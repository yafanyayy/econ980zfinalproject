Earlier today, we announced our results for the fiscal 2016 third quarter, which ended January 31. As a reminder, due to the highly seasonal nature of our business, a majority of our revenues and all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during the fiscal fourth quarter, and the fiscal first quarter financial results are not indicative of expected performance for the full year.
We are just halfway through the tax season with millions of tax returns yet to prepare. And so far, we have seen broad sweeping changes affecting the tax industry in what is really a transitional year for both the industry and H&R Block. Some of the changes we've seen include aggressive and numerous fraud prevention measures implemented above the federal and state levels; a decline in early-season tax filings indicating a real delay to the season, possibly due to the overall impact of fraud, the Affordable Care Act and other industry factors; the continued evolution of the DIY category as a result of significant changes in pricing and client acquisition strategies and the reintroduction of the Refund Anticipation Loan into the assisted category.
Although it will take the availability of complete season results to fully understand the effect of these changes, I'd like to spend some time today talking about that we believe each of these could mean at the industry level and how they are impacting H&R Block. Then I'll address the current season results to date. Finally, Greg Macfarlane, our CFO, will walk you through the quarter's financial results.
Let's start detailed look at the industry by first talking about the progress made this season at the federal and state levels and the battle against tax fraud. As we have discussed for several years, fraud continues to heavily impact the tax preparation industry. This season, however, is not merely a continuation of the same story that we've seen in the past few years. We are now seeing significant changes implemented at both the federal and state levels to combat fraud, and we are very pleased with the progress being made. Although there is still much to be done, positive momentum is building. At the federal level, we have seen refund processing slow noticeably from prior years, which we believe this an indication of the implementation of additional fraud filters. For example, in 2015 the IRS have processed and refunded $66 billion in tax refunds by February 6. This year, that number had dropped 11% to $59 million. And the average time for taxpayers to receive their refund has increased from 10 days last year to 13 days this year. 
Finally, our data shows that larger federal refunds are taking longer to process than smaller refunds, which may be another indication of stronger fraud prevention measures. Additionally, state governments and not waiting for the federal government to fix this problem. This season, we have seen initiatives in dozens of states designed to reduce fraud. For example, 14 states implemented W-2 matching to ensure taxpayers' reported earnings under their tax returns equal that reported by their employer on W-2s. 18 states now require some type of identification quiz to validate and receive a refund. 17 states are using an identity theft indicator on state returns, and we even saw Maryland shut down 1 competitor's ability to e-file state returns from several of its franchisee locations due to suspicious returns.
This is also the first year that increased security measures are required from tax software providers as a result of the Security Summit, a public-private partnership between the IRS, state departments of revenue and the industry leaders. Providers have implemented stronger security protocols and now require additional online filer authentication methods. Additionally, tax-preparation companies implemented better fraud monitoring processes, are required to report suspicious activity leads to the IRS in a timely manner, and some have increased their security infrastructure to better protect taxpayers' personal information. H&R Block has been doing most of this for years, but it is good for the industry that other tax providers are now required to follow the same processes. We applaud all of these new efforts and know that more changes are on the horizon. Federal W-2 matching and further enhancement of information technology security protocols at both the federal and state levels are forthcoming. 
Despite all these efforts, however, fraud remains a huge issue for this industry and our country, and there is still much more work to be done. This is evidenced by the magnitude of fraud being perpetrated year after year. We've discussed these numbers before, but they are still staggering they are worth repeating. The Treasury Department estimates that there are $14 billion to $17 billion in improper and income tax credit payments and at least $5 billion in tax identity theft losses annually. We continue to advocate for EITC Form parity, stronger DIY measures and minimum standards for tax return preparers. Such measures combined with the steps already taken and those planned for next year are needed to ensure that tax refunds are delivered to those that deserve them. And while it's widely accepted that the level of fraud in the industry is significant, we don't have clarity on how fraudulent returns impact return counts as reported by the IRS. Additionally, it's not clear what our competitors are including in their return counts, which makes it difficult to understand changes in filings year-over-year. We hope to have more clarity on fraud and its effect on the industry, but it's likely that such information will become available more slowly than we would all like.
Despite the uncertainty related to fraud, there has been a decline in the number of tax returns filed in the early season, indicating a shift in the first half of the season to the second half. The latest numbers from the IRS show that tax returns received as of February 26 continues to be down 0.4%. There are several possible reasons for this delay including fraudulent activity and related efforts to reduce fraud, refunds taking longer to process and increase in the number of balance the returns and the Affordable Care Act. What is not clear, however, is how much of the reduction in tax returns is due to taxpayers taking longer to file their taxes as opposed to a true reduction in returns being filed this year due to effective fraud filters at the IRS. It's worth spending some additional time on one of the possible causes for this delay that I just mentioned, the Affordable Care Act. The ACA continues to influence consumer tax filing behaviors. Last year was the first time many taxpayers truly felt the impact of the ACA in their tax returns. This year, the ACA should affect even more taxpayers for a number of reasons. First, increased marketplace enrollment means that more people would have to reconcile their insurance subsidies with their tax returns. Next, this is the first year that the IRS will be able to confirm if the taxpayers have private insurance to the issuance of forms to 95B and C. This may make taxpayers reluctant to just check the box on their tax returns, given that the IRS will eventually be validating their claims. That said, the deadline of these forms has been delayed until March 31, which may cause confusion for some. 
Finally, the penalty for noncompliance have more than doubled, potentially causing taxpayers an estimated $500 per return versus approximately $200 last year. It's clear that there are a lot of moving pieces around the ACA, which may be contributing to the delay this season.  Of course, we won't have a full understanding of that impact until seasons end. 
Let me shift gears now and talk about the DIY category. This category is also undergoing change, primarily due to the category leaders decision to focus on driving volume and low-lifetime value price-sensitive filers. This tax centers around offering products for free and creating movement in the DIY category, placing pressure on other competitors in this space. 
From an overall industry perspective, the early-season results reported by the IRS indicate a share shift to DIY. This shift is consistent with early-season results in prior years and will likely moderate as the season continues.
Finally, this year has marked the introduction of refund anticipation loans in the industry. These loans are being offered by our branded assisted competitors as well as independent tax preparers in varying forms. These low-dollar loans are not widely promoted and generally offer interest-free rates. It's hard to quantify the impact of these products on the industry or our business, but we are watching this development closely. 
With that overview of the industry, let's now shift our focus to H&R Block and why this is a year of transition for our company. First, as many of you recall, in August, we were able to successfully divest H&R Block Bank and transition 3 of our core financial products to our bank partner. We are pleased to say that the transition has gone well and has been seamless from a client-service perspective. In addition to the operational changes, there were also changes to our financials as a result of the bank divestiture, which we discussed at the investor conference in December. Greg will review these changes again later, but I wanted to provide a quick reminder that the divestiture impacted both the economics of the business as well as the presentation of certain items on the income statement, diluting earnings and giving our financials a different look from previous years. We are also moving forward with our new capital structure. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 12 million shares. This brings total repurchases for the fiscal year to 19% of outstanding shares. In fact, considering both share repurchases and dividends, we have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2016 alone. Finally, we continue to innovate to ensure we are delivering exceptional value to our clients. We are in the second year of our newest product, Tax Identity Shield, which provides real help to taxpayers facing the unwelcome threat of tax identity theft. And we launched a new brand, Block Advisers, focused on delivering tax planning and small business services to those clients that have year-round tax and business needs. Our new brand is up and running with over 280 offices throughout the company staffed with expert tax advisers ready to assist clients with complex tax situations. As we said at our investor conference, this is a long-term play for us, but we're pleased with the progress made this year.
With this overview on the season of our business, let's now talk about our third quarter results. As I mentioned earlier, it has been a slow start to the tax season. We are seeing the impact of delayed filings on our volumes and our revenues. Although assisted volume has declined compared to last year, the results are more positive from a share perspective. And as we said in December, it will take time to turn the early-season client loss around, but we are taking steps in the right direction. For the clients that we observed this season, we have seen positive increases in both price and form mix. Clients with more complex tax preparation needs continue to see H&R Block as a trusted expert to help them navigate through their complex tax situations. And our products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. Despite the early-season decline in volume, we are pleased with the overall product rates, which Greg will cover later. 
In conclusion, this is the year of change for both the tax preparation industry and H&R Block. Macro factors such as fraud and the ACA continue to impact the industry causing filing and refund delays. Although the first half of the tax season has been slower than expected, we are anticipating a stronger second half. As is often the case, this will again be a tax season where results can't be measured until the tax return filing deadline has passed. We look forward to sharing those results at the conclusion of the season.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to review the financial results."
276601,325922048,947155,"H&R Block, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2016",2016-03-03,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill and good afternoon, everybody. First, it's important that I reiterate what Bill mentioned earlier. Because of the seasonality of our business, a majority of our revenues and all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during our fiscal fourth",1334,"Thanks, Bill and good afternoon, everybody. First, it's important that I reiterate what Bill mentioned earlier. Because of the seasonality of our business, a majority of our revenues and all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during our fiscal fourth quarter. And as such, fiscal third quarter financial results are not necessarily indicative of expected performance for the full year. Third quarter revenues were $475 million, down 6.8% from the prior year. As we discussed at the investor conference, we consider 4 components when evaluating revenue: volume, price, mix and attach rate. I'd like to make a moment to discuss a little bit further. From a volume perspective, we came into the season expecting industry-wide returns to increase 1% to 2%. As of February 26, total industry returns actually decreased 0.4% compared to last year. As Bill discussed, this represents a possible industry-wide shift of approximately 2 million clients out of the first week of the season and into the second half. Similar to industry statistics, H&R Block has also experienced lower volume in the first half of the season. As of February 28 we were down 6% in total returns. The decline in early-season returns doesn't come as a complete surprise as we have communicated that this is a significant challenge, and solutions will take time to yield results. And although we are disappointed with this decline, we have seen an improvement from a share loss in our assisted business when comparing mid-season results from this year to last year. 
With that perspective in volume, let's talk about the progress we're seeing on the other 3 components of revenue: price, mix and cash. In terms of price and mix, both continue to be a positive story for us. We have once again been able to achieve price increases this year and are also pleased with our form mix as volume decline continue to be concentrated in lower-value forms. We are again running our half-half promotion for new clients through March 31, which was very successful last year. This promotion is designed to check more complex higher-value returns at a time when our offices historically have had available capacity, and we anticipated further improving the overall mix for the season.
Finally, our Tax Plus products continue to positively contribute to overall results. Although sales are related to volumes, we are pleased with our overall product attach rate. Specifically, our refund transfer attach in DIY has grown following enhancements at the interview flow within our software product. Additionally, Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield attach rate continue to increase. Peace of Mind provides a tremendous side to our clients considering flow cost, and Tax Identity Shield is an example of smart innovation the right product at the right time. As a reminder, revenue from each new products is deferred. And as such, only a small portion of is recognized in the year of sale. In addition to the factors just discussed, revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which we expect to result in a 1% reduction in overall revenue for the full year.
The revenue decline is also part due to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. As a reminder, the bank divestiture impacts our financial results in a couple of different ways. First, the economics paid to our bank partner results in lower revenues and increased expenses and as such, is dilutive to earnings. Second because we are no longer a bank holding company, there are certain accounting classification changes that negatively impact revenues. On a full year basis, these changes are expected to result in a 1% decline in revenue and a 1-point drop in EBITDA margin, consistent with the guidance provided at our investor conference in December. Operating expenses increased $10 million or 1.7% from the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to acquired businesses as well as increase in marketing expense. Although the acquisitions of independents and franchisees had expense to income statement, it's important to remember these transactions are accretive from an earnings perspective. Interest expense increased to $24 million, primarily as a result of the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt in 2 September of 2015. Given all these factors, net loss from continuing operations was $79 million or $0.34 per share compared to a net loss of $35 million or $0.13 per share in fiscal 2015. As Bill mentioned earlier, this is a transition year for us. So heading into the year, we anticipate a drop of EBITDA margin percentage due to the impacts of the bank divestiture and the acquisitions of our franchisees. For the full fiscal year, we are now targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin slightly below the 29% to 30% we shared at the investor conference but still within our overall guidance of 28% to 32%. This is primarily due to the current year decline in returns in our system business. Our long-term EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged at 28% to 32%. Turning to discontinued operations, there were positive developments during fiscal third quarter as Sand Canyon was able to enter into settlement agreements with certain counterparties related to representation and warranty obligations. The settlement of these claims is an ongoing process that began 8 years ago. During this time, the Sand Canyon management team has been diligently focused on bringing their representation and warranty contingency to its conclusion. Although the wind-down of Sand Canyon is expected to take time, this quarter's activity represents strong movement toward the resolution of its obligation. This quarter settlement amounts were fully covered by prior accruals. Sand Canyon's accrual for losses are open warranty claims decreased $89 million to $65 million as of January 31. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong and any potential veil-piercing arguments. Turning to our balance sheet, certain balances are substantially different compared to the prior year due to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. During the second quarter, cash balances and certain liabilities included all the banks deposit liabilities were transferred to our bank partner. Additionally, the available-for-sale securities held to meet regulatory requirements were liquidated. We did retain our mortgage loans held for investment and will continue to evaluate options for this portfolio. For additional information regarding these transactions, refer to previous 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC during the last calendar year. The increase in long-term debt is due to the issuance of $1 billion of senior notes in September 2015. Additionally, due to GAAP requirements, borrowing under the commented line of credit, which totaled $1.1 billion in January 31 are also required as long-term debt.
This does not reflect our intent regarding repayment of such outstanding amounts as the current balance on the line of credit is anticipated to be paid off by the end of the fiscal year. It is merely a reflection of the fact that the line of credit agreement runs longer than 1 year. As a reminder, we did not utilize any commercial paper borrowings this tax season, instead relying on the line of credit for our funding needs.
Finally, as mentioned by Bill, during the quarter, we continued our practice of returning capital to you, our shareholders. We repurchased and retired approximately 12 million shares of common stock, an aggregate price of $392 million at an average price of $32.72. A quick side note because I know a lot of you ask about this. Some of the share repurchases were executed during the tax season. As of January 31, approximately 224 million shares are outstanding. These repurchases are an affirmation of our confidence in the future of H&R Block and our desire to create value for our shareholders. All together, we have bought back 19% of outstanding shares for a total of $1.9 billion at the beginning of this fiscal year.
I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill for closing comments."

It's 74,000 pages long. So I do think that there are ways that we can aid in any effort to simplify, but the fundamental issue is the tax return is the fundamental way that the federal government runs its social programs. And so one of that is the Affordable Care Act in the current income tax credit or childcare, dependent care. All of these various refundable credits are run through the tax return, and those take a while to figure out how you would administer them and whether they were even -- there's been talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act and then there's also been talk about deducting premiums for health care, which is not was saw there now.

We have worked very hard the last several years to really use pricing strategically, not opportunistically, not tactically. So we went to this tax season with a specific plan, a lot of nuances to it, but it's a way to really make sure that we hone our price-value messaging to recognize the fact that we have this opportunity. So we've executed that quite smoothly and generated some real value. Historically, as you know, we've basically been raising price double the rate inflation, given more guidance elevated in this you at the end of the season. And then in terms of the mix, this is a very big issue for us and we talked about units, units units. And at this time of the year, that's the one thing we talk about. I always believe it's very misleading because the units themselves there's back differences in the value of those, and so we recognize that in Block the things do to help people and we had a really good story of what we continue to focus in the early client these are people who speak of refund matters and you get to types of people typically in the EZ and the most basic filer and then secondarily credit filer and were more particularly focused on credit will be able to better digest and results at the end of the season where that stands.

Some of the changes we've seen include: aggressive and numerous fraud prevention measures implemented above the federal and state levels; a decline in early-season tax filings indicating a real delay to the season, possibly due to the overall impact of fraud, the Affordable Care Act and other industry factors; the continued evolution of the DIY category as a result of significant changes in pricing and client acquisition strategies and the reintroduction of the Refund Anticipation Loan into the assisted category.
Although it will take the availability of complete season results to fully understand the effect of these changes, I'd like to spend some time today talking about what we believe each of these could mean at the industry level and how they are impacting H&R Block, then I'll address the current season results to-date. Finally, Greg Macfarlane, our CFO, will walk you through the quarter's financial results.
Let's start our detailed look at the industry by first talking about the progress made this season at the federal and state levels and the battle against tax fraud. As we have discussed for several years, fraud continues to heavily impact the tax preparation industry. This season, however, is not merely a continuation of the same story that we've seen in the past few years. We are now seeing significant changes implemented at both the federal and state levels to combat fraud, and we are very pleased with the progress being made. 
Although there is still much to be done, positive momentum is building. At the federal level, we have seen refund processing slow noticeably from prior years, which we believe is an indication of the implementation of additional fraud filters. For example, in 2015, the IRS had processed and refunded $66 billion in tax refunds by February 6. This year, that number had dropped 11% to $59 billion, and the average time for taxpayers to receive their refund has increased from 10 days last year to 13 days this year. 
Finally, our data shows that larger federal refunds are taking longer to process than smaller refunds, which may be another indication of stronger fraud prevention measures. Additionally, state governments and not waiting for the federal government to fix this problem. This season, we have seen initiatives in dozens of states designed to reduce fraud. For example, 14 states implemented W-2 matching to ensure taxpayers' reported earnings on their tax returns equal to that reported by their employer on W-2s. 
18 states now require some type of identification quiz to validate and receive a refund. 17 states are using an identity theft indicator on state returns, and we even saw Maryland shut down one competitor's ability to e-file state returns from several of its franchisee locations due to suspicious returns.
This is also the first year that increased security measures are  required from tax software providers as a result of the Security Summit, a public-private partnership between the IRS, state departments of revenue and industry leaders. Providers have implemented stronger security protocols and now require additional online filer authentication methods. 
Additionally, tax preparation companies implemented better fraud monitoring processes, are required to report suspicious activity leads to the IRS in a timely manner and some have increased their security infrastructure to better protect taxpayers' personal information. H&R Block has been doing most of this for years, but it is good for the industry that other tax providers are now required to follow the same processes. 
We applaud all of these new efforts and know that more change is on the horizon. Federal W-2 matching and further enhancement of information technology security protocols at both the federal and state levels are forthcoming. 
Despite all these efforts, however, fraud remains a huge issue for this industry and our country, and there is still much more work to be done. This is evidenced by the magnitude of fraud being perpetrated year after year. We've discussed these numbers before, but they are so staggering they are worth repeating. 
The Treasury Department estimates that there are $14 billion to $17 billion in improper earned income tax credit payments and at least $5 billion in tax identity theft losses annually. We continue to advocate for EITC Form parity, stronger DIY measures and minimum standards for tax return preparers. 
Such measures combined with the steps already taken and those planned for next year are needed to ensure that tax refunds are delivered to those that deserve them. And while it's widely accepted that the level of fraud in the industry is significant, we don't have clarity in how fraudulent returns impact return counts as reported by the IRS. 
Additionally, it's not clear what our competitors are including in their return counts, which makes it difficult to understand changes in filings year-over-year. We hope to have more clarity on fraud and its effect on the industry, but it's likely that such information will become available more slowly than we would all like it.
Despite the uncertainty related to fraud, there has been a decline in the number of tax returns filed in the early season indicating a shift in the first half of the season to the second half. The latest numbers from the IRS show that tax returns received as of February 26 continues to be down 0.4%. 
There are several possible reasons for this delay, including fraudulent activity and related efforts to reduce fraud, refunds taking longer to process and the increase in the number of balance due returns and the Affordable Care Act. What is not clear, however, is how much of the reduction in tax returns is due to taxpayers taking longer to file their taxes as opposed to a true reduction in returns being filed this year due to effective fraud filters at the IRS. 
It's worth spending some additional time on one of the possible causes for this delay that I just mentioned, the Affordable Care Act. The ACA continues to influence consumer tax filing behaviors. Last year was the first time many taxpayers truly felt the impact of the ACA in their tax returns. This year, the ACA should affect even more taxpayers for a number of reasons. 
First, increased marketplace enrollment means that more people will have to reconcile their insurance subsidies through their tax returns. Next, this is the first year that the IRS will be able to confirm if taxpayers have private insurance to the issuance of Forms 1095-B and C. 
This may make taxpayers reluctant to just check the box in their tax returns, given that the IRS will eventually be validating their claims. That said, the deadline for issuance of these forms has been delayed until March 31, which may cause confusion for some. 
Finally, the penalty for noncompliance have more than doubled, potentially causing taxpayers an estimated $500 per return versus approximately $200 last year. It's clear that there are a lot of moving pieces around the ACA, which may be contributing to the delay of this season.  Of course, we won't have a full understanding of its impact until season's end. 
Let me shift gears now and talk about the DIY category. This category is also undergoing change, primarily due to the category leader's decision to focus on driving volume and low-lifetime value price-sensitive filers. This tactic centers around offering products for free and creating movement in the DIY category, placing pressure on other competitors in this space. 
From an overall industry perspective, the early-season results reported by the IRS indicate a share shift to DIY. This shift is consistent with early-season results in prior years and will likely moderate as the season continues.
Finally, this year has marked the re-introduction of Refund Anticipation Loans in the industry. These loans are being offered by our branded assisted competitors as well as independent tax preparers in varying forms. These low-dollar loans are not widely promoted and generally offer interest-free rates. It's hard to quantify the impact of these products on the industry or our business, but we are watching this development closely. 
With that overview of the industry, let's now shift our focus to H&R Block and why this is a year of transition for our company. First, as many of you recall, in August, we were able to successfully divest H&R Block Bank and transitioned 3 of our core financial products to our bank partner.
We are pleased to say that the transition has gone well and has been seamless from a client-service perspective. In addition to the operational changes, there were also changes to our financials as a result of the bank divestiture, which we discussed at the investor conference in December. Greg will review these changes again later, but I wanted to provide a quick reminder that the divestiture impacted both the economics of the business as well as the presentation of certain items on the income statement, diluting earnings and giving our financials a different look from previous years. 
We are also moving forward with our new capital structure. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 12 million shares. This brings total repurchases for the fiscal year to 19% of outstanding shares. In fact, considering both share repurchases and dividends, we have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2016 alone. 
Finally, we continue to innovate to ensure we are delivering exceptional value to our clients. We are in the second year of our newest product, Tax Identity Shield, which provides real help to taxpayers facing the unwelcome threat of tax identity theft. And we launched a new brand, Block Advisors, focused on delivering tax planning and small business services to those clients that have year-round tax and business needs. 
Our new brand is up and running with over 280 offices throughout the country, staffed with expert tax advisers ready to assist clients with complex tax situations. As we said at our investor conference, this is a long-term play for us, but we're pleased with the progress we made this year.
With this overview on the season of our business, let's now talk about our third quarter results. As I mentioned earlier, it has been a slow start to the tax season. We are seeing the impact of delayed filings on our volumes and our revenues. Although assisted volume has declined compared to last year, the results are more positive from a share perspective. 
And as we said in December, it will take time to turn the early-season client loss around, but we are taking steps in the right direction. For the clients that we observed this season, we have seen positive increases in both price and form mix. Clients with more complex tax preparation needs continue to see H&R Block as a trusted expert to help them navigate through their complex tax situations. And our products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. Despite the early-season decline in volume, we are pleased with overall product attach rates, which Greg will cover later. 
In conclusion, this is the year of change for both the tax preparation industry and H&R Block. Macro factors such as fraud and the ACA continue to impact the industry causing filing and refund delays. Although the first half of the tax season has been slower than expected, we are anticipating a stronger second half. As is often the case, this will again be a tax season where results can't be measured until the tax return filing deadline has passed. We look forward to sharing those results at the conclusion of the season.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to review the financial results."
276601,325922048,947355,"H&R Block, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2016",2016-03-03,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. First, it's important that I reiterate what Bill mentioned earlier. Because of the seasonality of our business, a majority of our revenues and all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during our fiscal fourth",1351,"Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. First, it's important that I reiterate what Bill mentioned earlier. Because of the seasonality of our business, a majority of our revenues and all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during our fiscal fourth quarter. And as such, fiscal third quarter financial results are not necessarily indicative of expected performance for the full year. 
Third quarter revenues were $475 million, down 6.8% from the prior year. As we discussed at the investor conference, we consider 4 components when evaluating revenue: volume, price, mix and attach rate. I'd like to take a moment to discuss each of these a little bit further. 
From  a volume perspective, we came into the season expecting industry-wide returns to increase 1% to 2%. As of February 26, total industry returns actually decreased 0.4% compared to last year. As Bill discussed, this represents a possible industry-wide shift of approximately 2 million clients out of the first peak of the season and into the second half. 
Similar to industry statistics, H&R Block has also experienced lower volume in the first half of the season. As of February 28, we were down 6% in total returns. The decline in early-season returns doesn't come as a complete surprise as we have communicated that this is a significant challenge and solutions will take time to yield results. And although we are disappointed with this decline, we have seen an improvement from a share loss in our assisted business when comparing mid-season results from this year to last year. 
With that perspective in volume, let's talk about the progress we're seeing on the other 3 components of revenue: price, mix and product attach. In terms of price and mix, both continue to be a positive story for us. We have once again been able to achieve reasonable price increases this year and are also pleased with our form mix as volume decline continue to be concentrated in lower-value forms. 
We are again running our half- off promotion for new clients through March 31, which was very successful last year. This promotion is designed to attract more complex, higher-value returns at a time when our offices historically have had available capacity, and we anticipated further improving the overall mix for this season.
Finally, our Tax Plus products continue to positively contribute to overall results. Although sales are closely related to volumes, we are pleased with our overall product attach rate. Specifically, our refund transfer attach in DIY has grown following enhancements to the interview flow within our software product. 
Additionally, Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield attach rates continue to increase. Peace of Mind provides a tremendous value to our clients considering its low cost. And Tax Identity Shield is an example of smart innovation, the right product at the right time. As a reminder, revenue from these 2 products is deferred. And as such, only a small portion is recognized in the year of sale. 
In addition to the factors just discussed, revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which we expect to result in a 1% reduction in overall revenue for the full year.
The revenue decline is also part due to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. As a reminder, the bank divestiture impacts our financial results in a couple of different ways. First, the economics paid to our bank partner results in lower revenues and increased expenses and as such, is dilutive to earnings. 
Second because we are no longer a bank holding company, there are certain accounting classification changes that negatively impact revenues. On a full year basis, these changes are expected to result in a 1% decline in revenue and a 1-point drop in EBITDA margin, consistent with the guidance provided at our investor conference in December. 
Operating expenses increased $10 million or 1.7% from the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to acquired businesses as well as an increase in marketing expense. Although the acquisitions of independents and franchisees add expense to our income statement, it's important to remember that these transactions are accretive from an earnings perspective. 
Interest expense increased to $24 million, primarily as a result of the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt in 2 September of 2015. Given all these factors, net loss from continuing operations was $79 million or $0.34 per share compared to a net loss of $35 million or $0.13 per share in fiscal 2015. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, this is a transition year for us. So heading into the year, we anticipated a drop of EBITDA margin percentage due to the impacts of the bank divestiture and the acquisitions of our franchisees. 
For the full fiscal year, we are now targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin slightly below the 29% to 30% we shared at the investor conference, but still within our overall guidance of 28% to 32%. This is primarily due to the current year decline in returns in our assisted business. Our long-term EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged at 28% to 32%. 
Turning to discontinued operations. There were positive developments during the fiscal third quarter as Sand Canyon was able to enter into settlement agreements with certain counterparties related to representation and warranty obligations. 
The settlement of these claims is an ongoing process that began 8 years ago. During this time, the Sand Canyon management team has been diligently focused on bringing the representation and warranty contingency to its conclusion. Although the wind-down of Sand Canyon is expected to take time, this quarter's activity represents strong movement toward the resolution of its obligation. 
This quarter's settlement amounts were fully covered by prior accruals. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation of warranty claims decreased $89 million to $65 million as of January 31. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong in any potential veil-piercing arguments. 
Turning to our balance sheet, certain balances are substantially different compared to the prior year due to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. During the second quarter, cash balances and certain liabilities, including all the bank's deposit liabilities were transferred to our bank partner. 
Additionally, the available-for-sale securities held to meet regulatory requirements were liquidated. We did retain our mortgage loans held for investment and we'll continue to evaluate options for this portfolio. For additional information regarding these transactions, refer to previous 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC during the last calendar year. 
The increase in long-term debt is due to the issuance of $1 billion of senior notes in September of 2015. Additionally, due to GAAP requirements, borrowings under the committed line of credit, which totaled $1.1 billion in January 31 are also recorded as long-term debt.
This does not reflect our intent regarding repayment of such outstanding amounts as the current balance in the line of credit is anticipated to be paid off by the end of the fiscal year. It is merely a reflection of the fact that the line of credit agreement runs longer than 1 year. As a reminder, we did not utilize any commercial paper borrowings this tax season, instead we're relying in the line of credit for our funding needs.
Finally, as mentioned by Bill, during the quarter, we continued our practice of returning capital to you, our shareholders. We repurchased and retired approximately 12 million shares of common stock, an aggregate price of $392 million and at an average price of $32.72. A quick side note because I know a lot of you ask about this. Some of these share repurchases were executed during the tax season. 
As of January 31, approximately 224 million shares were outstanding. These repurchases are an affirmation of our confidence in the future of H&R Block and our desire to create value for our shareholders. All together, we have bought back 19% of outstanding shares for a total of $1.9 billion since the beginning of this fiscal year.
I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill for closing comments."

Generally speaking, when you sort of annualize it, that's kind of where we are still at this point in time. We did raise $1 billion back in the fall. That was included in those numbers which obviously would imply there's additional capacity there. But as a prospect of statement, and I think you have the answer here, we are going to create shareholder value opportunistically. And so at the point at which the board decides in which the right way to forward, then we would be able to execute that plan. And then, after the fact, typically, we then share it.

I've been quoted as saying, which is true there are 5 different definitions of a child in the tax code. It's 74,000 pages long. So I do think that there are ways that we can aid in any effort to simplify. But the fundamental issue is the tax return is the fundamental way that the federal government runs its social programs. So whether that's the Affordable Care Act or the Earning Income Tax Credit or childcare, dependent care. All of these various refundable credits are run through the tax return, and those take a while to figure out how you would administer them and whether they were even -- there's been talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act and then -- but there's also been talk about deducting premiums for health care, which would -- which is not what is on there now. So we have to wait until we see, obviously, who's elected, what the Congress -- makeup of the Congress is. Right now, believe me, I'm all in on this tax season.

In fact, somewhat disproportionally into the top line, and that's kind of what we've been doing. The slight revision to our margin is more just to kind of tighten it up in my viewpoint and the main driver there for us is just the volume pressure that we're seeing because most of the other factors that we look at are actually pretty good.

But last year, we bundled that product with the Peace of Mind product this year. They're sold separately as well as in a bundle. But you'll be able to see the Tax Identity Shield product is $30 for the year for the individual. The Peace of Mind is 35-ish. And we collect the cash from the client upfront, but the way it gets accounted is the Tax Identity Shield pretty much is 0 in the year it's sold. It's all recognized in the following year for the most part. And then Peace of Mind is spread over really a 3-year period with very little in the first year. So as those attach rates have been going up and as the units we've been selling had been going up, there's sort of an embedded accounting gain that will be realized in the next few years after that.

I think you're all intimately familiar with that, but we measure elasticity in the assisted side, the point 1. We have worked very hard the last several years to really -- to use pricing strategically, not opportunistically, not tactically. So we went to this tax season with a specific plan, a lot of nuances to it, but it's a way to really make sure that we hone our price value messaging to recognize the fact that we have this opportunity. And so we've executed that quite smoothly and generated some real value. Historically, as you know, we've basically been raising price.  we've doubled the rate inflation. We'll give you more guidance in what we did this year at the end of the season. And then in terms of the mix, this is a very big issue for us and we talked about units, units, units. This time of the year, that's the one thing we talk about. I always believe it's very misleading because the units themselves, there's vast differences in the value of those, and so we recognize that in Block. We know the things that we do to help people and we've had a really, I think, good story where we continue to focus, of course, at the early-season client. These are people where of refund matters and you get sort of 2 types of people typically in the early season, the EZ, the most basic filer, and then secondarily, is the earned income credit filer. And we're more particularly focused on earning credit. We'll be able to better digest and share kind of results at the end of the season where that stands.

Earlier today, we announced our results for the fiscal 2016 third quarter, which ended January 31. As a reminder, due to the highly seasonal nature of our business, a majority of our revenues and all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during the fiscal fourth quarter, and thus, fiscal third quarter financial results are not indicative of expected performance for the full year.
We are just halfway through the tax season, with millions of tax returns yet to prepare. And so far, we have seen broad sweeping changes affecting the tax industry in what is really a transitional year for both the industry and H&R Block. Some of the changes we've seen include: aggressive and numerous fraud prevention measures implemented at both the federal and state levels; a decline in early-season tax filings indicating a real delay to the season, possibly due to the overall impact of fraud, the Affordable Care Act and other industry factors; the continued evolution of the DIY category as a result of significant changes in pricing and client acquisition strategies; and the reintroduction of the Refund Anticipation Loan into the assisted category.
Although it will take the availability of complete season results to fully understand the effects of these changes, I'd like to spend some time today talking about what we believe each of these could mean at the industry level and how they are impacting H&R Block. Then, I'll address the current season results to-date. Finally, Greg Macfarlane, our CFO, will walk you through the quarter's financial results.
Let's start our detailed look at the industry by first talking about the progress made this season at the federal and state levels in the battle against tax fraud. As we have discussed for several years, fraud continues to heavily impact the tax preparation industry. This season, however, is not merely a continuation of the same story that we've seen in the past few years. We are now seeing significant changes implemented at both the federal and state levels to combat fraud, and we are very pleased with the progress being made. 
Although there is still much to be done, positive momentum is building. At the federal level, we have seen refund processing slow noticeably from prior years, which we believe is an indication of the implementation of additional fraud filters. For example, in 2015, the IRS had processed and refunded $66 billion in tax refunds by February 6. This year, that number had dropped 11% to $59 billion, and the average time for taxpayers to receive their refund has increased from 10 days last year to 13 days this year. 
Finally, our data shows that larger federal refunds are taking longer to process than smaller refunds, which may be another indication of stronger fraud prevention measures. Additionally, state governments are not waiting for the federal government to fix this problem. This season, we have seen initiatives in dozens of states designed to reduce fraud. For example, 14 states implemented W-2 matching to ensure taxpayers' reported earnings on their tax returns equals that reported by their employer on W-2s. 
18 states now require some type of identification quiz to validate and receive a refund. 17 states are using an identity theft indicator on state returns, and we even saw Maryland shut down one competitor's ability to e-file state returns from several of its franchisee locations due to suspicious returns.
This is also the first year that increased security measures are required from tax software providers as a result of the Security Summit, a public-private partnership between the IRS, state departments of revenue and industry leaders. Providers have implemented stronger security protocols and now require additional online filer authentication methods. 
Additionally, tax preparation companies implemented better fraud monitoring processes, are required to report suspicious activity leads to the IRS in a timely manner and some have increased their security infrastructure to better protect taxpayers' personal information. H&R Block has been doing most of this for years, but it is good for the industry that other tax providers are now required to follow the same processes. 
We applaud all of these new efforts and know that more change is on the horizon. Federal W-2 matching and further enhancement of information technology security protocols at both the federal and state levels are forthcoming. 
Despite all these efforts, however, fraud remains a huge issue for this industry, and our country, and there is still much more work to be done. This is evidenced by the magnitude of fraud being perpetrated year after year. We've discussed these numbers before, but they are so staggering they are worth repeating. 
The Treasury Department estimates that there are $14 billion to $17 billion in improper earned income tax credit payments and at least $5 billion in tax identity theft losses annually. We continue to advocate for EITC form parity, stronger DIY measures and minimum standards for tax return preparers. 
Such measures, combined with the steps already taken and those planned for next year, are needed to ensure that tax refunds are delivered to those that deserve them. And while it's widely accepted that the level of fraud in the industry is significant, we don't have clarity in how fraudulent returns impact return counts as reported by the IRS. 
Additionally, it's not clear what our competitors are including in their return counts, which makes it difficult to understand changes in filings year-over-year. We hope to have more clarity on fraud and its effect on the industry, but it's likely that such information will become available more slowly than we would all like.
Despite the uncertainty related to fraud, there has been a decline in the number of tax returns filed in the early season, indicating a shift in the first half of the season to the second half. The latest numbers from the IRS show that tax returns received as of February 26 continues to be down 0.4%. 
There are several possible reasons for this delay, including fraudulent activity and related efforts to reduce fraud, refunds taking longer to process, an increase in the number of balance due returns and the Affordable Care Act. What is not clear, however, is how much of the reduction in tax returns is due to taxpayers taking longer to file their taxes as opposed to a true reduction in returns being filed this year due to effective fraud filters at the IRS. 
It's worth spending some additional time on one of the possible causes for this delay that I just mentioned, the Affordable Care Act. The ACA continues to influence consumer tax filing behaviors. Last year was the first time many taxpayers truly felt the impact of the ACA in their tax returns. This year, the ACA should affect even more taxpayers for a number of reasons. 
First, increased marketplace enrollment means that more people will have to reconcile their insurance subsidies through their tax returns. Next, this is the first year that the IRS will be able to confirm if taxpayers have private insurance through the issuance of Forms 1095-B and C. 
This may make taxpayers reluctant to just check the box in their tax returns, given that the IRS will eventually be validating their claims. That said, the deadline for issuance of these forms has been delayed until March 31, which may cause confusion for some. 
Finally, the penalties for noncompliance have more than doubled, potentially costing taxpayers an estimated $500 per return versus approximately $200 last year. It's clear that there are a lot of moving pieces around the ACA, which may be contributing to the delay this season. Of course, we won't have a full understanding of its impact until season's end.
Let me shift gears now and talk about the DIY category. This category is also undergoing change, primarily due to the category leader's decision to focus on driving volume in low lifetime value, price-sensitive filers. This tactic centers around offering products for free and creating movement in the DIY category, placing pressure on other competitors in this space. 
From an overall industry perspective, the early season results reported by the IRS indicate a share shift to DIY. This shift is consistent with early season results in prior years and will likely moderate as the season continues.
Finally, this year has marked the re-introduction of Refund Anticipation Loans in the industry. These loans are being offered by our branded assisted competitors as well as independent tax preparers in varying forms. These low-dollar loans are not widely promoted and generally offer interest-free rates. It's hard to quantify the impact of these products on the industry or our business, but we are watching this development closely. 
With that overview of the industry, let's now shift our focus to H&R Block and why this is a year of transition for our company. First, as many of you recall, in August, we were able to successfully divest H&R Block Bank and transition 3 of our core financial products to our bank partner.
We are pleased to say that the transition has gone well and has been seamless from a client service perspective. In addition to the operational changes, there were also changes to our financials as a result of the bank divestiture, which we discussed at the investor conference in December. Greg will review these changes again later, but I wanted to provide a quick reminder that the divestiture impacted both the economics of the business as well as the presentation of certain items on the income statement, diluting earnings and giving our financials a different look from previous years. 
We are also moving forward with our new capital structure. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 12 million shares. This brings total repurchases for the fiscal year to 19% of outstanding shares. In fact, considering both share repurchases and dividends, we have returned over $2 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2016 alone. 
Finally, we continue to innovate to ensure we are delivering exceptional value to our clients. We are in the second year of our newest product, Tax Identity Shield, which provides real help to taxpayers facing the unwelcome threat of tax identity theft. And we launched a new brand, Block Advisors, focused on delivering tax planning and small business services to those clients that have year-round tax and business needs. 
Our new brand is up and running, with over 280 offices throughout the country, staffed with expert tax advisers ready to assist clients with complex tax situations. As we said at our investor conference, this is a long-term play for us, but we're pleased with the progress we made this year.
With this overview on the season and our business, let's now talk about our third quarter results. As I mentioned earlier, it has been a slow start to the tax season. We are seeing the impact of delayed filings on our volumes and our revenues. Although assisted volume has declined compared to last year, the results are more positive from a share perspective. 
And as we said in December, it will take time to turn the early season client loss around, but we are taking steps in the right direction. For the clients that we have served this season, we have seen positive increases in both price and form mix. Clients with more complex tax preparation needs continue to see H&R Block as a trusted expert to help them navigate through their complex tax situations. And our products continue to provide tremendous value to our clients. Despite the early season decline in volume, we are pleased with overall product attach rates, which Greg will cover later. 
In conclusion, this is the year of change for both the tax preparation industry and H&R Block. Macro factors such as fraud and the ACA continue to impact the industry, causing filing and refund delays. Although the first half of the tax season has been slower than expected, we are anticipating a stronger second half. As is often the case, this will again be a tax season where results can't be measured until the tax return filing deadline has passed. We look forward to sharing those results at the conclusion of the season.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to review the financial results."
276601,325922048,947410,"H&R Block, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2016",2016-03-03,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. First, it's important that I reiterate what Bill mentioned earlier. Because of the seasonality of our business, a majority of our revenues and all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during our fiscal fourth",1351,"Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everybody. First, it's important that I reiterate what Bill mentioned earlier. Because of the seasonality of our business, a majority of our revenues and all of our fiscal 2016 earnings will occur during our fiscal fourth quarter. And as such, fiscal third quarter financial results are not necessarily indicative of expected performance for the full year. 
Third quarter revenues were $475 million, down 6.8% from the prior year. As we discussed at the investor conference, we consider 4 components when evaluating revenue: volume, price, mix and attach rate. I'd like to take a moment to discuss each of these a little bit further. 
From a volume perspective, we came into the season expecting industry-wide returns to increase 1% to 2%. As of February 26, total industry returns actually decreased 0.4% compared to last year. As Bill discussed, this represents a possible industry-wide shift of approximately 2 million clients out of the first peak of the season and into the second half. 
Similar to industry statistics, H&R Block has also experienced lower volume in the first half of the season. As of February 28, we were down 6% in total returns. The decline in early season returns doesn't come as a complete surprise, as we have communicated that this is a significant challenge and solutions will take time to yield results. And although we are disappointed with this decline, we have seen an improvement from a share loss in our assisted business when comparing mid-season results from this year to last year. 
With that perspective in volume, let's talk about the progress we're seeing on the other 3 components of revenue: price, mix and product attach. In terms of price and mix, both continue to be a positive story for us. We have once again been able to achieve reasonable price increases this year and are also pleased with our form mix, as volume declines continue to be concentrated in lower-value forms. 
We are again running our half-off promotion for new clients through March 31, which was very successful last year. This promotion is designed to attract more complex, higher-value returns at a time when our offices historically have had available capacity, and we anticipated further improving the overall mix for the season.
Finally, our Tax Plus products continue to positively contribute to overall results. Although sales are closely related to volumes, we are pleased with our overall product attach rate. Specifically, our Refund Transfer attach in DIY has grown following enhancements to the interview flow within our software product. 
Additionally, Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield attach rates continue to increase. Peace of Mind provides a tremendous value to our clients, considering its low cost, and Tax Identity Shield is an example of smart innovation, the right product at the right time. As a reminder, revenue from these 2 products is deferred. And as such, only a small portion is recognized in the year of sale. 
In addition to the factors just discussed, revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which we expect to result in a 1% reduction in overall revenue for the full year.
The revenue decline is also part due to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. As a reminder, the bank divestiture impacts our financial results in a couple of different ways. First, the economics paid to our bank partner results in lower revenues and increased expenses, and as such, is dilutive to earnings. 
Second, because we are no longer a bank holding company, there are certain accounting classification changes that negatively impact revenues. On a full year basis, these changes are expected to result in a 1% decline in revenue and a 1-point drop in EBITDA margin, consistent with the guidance provided at our investor conference in December. 
Operating expenses increased $10 million or 1.7% from the prior year, primarily due to expenses related to acquire businesses as well as an increase in marketing expense. Although the acquisitions of independents and franchisees add expense to our income statement, it's important to remember that these transactions are accretive from an earnings perspective. 
Interest expense increased to $24 million, primarily as a result of the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt in 2 September of 2015. Given all these factors, net loss from continuing operations was $79 million or $0.34 per share, compared to a net loss of $35 million or $0.13 per share in fiscal 2015. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, this is a transition year for us. So heading into the year, we anticipated a drop of EBITDA margin percentage due to the impacts of the bank divestiture and the acquisitions of our franchisees. 
For the full fiscal year, we are now targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin slightly below the 29% to 30% we shared at the investor conference, but still within our overall guidance of 28% to 32%. This is primarily due to the current year decline in returns in our assisted business. Our long-term EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged at 28% to 32%. 
Turning to discontinued operations. There were positive developments during the fiscal third quarter, as Sand Canyon was able to enter into settlement agreements with certain counter-parties related to representation and warranty obligations. 
The settlement of these claims is an ongoing process that began 8 years ago. During this time, the Sand Canyon management team has been diligently focused on bringing the representation and warranty contingency to its conclusion. Although the wind-down of Sand Canyon is expected to take time, this quarter's activity represents strong movement toward the resolution of its obligation. 
This quarter's settlement amounts were fully covered by prior accruals. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims decreased $89 million to $65 million as of January 31. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong in any potential veil-piercing arguments. 
Turning to our balance sheet, certain balances are substantially different compared to the prior year due to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. During the second quarter, cash balances and certain liabilities, including all the bank's deposit liabilities, were transferred to our bank partner. 
Additionally, the available-for-sale securities held to meet regulatory requirements were liquidated. We did retain our mortgage loans held for investment and we'll continue to evaluate options for this portfolio. For additional information regarding these transactions, refer to previous 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC during the last calendar year. 
The increase in long-term debt is due to the issuance of $1 billion of senior notes in September of 2015. Additionally, due to GAAP requirements, borrowings under the committed line of credit, which totaled $1.1 billion in January 31, are also recorded as long-term debt.
This does not reflect our intent regarding repayment of such outstanding amounts, as the current balance on the line of credit is anticipated to be paid off by the end of the fiscal year. It is merely a reflection of the fact that the line of credit agreement runs longer than 1 year. As a reminder, we did not utilize any commercial paper borrowings this tax season, instead relying on the line of credit for our funding needs.
Finally, as mentioned by Bill, during the quarter, we continued our practice of returning capital to you, our shareholders. We repurchased and retired approximately 12 million shares of common stock, at an aggregate price of $392 million and at an average price of $32.72. A quick side note, because I know a lot of you ask about this, some of these share repurchases were executed during the tax season. 
As of January 31, approximately 224 million shares were outstanding. These repurchases are an affirmation of our confidence in the future of H&R Block and our desire to create value for our shareholders. All together, we have bought back 19% of outstanding shares for a total of $1.9 billion since the beginning of this fiscal year.
I'd now like to turn the call back to Bill for closing comments."

I've been quoted as saying, which is true, there are 5 different definitions of a child in the tax code. It's 74,000 pages long. So I do think that there are ways that we can aid in any effort to simplify. But the fundamental issue is the tax return is the fundamental way that the federal government runs its social programs. So whether that's the Affordable Care Act or the Earned Income Tax Credit or childcare, dependent care, all of these various refundable credits are run through the tax return, and those take a while to figure out how you would administer them and whether they were even -- there's been talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act and then -- but there's also been talk about deducting premiums for health care, which would -- which is not what is on there now.

And Scott, I know you know this, but for everyone else's benefit, if you go into our stores, you buy our products, which you should all buy our products, the Tax Identity Shield is a great product, by the way. But last year, we bundled that product with the Peace of Mind product. This year, they're sold separately, as well as in a bundle. But you'll be able to see the Tax Identity Shield product is $30 for the year for the individual. The Peace of Mind is $35-ish. And we collect the cash from the client upfront, but the way it gets accounted is the Tax Identity Shield pretty much is 0 in the year it's sold. It's all recognized in the following year, for the most part. And then Peace of Mind is spread over really a 3-year period, with very little in the first year. So as those attach rates have been going up and as the units we've been selling had been going up, there's sort of an embedded accounting gain that will be realized in the next few years after that.

But the first one, I think just factually, I disagree with your statement on RALs. So there were RALs in the market last year. There were RALs the year before. These were sort of private, specific to state, quite small in nature. Last tax season, it was really only one provider that had RALs and they had an okay experience with that. We're very familiar with the details there. This season, you see both the other large branded competitors have them, as well as multiple providers that are also putting it through the independent channel, which is we all know is 40% of the revenue part of this market. So the number of distribution points for RALs this year is a lot larger than it was last year. And we're saying it's a factor. We're not saying it's a large factor. We're just saying it's a factor. So -- but just to make sure we get the facts straight on that one. And the next one I think was the $1,000, is that our response? Do you want on that one, Bill?"

I think you're all intimately familiar with that, but we measure elasticity in the assisted side, point 1. We have worked very hard the last several years to really -- to use pricing strategically, not opportunistically, not tactically. So we went to this tax season with a specific plan, a lot of nuance to it, but it's a way to really make sure that we hone our price value messaging to recognize the fact that we have this opportunity. And so we've executed that quite smoothly and generated some real value. Historically, as you know, we've basically been raising price at double the rate of inflation. We'll give you more guidance in what we did this year at the end of the season. And then in terms of the mix, this is a very big issue for us and we talk about units, units, units. This time of the year, that's the one thing we talk about. I always believe it's very misleading, because the units themselves, there's vast differences in the value of those, and so we recognize that in Block. We know the things that we do to help people and we've had a really, I think, good story where we continue to focus, of course, is the early season client. These are people where speed of refund matters and you get sort of 2 types of people typically in the early season, the EZ, the most basic filer, and then secondarily, is the Earned Income Credit filer. And we're more particularly focused on Earned Income Credit. We'll be able to better digest and share kind of results at the end of the season where that stands. But in total so far this year, we're pleased with mix. As we look to the second half, we continue to believe that's a good driver of value for us."

Earlier today, we announced our results for fiscal year 2016. Clearly, this was a disappointing season on many fronts.

Earlier today, we announced our results for fiscal year 2016. Clearly, this was a disappointing season on many fronts. Our assisted tax preparation business continues to lose returns, and for the first time in several years, our digital do-it-yourself business did as well. Let me be clear. We will change the current loss trajectory and are hard at work to make this happen. Next season will not feel the same.
So with that as a backdrop, here's what we'll cover today. First, I'll spend a few minutes looking back at tax season '16. We did not deliver the results we wanted and for that, I take full responsibility. We have learned some hard lessons, and we'll change how we do business going forward. Next, I'll share our expectations for tax season '17 and beyond. We are fully committed to doing what it takes to turn our results around. Arresting the client decline and ultimately growing clients is our #1 objective. We cannot continue the client trajectory we've seen. Finally, I'll review the steps we are taking to achieve these objectives. Some have already been completed, many are in process, and others are yet  to start. I'm excited about the plans for fiscal year 2017 and beyond, and I'm confident we will execute on those plans to deliver better results. 
Let me, however, set some expectations upfront. I will not be able to provide full details regarding these plans, given how far out from the tax season we are and the competitive environment. But I can tell you that we are taking a broad look at our options and will be making meaningful changes in both the short and long term.
First, let's start by looking back at tax season 2016. From an industry perspective, the season started very slowly, and consistent with the past  few [ph] years, did not reach its expected growth level until the last week of the season. And the results seen this season were disappointing for most of the branded players, including H&R Block. One branded competitor, however, had an exceptional season. TurboTax absolute 0 promotion won the tax season and likely took share from all major branded competitors. Despite their success, however, the industry shift from assisted to DIY was relatively consistent with the last few years at approximately 90 basis points.
Although the assisted category grew slightly, we believe H&R Block and our assisted branded competitors lost share to independents. Based on our analysis, the independent shares in the market appears to have grown by approximately 80 basis points in tax season '16, continuing the trend we have seen for the past several years. 
Finally, this season, we saw increased fraud prevention measures at both the federal and state level. Stronger information security protocols in the DIY space were introduced to the public-private Security Summit, refund processing slowed at the federal level and states implemented measures designed to prevent and detect fraudulent activity. We will have a better idea of the impact these changes have on the industry when the IRS releases more information. In the meantime, our government relations team will continue to focus on finding fraud in all its forms, including tax identity theft and improper earned income tax payments, while my management team will be fully focused on running the business.
Fraud is not the only issue we face and as such, a solution to fraud is not the only answer to client growth.
Now let me discuss what happened in the industry, and let's talk about H&R Block's results. We will have [ph] 6% of our clients in the assisted channel or 1 point of share. The majority of the client loss, again, came from the early-season filers obtaining the Earned Income Tax Credit and those filings have the 1040EZ Form. Those losses have [indiscernible] while our retention levels have held steady over the last several years. What this means is that we are not driving new clients into our offices at an acceptable rate. So why are we declining in clients? Well, there isn't a single simple answer for this question. There are few things we can point to. This includes aggressive and compelling similar promotions and product and service offerings for both independents and DIY competitors, including the recently reintroduced Refund Anticipation Loan or RAL-like product in the assisted channel. While we cannot just look externally in our assessment, the truth is we do not perform well as a company. We saw a poor execution in all areas of our business: sales, marketing and field operations. I intend for this to be the last time you'll hear me say this. We do not intend to be outplayed again.
In order to move forward, we need to understand what didn't work, which I've just described, but we also need to capitalize on what has worked. In the past, we talked to you about the 4 components of revenue: price, mix, volume and product attached. Although volume was down, the other 3 components positively impacted results. We achieved the 3% average price increase we have planned. Overall, form mix continued to improve, contributing an additional 1% in revenue growth. Overall product attached also increased, driven by our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products. And despite the fact that we declined the most in early season clients, which impacts Emerald Card and refund transfer unit sales, attach rates for these 2 products in our retail offices were strong at 15% and 33%, respectively. We also had a strong first season with our new bank partner. The transition of our products was efficient, resulting in a seamless experience for tax professionals and clients. 
Finally, in the assisted space, we were pleased with the launch of our new brand and look forward to growing that business to over 350 locations in fiscal 2017. As we mentioned before the season, this is a long-term investment for us, although I'm pleased with the progress today.
In our DIY business, returns declined 2.6% [ph], resulting in a 1 point loss of share. Yes, Turbo had a great season, but we also know that we do not market our product appropriately, demonstrated by the fact that our DIY awareness continues to linger in the mid-60s range. This actually represents a great opportunity for us. We have seen in the past that with the right marketing, we can drive client revenue growth. Our average revenue per client in DIY increased due to pricing enhancements to the product, improved monetization and an increase in product attached. Conversion rates also increased 1 point, and our mobile usage increased significantly.
Moving to the Affordable Care Act, we do not see the impact we expected as early season client losses disproportionately affected ACA-related volume. In addition, IRS compliance efforts around ACA penalties were not yet visible to taxpayers, which we believe led to continued and potentially increased tax noncompliance. As such, the percent of ACA-impacted clients decreased slightly from 16% to 15%. In the ACA-impacted client base, we did see an increase in the number of clients completing the premium tax credit reconciliation at -- as expected which is the most complex of the 3 ACA forms [indiscernible] The ACA impacts an important segment of our client base, and we believe will result in growth over time. However, that growth is dependent on 3 things: First, our ability to grow clients who are impacted by the ACA, particularly early season filers; second, overall growth and marketplace enrollment; and third, increased IRS compliance enforcement, which we believe will start to happen later this calendar year.
Now with that overview of the business, let me provide a couple of additional thoughts on our financial performance. Coming into the year with the divestiture of H&R Block Bank, we had anticipated a 1% drop in revenue and a 1 point decline in adjusted EBITDA margin. Actual results were in line with expectations, resulting in a $35 million reduction in EBITDA. We also incurred additional headwinds due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations that negatively impacted revenues by another point. Excluding the 2 points decrease due to these impacts, overall revenues for the year increased compared to the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet, we made great progress in aligning our capital structure with our business model this year. We divested our bank to provide capital flexibility and have been able to retain a significant -- return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. In FY '16, we repurchased 56.4 million shares, representing over 20% [ph] of outstanding shares since the beginning of the fiscal year. I am also pleased with the announcement today that the Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. Tony will speak to our dividend approach later in the call.
With fiscal 2016 behind us, it's now time to look to the future. Going forward, our #1 goal is to arrest the client decline and ultimately achieve client growth. To do this, we must improve the value we provide to our clients and do a better job of communicating this value. We will fix this, both in the short term and the long term. In the short term, we will make significant aggressive changes aimed at driving client volumes. As we approach next season, we are reviewing our marketing efforts, product offerings, promotions and service delivery models. Understand, however, that we will not sacrifice the long term good of our company for a short-term gain. In the long term, we must consider the tax preparation needs of the market overall. We are the only company that can serve clients would be want to be served and have the opportunity to expand our offerings to appeal to the very market today. You will see innovative solutions designed to leverage our ability to serve clients anyway they want to be served. To deliver on these goals, we are investing in research and development. These investments will be funded through our cost reduction efforts, which I'll talk about in a moment.
So now that we know what we need to do, how will we do it? There are 3 main pieces to our fiscal year 2017 strategy. First, we will implement programs specifically designed to drive new client growth, and I'm excited about what we'll bring to the market next season. Next, we have evaluated all aspects of the business and identified cost savings throughout. This includes realigning our field management and identifying efficiencies at our corporate headquarters, allowing us to reduce headcount and sharpen our focus on delivering client growth. Additionally, we'll spend less on marketing and have taken out IT infrastructure and support costs. Collectively, these actions will enable us to ensure strong free cash flow going forward while funding our client acquisition initiatives and R&D efforts mentioned earlier. Given how far we are from the next tax season and the competitive environment, it is too early to share specifics regarding both our fiscal 2017 initiatives and our margin expectation. That said, we are not moving away from our long-term EBITDA margin guidance of 28% to 32%. We will provide more details on the operational changes and financial expectations at our investor conference in December.
Finally, I have reorganized my management leadership team. I have flattened the organization, divided it into more discrete areas of responsibility, taken on more direct reports, increased individual leader accountability and ultimately, assumed a more operational role. Overall, I am very pleased with what this team has achieved in the first 50 days since the changes were implemented. They are focused on the right objectives and are working diligently to achieve them. Caroline Roscoe, a nearly 17-year veteran of H&R Block will lead the sales side of the company on assisted business, and Keith Knight to lead a franchise side. Heather Watts, an experienced DIY professional will lead our DIY business. In line with our research and development efforts, I'm pleased to announce that Jason Houseworth is now our Chief Innovation Officer, tasked with bringing solutions to taxpayers in new and creative ways. In this role, Jason will lead a cross-functional organization and is focused on innovation in the tax industry, specifically around the clients' tax filing experience. And I have moved Greg Macfarlane into a role where he will be responsible for all products and operations that support our retail business. Greg's operational mindset and business acumen will enable us to leverage his talents in an even more meaningful way going forward.
Which leads me to Tony Bowen who is taking on the role of CFO. Tony has all the variety of financial roles throughout his 12-plus years at H&R Block. Most recently, he led the U.S. tax finance organization, working very closely with Greg and me. his institutional knowledge makes them a great addition to my leadership team, and a strong financial acumen makes him an excellent choice as CFO. I'm excited about the Tony brings to our organization, and I'm confident that you will appreciate working with him in the months and years ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony."

First, I would like to think Bill and the Board of Directors for this opportunity. I would also like to thank Greg for his guidance and support. He's been a great mentor during my time in his team and has big shoes to fill. I'm excited about being the CFO of H&R Block despite having a difficult season I know from my 12 years here at this great company with great people. And what we do for our clients is important, helping them with what for many is our largest financial transaction of the year. This is a great business with a solid financial model that generates strong free cash flow and provides an excellent return on capital. I believe in the future of this company and look forward to serving as CFO.
So today, I'd like to talk about fiscal 2016 results, the financial strength of the company and my thoughts around capital structure. 
First, let's talk about our results. In essence, this was a reset year regarding our financials, given the divestiture of the bank and the subsequent capital structure changes. Revenue decreased 1.3% to just over $3 billion, primarily due to lower tax return volumes. As we stated at our investor conference, we expected the bank divestiture to have a 1 point annual impact on revenues and a 1 point impact on EBITDA margins. The actual impact was consistent with this guidance. In addition to the impact related to the bank divestiture, total revenues were negatively impacted 1% due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our Canadian and Australian operations. Excluding the impact of the bank divestiture and foreign exchange, revenues would've increased by approximately 0.5% over the prior year. 
Turning to assisted, return volume decline of 6% were partially offset by price increases of about 3%. In addition, we had a 1% increase due to improved mix as most of our volume losses were in less complex returns in the early part of the tax season. Lower tax return volume also resulted in lower overall product revenue. Despite the volume loss, however, we were able to increase product attached per client. This was driven by increases in attach rates from our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products. We also issued 1.8 million Emerald Card in tax season in 2016, and revenue per card increased 2% from the prior year to $52 per card. DIY tax preparation revenues increased 1.1% to $234 million, despite a reduction in return volume. Improved pricing and monetization efforts do an enhanced product flow contributed to the revenue increase. Additionally, we improved our refund transfer product attaching our DIY online offering. Internationally, local currency revenues increased slightly compared to the prior year, while U.S. dollars revenues were negatively impacted $26 million by foreign currency translation adjustments.
Turning to expenses, operating expenses increased 5.3% from the prior year, mainly due to expenses resulted from independent and franchise acquisitions and increased marketing expenses related to the early season sweepstake promotion. This is partially offset by the decline in compensation and benefit expenses, driven by the decrease in tax return volume. We completed the year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28%, which is in line with a guidance provided in the mid-season volume update, with the issuance of an additional $1 billion of long-term debt in September 2015 and the increased borrowings under our lines of credit. Total interest expense for FY '16 was $69 million. This represented an increase of $24 million from the prior year. We were pleased that our effective tax rate decreased approximately 2 points to 32.6%, mainly due to favorable discrete items. Notwithstanding that, we expect our long-term base rate to be in the 35% to 36% range. Finally, the company's overall free cash flow for the year declined 14% to $432 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.59. 
Turning to discontinued operations, Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation of foreign claims was $65 million as of April 30. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential deal piercing arguments. Next I'd like to discuss capital allocation. After divesting the bank last September we returned, to our historical practice repurchasing of shares and increasing our dividend. We repurchased 3.9 million shares during the fourth quarter, bringing our fiscal year total repurchases to 56.4 million shares or more than 20% of outstanding shares. We remain committed to returning capital to share repurchases, and that we are going to discuss specific plans for this year. We would get more guidance later in the call.
During the leverage, we previously shared that we intend to maintain investment grade metrics. We believe that to do this we need to maintain an adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 3x. Based on this year's fiscal results, we are now in that range. As such, we don't plan to issue any incremental debt in the near term to finance share repurchases. We will continue to evaluate the appropriate debt level as part of our overall capital structure plans going forward. Regarding dividends, the Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend. This increase represents a bit of a catch-up, given our inability to increase the dividend during the past few years while we were regulated as a savings loan holding company. Going forward, we are committed to an annual review of our dividend after each fiscal year. Any decisions regarding future dividends will depend in our operating results, market conditions and capital needs among other factors.
Turning to fiscal 2017, while we are focused on arresting the client decline, we've also completed a comprehensive review of our cost structure and implemented many of the cost reduction efforts Bill mentioned earlier. Because we are still in the planning process, we will provide more specifics for fiscal year 2017 at our investor conference in December.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill for some final comments."

I think that it's very strategic in the response we have to take, but let me try to lay out there I think we are. One is I think we're in line with our competitors. I think with some independents, we're higher priced. With our branded competitors in the assisted channel, we are beneath them. But I do think that we do have pockets of clients where it's clear we're going to have taken difficult approach to our pricing. I think that there are some value initiatives that we're going to have to look closely at on a surgical or strategic basis. I think having settled that, I do believe we still have the ability to take price increases, but I do think that they are going to be modest as we go forward."

On independents, I think a couple of things there. You mentioned pricing. I think that has an impact. I think -- as I said earlier, I think we need some more information on exactly what has happened there, it's tough in the independent space. I think a lack of minimal standards, which I continue to talk about as one of our top 2 government relations initiatives continues to hurt us, because part of independents is fraudulent providers. But again, I don't want to spend a lot of time on fraud. Our -- we continue to work on our government relations initiatives, but we have to focus on executing better. So we need more analysis on the independent space. But obviously, we don't like to see them growing while we're not. With regard to retention, our retention continues to be very strong. There is no change our issue this year was the lack of attraction of new clients so we were not able to get the new clients we've seen in the past, but our retention continues to be quite strong. And then finally from an ACA perspective, I do think, frankly, we were surprised by this year's results. The number of enrollees have gone up almost 50% to 11.7 million. And frankly, we had very little change in the amount of clients that are impacted. Last year, we had 16% client impacted. This year, was 15%. We did have more clients who were completing their premium tax credit, but to say that this was expected is not true. We were surprised ourselves. I do want to say though a few things. One, the exchanges continue to grow. There's another million people enrolled in the exchanges this year. It's almost 13 million people enrolled in '16. I think the -- I think there has been some noncompliance checking the boxes because IRS auditing efforts haven't begun they're going to begin this summer. IRS is going to be able to match the 1095s the people who did not file correctly. So I think you will see more stepped-up awareness that the IRS is coming after this. I also think that with our focus on early season volumes, I think that is going to help us also. I think with our miss in the early season it's hurt us on the piece. So I believe that the long-term this is still a deal in for us I think this is going to continue to grow. I think it's still going to be a positive for us. Frankly, I think we had a bump this year that we're a little surprised I think in the long run that this is still a benefit to H&R Block."

And what we committed to is we will have an annual review of the dividend in June because that's the time of the year we're 3 quarters of our revenue or more in the fourth quarter, that's the appropriate time for us to be discussing any change in the dividend. So we are committing to investors that we will have that annual review. Specific to this year, we felt that early on in my tenure, we did increase the dividend 33%. We haven't done it for almost 4 years, so we thought it appropriate for us to do a 10% increase at this moment. That will be effective with the dividend payable July 1, so that's what we announced today was a 10% increase, and then we'll in have an annual review of the dividend every June."

With the IRS Moving to matching W-2 matching income, matching W-2s to tax returns that's going to come into place this year, that will have a positive impact on the assisted business. Also as we talked about earlier with the way the refunds being delayed through the middle of February, that can have a benefit to the assisted business done in the right way. So I think there are some things that are going to start to happen that may lessen the impact of fraud in the assisted business but at this point, I think it's still -- until those documentation requirements are equalized, I think it's tough for the assisted business."

Earlier today, we announced our results for fiscal year 2016. Clearly, this was a disappointing season on many fronts. Our assisted tax preparation business continues to lose returns, and for the first time in several",2192,"Thank you, Colby, and good afternoon. Earlier today, we announced our results for fiscal year 2016. Clearly, this was a disappointing season on many fronts. Our assisted tax preparation business continues to lose returns, and for the first time in several years, our digital do-it-yourself business did as well. Let me be clear. We will change the current loss trajectory and are hard at work to make this happen. Next season will not feel the same.
So with that as a backdrop, here's what we'll cover today. First, I'll spend a few minutes looking back at tax season '16. We did not deliver the results we wanted and for that, I take full responsibility. We have learned some hard lessons and we'll change how we do business going forward. 
Next, I'll share our expectations for tax season '17 and beyond. We are fully committed to doing what it takes to turn our results around. Arresting the client decline and ultimately growing clients is our #1 objective. We cannot continue the client trajectory we've seen. 
Finally, I'll review the steps we are taking to achieve these objectives. Some have already been completed, many are in process, and others are yet  to start. I'm excited about the plans for fiscal year 2017 and beyond, and I'm confident we will execute on those plans to deliver better results. 
Let me, however, set some expectations upfront. I will not be able to provide full details regarding these plans given how far out from the tax season we are and the competitive environment. But I can tell you that we are taking a broad look at our options and we'll be making meaningful changes in both the short and long term.
First, let's start by looking back at tax season 2016. From an industry perspective, the season started very slowly and, consistent with the past  few years, did not reach its expected growth level until the last week of the season. And the results seen this season were disappointing for most of the branded players, including H&R Block. One branded competitor, however, had an exceptional season. TurboTax Absolute Zero promotion won the tax season and likely took share from all major branded competitors. Despite their success, however, the industry shift from assisted to DIY was relatively consistent with the last few years at approximately 90 basis points.
Although the assisted category grew slightly, we believe H&R Block and our assisted branded competitors lost share to independents. Based on our analysis, the independent shares in the market appears to have grown by approximately 80 basis points in tax season '16, continuing the trend we have seen for the past several years. 
Finally, this season, we saw increased fraud prevention measures at both the federal and state level. Stronger information security protocols in the DIY space were introduced to the public-private Security Summit, refund processing slowed at the federal level and states-implemented measures designed to prevent and detect fraudulent activity. We will have a better idea of the impact these changes have on the industry when the IRS releases more information. In the meantime, our government relations team will continue to focus on finding fraud in all its forms, including tax identity theft and improper earned income tax credit payments, while my management team will be fully focused on running the business. Fraud is not the only issue we face and as such, a solution to fraud is not the only answer to client growth.
Now let me discuss what happened in the industry, and let's talk about H&R Block's results. We will have 6% of our clients in the assisted channel or 1 point of share. The majority of the client loss, again, came from the early-season filers, obtaining the Earned Income Tax Credit and those filings at 1040EZ Form. Those losses have [indiscernible] our retention levels have held steady over the last several years. What this means is that we are not driving new clients into our offices at an acceptable rate. So why are we declining new clients? Well, there isn't a single simple answer for this question. There are few things we can point to. This includes aggressive and compelling consumer promotions and product and service offerings for both independents and DIY competitors, including the recently reintroduced Refund Anticipation Loan or RAL-like product in the assisted channel. While we cannot just look externally in our assessment, the truth is we do not perform well as a company. We saw poor execution in all areas of our business: sales, marketing and field operations. I intend for this to be the last time you'll hear me say this: We do not intend to be outplayed again.
In order to move forward, we need to understand what didn't work, which I've just described, but we also need to capitalize on what has worked. In the past, we talked to you about the 4 components of revenue: price, mix, volume and product attached. Although volume was down, the other 3 components positively impacted results. We achieved the 3% average price increase we had planned. Overall, form mix continued to improve, contributing an additional 1% in revenue growth. Overall, product attached also increased, driven by our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products. And despite the fact that we declined the most in early season clients, which impacts Emerald Card and refund transfer unit sales, attach rates for these 2 products in our retail offices were strong at 15% and 33%, respectively. We also had a strong first season with our new bank partner. The transition of our products was efficient, resulting in a seamless experience for our tax professionals and clients. 
Finally, in the assisted space, we were pleased with the launch of our new brand, Block Advisors, and we look forward to growing that business to over 350 locations in fiscal 2017. As we mentioned before the season, this is a long-term investment for us, although I'm pleased with the progress to date.
In our DIY business, returns declined 2.6%, resulting in a 1 point loss of share. Yes, Turbo had a great season, but we also know that we do not market our product appropriately, demonstrated by the fact that our DIY awareness continues to linger in the mid-60s range. This actually represents a great opportunity for us. We have seen in the past that with the right marketing, we can drive client revenue growth. Our average revenue per client in DIY increased due to pricing, enhancements to the product, improved monetization and an increase in product attached. Conversion rates also increased 1 point, and our mobile usage increased significantly.
Moving to the Affordable Care Act, we do not see the impact we expected as early season client losses disproportionately affected ACA-related volume. In addition, IRS compliance efforts around ACA penalties were not yet visible to taxpayers, which we believe led to continued and potentially increased tax primary noncompliance. As such, the percent of ACA-impacted clients decreased slightly from 16% to 15%. 
In the ACA-impacted client base, we did see an increase from the number of clients completing the premium tax credit reconciliation at -- I'm sorry, as expected, which is the most complex of the 3 ACA forms or worksheets. The ACA impacts an important segment of our client base, and we believe will result in growth over time. However, that growth is dependent on 3 things: First, our ability to grow clients who are impacted by the ACA, particularly early season filers; second, overall growth and marketplace enrollment; and third, increased IRS compliance enforcement, which we believe will start to happen later this calendar year.
Now with that overview of the business, let me provide a couple of additional thoughts on our financial performance. Coming into the year with the divestiture of H&R Block Bank, we had anticipated a 1% drop in revenue and a 1-point decline in adjusted EBITDA margin. Actual results were in line with expectations, resulting in a $35 million reduction in EBITDA. We also incurred additional headwinds due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations that negatively impacted revenues by another point. Excluding the 2 points of decrease due to these impacts, overall revenues for the year increased compared to the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet, we made great progress in aligning our capital structure with our business model this year. We divested our bank to provide capital flexibility and have been able to retain a -- return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. In FY '16, we repurchased 56.4 million shares, representing over 20% of outstanding shares since the beginning of the fiscal year. 
I am also pleased with the announcement today that the Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. Tony will speak to our dividend approach later in the call.
With fiscal 2016 behind us, it's now time to look to the future. Going forward, our #1 goal is to arrest the client decline and ultimately achieve client growth. To do this, we must improve the value we provide to our clients and do a better job of communicating this value. We will fix this, both in the short term and the long term. 
In the short term, we will make significant aggressive changes aimed at driving client volumes. As we approach next season, we are reviewing our marketing efforts, product offerings, promotions and service delivery models. Understand, however, that we will not sacrifice the long term good of our company for a short-term gain. In the long term, we must consider the tax preparation needs of the market overall. We are the only company that can serve clients however they want to be served and have the opportunity to expand our offerings to appeal to the very needs in the market today. You will see innovative solutions designed to leverage our ability to serve clients any way they want to be served. To deliver on these goals, we are investing in research and development. These investments will be funded through our cost-reduction efforts, which I'll talk about in a moment.
So now that we know what we need to do, how will we do it? There are 3 main pieces to our fiscal year 2017 strategy. First, we will implement programs specifically designed to drive new client growth, and I'm excited about what we'll bring to the market next season. Next, we have evaluated all aspects of the business and identified cost savings throughout. This includes realigning our field management and identifying efficiencies at our corporate headquarters, allowing us to reduce headcount and sharpen our focus on delivering client growth. Additionally, we'll spend less on marketing and have taken out IT infrastructure and support costs. Collectively, these actions will enable us to ensure strong free cash flow going forward while funding our client acquisition initiatives and R&D efforts mentioned earlier. Given how far we are from the next tax season and the competitive environment, it is too early to share specifics regarding both our fiscal 2017 initiatives and our margin expectation. That said, we are not moving away from our long-term EBITDA margin guidance of 28% to 32%. We'll provide more details on the operational changes and financial expectations at our investor conference in December.
Finally, I have reorganized my management leadership team. I have flattened the organization, divided it into more discrete areas of responsibility, taken on more direct reports, increased individual leader accountability and ultimately, assumed a more operational role. Overall, I am very pleased with what this team has achieved in the first 50 days since the changes were implemented. They are focused on the right objectives and are working diligently to achieve them. 
Caroline Roscoe, a nearly 17-year veteran of H&R Block, will lead the sales side of the company-owned assisted business, and Kip Knight will lead a franchise side. Heather Watts, an experienced DIY professional will lead our DIY business. In line with our research and development efforts, I'm pleased to announce that Jason Houseworth is now our Chief Innovation Officer, tasked with bringing solutions to taxpayers in new and creative ways. In this role, Jason will lead a cross-functional organization that is focused on innovation in the tax industry, specifically around the clients' tax filing experience. And I have moved Greg Macfarlane into a role where he will be responsible for all products and operations that support our retail business. Greg's operational mindset and business acumen will enable us to leverage his talents in an even more meaningful way going forward.
Which leads me to Tony Bowen, who is taking on the role of CFO. Tony has all the variety of finance roles throughout his 12-plus years at H&R Block. Most recently, he led the U.S. tax finance organization, working very closely with Greg and me. His institutional knowledge makes him a great addition to my leadership team, and his strong financial acumen makes him an excellent choice as CFO. I'm excited about what Tony brings to our organization and I'm confident that you will appreciate working with him in the months and years ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony."

First, I would like to think Bill and the Board of Directors for this opportunity. I would also like to thank Greg for his guidance and support. He's been a great mentor to me during my time on his team and has left big shoes to fill. I'm excited about being the CFO of H&R Block. Despite having a difficult season I know from my 12 years here at this great company with great people, and what we do for our clients is important, helping them with what for many is our largest financial transaction of the year. This is a great business with a solid financial model that generates strong free cash flow and provides an excellent return on capital. I believe in the future of this company and look forward to serving as CFO.
So today, I'd like to talk about fiscal 2016 results, the financial strength of the company and my thoughts around capital structure. 
First, let's talk about our results. In essence, this was a reset year regarding our financials, given the divestiture of the bank and the subsequent capital structure changes. Revenue decreased 1.3% to just over $3 billion, primarily due to lower tax return volumes. As we stated at our investor conference, we expected the bank divestiture to have a 1 point annual impact on revenues and a 1 point impact on EBITDA margins. The actual impact was consistent with this guidance. In addition to the impact related to the bank divestiture, total revenues were negatively impacted 1% due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our Canadian and Australian operations. Excluding the impact of the bank divestiture and foreign exchange, revenues would've increased by approximately 0.5% over the prior year. 
Turning to assisted. Return volume decline to 6% were partially offset by price increases of about 3%. In addition, we had a 1% increase due to improved mix as most of our volume losses were in less complex returns in the early part of the tax season. Lower tax return volume also resulted in lower overall product revenue. Despite the volume loss, however, we were able to increase product attached per client. This was driven by increases in attach rates for our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products. We also issued 1.8 million Emerald Card in tax season in 2016, and revenue per card increased 2% from the prior year to $52 per card. DIY tax preparation revenues increased 1.1% to $234 million, despite a reduction in return volume. Improved pricing and monetization efforts through an enhanced product flow contributed to the revenue increase. Additionally, we improved our refund transfer product attaching our DIY online offering. Internationally, local currency revenues increased slightly compared to the prior year, while U.S. dollars revenues were negatively impacted $26 million by foreign currency translation adjustments.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses increased 5.3% from the prior year, mainly due to expenses resulted from independent and franchise acquisitions and increased marketing expenses related to the early season Sweepstakes promotion. This was partially offset by the decline in compensation and benefit expenses driven by the decrease in tax return volume. We completed the year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28%, which is in line with the guidance provided in the mid-season volume update. With the issuance of an additional $1 billion of long-term debt in September 2015 and the increased borrowings under our lines of credit, total interest expense for FY '16 was $69 million. This represented an increase of $24 million from the prior year. We were pleased that our effective tax rate decreased approximately 2 points to 32.6%, mainly due to favorable discrete items. Notwithstanding that, we expect our long-term base rate to be in the 35% to 36% range. Finally, the company's overall free cash flow for the year declined 14% to $432 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.59. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation of warranty claims was $65 million as of April 30. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil piercing arguments. 
Next I'd like to discuss capital allocation. After divesting the bank last September, we returned our historical practice of repurchasing shares and increasing our dividend. We repurchased 3.9 million shares during the fourth quarter, bringing our fiscal year total repurchases to 56.4 million shares or more than 20% of outstanding shares. We remain committed to returning capital through share repurchases and that we aren't going to discuss specific plans for this year. We would get more guidance later in the call.
Turning to leverage. We previously shared that we intend to maintain investment grade metrics. We believe that to do this, we need to maintain an adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 3x. Based on this year's fiscal results, we are now in that range. As such, we don't plan to issue any incremental debt in the near term to finance share repurchases. We will continue to evaluate the appropriate debt level as part of our overall capital structure plans going forward. 
Regarding dividends, the Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend. This increase represents a bit of a catch-up, given our inability to increase the dividend during the past few years while we were regulated as a savings loan holding company. Going forward, we are committed to an annual review of our dividend after each fiscal year. Any decisions regarding future dividends will depend on our operating results, market conditions and capital needs, among other factors.
Turning to fiscal 2017, while we are focused on arresting the client decline, we have also completed a comprehensive review of our cost structure and implemented many of the cost reduction efforts Bill mentioned earlier. Because we are still in the planning process, we will provide more specifics for fiscal year 2017 at our investor conference in December.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill for some final comments."

So that's kind of the overview program-wise et cetera, but let me address pricing because I do think that if you think about where the pricing piece goes, this is -- this gets to be a kind of a complicated issue. I think that it's very strategic in the response we have to take, but let me try to lay out where I think we are. One is I do think that we are in line with our competitors. I think with some independents, we are higher-priced. With our branded competitors in the assisted channels, we are beneath them. But I do think that we do have pockets of clients where it's clear that we're going to have taken difficult approach to our pricing because I think that there are some value initiatives that we're going to have to look closely at on a surgical or strategic basis. I think having settled that, I do believe we still have the ability to take price increases, but I do think that they are going to be modest as we go forward."

On independents, I think a couple of things to reply there. You mentioned pricing. I think that has an impact. I think we -- as I said earlier, I think we need some more information on exactly what has happened there. It's tougher to get in the independent space. I think the lack of minimum standards, which I continue to talk about as one of our top 2 government relations initiative continues to hurt us because I think part of independents is fraudulent providers. But again, I don't want to spend a lot of time on fraud. Our -- we continue to work on our government relations initiatives. That is -- but we have to focus on executing better. So we need more analysis on the independent space. But obviously, we don't like to see them growing while we're not. 
With regard to retention. Our retention continues to be very strong. There was no change -- our issue this year was the lack of attraction of new clients. So we were not able to get to new client quest [ph] that we've seen in the past, but our retention continues to be quite strong. And then finally, from an ACA perspective, I do think, frankly, we were surprised by this year's results. The number of enrollees have gone up almost 50% to 11.7 million. And frankly, we had very little change in the amount of clients that are impacted. Last year, we had 16% client impacted. This year was 15%. 
We did have more clients who were completing their premium tax credit, but to say that this was expected was -- is not true. We were surprised ourselves. 
I do want to say, though, a few things. One, the exchanges continue to grow. There's another million people enrolled in the exchanges this year. It's almost 13 million people enrolled in '16. I think the -- I think there has been some noncompliance, some checking the boxes because IRS auditing efforts haven't begun. They're going to begin this summer. IRS is going to be able to match with all the 1095s, the people who did not file correctly. So I think you will see more stepped-up awareness that the IRS is coming after this. I also think that with our focus on early season volumes, I think that is going to help us also. I think with our miss in the early season it's hurt us on the ACA piece. So I believe that in the long-term this is still a tailwind for us. I think this is going to continue to grow. I think it's still going to be a positive for us. Frankly, I think we had a bump this year that we're a little surprised at, but I think in the long run, this is still a benefit age in H&R Block."

That's the appropriate time for us to be discussing any change in the dividend. So we are committing to investors that we will have that annual review.

So I think that's the other piece we talked about. Now I do think there are some things that are going to happen, not wishful thinking, that is going to help the assisted business and ultimately, I believe, help us. With the IRS moving to matching W-2 matching income, matching W-2s to tax returns that's going to come into place this year, that will have a positive impact on the assisted business. Also, as we talked about earlier with the PAT Act, with refunds being delayed through the middle of February, that can have a benefit to the assisted business if done in the right way. So I think there are some things that are going to have -- start to happen that may lessen the impact of fraud on the assisted business.

Earlier today, we announced our results for fiscal year 2016. Clearly, this was a disappointing season on many fronts. Our assisted tax preparation business continues to lose returns, and for the first time in several",2193,"Thank you, Colby, and good afternoon. Earlier today, we announced our results for fiscal year 2016. Clearly, this was a disappointing season on many fronts. Our assisted tax preparation business continues to lose returns, and for the first time in several years, our digital do-it-yourself business did as well. Let me be clear. We will change the client loss trajectory and are hard at work to make this happen. Next season will not feel the same.
So with that as a backdrop, here's what we'll cover today. First, I'll spend a few minutes looking back at tax season '16. We did not deliver the results we wanted and for that, I take full responsibility. We have learned some hard lessons and we'll change how we do business going forward. 
Next, I'll share our expectations for tax season '17 and beyond. We are fully committed to doing what it takes to turn our results around. Arresting the client decline and ultimately growing clients is our #1 objective. We cannot continue the client trajectory we've seen. 
Finally, I'll review the steps we are taking to achieve these objectives. Some have already been completed, many are in process, and others are yet to start. I'm excited about the plans for fiscal year 2017 and beyond, and I'm confident we will execute on those plans to deliver better results. 
Let me, however, set some expectations upfront. I will not be able to provide full details regarding these plans given how far out from the tax season we are and the competitive environment. But I can tell you that we are taking a broad look at our options and we'll be making meaningful changes in both the short and long term.
First, let's start by looking back at tax season 2016. From an industry perspective, the season started very slowly and, consistent with the past  few years, did not reach its expected growth level until the last week of the season. And the results seen this season were disappointing for most of the branded players, including H&R Block. One branded competitor, however, had an exceptional season. TurboTax Absolute Zero promotion won the tax season and likely took share from all major branded competitors. Despite their success, however, the industry shift from assisted to DIY was relatively consistent with the last few years at approximately 90 basis points.
Although the assisted category grew slightly, we believe H&R Block and our assisted branded competitors lost share to independents. Based on our analysis, the independent share of the market appears to have grown by approximately 80 basis points in tax season '16, continuing the trend we have seen for the past several years. 
Finally, this season, we saw increased fraud prevention measures at both the federal and state level. Stronger information security protocols in the DIY space were introduced to the public-private Security Summit, refund processing slowed at the federal level and states implemented measures designed to prevent and detect fraudulent activity. We will have a better idea of the impact these changes have on the industry when the IRS releases more information. In the meantime, our government relations team will continue to focus on finding fraud in all its forms, including tax identity theft and improper earned income tax credit payments, while my management team will be fully focused on running the business. Fraud is not the only issue we face and as such, a solution to fraud is not the only answer to client growth.
Now that we have discussed what happened in the industry, let's talk about H&R Block's results. We lost 6% of our clients in the assisted channel or 1 point of share. The majority of the client loss, again, came from the early-season filers, obtaining the Earned Income Tax Credit and those filing the 1040EZ Form. Those losses have [indiscernible] our retention levels have held steady over the last several years. What this means is that we are not driving new clients into our offices at an acceptable rate. So why are we declining in clients? While there isn't a single simple answer for this question, there are few things we can point to. This includes aggressive and compelling consumer promotions and product and service offerings for both independents and DIY competitors, including the recently reintroduced Refund Anticipation Loan or RAL-like product in the assisted channel. While we cannot just look externally in our assessment, the truth is we did not perform well as a company. We saw poor execution in all areas of our business: sales, marketing and field operations. I intend for this to be the last time you'll hear me say this: We do not intend to be outplayed again.
In order to move forward, we need to understand what didn't work, which I've just described, but we also need to capitalize on what has worked. In the past, we talked to you about the 4 components of revenue: price, mix, volume and product attached. Although volume was down, the other 3 components positively impacted results. We achieved the 3% average price increase we had planned. Overall, form mix continued to improve, contributing an additional 1% in revenue growth. Overall, product attached also increased, driven by our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products. And despite the fact that we declined the most in early season clients, which impacts Emerald Card and refund transfer unit sales, attach rates for these 2 products in our retail offices were strong at 15% and 33%, respectively. We also had a strong first season with our new bank partner. The transition of our products was efficient, resulting in a seamless experience for our tax professionals and clients. 
Finally, in the assisted space, we were pleased with the launch of our new brand, Block Advisors, and we look forward to growing that business to over 350 locations in fiscal 2017. As we mentioned before the season, this is a long-term investment for us, although I'm pleased with the progress to date.
In our DIY business, returns declined 2.6%, resulting in a 1-point loss of share. Yes, Turbo had a great season, but we also know that we did not market our product appropriately, demonstrated by the fact that our DIY awareness continues to linger in the mid-60s range. This actually represents a great opportunity for us. We have seen in the past that with the right marketing, we can drive client and revenue growth. Our average revenue per client in DIY increased due to pricing, enhancements to the product, improved monetization and an increase in product attached. Conversion rates also increased 1 point, and our mobile usage increased significantly.
Moving to the Affordable Care Act, we did not see the impact we expected as early season client losses disproportionately affected ACA-related volume. In addition, IRS compliance efforts around ACA penalties were not yet visible to taxpayers, which we believe led to continued and potentially increased tax filer noncompliance. As such, the percent of ACA-impacted clients decreased slightly from 16% to 15%. 
In the ACA-impacted client base, we did see an increase in the number of clients completing the premium tax credit reconciliation at -- I'm sorry, as expected, which is the most complex of the 3 ACA forms or worksheets. The ACA impacts an important segment of our client base, and we believe will result in growth over time. However, that growth is dependent on 3 things: First, our ability to grow clients who are impacted by the ACA, particularly early season filers; second, overall growth in marketplace enrollment; and third, increased IRS compliance enforcement, which we believe will start to happen later this calendar year.
Now with that overview of the business, let me provide a couple of additional thoughts on our financial performance. Coming into the year with the divestiture of H&R Block Bank, we had anticipated a 1% drop in revenue and a 1-point decline in adjusted EBITDA margin. Actual results were in line with expectations, resulting in a $35 million reduction in EBITDA. We also incurred additional headwinds due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations that negatively impacted revenues by another point. Excluding the 2 points of decrease due to these impacts, overall revenues for the year increased compared to the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet, we made great progress in aligning our capital structure with our business model this year. We divested our bank to provide capital flexibility and have been able to retain a -- return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. In FY '16, we repurchased 56.4 million shares, representing over 20% of outstanding shares since the beginning of the fiscal year. 
I am also pleased with the announcement today that the Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. Tony will speak to our dividend approach later in the call.
With fiscal 2016 behind us, it's now time to look to the future. Going forward, our #1 goal is to arrest the client decline and ultimately achieve client growth. To do this, we must improve the value we provide to our clients and do a better job of communicating this value. We will fix this, both in the short term and the long term. 
In the short term, we will make significant aggressive changes aimed at driving client volumes. As we approach next season, we are reviewing our marketing efforts, product offerings, promotions and service delivery models. Understand, however, that we will not sacrifice the long term good of our company for a short-term gain. In the long term, we must consider the tax preparation needs of the market overall. We are the only company that can serve clients however they want to be served and have the opportunity to expand our offerings to appeal to the very needs in the market today. You will see innovative solutions designed to leverage our ability to serve clients any way they want to be served. To deliver on these goals, we are investing in research and development. These investments will be funded through our cost-reduction efforts, which I'll talk about in a moment.
So now that we know what we need to do, how will we do it? There are 3 main pieces to our fiscal year 2017 strategy. First, we will implement programs specifically designed to drive new client growth, and I'm excited about what we'll bring to the market next season. Next, we have evaluated all aspects of the business and identified cost savings throughout. This includes realigning our field management and identifying efficiencies at our corporate headquarters, allowing us to reduce headcount and sharpen our focus on delivering client growth. Additionally, we'll spend less on marketing and have taken out IT infrastructure and support costs. Collectively, these actions will enable us to ensure strong free cash flow going forward while funding our client acquisition initiatives and the R&D efforts mentioned earlier. Given how far we are from the next tax season and the competitive environment, it is too early to share specifics regarding both our fiscal 2017 initiatives and our margin expectation. That said, we are not moving away from our long-term EBITDA margin guidance of 28% to 32%. We'll provide more details on the operational changes and financial expectations at our investor conference in December.
Finally, I have reorganized my management leadership team. I have flattened the organization, divided it into more discrete areas of responsibility, taken on more direct reports, increased individual leader accountability and ultimately assumed a more operational role. Overall, I am very pleased with what this team has achieved in the first 50 days since the changes were implemented. They are focused on the right objectives and are working diligently to achieve them. 
Carolyn Roscoe, a nearly 17-year veteran of H&R Block, will lead the sales side of the company-owned assisted business, and Kip Knight will lead the franchise side. Heather Watts, an experienced DIY professional, will lead our DIY business. In line with our research and development efforts, I'm pleased to announce that Jason Houseworth is now our Chief Innovation Officer, tasked with bringing solutions to taxpayers in new and creative ways. In this role, Jason will lead a cross-functional organization that is focused on innovation in the tax industry, specifically around the clients' tax filing experience. And I have moved Greg Macfarlane into a role where he will be responsible for all products and operations that support our retail business. Greg's operational mindset and business acumen will enable us to leverage his talents in an even more meaningful way going forward.
Which leads me to Tony Bowen, who is taking on the role of CFO. Tony has held a variety of finance roles throughout his 12-plus years at H&R Block. Most recently, he led the U.S. tax finance organization, working very closely with Greg and me. His institutional knowledge makes him a great addition to my leadership team, and his strong financial acumen makes him an excellent choice as CFO. I'm excited about what Tony brings to our organization and I'm confident that you will appreciate working with him in the months and years ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony."

First, I would like to think Bill and the Board of Directors for this opportunity. I would also like to thank Greg for his guidance and support. He's been a great mentor to me during my time on his team and has left big shoes to fill. I'm excited about being the CFO of H&R Block. Despite having a difficult season, I know from my 12 years here at this great company with great people that what we do for our clients is important, helping them with what for many is our largest financial transaction of the year. This is a great business with a solid financial model that generates strong free cash flow and provides an excellent return on capital. I believe in the future of this company and look forward to serving as CFO.
So today, I'd like to talk about fiscal 2016 results, the financial strength of the company and my thoughts around capital structure. 
First, let's talk about our results. In essence, this was a reset year regarding our financials, given the divestiture of the bank and the subsequent capital structure changes. Revenue decreased 1.3% to just over $3 billion, primarily due to lower tax return volumes. As we stated at our investor conference, we expected the bank divestiture to have a 1-point annual impact on revenues and a 1-point impact on EBITDA margins. The actual impact was consistent with this guidance. In addition to the impact related to the bank divestiture, total revenues were negatively impacted 1% due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our Canadian and Australian operations. Excluding the impact of the bank divestiture and foreign exchange, revenues would have increased by approximately 0.5% over the prior year. 
Turning to assisted. Return volume declines of 6% were partially offset by price increases of about 3%. In addition, we had a 1% increase due to improved mix as most of our volume losses were in less complex returns in the early part of the tax season. Lower tax return volume also resulted in lower overall product revenue. Despite the volume loss, however, we were able to increase product attach per client. This was driven by increases in attach rates for our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products. We also issued 1.8 million Emerald Cards in tax season 2016, and revenue per card increased 2% from the prior year to $52 per card. DIY tax preparation revenues increased 1.1% to $234 million, despite a reduction in return volume. Improved pricing and monetization efforts through an enhanced product flow contributed to the revenue increase. Additionally, we improved our refund transfer product attach in our DIY online offering. Internationally, local currency revenues increased slightly compared to the prior year, while U.S. dollar revenues were negatively impacted $26 million by foreign currency translation adjustments.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses increased 5.3% from the prior year, mainly due to expenses resulted from independent and franchise acquisitions and increased marketing expenses related to the early season Sweepstakes promotion. This was partially offset by the decline in compensation and benefit expenses driven by the decrease in tax return volume. We completed the year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28%, which is in line with the guidance provided in the mid-season volume update. With the issuance of an additional $1 billion of long-term debt in September 2015 and the increased borrowings under our lines of credit, total interest expense for FY '16 was $69 million. This represented an increase of $24 million from the prior year. We were pleased that our effective tax rate decreased approximately 2 points to 32.6%, mainly due to favorable discrete items. Notwithstanding that, we expect our long-term base rate to be in the 35% to 36% range. Finally, the company's overall free cash flow for the year declined 14% to $432 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.59. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation of warranty claims was $65 million as of April 30. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil piercing arguments. 
Next, I'd like to discuss capital allocation. After divesting the bank last September, we returned to our historical practice of repurchasing shares and increasing our dividend. We repurchased 3.9 million shares during the fourth quarter, bringing our fiscal year total repurchases to 56.4 million shares or more than 20% of outstanding shares. We remain committed to returning capital through share repurchases and that we aren't going to discuss specific plans for this year. We will get more guidance later in the call.
Turning to leverage. We previously shared that we intend to maintain investment grade metrics. We believe that to do this, we need to maintain an adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5x to 3x. Based on this year's fiscal results, we are now in that range. As such, we don't plan to issue any incremental debt in the near term to finance share repurchases. We will continue to evaluate the appropriate debt level as part of our overall capital structure plans going forward. 
Regarding dividends, the Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend. This increase represents a bit of a catch-up, given our inability to increase the dividend during the past few years while we were regulated as a savings loan holding company. Going forward, we are committed to an annual review of our dividend after each fiscal year. Any decisions regarding future dividends will depend on our operating results, market conditions and capital needs, among other factors.
Turning to fiscal 2017, while we are focused on arresting the client decline, we have also completed a comprehensive review of our cost structure and implemented many of the cost reduction efforts Bill mentioned earlier. Because we are still in the planning process, we will provide more specifics for fiscal year 2017 at our investor conference in December.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill for final comments."

We are taking full responsibility and are addressing the issues of last season. You've heard me say it before but it bears repeating here. I own what happened. And to that end, I will not receive a performance bonus this year. Looking forward, my senior leaders and I are a very competitive group. We do not like to lose. We are smarter than we were at the beginning of the season and the lessons learned from tax season '16 will benefit us in the long range. We are aggressively focused on arresting the client decline going forward, and we will deliver stronger results in tax season '17.

So that's kind of the overview program-wise, et cetera, but let me address pricing because I do think that if you think about where the pricing piece goes, this is -- this gets to be a kind of a complicated issue. I think that it's very strategic in the response we have to take, but let me try to lay out where I think we are. One is I do think that we are in line with our competitors. I think with some independents, we are higher-priced. With our branded competitors in the assisted channels, we are beneath them. But I do think that we do have pockets of clients where it's clear that we're going to have to take a difficult approach to our pricing because I think that there are some value initiatives that we're going to have to look closely at on a surgical or strategic basis. I think having said all that, I do believe we still have the ability to take price increases, but I do think that they are going to be modest as we go forward."

So that -- and whether that's in '17, we're still modeling everything out, but the direction of my team has been to be very aggressive. 
On the executional front, and as I've said, I own this. I drove all of these initiatives. We missed on the sweepstakes. It underperformed. I don't think this is our best year in marketing. I think that from a sales perspective, I think our field team -- and everybody worked hard, everybody did their best, but we did not capture new clients at the rate that we have in the past. So I don't think our efforts at the local level were very strong. I think there were some executional hiccups also. And on the DIY side, while I think we're very pleased with our product performance and our reviews continue to show what a strong product we have that matches up very well with TurboTax, we just didn't -- the combination of marketing and really attracting new clients worked. 
I was talking to somebody recently and I said, normally in business, a few things hit and a few things miss and you hope you move ahead. And every once in a while, you hit on everything. Well, this was a perfect storm the wrong way. Virtually everything, whether it be foreign currency, the reset year with Bothe [ph], I mean, everything went the wrong way here. That's why I think, ultimately, this was a bad tax season. That's the way I'm approaching it. 
We are going to turn this around. We're going to fix this. But it was one bad season is the way I really look at it. I think in other seasons, we've had some plus and minus stuff, and we've been able to move forward with a credible result. This year, they were unacceptable. And we're committed to turning that around."

On independents, I think a couple of things are at play there. You mentioned pricing. I think that has an impact. I think we -- as I said earlier, I think we need some more information on exactly what has happened there. It's tougher to get in the independent space. I think the lack of minimum standards, which I continue to talk about as one of our top 2 government relations initiative continues to hurt us because I think part of independents is fraudulent providers. But again, I don't want to spend a lot of time on fraud. Our -- we continue to work on our government relations initiatives. That is -- but we have to focus on executing better. So we need more analysis on the independent space. But obviously, we don't like to see them growing while we're not. 
With regard to retention. Our retention continues to be very strong. There was no change -- our issue this year was the lack of attraction of new clients. So we were not able to get the new client push that we've seen in the past, but our retention continues to be quite strong. And then finally, from an ACA perspective, I do think, frankly, we were surprised by this year's results. The number of enrollees had gone up almost 50% to 11.7 million. And frankly, we had very little change in the amount of clients that are impacted. Last year, we had 16% client impacted. This year was 15%. 
We did have more clients who were completing their premium tax credit, but to say that this was expected was -- is not true. We were surprised ourselves. 
I do want to say, though, a few things. One, the exchanges continue to grow. There's another million people enrolled in the exchanges this year. It's almost 13 million people enrolled in '16. I think the -- I think there has been some noncompliance, some checking of the boxes because IRS auditing efforts haven't begun. They're going to begin this summer. IRS is going to be able to match with all the 1095s to people who did not file correctly. So I think you will see more stepped-up awareness that the IRS is coming after this. I also think that with our focus on early season volumes, I think that is going to help us also. I think with our miss in the early season, it's hurt us on the ACA piece. So I believe that in the long-term this is still a tailwind for us. I think this is going to continue to grow. I think it's still going to be a positive for us. Frankly, I think we had a bump this year that we're a little surprised at, but I think in the long run, this is still a benefit to H&R Block."

When we left the bank in September and came out with our capital plan, we said we would talk about dividends at the time when we think it's appropriate, which is this -- which is every June. And what we've committed to is we will have an annual review of the dividend in June because that's the time of the year, 3/4 of our revenue or more are in the fourth quarter. That's the appropriate time for us to be discussing any change in the dividend. So we are committing to investors that we will have that annual review. Specific to this year, we felt that early on in my tenure, we did increase the dividend 33%. We hadn't done it for almost 4 years so we thought it appropriate for us to do a 10% increase at this moment. That'll be effective with the dividend payable July 1.

So I think that's the other piece we talk about. Now I do think there are some things that are going to happen, not wishful thinking, that is going to help the assisted business and ultimately, I believe, help us. With the IRS moving to matching W-2 matching income, matching W-2s to tax returns that's going to come into place this year, that will have a positive impact on the assisted business. Also, as we talked about earlier with the PAT Act, with refunds being delayed through the middle of February, that can have a benefit to the assisted business if done in the right way.

Our assisted tax preparation business continues to lose returns, and for the first time in several",2193,"Thank you, Colby, and good afternoon. Earlier today, we announced our results for fiscal year 2016. Clearly, this was a disappointing season on many fronts. Our assisted tax preparation business continues to lose returns, and for the first time in several years, our digital do-it-yourself business did as well. Let me be clear. We will change the client loss trajectory and are hard at work to make this happen. Next season will not feel the same.
So with that as a backdrop, here's what we'll cover today. First, I'll spend a few minutes looking back at tax season '16. We did not deliver the results we wanted and for that, I take full responsibility. We have learned some hard lessons and we'll change how we do business going forward. 
Next, I'll share our expectations for tax season '17 and beyond. We are fully committed to doing what it takes to turn our results around. Arresting the client decline and ultimately growing clients is our #1 objective. We cannot continue the client trajectory we've seen. 
Finally, I'll review the steps we are taking to achieve these objectives. Some have already been completed, many are in process, and others are yet to start. I'm excited about the plans for fiscal year 2017 and beyond, and I'm confident we will execute on those plans to deliver better results. 
Let me, however, set some expectations upfront. I will not be able to provide full details regarding these plans given how far out from the tax season we are and the competitive environment. But I can tell you that we are taking a broad look at our options and we'll be making meaningful changes in both the short and long term.
First, let's start by looking back at tax season 2016. From an industry perspective, the season started very slowly and, consistent with the past  few years, did not reach its expected growth level until the last week of the season. And the results seen this season were disappointing for most of the branded players, including H&R Block. One branded competitor, however, had an exceptional season. TurboTax Absolute Zero promotion won the tax season and likely took share from all major branded competitors. Despite their success, however, the industry shift from assisted to DIY was relatively consistent with the last few years at approximately 90 basis points.
Although the assisted category grew slightly, we believe H&R Block and our assisted branded competitors lost share to independents. Based on our analysis, the independent share of the market appears to have grown by approximately 80 basis points in tax season '16, continuing the trend we have seen for the past several years. 
Finally, this season, we saw increased fraud prevention measures at both the federal and state level. Stronger information security protocols in the DIY space were introduced to the public-private Security Summit, refund processing slowed at the federal level and states implemented measures designed to prevent and detect fraudulent activity. We will have a better idea of the impact these changes have on the industry when the IRS releases more information. In the meantime, our government relations team will continue to focus on finding fraud in all its forms, including tax identity theft and improper earned income tax credit payments, while my management team will be fully focused on running the business. Fraud is not the only issue we face and as such, a solution to fraud is not the only answer to client growth.
Now that we have discussed what happened in the industry, let's talk about H&R Block's results. We lost 6% of our clients in the assisted channel or 1 point of share. The majority of the client loss, again, came from the early-season filers, obtaining the Earned Income Tax Credit and those filing the 1040EZ Form. Those losses have [indiscernible] our retention levels have held steady over the last several years. What this means is that we are not driving new clients into our offices at an acceptable rate. So why are we declining in clients? While there isn't a single simple answer for this question, there are few things we can point to. This includes aggressive and compelling consumer promotions and product and service offerings for both independents and DIY competitors, including the recently reintroduced Refund Anticipation Loan or RAL-like product in the assisted channel. While we cannot just look externally in our assessment, the truth is we did not perform well as a company. We saw poor execution in all areas of our business: sales, marketing and field operations. I intend for this to be the last time you'll hear me say this: We do not intend to be outplayed again.
In order to move forward, we need to understand what didn't work, which I've just described, but we also need to capitalize on what has worked. In the past, we talked to you about the 4 components of revenue: price, mix, volume and product attached. Although volume was down, the other 3 components positively impacted results. We achieved the 3% average price increase we had planned. Overall, form mix continued to improve, contributing an additional 1% in revenue growth. Overall, product attached also increased, driven by our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products. And despite the fact that we declined the most in early season clients, which impacts Emerald Card and refund transfer unit sales, attach rates for these 2 products in our retail offices were strong at 15% and 33%, respectively. We also had a strong first season with our new bank partner. The transition of our products was efficient, resulting in a seamless experience for our tax professionals and clients. 
Finally, in the assisted space, we were pleased with the launch of our new brand, Block Advisors, and we look forward to growing that business to over 350 locations in fiscal 2017. As we mentioned before the season, this is a long-term investment for us, although I'm pleased with the progress to date.
In our DIY business, returns declined 2.6%, resulting in a 1-point loss of share. Yes, Turbo had a great season, but we also know that we did not market our product appropriately, demonstrated by the fact that our DIY awareness continues to linger in the mid-60s range. This actually represents a great opportunity for us. We have seen in the past that with the right marketing, we can drive client and revenue growth. Our average revenue per client in DIY increased due to pricing, enhancements to the product, improved monetization and an increase in product attached. Conversion rates also increased 1 point, and our mobile usage increased significantly.
Moving to the Affordable Care Act, we did not see the impact we expected as early season client losses disproportionately affected ACA-related volume. In addition, IRS compliance efforts around ACA penalties were not yet visible to taxpayers, which we believe led to continued and potentially increased tax filer noncompliance. As such, the percent of ACA-impacted clients decreased slightly from 16% to 15%. 
In the ACA-impacted client base, we did see an increase in the number of clients completing the premium tax credit reconciliation at -- I'm sorry, as expected, which is the most complex of the 3 ACA forms or worksheets. The ACA impacts an important segment of our client base, and we believe will result in growth over time. However, that growth is dependent on 3 things: First, our ability to grow clients who are impacted by the ACA, particularly early season filers; second, overall growth in marketplace enrollment; and third, increased IRS compliance enforcement, which we believe will start to happen later this calendar year.
Now with that overview of the business, let me provide a couple of additional thoughts on our financial performance. Coming into the year with the divestiture of H&R Block Bank, we had anticipated a 1% drop in revenue and a 1-point decline in adjusted EBITDA margin. Actual results were in line with expectations, resulting in a $35 million reduction in EBITDA. We also incurred additional headwinds due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations that negatively impacted revenues by another point. Excluding the 2 points of decrease due to these impacts, overall revenues for the year increased compared to the prior year.
Turning to the balance sheet, we made great progress in aligning our capital structure with our business model this year. We divested our bank to provide capital flexibility and have been able to retain a -- return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. In FY '16, we repurchased 56.4 million shares, representing over 20% of outstanding shares since the beginning of the fiscal year. 
I am also pleased with the announcement today that the Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. Tony will speak to our dividend approach later in the call.
With fiscal 2016 behind us, it's now time to look to the future. Going forward, our #1 goal is to arrest the client decline and ultimately achieve client growth. To do this, we must improve the value we provide to our clients and do a better job of communicating this value. We will fix this, both in the short term and the long term. 
In the short term, we will make significant aggressive changes aimed at driving client volumes. As we approach next season, we are reviewing our marketing efforts, product offerings, promotions and service delivery models. Understand, however, that we will not sacrifice the long term good of our company for a short-term gain. In the long term, we must consider the tax preparation needs of the market overall. We are the only company that can serve clients however they want to be served and have the opportunity to expand our offerings to appeal to the very needs in the market today. You will see innovative solutions designed to leverage our ability to serve clients any way they want to be served. To deliver on these goals, we are investing in research and development. These investments will be funded through our cost-reduction efforts, which I'll talk about in a moment.
So now that we know what we need to do, how will we do it? There are 3 main pieces to our fiscal year 2017 strategy. First, we will implement programs specifically designed to drive new client growth, and I'm excited about what we'll bring to the market next season. Next, we have evaluated all aspects of the business and identified cost savings throughout. This includes realigning our field management and identifying efficiencies at our corporate headquarters, allowing us to reduce headcount and sharpen our focus on delivering client growth. Additionally, we'll spend less on marketing and have taken out IT infrastructure and support costs. Collectively, these actions will enable us to ensure strong free cash flow going forward while funding our client acquisition initiatives and the R&D efforts mentioned earlier. Given how far we are from the next tax season and the competitive environment, it is too early to share specifics regarding both our fiscal 2017 initiatives and our margin expectation. That said, we are not moving away from our long-term EBITDA margin guidance of 28% to 32%. We'll provide more details on the operational changes and financial expectations at our investor conference in December.
Finally, I have reorganized my management leadership team. I have flattened the organization, divided it into more discrete areas of responsibility, taken on more direct reports, increased individual leader accountability and ultimately assumed a more operational role. Overall, I am very pleased with what this team has achieved in the first 50 days since the changes were implemented. They are focused on the right objectives and are working diligently to achieve them. 
Carolyn Roscoe, a nearly 17-year veteran of H&R Block, will lead the sales side of the company-owned assisted business, and Kip Knight will lead the franchise side. Heather Watts, an experienced DIY professional, will lead our DIY business. In line with our research and development efforts, I'm pleased to announce that Jason Houseworth is now our Chief Innovation Officer, tasked with bringing solutions to taxpayers in new and creative ways. In this role, Jason will lead a cross-functional organization that is focused on innovation in the tax industry, specifically around the clients' tax filing experience. And I have moved Greg Macfarlane into a role where he will be responsible for all products and operations that support our retail business. Greg's operational mindset and business acumen will enable us to leverage his talents in an even more meaningful way going forward.
Which leads me to Tony Bowen, who is taking on the role of CFO. Tony has held a variety of finance roles throughout his 12-plus years at H&R Block. Most recently, he led the U.S. tax finance organization, working very closely with Greg and me. His institutional knowledge makes him a great addition to my leadership team, and his strong financial acumen makes him an excellent choice as CFO. I'm excited about what Tony brings to our organization and I'm confident that you will appreciate working with him in the months and years ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony."

First, I would like to think Bill and the Board of Directors for this opportunity. I would also like to thank Greg for his guidance and support. He's been a great mentor to me during my time on his team and has left big shoes to fill. I'm excited about being the CFO of H&R Block. Despite having a difficult season, I know from my 12 years here at this great company with great people that what we do for our clients is important, helping them with what for many is our largest financial transaction of the year. This is a great business with a solid financial model that generates strong free cash flow and provides an excellent return on capital. I believe in the future of this company and look forward to serving as CFO.
So today, I'd like to talk about fiscal 2016 results, the financial strength of the company and my thoughts around capital structure. 
First, let's talk about our results. In essence, this was a reset year regarding our financials, given the divestiture of the bank and the subsequent capital structure changes. Revenue decreased 1.3% to just over $3 billion, primarily due to lower tax return volumes. As we stated at our investor conference, we expected the bank divestiture to have a 1-point annual impact on revenues and a 1-point impact on EBITDA margins. The actual impact was consistent with this guidance. In addition to the impact related to the bank divestiture, total revenues were negatively impacted 1% due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our Canadian and Australian operations. Excluding the impact of the bank divestiture and foreign exchange, revenues would have increased by approximately 0.5% over the prior year. 
Turning to assisted. Return volume declines of 6% were partially offset by price increases of about 3%. In addition, we had a 1% increase due to improved mix as most of our volume losses were in less complex returns in the early part of the tax season. Lower tax return volume also resulted in lower overall product revenue. Despite the volume loss, however, we were able to increase product attach per client. This was driven by increases in attach rates for our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products. We also issued 1.8 million Emerald Cards in tax season 2016, and revenue per card increased 2% from the prior year to $52 per card. DIY tax preparation revenues increased 1.1% to $234 million, despite a reduction in return volume. Improved pricing and monetization efforts through an enhanced product flow contributed to the revenue increase. Additionally, we improved our refund transfer product attach in our DIY online offering. Internationally, local currency revenues increased slightly compared to the prior year, while U.S. dollar revenues were negatively impacted $26 million by foreign currency translation adjustments.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses increased 5.3% from the prior year, mainly due to expenses resulted from independent and franchise acquisitions and increased marketing expenses related to the early season Sweepstakes promotion. This was partially offset by the decline in compensation and benefit expenses driven by the decrease in tax return volume. We completed the year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28%, which is in line with the guidance provided in the mid-season volume update. With the issuance of an additional $1 billion of long-term debt in September 2015 and the increased borrowings under our lines of credit, total interest expense for FY '16 was $69 million. This represented an increase of $24 million from the prior year. We were pleased that our effective tax rate decreased approximately 2 points to 32.6%, mainly due to favorable discrete items. Notwithstanding that, we expect our long-term base rate to be in the 35% to 36% range. Finally, the company's overall free cash flow for the year declined 14% to $432 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.59. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon's accrual for contingent losses related to representation of warranty claims was $65 million as of April 30. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil piercing arguments. 
Next, I'd like to discuss capital allocation. After divesting the bank last September, we returned to our historical practice of repurchasing shares and increasing our dividend. We repurchased 3.9 million shares during the fourth quarter, bringing our fiscal year total repurchases to 56.4 million shares or more than 20% of outstanding shares. We remain committed to returning capital through share repurchases and that we aren't going to discuss specific plans for this year. We will get more guidance later in the call.
Turning to leverage. We previously shared that we intend to maintain investment grade metrics. We believe that to do this, we need to maintain an adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5x to 3x. Based on this year's fiscal results, we are now in that range. As such, we don't plan to issue any incremental debt in the near term to finance share repurchases. We will continue to evaluate the appropriate debt level as part of our overall capital structure plans going forward. 
Regarding dividends, the Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend. This increase represents a bit of a catch-up, given our inability to increase the dividend during the past few years while we were regulated as a savings loan holding company. Going forward, we are committed to an annual review of our dividend after each fiscal year. Any decisions regarding future dividends will depend on our operating results, market conditions and capital needs, among other factors.
Turning to fiscal 2017, while we are focused on arresting the client decline, we have also completed a comprehensive review of our cost structure and implemented many of the cost reduction efforts Bill mentioned earlier. Because we are still in the planning process, we will provide more specifics for fiscal year 2017 at our investor conference in December.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill for final comments."

And to that end, I will not receive a performance bonus this year. Looking forward, my senior leaders and I are a very competitive group. We do not like to lose. We are smarter than we were at the beginning of the season and the lessons learned from tax season '16 will benefit us in the long range.

I think that it's very strategic in the response we have to take, but let me try to lay out where I think we are. One is I do think that we are in line with our competitors. I think with some independents, we are higher-priced. With our branded competitors in the assisted channels, we are beneath them. But I do think that we do have pockets of clients where it's clear that we're going to have to take a difficult approach to our pricing because I think that there are some value initiatives that we're going to have to look closely at on a surgical or strategic basis. I think having said all that, I do believe we still have the ability to take price increases, but I do think that they are going to be modest as we go forward."

So that -- and whether that's in '17, we're still modeling everything out, but the direction of my team has been to be very aggressive. 
On the executional front, and as I've said, I own this. I drove all of these initiatives. We missed on the sweepstakes. It underperformed. I don't think this is our best year in marketing. I think that from a sales perspective, I think our field team -- and everybody worked hard, everybody did their best, but we did not capture new clients at the rate that we have in the past. So I don't think our efforts at the local level were very strong. I think there were some executional hiccups also. And on the DIY side, while I think we're very pleased with our product performance and our reviews continue to show what a strong product we have that matches up very well with TurboTax, we just didn't -- the combination of marketing and really attracting new clients worked. 
I was talking to somebody recently and I said, normally in business, a few things hit and a few things miss and you hope you move ahead. And every once in a while, you hit on everything. Well, this was a perfect storm the wrong way. Virtually everything, whether it be foreign currency, the reset year with Bothe [ph], I mean, everything went the wrong way here. That's why I think, ultimately, this was a bad tax season. That's the way I'm approaching it. 
We are going to turn this around. We're going to fix this. But it was one bad season is the way I really look at it. I think in other seasons, we've had some plus and minus stuff, and we've been able to move forward with a credible result. This year, they were unacceptable.

On independents, I think a couple of things are at play there. You mentioned pricing. I think that has an impact. I think we -- as I said earlier, I think we need some more information on exactly what has happened there. It's tougher to get in the independent space. I think the lack of minimum standards, which I continue to talk about as one of our top 2 government relations initiative continues to hurt us because I think part of independents is fraudulent providers. But again, I don't want to spend a lot of time on fraud. Our -- we continue to work on our government relations initiatives. That is -- but we have to focus on executing better. So we need more analysis on the independent space. But obviously, we don't like to see them growing while we're not. 
With regard to retention. Our retention continues to be very strong. There was no change -- our issue this year was the lack of attraction of new clients. So we were not able to get the new client push that we've seen in the past, but our retention continues to be quite strong. And then finally, from an ACA perspective, I do think, frankly, we were surprised by this year's results. The number of enrollees had gone up almost 50% to 11.7 million. And frankly, we had very little change in the amount of clients that are impacted. Last year, we had 16% client impacted. This year was 15%. 
We did have more clients who were completing their premium tax credit, but to say that this was expected was -- is not true. We were surprised ourselves. 
I do want to say, though, a few things. One, the exchanges continue to grow. There's another million people enrolled in the exchanges this year. It's almost 13 million people enrolled in '16. I think the -- I think there has been some noncompliance, some checking of the boxes because IRS auditing efforts haven't begun. They're going to begin this summer. IRS is going to be able to match with all the 1095s to people who did not file correctly. So I think you will see more stepped-up awareness that the IRS is coming after this. I also think that with our focus on early season volumes, I think that is going to help us also. I think with our miss in the early season, it's hurt us on the ACA piece. So I believe that in the long-term this is still a tailwind for us. I think this is going to continue to grow. I think it's still going to be a positive for us. Frankly, I think we had a bump this year that we're a little surprised at, but I think in the long run, this is still a benefit to H&R Block."

When we left the bank in September and came out with our capital plan, we said we would talk about dividends at the time when we think it's appropriate, which is this -- which is every June.

We hadn't done it for almost 4 years so we thought it appropriate for us to do a 10% increase at this moment. That'll be effective with the dividend payable July 1. So that's what we announced today was a 10% increase, and then we'll have an annual review of the dividend every June."

It makes no sense to me. You heard me talk about this. So that's one piece that I think has impacted the assisted business and also the lack of minimum standards. So I think that's the other piece we talk about. Now I do think there are some things that are going to happen, not wishful thinking, that is going to help the assisted business and ultimately, I believe, help us. With the IRS moving to matching W-2 matching income, matching W-2s to tax returns that's going to come into place this year, that will have a positive impact on the assisted business. Also, as we talked about earlier with the PAT Act, with refunds being delayed through the middle of February, that can have a benefit to the assisted business if done in the right way. So I think there are some things that are going to -- start to happen that may lessen the impact of fraud on the assisted business. But at this point, I think it's still -- until those documentation requirements are equalized, I think we're -- it's tough for the assisted business."

Earlier today, we announced results for our fiscal 2017 first quarter, which ended July 31. As a reminder, given the highly seasonal nature of our business, the first quarter is not indicative of our performance for the full year. To put it in perspective, first quarter results typically represent less than 5% of our annual revenues and less than 15% of our annual expenses. Tony will walk you through the first quarter results in greater detail shortly. But overall, they were in line with our expectations. Our financial results of varied from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the increased interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt last September. With that context on the quarter, I will now spend a few minutes providing an update on our for the upcoming tax season. As I said during our call in June, our focus for tax season 2017 is to arrest the client decline, and I can assure you that the entire company's laser-focused on achieving this goal. To understand the drivers behind that client loss, we finalize data from the 2016 tax season. This more confirm that we relatively stable year-over-year and that our challenge remains attracting new clients. With greater competition both from aggressive offers in the industry and an increase in a number of independent tax payers, our value proposition struggle to resonate with new clients. With a better of the issue, we then evaluated all aspects of the business: products, promotions, pricing, marketing, service delivery, operational processes, everything. We have spent the summer developing a multifaceted plan to appeal to new clients. While we have developed for tax season 2017 will result in an H&R Block and that will look very different from what we've seen in the past several years. We will be aggressively going after clients in both the and the DIY categories. We will have compelling product offerings and an improved client experience that we believe clients will value. And we will make sure the marketing message appropriately communicates that value. Our marketing campaign will be fundamentally different from last year. Also we are making progress on our cost-reduction efforts. But given the nature of our business, we don't expect to realize a majority of those benefits until later in the fiscal year. And as we discussed in June, we intend to use a substantial portion of the savings to fund our operational objectives for the upcoming tax season. While I look forward to delivering a strong 2017 tax season, we will not sacrifice the long term health of the business to achieve short-term success. Rather, the changes we are implementing will further strengthen our overall value proposition. We remain a strong company with a history of delivering for our shareholders and I look forward to continuing this practice going forward. I am excited about the future of H&R Block and the opportunity to demonstrate strong performance for our clients and for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony to review the quarter's financial results."
276601,380738265,1040072,"H&R Block, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 30, 2016",2016-08-30,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results represent a small percentage of annual revenues and expenses and are not representative of our full year performance. With that as a backdrop, I would like to provide",509,"Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results represent a small percentage of annual revenues and expenses and are not representative of our full year performance. With that as a backdrop, I would like to provide additional context on the quarter. Revenues decreased $12.5 million to $125 million, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. This included a reclassification of our mortgage portfolio and present them to other income, the loss of investment income from available for sale securities and lower revenues resulting from payments to our third-party bank partner. Lower U.S. tax return volume and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations international businesses also negatively impacted revenues. 
Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses decreased $2 million to $310 million, primarily due to cost-reduction efforts, which were partially offset by occupancy cost and amortization expense related to franchise acquisitions in the prior year. Not included in operating expenses is interest expense, which increased $13 million from the prior year given the issuance of long-term debt in September 2015. Pretax loss increased $16 million to $203.5 million. The increase in pretax loss was driven by the increased interest expense and changes related to the divestiture of the bank. Excluding these 2 items, pretax loss would have improved $3 million compared to the prior year. Notwithstanding the changes discussed, EBITDA loss increased just $2.5 million to $141 million, and again, was entirely due to the bank divestiture. Income taxes were less favorable during the quarter due to the discrete tax benefits we recognized during Q1 of the prior year. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be in the 35% to 36% range. 
Finally, our loss per share increased $0.20 to $0.55. Approximately half of this increase was due to the reduction in share count, which will accretive on a full year basis, but negatively impacts those quarters in which we have a net loss. The remainder of the change in loss per share was due to the increase in pretax loss mentioned earlier. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon's representation in accrual decreased $40 million from the prior quarter to $26 million as a result of a settlement with The settlement was fully covered by existing accruals. As a reminder, sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate arguments. 
Turning to our capital structure. We repurchased an additional 2 million shares during our first quarter at an aggregate price of $48.6 million, bringing total repurchases under the current $3.5 billion authorization to over $2 billion. There are number of factors that impact our share repurchase decisions including our financial position, market conditions, block-out periods and operational considerations. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and going forward, we continue to be opportunistic in our approach. With that, I will now turn the call back over to believe for some closing comments."

We did do a number of other cost-reduction efforts, which we're seeing further benefit in Q1, but there was a couple of numbers going against us. We had some amortization as well as some additional rents we were paying on behalf of our franchise buybacks from deals that we did last year, that are now impacting us in Q1. We also have some payments that we're making to our bank partner as for that transaction. So those are all just moving and wrong direction. And despite that, we did reduce our operating excesses about $2 million during Q1. So the other point to add on is, there are some of the cost-reduction efforts are going to be more impactful during the tax season. We are still deciding which of those cost reductions are going to be reinvesting in the business. But given the nature of where 75% of our revenue and a significant amount of our expense comes in Q4, there is going to be a delay to some of our cost reductions."

Earlier today, we announced results for our fiscal 2017 first quarter, which ended July 31.

Earlier today, we announced results for our fiscal 2017 first quarter, which ended July 31. As a reminder, given the highly seasonable nature of our business, the first quarter is not indicative of our performance for the full year. To put it in perspective, first quarter results typically represent less than 5% of our annual revenues and less than 15% of our annual expenses. Tony will walk you through the first quarter results in greater detail shortly. But overall, they were in line with our expectations. Our financial results varied from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the increased interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt last September. 
With that context on the quarter, I'll now spend a few minutes providing an update on our preparations for the upcoming tax season. As I shared during our call in June, our focus for tax season 2017 is to arrest the client decline, and I can assure you that the entire company is laser-focused on achieving this goal. To understand the drivers behind that client loss, we've analyzed data from the 2016 tax season. This more confirm that we maintain relatively stable retention rates year-over-year and that our challenge remains attracting new clients. With greater competition, both from aggressive offers in the industry and an increase in the number of independent tax preparers, our value proposition struggle to resonate with new clients. With a better understanding of the issue, we then evaluated all aspects of the business: products, promotions, pricing, marketing, service delivery, operational processes, everything. We have spent the summer developing a multifaceted plan to appeal to new clients. While we have developed for tax season 2017 will result in an H&R Block that will look very different from what you've seen in the past several years. We will be aggressively going after clients in both the assisted and the DIY categories. We will have compelling product offers and an improved client experience that we believe clients will value. And we will make sure the marketing message appropriately communicates that value. Our marketing campaign will be fundamentally different from last year. Also, we are making progress on our cost-reduction efforts. But given the nature of our business, we don't expect to realize a majority of those benefits until later in the fiscal year. 
And as we discussed in June, we intend to use a substantial portion of the savings to fund our operational objectives for the upcoming tax season. While I look forward to delivering a strong 2017 tax season, we will not sacrifice the long-term health of the business to achieve short-term success. Rather, the changes we're implementing will further strengthen our overall value proposition. We remain a strong company with a history of delivering for our shareholders, and I look forward to continuing this practice going forward. I am excited about the future of H&R Block and the opportunity to demonstrate strong performance for our clients and for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony to review the quarter's financial results."
276601,380738265,1040100,"H&R Block, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 30, 2016",2016-08-30,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results represent a small percentage of our annual revenues and expenses and are not representative of our full year performance. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to provide",515,"Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results represent a small percentage of our annual revenues and expenses and are not representative of our full year performance. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to provide additional context on the quarter. Revenues decreased $12.5 million to $125 million, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. This included a reclassification of mortgage portfolio interest income to other income, the loss of investment income from available-for-sale securities and lower Emerald Card revenues resulting from payments to our third-party bank partner. Lower U.S. tax return volume and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our international businesses also negatively impacted revenues. 
Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses decreased $2 million to $310 million, primarily due to cost-reduction efforts, which were partially offset by occupancy cost and amortization expense related to franchise acquisitions in the prior year. Not included in operating expenses is interest expense, which increased $13 million from the prior year due to the issuance of long-term debt in September 2015. Pretax loss increased $16 million to $203.5 million. The increase in pretax loss was driven by the increased interest expense and changes related to the divestiture of the bank. Excluding these 2 items, pretax loss would have improved $3 million compared to the prior year. Notwithstanding the changes discussed, EBITDA loss increased just $2.5 million to $141 million, and again, was entirely due to the bank divestiture. Income taxes were less favorable during the quarter due to the discrete tax benefits we recognized during Q1 of the prior year. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be in the 35% to 36% range. 
Finally, our loss per share increased $0.20 to $0.55. Approximately half of this increase was due to the reduction in share count, which will be accretive on a full year basis, but negatively impacts those quarters in which we have a net loss. The remainder of the change in loss per share was due to the increase in pretax loss mentioned earlier. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon's representation in warranty accrual decreased $40 million from the prior quarter to $26 million as a result of a settlement with a counterparty. The settlement was fully covered by existing accruals. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil piercing arguments. 
Turning to our capital structure. We repurchased an additional 2 million shares during our first quarter at an aggregate price of $48.6 million, bringing total repurchases under the current $3.5 billion authorization to over $2 billion. There are number of factors that impact our share repurchase decisions, including our financial position, market conditions, block-out periods and operational considerations. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and going forward, we continue to be opportunistic in our approach. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for some closing comments."

This is the right decision. It is essential that we remain focused on flawlessly executing our plan for the upcoming tax season, and it also saves us the money, which is always a good thing. With that, we are now ready for questions. Mariama?"

I think, you're asking about how many positions we reduced as part of the cost-reduction effort that we went through last April. So we did reduce by about 250 full-time positions both at our corporate offices as well as in our field. So those are essentially behind us. We did do a number of other cost-reduction efforts, which we're seeing further benefit in Q1, but there was a couple of numbers going against this. We had some amortization as well as some additional rents that we're paying on behalf of our franchise buybacks from deals we did last year, that are now impacting us in Q1. We also have some payments that we're making to our bank partner as part of that transaction. So those are all essentially moving in the wrong direction. And despite that, we did reduce our operating expenses about $2 million during Q1. So the other point to add on though is, there are some of the cost-reduction efforts that are going to be more impactful during the tax season. We are still deciding which of those cost reductions are going to be reinvesting in the business. But given the nature of where 75% of our revenue and a significant amount of our expense comes in Q4, there is going to be a delay to some of our cost reductions."

Earlier today, we announced results for our fiscal 2017 first quarter, which ended July 31.

Earlier today, we announced results for our fiscal 2017 first quarter, which ended July 31. As a reminder, given the highly seasonable nature of our business, the first quarter is not indicative of our performance for the full year. To put it in perspective, first quarter results typically represent less than 5% of our annual revenues and less than 15% of our annual expenses. Tony will walk you through the first quarter results in greater detail shortly. But overall, they were in line with our expectations. Our financial results varied from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the increased interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt last September. 
With that context on the quarter, I'll now spend a few minutes providing an update on our preparations for the upcoming tax season. As I shared during our call in June, our focus for tax season 2017 is to arrest the client decline, and I can assure you that the entire company is laser-focused on achieving this goal. To understand the drivers behind the client loss, we have analyzed data from the 2016 tax season. This work confirmed that we maintain relatively stable retention rates year-over-year and that our challenge remains attracting new clients. With greater competition, both from aggressive offers in the industry and an increase in the number of independent tax preparers, our value proposition struggled to resonate with new clients. With a better understanding of the issue, we then evaluated all aspects of the business: products, promotions, pricing, marketing, service delivery, operational processes, everything. We have spent the summer developing a multifaceted plan to appeal to new clients. What we have developed for tax season 2017 will result in an H&R Block that will look very different from what you've seen in the past several years. We will be aggressively going after clients in both the assisted and the DIY categories. We will have compelling product offers and an improved client experience that we believe clients will value. And we will make sure the marketing message appropriately communicates that value. Our marketing campaign will be fundamentally different from last year. Also, we are making progress on our cost-reduction efforts. But given the nature of our business, we don't expect to realize a majority of those benefits until later in the fiscal year. 
And as we discussed in June, we intend to use a substantial portion of the savings to fund our operational objectives for the upcoming tax season. While I look forward to delivering a strong 2017 tax season, we will not sacrifice the long-term health of the business to achieve short-term success. Rather, the changes we're implementing will further strengthen our overall value proposition. We remain a strong company with a history of delivering for our shareholders, and I look forward to continuing this practice going forward. I am excited about the future of H&R Block and the opportunity to demonstrate strong performance for our clients and for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony to review the quarter's financial results."
276601,380738265,1040116,"H&R Block, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 30, 2016",2016-08-30,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results represent a small percentage of our annual revenues and expenses and are not representative of our full year performance. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to provide",515,"Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results represent a small percentage of our annual revenues and expenses and are not representative of our full year performance. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to provide additional context on the quarter. Revenues decreased $12.5 million to $125 million, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. This included a reclassification of mortgage portfolio interest income to other income, the loss of investment income from available-for-sale securities and lower Emerald Card revenues resulting from payments to our third-party bank partner. Lower U.S. tax return volume and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our international businesses also negatively impacted revenues. 
Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses decreased $2 million to $310 million, primarily due to cost-reduction efforts, which were partially offset by occupancy cost and amortization expense related to franchise acquisitions in the prior year. Not included in operating expenses is interest expense, which increased $13 million from the prior year due to the issuance of long-term debt in September 2015. Pretax loss increased $16 million to $203.5 million. The increase in pretax loss was driven by the increased interest expense and changes related to the divestiture of the bank. Excluding these 2 items, pretax loss would have improved $3 million compared to the prior year. Notwithstanding the changes discussed, EBITDA loss increased just $2.5 million to $141 million, and again, was entirely due to the bank divestiture. Income taxes were less favorable during the quarter due to the discrete tax benefits we recognized during Q1 of the prior year. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be in the 35% to 36% range. 
Finally, our loss per share increased $0.20 to $0.55. Approximately half of this increase was due to the reduction in share count, which will be accretive on a full year basis, but negatively impacts those quarters in which we have a net loss. The remainder of the change in loss per share was due to the increase in pretax loss mentioned earlier. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon's representation in warranty accrual decreased $40 million from the prior quarter to $26 million as a result of a settlement with a counterparty. The settlement was fully covered by existing accruals. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil piercing arguments. 
Turning to our capital structure. We repurchased an additional 2 million shares during our first quarter at an aggregate price of $48.6 million, bringing total repurchases under the current $3.5 billion authorization to over $2 billion. There are number of factors that impact our share repurchase decisions, including our financial position, market conditions, blackout periods and operational considerations. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and going forward, we'll continue to be opportunistic in our approach. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for some closing comments."

Historically, we have held an investor conference in December in conjunction with the release of our second quarter results. Given our stated objective of arresting the client decline and the work it will take to get there, it's imperative that the management team stay focused on executing against this goal. Additionally, we will not reveal the majority of changes we are implementing in advance of the tax season given the industry's competitive environment. Thus, we will not be holding an investor conference this year. That said, we will include guidance on a select number of financial metrics during our second quarter call in December. This is the right decision. It is essential that we remain focused on flawlessly executing our plan for the upcoming tax season, and it also saves us some money, which is always a good thing.

But I think, you're asking about how many positions we reduced as part of the cost-reduction effort that we went through last April. So we did reduce by about 250 full-time positions, both at our corporate offices as well as in our field. So those are essentially behind us. We did do a number of other cost-reduction efforts, which you're seeing further benefit in Q1, but there was a couple of numbers going against this. We had some amortization as well as some additional rent that we're paying on behalf of our franchise buybacks from deals we did last year, that are now impacting us in Q1. We also have some payments that we're making to our bank partner as part of that transaction. So those are all essentially moving in the wrong direction. And despite that, we did reduce our operating expenses about $2 million during Q1. So the other point to add on though is, there are some of the cost-reduction efforts that are going to be more impactful during the tax season. We are still deciding which of those cost reductions we're going to be reinvesting in the business. But given the nature of where 75% of our revenue and a significant amount of our expense comes in Q4, there is going to be a delay to some of our cost reductions."

Earlier today, we announced results for our fiscal 2017 first quarter, which ended July 31.

Earlier today, we announced results for our fiscal 2017 first quarter, which ended July 31. As a reminder, given the highly seasonable nature of our business, the first quarter is not indicative of our performance for the full year. To put it in perspective, first quarter results typically represent less than 5% of our annual revenues and less than 15% of our annual expenses. Tony will walk you through the first quarter results in greater detail shortly. But overall, they were in line with our expectations. Our financial results varied from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the increased interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt last September. 
With that context on the quarter, I'll now spend a few minutes providing an update on our preparations for the upcoming tax season. As I shared during our call in June, our focus for tax season 2017 is to arrest the client decline, and I can assure you that the entire company is laser-focused on achieving this goal. To understand the drivers behind the client loss, we have analyzed data from the 2016 tax season. This work confirmed that we maintain relatively stable retention rates year-over-year and that our challenge remains attracting new clients. With greater competition, both from aggressive offers in the industry and an increase in the number of independent tax preparers, our value proposition struggled to resonate with new clients. With a better understanding of the issue, we then evaluated all aspects of the business: products, promotions, pricing, marketing, service delivery, operational processes, everything. We have spent the summer developing a multifaceted plan to appeal to new clients. What we have developed for tax season 2017 will result in an H&R Block that will look very different from what you've seen in the past several years. We will be aggressively going after clients in both the assisted and the DIY categories. We will have compelling product offers and an improved client experience that we believe clients will value. And we will make sure the marketing message appropriately communicates that value. Our marketing campaign will be fundamentally different from last year. Also, we are making progress on our cost-reduction efforts. But given the nature of our business, we don't expect to realize a majority of those benefits until later in the fiscal year. 
And as we discussed in June, we intend to use a substantial portion of the savings to fund our operational objectives for the upcoming tax season. While I look forward to delivering a strong 2017 tax season, we will not sacrifice the long-term health of the business to achieve short-term success. Rather, the changes we're implementing will further strengthen our overall value proposition. We remain a strong company with a history of delivering for our shareholders, and I look forward to continuing this practice going forward. I am excited about the future of H&R Block and the opportunity to demonstrate strong performance for our clients and for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony to review the quarter's financial results."
276601,380738265,1040277,"H&R Block, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 30, 2016",2016-08-30,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results represent a small percentage of our annual revenues and expenses and are not representative of our full year performance. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to provide",515,"Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results represent a small percentage of our annual revenues and expenses and are not representative of our full year performance. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to provide additional context on the quarter. Revenues decreased $12.5 million to $125 million, primarily due to the impact of the divestiture of H&R Block Bank. This included a reclassification of mortgage portfolio interest income to other income, the loss of investment income from available-for-sale securities and lower Emerald Card revenues resulting from payments to our third-party bank partner. Lower U.S. tax return volume and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in our international businesses also negatively impacted revenues. 
Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses decreased $2 million to $310 million, primarily due to cost-reduction efforts, which were partially offset by occupancy cost and amortization expense related to franchise acquisitions in the prior year. Not included in operating expenses is interest expense, which increased $13 million from the prior year due to the issuance of long-term debt in September 2015. Pretax loss increased $16 million to $203.5 million. The increase in pretax loss was driven by the increased interest expense and changes related to the divestiture of the bank. Excluding these 2 items, pretax loss would have improved $3 million compared to the prior year. Notwithstanding the changes discussed, EBITDA loss increased just $2.5 million to $141 million, and again, was entirely due to the bank divestiture. Income taxes were less favorable during the quarter due to the discrete tax benefits we recognized during Q1 of the prior year. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be in the 35% to 36% range. 
Finally, our loss per share increased $0.20 to $0.55. Approximately half of this increase was due to the reduction in share count, which will be accretive on a full year basis, but negatively impacts those quarters in which we have a net loss. The remainder of the change in loss per share was due to the increase in pretax loss mentioned earlier. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon's representation in warranty accrual decreased $40 million from the prior quarter to $26 million as a result of a settlement with a counterparty. The settlement was fully covered by existing accruals. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is and always has been operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil piercing arguments. 
Turning to our capital structure. We repurchased an additional 2 million shares during our first quarter at an aggregate price of $48.6 million, bringing total repurchases under the current $3.5 billion authorization to over $2 billion. There are number of factors that impact our share repurchase decisions, including our financial position, market conditions, blackout periods and operational considerations. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and going forward, we'll continue to be opportunistic in our approach. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for some closing comments."

But I think, you're asking about how many positions we reduced as part of the cost-reduction effort that we went through last April. So we did reduce by about 250 full-time positions, both at our corporate offices as well as in our field. So those are essentially behind us. We did do a number of other cost-reduction efforts, which you're seeing further benefit in Q1, but there was a couple of numbers going against this. We had some amortization as well as some additional rent that we're paying on behalf of our franchise buybacks from deals we did last year, that are now impacting us in Q1. We also have some payments that we're making to our bank partner as part of that transaction. So those are all essentially moving in the wrong direction. And despite that, we did reduce our operating expenses about $2 million during Q1. So the other point to add on though is, there are some of the cost-reduction efforts that are going to be more impactful during the tax season. We are still deciding which of those cost reductions we're going to be reinvesting in the business. But given the nature of where 75% of our revenue and a significant amount of our expense comes in Q4, there is going to be a delay to some of our cost reductions."

So we're going to essentially have that year-over-year variance behind us after we move out of Q1. We'll still have about a month in Q2, but most of it will be behind us.

Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP figures in the schedules attached to our press release.
Before we begin our prepared remarks, I will remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements as defined under the securities laws. Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.

H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements.
At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we'll have a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill."

I am extremely excited for the upcoming tax season, and as we shared some of our plans today, I will hope you will be as well. 
I am proud of my leadership team and the dedication and tenacity they have shown coming off a challenging season. We have been hard at work developing and implementing a comprehensive and aggressive plan designed to deliver stronger results in tax season '17. That same spirit and dedication is echoed in the thousands of hard-working associates throughout H&R Block. I am now entering my sixth tax season, and the level of enthusiasm displayed for the upcoming season is the best I have seen. I recently attended our company and franchise conventions and was motivated by the energy level of the attendees. We are all ready to deliver.
Before diving into why we're energized for the upcoming season, I'd like to outline what we intend to cover during today's call. First, we will have a short discussion about our second quarter results. Then I'll provide some thoughts around how we will define success in both the short and long term. Next, I will share some key elements of our plans for the upcoming tax season. Tony will then review our second quarter financial results and our financial outlook for fiscal year '17. And finally, I will close out with thoughts on why we believe H&R Block is such a compelling investment.
With that, let's talk about our second quarter results. Overall, we're on track with our financial plans, and Q2 results were in line with our expectations. We are pleased to report an increase in revenue and an improvement in both operating expenses and our pretax loss. Now that we have hit the halfway point of the fiscal year, we are starting to realize some of the benefits of our previously announced cost-reduction efforts, which will not be fully realized until year-end. And with our plans for this tax season now set, we have identified the areas in which we'll invest to be successful. Tony will talk more about this later.
I'm also pleased to discuss some good news in the fight against tax fraud. The public-private collaboration through the IRS security Summit made a positive impact last year, as demonstrated by a decrease of over 50% in the number of new people reporting stolen identities on federal tax returns. We will continue to make progress this season through stronger authentication measures in the DIY category and better information sharing among tax software providers. 
In addition, the Protecting American from Tax Hikes, or PATH Act, will take effect this season. The IRS will now have additional time to review tax returns containing the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit before processing refunds. While this will delay refunds for as many as 15 million tax filers until late February, it will help cut down on inaccurate or fraudulent returns, which is something we fully support.
So there has been a great amount of progress in the fight against tax fraud, but the work is far from complete. As an example, taxpayer safeguards, such as minimum standards for return preparers, have not yet been implemented. We will continue to advocate for the honest taxpayer in this fight.
While we're talking about the industry, let me address something many of you have been asking about the past few weeks, the recent election results. First, we congratulate President-elect Trump on his election victory. We look forward to working with Congress and the President-elect's team in the coming months. Some within the investment community committee have expressed concern about the possible negative implications for H&R Block that might result from the new administration's policies. I'd like to take a moment to provide an alternative viewpoint to these concerns. 
Like you, we have been listening closely to the comments of the President-elect and his nominees for key cabinet positions. Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin has talked about the desire to lower corporate tax rates and to have a middle-class tax cut that includes increased Child Tax Credits and other rebates. There's also been discussion of limiting mortgages and charitable deductions and raising standard deductions. So as you can tell, there are a lot of moving parts. 
On the Affordable Care Act, Health and Human Services nominee Congressman Tom Price has talked about repealing the ACA and replacing it with a new program that could include refundable credits. The President-elect is on record for wanting to retain certain aspects of the ACA, such as coverage for dependent children up to age 26 and covering people with preexisting conditions. It's also our understanding that any proposed changes will not impact this tax season, and as media are reporting, they may not be effective for 2 or 3 more years. While there are many questions about changes to the ACA, we don't expect there to be a material impact to H&R Block, regardless of the outcome. 
Finally, potential changes to the corporate tax rate, specifically reducing the rate to as low as 15%, could be a significant benefit for H&R Block. Given our historical effective tax rates in the mid-30% range, such reductions would have a material positive impact on our net income and cash flow.
So as you can tell, the dialogue on tax policies [indiscernible]. Mostly, what we've heard is from the incoming administration, but Congress will have a great deal to say too. Regardless of the outcome, people will still need help to sort through the changes and the impact on their taxes. Thus, I'm absolutely certain of one thing, taxpayers will continue to need and want H&R Block's help. The tax code was much simpler when this company began in 1955. People wanted our help then, just as they will in the future. We remain laser focused on helping our clients this coming season, the season after that and for many years to come.
Shifting gears, let me talk about our plan for the future, specifically focusing on defining what success means to H&R Block. Ultimately, return volume is key to how we will measure success. We understand this and are focused on addressing recent client losses, but this is not something that can be solved in one season. To that end, we would like to share you with how we're defining success in both the short and long term. 
In the short term, we're focused on arresting the client decline. In our assisted business, given the losses we've experienced over the last several years, it is unrealistic to think that, in 1 year, we'll be able to move from losing clients to client growth. We believe, however, that we will be able to significantly reduce the client loss this year as we move toward client growth in the future. And for our DIY business, we do consider last year's performance to be an anomaly as we were able to successfully grow clients for 5 consecutive years prior to last tax season.
In the long term, our goal is to grow clients in both the assisted and the DIY categories. To accomplish this, we're approaching assisted tax preparation in a different way, by focusing on enhancing our client service delivery model, which really hasn't changed much in decades. In DIY, we made significant progress in our user experience over the last several years, as validated by the strong independent reviews we received last tax season. We're building on this progress by adding more client-friendly features designed to improve the DIY tax preparation experience. 
While the objectives I just outlined center on arresting the client decline this tax season and growing clients in the long term, they must be accomplished while maintaining our financial health. We are a financially sound company with enviable margins, strong free cash flow and a solid balance sheet, and we intend to stay that way.
So let's talk more specifically about the changes we're making to achieve this success. We've been hard at work this preseason developing a winning approach for tax season '17, which includes changes in all customer-facing areas of the business including our sales and service model, promotion, pricing and products and market. I'll now talk specifically about each of these areas, providing details on what we plan to do and how we believe these plans will translate into results.
Let's start first with sales and service. After last season, it was clear that changes at the office level were necessary. This included a new approach at the local level regarding how we attract our clients and improvements at the tax desk or how we serve our clients. Ultimately, it was time for cultural changes in both areas. 
From a sales perspective, we have spent the preseason emphasizing with our deal management and associates that not only is delivering excellent service important but that they are also the best sales agents for our brand. We have provided trading opportunities to enhance their sales skills, develop new sales programs, including a B2B sales plan in which we're partnering with local and national businesses and hired experienced sales managers to further the sales culture. Our field leadership has been energized by this new approach, and I am extremely pleased with the level of engagement we've seen today. 
So while that addresses how we can drive client volume at the local level, we also recognize that we need to enhance the client experience once they are in our offices. Our service delivery model hasn't changed significantly in decades, and we felt it was time to deliver a fresh new approach to tax preparation. We know from our market research that consumers want a more dynamic, personalized and engaging experience, which we intend to deliver. We expect most of those changes to the client experience to occur in the second half of the season. So you'll hear more about this later this fiscal year.
In addition to instilling a sales and service mentality, we've also addressed gaps in our product and pricing strategies this off-season with a particular focus on early-season assisted clients and DIY tax filers. I'll address our 3 most significant efforts in these areas: the Refund Advance, our free Federal 1040EZ promotion and free DIY. 
Starting with the Refund Advance. Early-season clients typically have a compelling need for cash and want to access their tax refund faster than the customary 2 to 3 weeks. The impact of the PATH Act make further increases need as refunds for over 15 million early-season filers will be delayed until late February. In tax season 2017, H&R Block's Refund Advance will directly meet that need. The Refund Advance is a no-interest, no-fee loan that provides our clients quicker access to their cash. We work hard with our bank partners to develop a program that will be seamless for the client, built into the tax synergy and will provide the best product and service experience available. Tony will cover the details of this offer later during his remarks. 
The next offer on our lineup is the reintroduction of our free federal 1040EZ promotion in our retail offices. The market is not the same as it was when we last offered this promotion. Specifically, the competitive landscape and the fight to attract simple tax returns has changed dramatically over the past couple of years with the introduction of numerous DIY free product offerings. For similar returns, free is now the norm rather than the exception. That said, we believe that there are tax filers using a free DIY products who would prefer assistance but are swayed by the free offers in the digital space. The free federal 1040EZ offer will address those taxpayers' needs, providing tremendous value and driving filers to our offices during the early part of the tax season.
Finally, given the changes in the DIY category, we recognize that to compete, we had to reevaluate our pricing structure. Last year, our product lineup and pricing did not align well with the competition. As such, we have made changes to our product line and are now offering a free federal, free straight -- free state product for 1040EZ and 1040A returns. But it's not just about the offer. We're also stepping up our game in terms of the product. We're excited about the new features and capabilities we will offer, such as the ability to easily import last year's tax return from any other tax preparation service or provider or the capability to take a picture of your W-2 to easily import your information and get started quickly. With a user experience that can stand up to any in the DIY category and the right products at the right price, we believe we can achieve DIY client growth this season. 
Now that we have discussed our approach to sales and service and our pricing and product changes for this season, I'll mention a few things about our marketing efforts. We know that last year, our message missed the mark and did not yield desired results. Thus, we spent the preseason working to ensure that we better understood the value that clients are seeking and aligning our value proposition accordingly. What you will see is a more cohesive marketing approach for H&R Block with a new look, a new tone and a new value proposition that will appeal to tax filers. Additionally, we will more efficiently allocate our resources. We've eliminated programs that were not yielding results. In tax season '17, we will have lower marketing expense overall, but it will be spent more effectively. We will communicate our new assisted products and promotions timely and loudly, and our messaging will be stronger in our DIY business with a goal of driving awareness and highlighting our value proposition in that category. 
So I covered a lot of ground describing our vision of success and the changes we're making to achieve our objectives. I'll now turn the call over to Tony to talk about the details of the second quarter look -- second quarter results and to provide a financial view of the upcoming season."
276601,410255769,1099073,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 07, 2016",2016-12-07,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let me start by taking a few minutes to review the results of the second quarter. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of our business, the results in the second quarter are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Additionally,",1893,"Thanks, Bill. Let me start by taking a few minutes to review the results of the second quarter. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of our business, the results in the second quarter are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Additionally, this will be the last time in which year-over-year comparisons for the quarter are impacted by the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the capital structure changes, which occurred last year. 
In the quarter, revenues increased approximately 2% to $131 million, primarily driven by foreign exchange in our international operations as well as improved product revenue in the U.S. Total operating expenses decreased from the prior year by $23 million or 6% due primarily to onetime cost of $21 million incurred in the prior year related to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and our capital structure changes. Even excluding this impact, operating expenses declined due to our cost-reduction efforts, which were mainly realized through lower compensation and benefits. Partially offsetting these reductions were occupancy and amortization expenses related to franchise and independent acquisitions in the prior year. The favorability in revenues and operating expenses were partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of the long-term debt issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and prior year gain on sale of securities. Netting all of the changes, pretax loss improved 4% or $9 million. 
Our income tax benefit was lower in the quarter primarily due to a lower base tax rate. As a reminder, a reduction on our tax rate will be beneficial for the full fiscal year but reduces the benefit in quarters in which we record a loss. I'll provide additional thoughts on our income tax rate when discussing our outlook for the fiscal year.
Finally, loss per share increased $0.13 to $0.67, which was entirely due to the reduction in share count as a result of our share repurchases over the last 12 months. As a reminder, in quarters with a loss, reducing the share count negatively impact the loss per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet, there are a couple of areas I'd like to highlight. You may recall that H&R Block Bank owned a mortgage portfolio to satisfy regulatory requirements. When we divested the bank, we decided to retain the mortgage portfolio as market conditions were not favorable at the time. Given improving market conditions, we have now decided to sell this noncore asset and have moved mortgage loans held for investment to held for sale. We expect to complete the sale in the fiscal third quarter and receive cash proceeds of approximately $190 million, which is above current book value of $183 million. This allows us to streamline the balance sheet and accelerate cash flow, which we will fold into our overall capital allocation approach. 
In the second quarter, we also continued to take advantage of the current share price, repurchasing 7.6 million shares at a total cost of $168 million. In total, we repurchased 9.6 million shares for $217 million in fiscal year 2017. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing shares as a component of our overall capital allocation strategy. 
As we look forward to tax season 2017, we're very excited about our new offerings. Following the announcement in late October regarding our Refund Advance product, many of you have inquired about how the product will work for the consumer and what the financial implications are for H&R Block. 
So I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the details. The Refund Advance is an interest-free, no-fee loan available to our assisted tax preparation clients. We have partnered with our existing bank partner BofI and MetaBank to offer this consumer-friendly product. From an operational perspective, we feel it is important to make the application and approval process as easy as possible for our clients. 
To obtain the loan, the client completes the application at the tax desk during the preparation of their tax return. The tax professional then submit the loan application electronically to MetaBank for loan decision. Loans will be made in the amounts of $500, $750 or $1,250, and most approved clients will have funds loaded onto their Emerald Cards within 24 hours. This will be a seamless process for our clients. 
H&R Block will pay a fee of $32 to $36 on average for each loan, which is intended to cover loan origination fees, servicing cost and expected losses among other items. The fees will be recorded as a cost of revenue and will not be passed along to our clients, either upfront or on the back end. Franchisees will pay H&R Block a royalty for each loan at an amount slightly lower than the fee H&R Block is paying BofI and MetaBank. 
And while Refund Advance will not directly increase revenues, it will provide a tangible benefit to our clients and positive -- positively contribute to Emerald Card revenue and volume. Ultimately, the financial results of the program will be dependent on the number and mix of clients electing to take a Refund Advance. 
One final note. To ensure we have the appropriate level of funding in place, we have secured an additional $200 million of capacity from our Refund Advance partners under the same economic terms as the original agreement. This brings our total available funds under this program to $1.65 billion. We're excited to offer this valuable product that will appeal to many early-season assisted tax filers. 
Turning to our financial outlook, let's start by discussing return volume and pricing. As Bill mentioned, we don't expect to grow assisted return volume this tax season, but we have the right strategy in place to deliver client growth over the long term. We do, however, expect to significantly reduce the client loss this tax season. 
With regards to assisted pricing, let me walk through some of the specifics. Given the changes in the competitive landscape we discussed earlier, free has become the new norm for the simple tax return. As Bill mentioned, we will be offering the free federal 1040EZ promotion in the early part of the tax season. Other forms in our assisted business will see moderate price increases, recognizing we cannot expect -- or expect to arrest the client decline and ultimately grow clients while aggressively increasing price. We expect these changes to result in a flat to slightly down net average charge in our assisted business when compared to the prior year. 
Turning to our DIY business. We believe that last year was an anomaly. And with the enhancements to the user experience, changes in pricing and increased awareness, we can grow clients this tax season and beyond. In terms of DIY pricing, our approach the past couple of years [indiscernible] market leader. For example, our free products did not include EITC or a free state return. In tax season 2017, we will be more aggressive in our approach, which will require modifications to our product lineup. By making changes, such as including EITC in our free product, we will better align with other providers in the marketplace and appeal to more DIY tax filers. 
The changes to our product lineup, coupled with our free federal, free state promotion that Bill discussed, will result in a lower overall net average charge this season for our DIY business. This essentially represents a bit of a reset year for us with regard to pricing, especially in our DIY business. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate the optimal pricing model to achieve client growth while not sacrificing the overall financial health of the business. These pricing changes, coupled with our promotional efforts, including the Refund Advance, will make us more competitive in both the short and long term. 
Turning to EBITDA. To offset the incremental expense of these initiatives, we have announced cost -- we announced cost-reduction efforts in June. I am pleased that as a result, we will continue to maintain a healthy EBITDA margin. When considering these changes as well as the ongoing impact of the bank transaction, we're setting our expected long-term EBITDA margin at 27% to 30%. We anticipate fiscal year 2017 to come in at the lower end of this range, which is comparable to last year's adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.6%. 
I'll now move through other areas of our financial states. Starting with CapEx, we're capital-light with minimal investment needed to run our business successfully. After peaking in fiscal year 2014 due to needed office improvements, CapEx levels have moderated to levels we would expect for the foreseeable future. In fiscal '17, we expect CapEx of approximately $90 million to $95 million. Long term, we expect CapEx to run at approximately 3% to 4% of revenues. 
In regards to acquisitions, over the past 2 years, we have purchased approximately 600 locations that were previously franchised. These acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our trading multiples and, as such, are accretive to earnings. As we've discussed in previous calls, however, the opportunity for franchise acquisitions will moderate while we expect to continue similar levels of independent acquisitions. We anticipate closing out the year having repurchased approximately 145 franchise locations and acquiring 65 independent locations for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $60 million. 
Moving to depreciation and amortization. Given the level of franchise repurchases and capital expenditures, we anticipate fiscal year '17 to be the peak year at approximately $175 million to $180 million. In general, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is CapEx-related while the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. 
In regards to capital structure, you recall -- you'll recall that last year, we made significant changes, issuing long-term debt and putting into place our $2 billion line of credit. I'm pleased that we were able to extend the maturity date of the line of credit an additional year to September 21. And regarding our overall level of debt, we continue to target adjusted gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA levels of 2.5 to 3x and are currently within that range. We believe this will help us achieve our stated objective of maintaining investment-grade credit ratings metrics. Following these capital structure changes last fiscal year, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million. 
In regards to share repurchases, the year-to-date weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter was approximately 218 million shares. This number will decline on a full year basis due to the weighted average share calculation as our shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were approximately 212 million. As I mentioned earlier, going forward, we will continue to purchase shares opportunistically and have approximately $1.3 billion of our $3.5 billion share repurchase authorization remain. 
Finally, we continue to do a lot of work around our corporate taxes, and going forward, we expect our long-term effective tax rate to be approximately 34% to 36% with fiscal year 2017 coming in at the low end of this range. Note that this range does not consider any implications of future corporate tax reform, which, as Bill mentioned, would likely be positive for the company. 
I'm excited about what we have in store for this upcoming tax season and beyond, and I look forward to sharing the results with you after the third quarter.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for some closing comments."
276601,410255769,1099073,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 07, 2016",2016-12-07,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. I thought it was important to share all that detail regarding our plans and outlook, so thanks again, Tony.

I thought it was important to share all that detail regarding our plans and outlook, so thanks again, Tony. 
Before I conclude, I want to address the personnel change that we just announced in an 8-K filed this afternoon. Greg Macfarlane, our Senior Vice President of U.S. Retail Operations and Products, has decided to leave the company at the end of this month. Earlier this year, he transitioned to an operating role and performed as his usual high level, as evidenced by his many contributions to our tax season readiness. He will be missed, but we have a strong bench of leaders who are ready to seamlessly take over Greg's responsibilities and execute our plans in season. Personally, I want to thank Greg for his leadership over the past 4.5 years in both this current role and, previously, as our CFO. I am grateful for his many contributions and his friendship. We wish Greg all the best as he pursues the next phase of his career.
Now I'd like to wrap up by spending a few minutes discussing why we believe H&R Block is a strong long-term investment. H&R Block offers investors an opportunity for growth, value and stability. We participate in an industry that offers predictable and consistent growth. Tax filings in the U.S. has historically grown that 1% to 2%, and we expect that to continue. Our Tax Plus products contributed over $400 million of revenue in fiscal year '16 and our differentiator in the marketplace. While the addition of the Refund Advance product does not generate stand-alone revenue. It is expected to positively impact line volumes and increase the usage of other key products such as our Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. Opportunity for growth in the DIY tax preparation category continue. We are the #2 player in the category and are well positioned for future growth. And as a reminder, H&R Block is the only tax-preparation company that offers taxpayers the ability to complete your taxes in whatever way they choose, whether that be through assistance, using a DIY method or options that incorporate aspects of both methods, H&R Block provide solutions for all tax filers. And finally, there continues to be growth in the international space. Our operations in Canada and Australia provides tangible value to H&R Block, and the opportunities we are cultivating in India will benefit us in the long term.
From a value perspective, we are taking measures to ensure that our growth will not come at the expense of the bottom line. By taking the previously discussed cost reductions to fund client growth initiatives, we are able to maintain enviable EBITDA margins. We've run a capital-light business, which requires minimal infrastructure investments to operate successfully. In fact, our return on invested capital is consistently in the top quartile of the S&P 500. And ultimately, the excess cash we generate is returned to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. This fiscal year, we announced a 10% dividend increase. We paid quarterly dividends consecutively since going public over 50 years ago and deliver a strong dividend yield well above the average in the S&P 500. 
Finally, regarding share repurchases, since the start of my tenure, we have repurchased approximately 102 million shares for $2.7 billion. Including dividends, total cash returned to shareholders over this time about -- amounts to $3.9 billion, which is more than double our net income over the same period.
In closing, I want to thank our shareholders. Last year was challenging, and we appreciate the support you've shown. Although we believe we have a plan that will deliver stronger results in '17, we understand the plans are just that, and it's what we deliver that matters. We are playing to win, and we look forward to sharing the season results with you after the third quarter. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Mike?"

I am extremely excited for the upcoming tax season, and as we shared some of our plans today, I will hope you will be as well. 
I am proud of my leadership team and the dedication and tenacity they have shown coming off a challenging season. We have been hard at work developing and implementing a comprehensive and aggressive plan designed to deliver stronger results in tax season '17. That same spirit and dedication is echoed in the thousands of hard-working associates throughout H&R Block. I am now entering my sixth tax season, and the level of enthusiasm displayed for the upcoming season is the best I have seen. I recently attended our company and franchise conventions and was motivated by the energy level of the attendees. We are all ready to deliver.
Before diving into why we're energized for the upcoming season, I'd like to outline what we intend to cover during today's call. First, we will have a short discussion about our second quarter results. Then I'll provide some thoughts around how we will define success in both the short and long term. Next, I will share some key elements of our plans for the upcoming tax season. Tony will then review our second quarter financial results and our financial outlook for fiscal year '17. And finally, I will close out with thoughts on why we believe H&R Block is such a compelling investment.
With that, let's talk about our second quarter results. Overall, we're on track with our financial plans, and Q2 results were in line with our expectations. We are pleased to report an increase in revenue and an improvement in both operating expenses and our pretax loss. Now that we have hit the halfway point of the fiscal year, we are starting to realize some of the benefits of our previously announced cost-reduction efforts, which will not be fully realized until year-end. And with our plans for this tax season now set, we have identified the areas in which we'll invest to be successful. Tony will talk more about this later.
I'm also pleased to discuss some good news in the fight against tax fraud. The public-private collaboration through the IRS security Summit made a positive impact last year, as demonstrated by a decrease of over 50% in the number of new people reporting stolen identities on federal tax returns. We will continue to make progress this season through stronger authentication measures in the DIY category and better information sharing among tax software providers. 
In addition, the Protecting American from Tax Hikes, or PATH Act, will take effect this season. The IRS will now have additional time to review tax returns containing the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit before processing refunds. While this will delay refunds for as many as 15 million tax filers until late February, it will help cut down on inaccurate or fraudulent returns, which is something we fully support.
So there has been a great amount of progress in the fight against tax fraud, but the work is far from complete. As an example, taxpayer safeguards, such as minimum standards for return preparers, have not yet been implemented. We will continue to advocate for the honest taxpayer in this fight.
While we're talking about the industry, let me address something many of you have been asking about the past few weeks, the recent election results. First, we congratulate President-elect Trump on his election victory. We look forward to working with Congress and the President-elect's team in the coming months. Some within the investment community committee have expressed concern about the possible negative implications for H&R Block that might result from the new administration's policies. I'd like to take a moment to provide an alternative viewpoint to these concerns. 
Like you, we have been listening closely to the comments of the President-elect and his nominees for key cabinet positions. Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin has talked about the desire to lower corporate tax rates and to have a middle-class tax cut that includes increased Child Tax Credits and other rebates. There's also been discussion of limiting mortgages and charitable deductions and raising standard deductions. So as you can tell, there are a lot of moving parts. 
On the Affordable Care Act, Health and Human Services nominee Congressman Tom Price has talked about repealing the ACA and replacing it with a new program that could include refundable credits. The President-elect is on record for wanting to retain certain aspects of the ACA, such as coverage for dependent children up to age 26 and covering people with preexisting conditions. It's also our understanding that any proposed changes will not impact this tax season, and as media are reporting, they may not be effective for 2 or 3 more years. While there are many questions about changes to the ACA, we don't expect there to be a material impact to H&R Block, regardless of the outcome. 
Finally, potential changes to the corporate tax rate, specifically reducing the rate to as low as 15%, could be a significant benefit for H&R Block. Given our historical effective tax rates in the mid-30% range, such reductions would have a material positive impact on our net income and cash flow.
So as you can tell, the dialogue on tax policy is far from vague. Mostly, what we've heard is from the incoming administration, but Congress will have a great deal to say too. Regardless of the outcome, people will still need help to sort through the changes and the impact on their taxes. Thus, I'm absolutely certain of one thing, taxpayers will continue to need and want H&R Block's help. The tax code was much simpler when this company began in 1955. People wanted our help then, just as they will in the future. We remain laser focused on helping our clients this coming season, the season after that and for many years to come.
Shifting gears, let me talk about our plan for the future, specifically focusing on defining what success means to H&R Block. Ultimately, return volume is key to how we will measure success. We understand this and are focused on addressing recent client losses, but this is not something that can be solved in one season. To that end, we would like to share you with how we're defining success in both the short and long term. 
In the short term, we're focused on arresting the client decline. In our assisted business, given the losses we've experienced over the last several years, it is unrealistic to think that, in 1 year, we'll be able to move from losing clients to client growth. We believe, however, that we will be able to significantly reduce the client loss this year as we move toward client growth in the future. And for our DIY business, we do consider last year's performance to be an anomaly as we were able to successfully grow clients for 5 consecutive years prior to last tax season.
In the long term, our goal is to grow clients in both the assisted and the DIY categories. To accomplish this, we're approaching assisted tax preparation in a different way, by focusing on enhancing our client service delivery model, which really hasn't changed much in decades. In DIY, we made significant progress in our user experience over the last several years, as validated by the strong independent reviews we received last tax season. We're building on this progress by adding more client-friendly features designed to improve the DIY tax preparation experience. 
While the objectives I just outlined center on arresting the client decline this tax season and growing clients in the long term, they must be accomplished while maintaining our financial health. We are a financially sound company with enviable margins, strong free cash flow and a solid balance sheet, and we intend to stay that way.
So let's talk more specifically about the changes we're making to achieve this success. We've been hard at work this preseason developing a winning approach for tax season '17, which includes changes in all customer-facing areas of the business including our sales and service model, promotion, pricing and products and market. I'll now talk specifically about each of these areas, providing details on what we plan to do and how we believe these plans will translate into results.
Let's start first with sales and service. After last season, it was clear that changes at the office level were necessary. This included a new approach at the local level regarding how we attract our clients and improvements at the tax desk or how we serve our clients. Ultimately, it was time for cultural changes in both areas. 
From a sales perspective, we have spent the preseason emphasizing with our deal management and associates that not only is delivering excellent service important but that they are also the best sales agents for our brand. We have provided trading opportunities to enhance their sales skills, develop new sales programs, including a B2B sales plan in which we're partnering with local and national businesses and hired experienced sales managers to further the sales culture. Our field leadership has been energized by this new approach, and I am extremely pleased with the level of engagement we've seen today. 
So while that addresses how we can drive client volume at the local level, we also recognize that we need to enhance the client experience once they are in our offices. Our service delivery model hasn't changed significantly in decades, and we felt it was time to deliver a fresh new approach to tax preparation. We know from our market research that consumers want a more dynamic, personalized and engaging experience, which we intend to deliver. We expect most of those changes to the client experience to occur in the second half of the season. So you'll hear more about this later this fiscal year.
In addition to instilling a sales and service mentality, we've also addressed gaps in our product and pricing strategies this off-season with a particular focus on early-season assisted clients and DIY tax filers. I'll address our 3 most significant efforts in these areas: the Refund Advance, our free federal 1040EZ promotion and free DIY. 
Starting with the Refund Advance. Early-season clients typically have a compelling need for cash and want to access their tax refund faster than the customary 2 to 3 weeks. The impact of the PATH Act make further increases need as refunds for over 15 million early-season filers will be delayed until late February. In tax season 2017, H&R Block's Refund Advance will directly meet that need. The Refund Advance is a no-interest, no-fee loan that provides our clients quicker access to their cash. We work hard with our bank partners to develop a program that will be seamless for the client, built into the tax synergy and will provide the best product and service experience available. Tony will cover the details of this offer later during his remarks. 
The next offer on our lineup is the reintroduction of our free federal 1040EZ promotion in our retail offices. The market is not the same as it was when we last offered this promotion. Specifically, the competitive landscape and the fight to attract simple tax returns has changed dramatically over the past couple of years with the introduction of numerous DIY free product offerings. For similar returns, free is now the norm rather than the exception. That said, we believe that there are tax filers using a free DIY products who would prefer assistance but are swayed by the free offers in the digital space. The free federal 1040EZ offer will address those taxpayers' needs, providing tremendous value and driving filers to our offices during the early part of the tax season.
Finally, given the changes in the DIY category, we recognize that to compete, we had to reevaluate our pricing structure. Last year, our product lineup and pricing did not align well with the competition. As such, we have made changes to our product line and are now offering a free federal, free straight -- free state product for 1040EZ and 1040A returns. But it's not just about the offer. We're also stepping up our game in terms of the product. We're excited about the new features and capabilities we will offer, such as the ability to easily import last year's tax return from any other tax preparation service or provider or the capability to take a picture of your W-2 to easily import your information and get started quickly. With a user experience that can stand up to any in the DIY category and the right products at the right price, we believe we can achieve DIY client growth this season. 
Now that we have discussed our approach to sales and service and our pricing and product changes for this season, I'll mention a few things about our marketing efforts. We know that last year, our message missed the mark and did not yield desired results. Thus, we spent the preseason working to ensure that we better understood the value that clients are seeking and aligning our value proposition accordingly. What you will see is a more cohesive marketing approach for H&R Block with a new look, a new tone and a new value proposition that will appeal to tax filers. Additionally, we will more efficiently allocate our resources. We've eliminated programs that were not yielding results. In tax season '17, we will have lower marketing expense overall, but it will be spent more effectively. We will communicate our new assisted products and promotions timely and loudly, and our messaging will be stronger in our DIY business with a goal of driving awareness and highlighting our value proposition in that category. 
So I covered a lot of ground describing our vision of success and the changes we're making to achieve our objectives. I'll now turn the call over to Tony to talk about the details of the second quarter look -- second quarter results and to provide a financial view of the upcoming season."
276601,410255769,1099211,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 07, 2016",2016-12-07,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let me start by taking a few minutes to review the results of the second quarter. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of our business, the results in the second quarter are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Additionally,",1896,"Thanks, Bill. Let me start by taking a few minutes to review the results of the second quarter. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of our business, the results in the second quarter are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Additionally, this will be the last time in which year-over-year comparisons for the quarter are impacted by the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the capital structure changes, which occurred last year. 
In the quarter, revenues increased approximately 2% to $131 million, primarily driven by foreign exchange in our international operations as well as improved product revenue in the U.S. Total operating expenses decreased from the prior year by $23 million or 6% due primarily to onetime cost of $21 million incurred in the prior year related to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and our capital structure changes. Even excluding this impact, operating expenses declined due to our cost-reduction efforts, which were mainly realized through lower compensation and benefits. Partially offsetting these reductions were occupancy and amortization expenses related to franchise and independent acquisitions in the prior year. The favorability in revenues and operating expenses were partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of the long-term debt issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and prior year gain on sale of securities. Netting all of the changes, pretax loss improved 4% or $9 million. 
Our income tax benefit was lower in the quarter primarily due to a lower base tax rate. As a reminder, a reduction on our tax rate will be beneficial for the full fiscal year but reduces the benefit in quarters in which we record a loss. I'll provide additional thoughts on our income tax rate when discussing our outlook for the fiscal year.
Finally, loss per share increased $0.13 to $0.67, which was entirely due to the reduction in share count as a result of our share repurchases over the last 12 months. As a reminder, in quarters with a loss, reducing the share count negatively impact the loss per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet, there are a couple of areas I'd like to highlight. You may recall that H&R Block Bank owned a mortgage portfolio to satisfy regulatory requirements. When we divested the bank, we decided to retain the mortgage portfolio as market conditions were not favorable at the time. Given improving market conditions, we have now decided to sell this noncore asset and have moved mortgage loans held for investment to held for sale. We expect to complete the sale in the fiscal third quarter and receive cash proceeds of approximately $190 million, which is above current book value of $183 million. This allows us to streamline the balance sheet and accelerate cash flow, which we will fold into our overall capital allocation approach. 
In the second quarter, we also continued to take advantage of the current share price, repurchasing 7.6 million shares at a total cost of $168 million. In total, we repurchased 9.6 million shares for $217 million in fiscal year 2017. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing shares as a component of our overall capital allocation strategy. 
As we look forward to tax season 2017, we're very excited about our new offerings. Following the announcement in late October regarding our Refund Advance product, many of you have inquired about how the product will work for the consumer and what the financial implications are for H&R Block. 
So I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the details. The Refund Advance is an interest-free, no-fee loan available to our assisted tax preparation clients. We have partnered with our existing bank partner BofI and MetaBank to offer this consumer-friendly product. From an operational perspective, we feel it is important to make the application and approval process as easy as possible for our clients. 
To obtain the loan, the client completes the application at the tax desk during the preparation of their tax return. The tax professional then submit the loan application electronically to MetaBank for loan decision. Loans will be made in the amounts of $500, $750 or $1,250, and most approved clients will have funds loaded onto their Emerald Cards within 24 hours. This will be a seamless process for our clients. 
H&R Block will pay a fee of $32 to $36 on average for each loan, which is intended to cover loan origination fees, servicing cost and expected losses among other items. The fees will be recorded as a cost of revenue and will not be passed along to our clients, either upfront or on the back end. Franchisees will pay H&R Block a royalty for each loan at an amount slightly lower than the fee H&R Block is paying BofI and MetaBank. 
And while Refund Advance will not directly increase revenues, it will provide a tangible benefit to our clients and positive -- positively contribute to Emerald Card revenue and volume. Ultimately, the financial results of the program will be dependent on the number and mix of clients electing to take a Refund Advance. 
One final note. To ensure we have the appropriate level of funding in place, we have secured an additional $200 million of capacity from our Refund Advance partners under the same economic terms as the original agreement. This brings our total available funds under this program to $1.65 billion. We're excited to offer this valuable product that will appeal to many early-season assisted tax filers. 
Turning to our financial outlook, let's start by discussing return volume and pricing. As Bill mentioned, we don't expect to grow assisted return volume this tax season, but we have the right strategy in place to deliver client growth over the long term. We do, however, expect to significantly reduce the client loss this tax season. 
With regards to assisted pricing, let me walk through some of the specifics. Given the changes in the competitive landscape we discussed earlier, free has become the new norm for the simple tax return. As Bill mentioned, we will be offering the free federal 1040EZ promotion in the early part of the tax season. Other forms in our assisted business will see moderate price increases, recognizing we cannot expect -- or expect to arrest the client decline and ultimately grow clients while aggressively increasing price. We expect these changes to result in a flat to slightly down net average charge in our assisted business when compared to the prior year. 
Turning to our DIY business. We believe that last year was an anomaly. And with the enhancements to the user experience, changes in pricing and increased awareness, we can grow clients this tax season and beyond. In terms of DIY pricing, our approach the past couple of years is varied from the market leader. For example, our free products did not include EITC or a free state return. In tax season 2017, we will be more aggressive in our approach, which will require modifications to our product lineup. By making changes, such as including EITC in our free product, we will better align with other providers in the marketplace and appeal to more DIY tax filers. 
The changes to our product lineup, coupled with our free federal, free state promotion that Bill discussed, will result in a lower overall net average charge this season for our DIY business. This essentially represents a bit of a reset year for us with regard to pricing, especially in our DIY business. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate the optimal pricing model to achieve client growth while not sacrificing the overall financial health of the business. These pricing changes, coupled with our promotional efforts, including the Refund Advance, will make us more competitive in both the short and long term. 
Turning to EBITDA. To offset the incremental expense of these initiatives, we have announced cost -- we announced cost-reduction efforts in June. I am pleased that as a result, we will continue to maintain a healthy EBITDA margin. When considering these changes as well as the ongoing impact of the bank transaction, we're setting our expected long-term EBITDA margin at 27% to 30%. We anticipate fiscal year 2017 to come in at the lower end of this range, which is comparable to last year's adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.6%. 
I'll now move through other areas of our financial states. Starting with CapEx, we're capital-light with minimal investment needed to run our business successfully. After peaking in fiscal year 2014 due to needed office improvements, CapEx levels have moderated to levels we would expect for the foreseeable future. In fiscal '17, we expect CapEx of approximately $90 million to $95 million. Long term, we expect CapEx to run at approximately 3% to 4% of revenues. 
In regards to acquisitions, over the past 2 years, we have purchased approximately 600 locations that were previously franchised. These acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our trading multiples and, as such, are accretive to earnings. As we've discussed in previous calls, however, the opportunity for franchise acquisitions will moderate while we expect to continue similar levels of independent acquisitions. We anticipate closing out the year having repurchased approximately 145 franchise locations and acquiring 65 independent locations for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $60 million. 
Moving to depreciation and amortization. Given the level of franchise repurchases and capital expenditures, we anticipate fiscal year '17 to be the peak year at approximately $175 million to $180 million. In general, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is CapEx-related while the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. 
In regards to capital structure, you recall -- you'll recall that last year, we made significant changes, issuing long-term debt and putting into place our $2 billion line of credit. I'm pleased that we were able to extend the maturity date of the line of credit an additional year to September 21. And regarding our overall level of debt, we continue to target adjusted gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA levels of 2.5 to 3x and are currently within that range. We believe this will help us achieve our stated objective of maintaining investment-grade credit ratings metrics. Following these capital structure changes last fiscal year, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million. 
In regards to share repurchases, the year-to-date weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter was approximately 218 million shares. This number will decline on a full year basis due to the weighted average share calculation as our shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were approximately 212 million. As I mentioned earlier, going forward, we will continue to purchase shares opportunistically and have approximately $1.3 billion of our $3.5 billion share repurchase authorization remain. 
Finally, we continue to do a lot of work around our corporate taxes, and going forward, we expect our long-term effective tax rate to be approximately 34% to 36% with fiscal year 2017 coming in at the low end of this range. Note that this range does not consider any implications of future corporate tax reform, which, as Bill mentioned, would likely be positive for the company. 
I'm excited about what we have in store for this upcoming tax season and beyond, and I look forward to sharing the results with you after the third quarter.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for some closing comments."

I thought it was important to share all that detail regarding our plans and outlook, so thanks again, Tony. 
Before I conclude, I want to address the personnel change that we just announced in an 8-K filed this afternoon. Greg Macfarlane, our Senior Vice President of U.S. Retail Operations and Products, has decided to leave the company at the end of this month. Earlier this year, he transitioned to an operating role and performed as his usual high level, as evidenced by his many contributions to our tax season readiness. He will be missed, but we have a strong bench of leaders who are ready to seamlessly take over Greg's responsibilities and execute our plans in season. Personally, I want to thank Greg for his leadership over the past 4.5 years in both this current role and, previously, as our CFO. I am grateful for his many contributions and his friendship. We wish Greg all the best as he pursues the next phase of his career.
Now I'd like to wrap up by spending a few minutes discussing why we believe H&R Block is a strong long-term investment. H&R Block offers investors an opportunity for growth, value and stability. We participate in an industry that offers predictable and consistent growth. Tax filings in the U.S. have historically grown at 1% to 2%, and we expect that to continue. 
Our Tax Plus products contributed over $400 million of revenue in fiscal year '16 and are a differentiator in the marketplace. While the addition of the Refund Advance product does not generate stand-alone revenue, it is expected to positively impact client volumes and increase the usage of other key products, such as our Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. 
Opportunity for growth in the DIY tax preparation category continue. We are the #2 player in the category and are well positioned for future growth. And as a reminder, H&R Block is the only tax-preparation company that offers taxpayers the ability to complete their taxes in whatever way they choose. Whether that be through assistance, using a DIY method or options that incorporate aspects of both methods, H&R Block provide solutions for all tax filers. 
And finally, there continues to be growth in the international space. Our operations in Canada and Australia provides tangible value to H&R Block, and the opportunities we are cultivating in India will benefit us in the long term. 
From a value perspective, we're taking measures to ensure that our growth will not come at the expense of the bottom line. By taking the previously discussed cost reductions to fund client growth initiatives, we are able to maintain enviable EBITDA margins. We run a capital-light business, which requires minimal infrastructure investment to operate successfully. In fact, our return on invested capital is consistently in the top quartile of the S&P 500. 
And ultimately, the excess cash we generate is returned to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. This fiscal year, we announced a 10% dividend increase. We paid quarterly dividends consecutively since going public over 50 years ago and deliver a strong dividend yield well above the average in the S&P 500. Finally, regarding share repurchases. Since the start of my tenure, we have repurchased approximately 102 million shares for $2.7 billion. Including dividends, total cash returned to shareholders over this time about -- amounts to $3.9 billion, which is more than double our net income over the same period.
In closing, I want to thank our shareholders. Last year was challenging, and we appreciate the support you've shown. Although we believe we have a plan that will deliver stronger results in tax season '17, we understand that plans are just that, and it's what we deliver that matters. We are playing to win, and we look forward to sharing this season results with you after the third quarter. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Mike?"

I am extremely excited for the upcoming tax season, and as we share some of our plans today, I will hope you will be as well. 
I am proud of my leadership team and the dedication and tenacity they have shown coming off a challenging season. We have been hard at work developing and implementing a comprehensive and aggressive plan designed to deliver stronger results in tax season '17. That same spirit and dedication is echoed in the thousands of hard-working associates throughout H&R Block. I am now entering my sixth tax season, and the level of enthusiasm displayed for the upcoming season is the best I have seen. I recently attended our company and franchise conventions and was motivated by the energy level of the attendees. We are all ready to deliver.
Before diving into why we're energized for the upcoming season, I'd like to outline what we intend to cover during today's call. First, we will have a short discussion about our second quarter results. Then I'll provide some thoughts around how we will define success in both the short and long term. Next, I will share some key elements of our plans for the upcoming tax season. Tony will then review our second quarter financial results and our financial outlook for fiscal year '17. And finally, I will close out with thoughts on why we believe H&R Block is such a compelling investment.
With that, let's talk about our second quarter results. Overall, we're on track with our financial plans, and Q2 results were in line with our expectations. We are pleased to report an increase in revenue and an improvement in both operating expenses and our pretax loss. Now that we have hit the halfway point of the fiscal year, we are starting to realize some of the benefits of our previously announced cost-reduction efforts, which will not be fully realized until year-end. And with our plans for this tax season now set, we have identified the areas in which we'll invest to be successful. Tony will talk more about this later.
I'm also pleased to discuss some good news in the fight against tax fraud. The public-private collaboration through the IRS Security Summit made a positive impact last year, as demonstrated by a decrease of over 50% in the number of new people reporting stolen identities on federal tax returns. We will continue to make progress this season through stronger authentication measures in the DIY category and better information sharing among tax software providers. 
In addition, the Protecting American from Tax Hikes, or PATH Act, will take effect this season. The IRS will now have additional time to review tax returns containing the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit before processing refunds. While this will delay refunds for as many as 15 million tax filers until late February, it will help cut down on inaccurate or fraudulent returns, which is something we fully support.
So there has been a great amount of progress in the fight against tax fraud, but the work is far from complete. As an example, taxpayer safeguards, such as minimum standards for return preparers, have not yet been implemented. We will continue to advocate for the honest taxpayer in this fight.
While we're talking about the industry, let me address something many of you have been asking about the past few weeks, the recent election results. First, we congratulate President-elect Trump on his election victory. We look forward to working with Congress and the President-elect's team in the coming months. Some within the investment community have expressed concern about the possible negative implications for H&R Block that might result from the new administration's policies. I'd like to take a moment to provide an alternative viewpoint to these concerns. 
Like you, we have been listening closely to the comments of the President-elect and his nominees for key cabinet positions. Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin has talked about the desire to lower corporate tax rates and to have a middle-class tax cut that includes increased Child Tax Credits and other rebates. There's also been discussion of limiting mortgages and charitable deductions and raising standard deductions. So as you can tell, there are a lot of moving parts. 
On the Affordable Care Act, Health and Human Services nominee Congressman Tom Price has talked about repealing the ACA and replacing it with a new program that could include refundable credits. The President-elect is on record for wanting to retain certain aspects of the ACA, such as coverage for dependent children up to age 26 and covering people with preexisting conditions. It's also our understanding that any proposed changes will not impact this tax season, and as media are reporting, they may not be effective for 2 or 3 more years. While there are many questions about changes to the ACA, we don't expect there to be a material impact to H&R Block, regardless of the outcome. 
Finally, potential changes to the corporate tax rate, specifically reducing the rate to as low as 15%, could be a significant benefit for H&R Block. Given our historical effective tax rates in the mid-30% range, such reductions would have a material positive impact on our net income and cash flow.
So as you can tell, the dialogue on tax policy is far from baked. Mostly, what we've heard is from the incoming administration, but Congress will have a great deal to say too. Regardless of the outcome, people will still need help to sort through the changes and the impact on their taxes. Thus, I'm absolutely certain of one thing, taxpayers will continue to need and want H&R Block's help. The tax code was much simpler when this company began in 1955. People wanted our help then, just as they will in the future. We remain laser focused on helping our clients this coming season, the season after that and for many years to come.
Shifting gears, let me talk about our plan for the future, specifically focusing on defining what success means to H&R Block. Ultimately, return volume is key to how we will measure success. We understand this and are focused on addressing recent client losses, but this is not something that can be solved in one season. To that end, we would like to share you with how we're defining success in both the short and long term. 
In the short term, we're focused on arresting the client decline. In our assisted business, given the losses we've experienced over the last several years, it is unrealistic to think that, in 1 year, we'll be able to move from losing clients to client growth. We believe, however, that we will be able to significantly reduce the client loss this year as we move toward client growth in the future. And for our DIY business, we do consider last year's performance to be an anomaly as we were able to successfully grow clients for 5 consecutive years prior to last tax season.
In the long term, our goal is to grow clients in both the assisted and the DIY categories. To accomplish this, we're approaching assisted tax preparation in a different way, by focusing on enhancing our client service delivery model, which really hasn't changed much in decades. In DIY, we've made significant progress in our user experience over the last several years, as validated by the strong independent reviews we received last tax season. We're building on this progress by adding more client-friendly features designed to improve the DIY tax preparation experience. 
While the objectives I just outlined center on arresting the client decline this tax season and growing clients in the long term, they must be accomplished while maintaining our financial health. We are a financially sound company with enviable margins, strong free cash flow and a solid balance sheet, and we intend to stay that way.
So let's talk more specifically about the changes we're making to achieve this success. We've been hard at work this preseason developing a winning approach for tax season '17, which includes changes in all customer-facing areas of the business including our sales and service model, promotion, pricing and products and market. I'll now talk specifically about each of these areas, providing details on what we plan to do and how we believe these plans will translate into results.
Let's start first with sales and service. After last season, it was clear that changes at the office level were necessary. This included a new approach at the local level regarding how we attract our clients and improvements at the tax desk or how we serve our clients. Ultimately, it was time for cultural changes in both areas. 
From a sales perspective, we have spent the preseason emphasizing with our field management and associates that not only is delivering excellent service important but that they are also the best sales agents for our brand. We have provided trading opportunities to enhance their sales skills, develop new sales programs, including a B2B sales plan in which we're partnering with local and national businesses and hired experienced sales managers to further the sales culture. Our field leadership has been energized by this new approach, and I am extremely pleased with the level of engagement we've seen to date. 
So while that addresses how we can drive client volume at the local level, we also recognize that we need to enhance the client experience once they are in our offices. Our service delivery model hasn't changed significantly in decades, and we felt it was time to deliver a fresh new approach to tax preparation. We know from our market research that consumers want a more dynamic, personalized and engaging experience, which we intend to deliver. We expect most of those changes to the client experience to occur in the second half of the season. So you'll hear more about this later this fiscal year.
In addition to instilling a sales and service mentality, we've also addressed gaps in our product and pricing strategies this off-season with a particular focus on early-season assisted clients and DIY tax filers. I'll address our 3 most significant efforts in these areas: the Refund Advance, our free federal 1040EZ promotion and free DIY. 
Starting with the Refund Advance. Early-season clients typically have a compelling need for cash and want to access their tax refund faster than the customary 2 to 3 weeks. The impact of the PATH Act make further increases need as refunds for over 15 million early-season filers will be delayed until late February. In tax season 2017, H&R Block's Refund Advance will directly meet that need. The Refund Advance is a no-interest, no-fee loan that provides our clients quicker access to their cash. We've worked hard with our bank partners to develop a program that will be seamless for the client, built into the tax interview and will provide the best product and service experience available. Tony will cover the details of this offer later during his remarks. 
The next offer on our lineup is the reintroduction of our free federal 1040EZ promotion in our retail offices. The market is not the same as it was when we last offered this promotion. Specifically, the competitive landscape and the fight to attract simple tax returns has changed dramatically over the past couple of years with the introduction of numerous DIY free product offerings. For similar returns, free is now the norm rather than the exception. That said, we believe that there are tax filers using a free DIY products who would prefer assistance but are swayed by the free offers in the digital space. The free federal 1040EZ offer will address those taxpayers' needs, providing tremendous value and driving filers to our offices during the early part of the tax season.
Finally, given the changes in the DIY category, we recognize that to compete, we had to reevaluate our pricing structure. Last year, our product lineup and pricing did not align well with the competition. As such, we have made changes to our product line and are now offering a free federal, free straight -- free state product for 1040EZ and 1040A returns. But it's not just about the offer. We're also stepping up our game in terms of the product. We're excited about the new features and capabilities we will offer, such as the ability to easily import last year's tax return from any other tax preparation service or provider or the capability to take a picture of your W-2 to easily import your information and get started quickly. With a user experience that can stand up to any in the DIY category and the right products at the right price, we believe we can achieve DIY client growth this season. 
Now that we have discussed our approach to sales and service and our pricing and product changes for this season, I'll mention a few things about our marketing efforts. We know that last year, our message missed the mark and did not yield desired results. Thus, we spent the preseason working to ensure that we better understood the value that clients are seeking and aligning our value proposition accordingly. What you will see is a more cohesive marketing approach for H&R Block with a new look, a new tone and a new value proposition that will appeal to tax filers. Additionally, we will more efficiently allocate our resources. We've eliminated programs that were not yielding results. In tax season '17, we will have lower marketing expense overall, but it will be spent more effectively. We will communicate our new assisted products and promotions timely and loudly, and our messaging will be stronger in our DIY business with a goal of driving awareness and highlighting our value proposition in that category. 
So I covered a lot of ground describing our vision of success and the changes we're making to achieve our objectives. I'll now turn the call over to Tony to talk about the details of the second quarter look -- second quarter results and to provide a financial view of the upcoming season."

Let me start by taking a few minutes to review the results of the second quarter. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of our business, the results in the second quarter are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Additionally,",1897,"Thanks, Bill. Let me start by taking a few minutes to review the results of the second quarter. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of our business, the results in the second quarter are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Additionally, this will be the last time in which year-over-year comparisons for the quarter are impacted by the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the capital structure changes, which occurred last year. 
In the quarter, revenues increased approximately 2% to $131 million, primarily driven by foreign exchange in our international operations as well as improved product revenue in the U.S. Total operating expenses decreased from the prior year by $23 million or 6% due primarily to onetime cost of $21 million incurred in the prior year related to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and our capital structure changes. Even excluding this impact, operating expenses declined due to our cost-reduction efforts, which were mainly realized through lower compensation and benefits. Partially offsetting these reductions were occupancy and amortization expenses related to franchise and independent acquisitions in the prior year. The favorability in revenues and operating expenses were partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of the long-term debt issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and prior year gain on sale of securities. Netting all of the changes, pretax loss improved 4% or $9 million. 
Our income tax benefit was lower in the quarter primarily due to a lower base tax rate. As a reminder, a reduction in our tax rate will be beneficial for the full fiscal year but reduces the benefit in quarters in which we record a loss. I'll provide additional thoughts on our income tax rate when discussing our outlook for the fiscal year.
Finally, loss per share increased $0.13 to $0.67, which was entirely due to the reduction in share count as a result of our share repurchases over the last 12 months. As a reminder, in quarters with a loss, reducing the share count negatively impacts the loss per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet, there are a couple of areas I'd like to highlight. You may recall that H&R Block Bank owned a mortgage portfolio to satisfy regulatory requirements. When we divested the bank, we decided to retain the mortgage portfolio as market conditions were not favorable at the time. Given improving market conditions, we have now decided to sell this noncore asset and have moved mortgage loans held for investment to held for sale. We expect to complete the sale in the fiscal third quarter and receive cash proceeds of approximately $190 million, which is above current book value of $183 million. This allows us to streamline the balance sheet and accelerate cash flow, which we will fold into our overall capital allocation approach. 
In the second quarter, we also continued to take advantage of the current share price, repurchasing 7.6 million shares at a total cost of $168 million. In total, we have repurchased 9.6 million shares for $217 million in fiscal year 2017. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing shares as a component of our overall capital allocation strategy. 
As we look forward to tax season 2017, we're very excited about our new offerings. Following the announcement in late October regarding our Refund Advance product, many of you have inquired about how the product will work for the consumer and what the financial implications are for H&R Block. 
So I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the details. The Refund Advance is an interest-free, no-fee loan available to our assisted tax preparation clients. We have partnered with our existing bank partner BofI and MetaBank to offer this consumer-friendly product. From an operational perspective, we feel it is important to make the application and approval process as easy as possible for our clients. 
To obtain the loan, the client completes the application at the tax desk during the preparation of their tax return. The tax professional then submits the loan application electronically to MetaBank for loan decision. Loans will be made in amounts of $500, $750 or $1,250, and most approved clients will have funds loaded onto their Emerald Cards within 24 hours. This will be a seamless process for our clients. 
H&R Block will pay a fee of $32 to $36 on average for each loan, which is intended to cover loan origination fees, servicing cost and expected losses among other items. The fees will be recorded as a cost of revenue and will not be passed along to our clients, either upfront or on the back end. Franchisees will pay H&R Block a royalty for each loan at an amount slightly lower than the fee H&R Block is paying BofI and MetaBank. 
And while Refund Advance will not directly increase revenues, it will provide a tangible benefit to our clients and positive -- positively contribute to Emerald Card revenue and volume. Ultimately, the financial results of the program will be dependent on the number and mix of clients electing to take a Refund Advance. 
One final note. To ensure we had the appropriate level of funding in place, we have secured an additional $200 million of capacity from our Refund Advance partners under the same economic terms as the original agreement. This brings our total available funds under this program to $1.65 billion. We're excited to offer this valuable product that will appeal to many early-season assisted tax filers. 
Turning to our financial outlook, let's start by discussing return volume and pricing. As Bill mentioned, we don't expect to grow assisted return volume this tax season, but we have the right strategy in place to deliver client growth over the long term. We do, however, expect to significantly reduce the client loss this tax season. 
With regards to assisted pricing, let me walk through some of the specifics. Given the changes in the competitive landscape we discussed earlier, free has become the new norm for the simple tax return. As Bill mentioned, we will be offering the free federal 1040EZ promotion in the early part of the tax season. Other forms in our assisted business will see moderate price increases, recognizing we cannot expect -- or expect to arrest the client decline and ultimately grow clients while aggressively increasing price. We expect these changes to result in a flat to slightly down net average charge in our assisted business when compared to the prior year. 
Turning to our DIY business. We believe that last year was an anomaly. And with the enhancements to the user experience, changes in pricing and increased awareness, we can grow clients this tax season and beyond. In terms of DIY pricing, our approach the past couple of years is varied from the market leader. For example, our free product did not include EITC or a free state return. In tax season 2017, we will be more aggressive in our approach, which will require modifications to our product lineup. By making changes, such as including EITC in our free product, we will better align with other providers in the marketplace and appeal to more DIY tax filers. 
The changes to our product lineup, coupled with our free federal, free state promotion that Bill discussed, will result in a lower overall net average charge this season for our DIY business. This essentially represents a bit of a reset year for us with regard to pricing, especially in our DIY business. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate the optimal pricing model to achieve client growth while not sacrificing the overall financial health of the business. These pricing changes, coupled with our promotional efforts, including the Refund Advance, will make us more competitive in both the short and long term. 
Turning to EBITDA. To offset the incremental expense of these initiatives, we have announced cost -- we announced cost-reduction efforts in June. I am pleased that as a result, we will continue to maintain a healthy EBITDA margin. When considering these changes as well as the ongoing impact of the bank transaction, we're setting our expected long-term EBITDA margin at 27% to 30%. We anticipate fiscal year 2017 to come in at the lower end of this range, which is comparable to last year's adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.6%. 
I'll now move through other areas of our financial statements. Starting with CapEx, we're capital-light with minimal investment needed to run our business successfully. After peaking in fiscal year 2014 due to needed office improvements, CapEx levels have moderated to levels we would expect for the foreseeable future. In fiscal '17, we expect CapEx of approximately $90 million to $95 million. Long term, we expect CapEx to run at approximately 3% to 4% of revenues. 
In regards to acquisitions, over the past 2 years, we have purchased approximately 600 locations that were previously franchised. These acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our trading multiples and, as such, are accretive to earnings. As we've discussed in previous calls, however, the opportunity for franchise acquisitions will moderate while we expect to continue with similar levels of independent acquisitions. We anticipate closing out the year having repurchased approximately 145 franchise locations and acquiring 65 independent locations for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $60 million. 
Moving to depreciation and amortization. Given the level of franchise repurchases and capital expenditures, we anticipate fiscal year '17 to be the peak year at approximately $175 million to $180 million. In general, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is CapEx-related while the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. 
In regards to capital structure, you recall -- you'll recall that last year, we made significant changes, issuing long-term debt and putting into place our $2 billion line of credit. I'm pleased that we were able to extend the maturity date of the line of credit an additional year to September 2021. And regarding our overall level of debt, we continue to target adjusted gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA levels of 2.5 to 3x and are currently within that range. We believe this will help us achieve our stated objective of maintaining investment-grade credit ratings metrics. Following these capital structure changes last fiscal year, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million. 
In regards to share repurchases, the year-to-date weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter was approximately 218 million shares. This number will decline on a full year basis due to the weighted average share calculation as our shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were approximately 212 million. As I mentioned earlier, going forward, we will continue to purchase shares opportunistically and have approximately $1.3 billion of our $3.5 billion share repurchase authorization remaining. 
Finally, we continue to do a lot of work around our corporate taxes, and going forward, we expect our long-term effective tax rate to be approximately 34% to 36% with fiscal year 2017 coming in at the low end of this range. Note that this range does not consider any implications of future corporate tax reform, which, as Bill mentioned, would likely be positive for the company. 
I'm excited about what we have in store for this upcoming tax season and beyond, and I look forward to sharing the results with you after the third quarter.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for some closing comments."

I thought it was important to share all that detail regarding our plans and outlook, so thanks again, Tony.

I thought it was important to share all that detail regarding our plans and outlook, so thanks again, Tony. 
Before I conclude, I want to address the personnel change that we just announced in an 8-K filed this afternoon. Greg Macfarlane, our Senior Vice President of U.S. Retail Operations and Products, has decided to leave the company at the end of this month. Earlier this year, he transitioned to an operating role and performed as his usual high level, as evidenced by his many contributions to our tax season readiness. He will be missed, but we have a strong bench of leaders who are ready to seamlessly take over Greg's responsibilities and execute our plans in season. Personally, I want to thank Greg for his leadership over the past 4.5 years in both his current role and, previously, as our CFO. I am grateful for his many contributions and his friendship. We wish Greg all the best as he pursues the next phase of his career.
Now I'd like to wrap up by spending a few minutes discussing why we believe H&R Block is a strong long-term investment. H&R Block offers investors an opportunity for growth, value and stability. We participate in an industry that offers predictable and consistent growth. Tax filings in the U.S. have historically grown at 1% to 2%, and we expect that to continue. 
Our Tax Plus products contributed over $400 million of revenue in fiscal year '16 and are a differentiator in the marketplace. While the addition of the Refund Advance product does not generate standalone revenue, it is expected to positively impact client volumes and increase the usage of other key products, such as our Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. 
Opportunity for growth in the DIY tax preparation category continue. We are the #2 player in the category and are well positioned for future growth. And as a reminder, H&R Block is the only tax-preparation company that offers taxpayers the ability to complete their taxes in whatever way they choose. Whether that be through assistance, using a DIY method or options that incorporate aspects of both methods, H&R Block provide solutions for all tax filers. 
And finally, there continues to be growth in the international space. Our operations in Canada and Australia provide tangible value to H&R Block, and the opportunities we are cultivating in India will benefit us in the long term. 
From a value perspective, we're taking measures to ensure that our growth will not come at the expense of the bottom line. By taking the previously discussed cost reductions to fund client growth initiatives, we are able to maintain enviable EBITDA margins. We run a capital-light business, which requires minimal infrastructure investment to operate successfully. In fact, our return on invested capital is consistently in the top quartile of the S&P 500. 
And ultimately, the excess cash we generate is returned to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. This fiscal year, we announced a 10% dividend increase. We've paid quarterly dividends consecutively since going public over 50 years ago and deliver a strong dividend yield well above the average in the S&P 500. Finally, regarding share repurchases. Since the start of my tenure, we have repurchased approximately 102 million shares for $2.7 billion. Including dividends, total cash returned to shareholders over this time about -- amounts to $3.9 billion, which is more than double our net income over the same period.
In closing, I want to thank our shareholders. Last year was challenging, and we appreciate the support you've shown. Although we believe we have a plan that will deliver stronger results in tax season '17, we understand that plans are just that, and it's what we deliver that matters. We are playing to win, and we look forward to sharing this season results with you after the third quarter. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Mike?"

I am extremely excited for the upcoming tax season, and as we share some of our plans today, I will hope you will be as well. 
I am proud of my leadership team and the dedication and tenacity they have shown coming off a challenging season. We have been hard at work developing and implementing a comprehensive and aggressive plan designed to deliver stronger results in tax season '17. That same spirit and dedication is echoed in the thousands of hard-working associates throughout H&R Block. I am now entering my sixth tax season, and the level of enthusiasm displayed for the upcoming season is the best I have seen. I recently attended our company and franchise conventions and was motivated by the energy level of the attendees. We are all ready to deliver.
Before diving into why we're energized for the upcoming season, I'd like to outline what we intend to cover during today's call. First, we will have a short discussion about our second quarter results. Then I'll provide some thoughts around how we will define success in both the short and long term. Next, I will share some key elements of our plans for the upcoming tax season. Tony will then review our second quarter financial results and our financial outlook for fiscal year '17. And finally, I will close out with thoughts on why we believe H&R Block is such a compelling investment.
With that, let's talk about our second quarter results. Overall, we're on track with our financial plans, and Q2 results were in line with our expectations. We are pleased to report an increase in revenue and an improvement in both operating expenses and our pretax loss. Now that we have hit the halfway point of the fiscal year, we are starting to realize some of the benefits of our previously announced cost-reduction efforts, which will not be fully realized until year-end. And with our plans for this tax season now set, we have identified the areas in which we'll invest to be successful. Tony will talk more about this later.
I'm also pleased to discuss some good news in the fight against tax fraud. The public-private collaboration through the IRS Security Summit made a positive impact last year, as demonstrated by a decrease of over 50% in the number of new people reporting stolen identities on federal tax returns. We will continue to make progress this season through stronger authentication measures in the DIY category and better information sharing among tax software providers. 
In addition, the Protecting American from Tax Hikes, or PATH Act, will take effect this season. The IRS will now have additional time to review tax returns containing the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit before processing refunds. While this will delay refunds for as many as 15 million tax filers until late February, it will help cut down on inaccurate or fraudulent returns, which is something we fully support.
So there has been a great amount of progress in the fight against tax fraud, but the work is far from complete. As an example, taxpayer safeguards, such as minimum standards for return preparers, have not yet been implemented. We will continue to advocate for the honest taxpayer in this fight.
While we're talking about the industry, let me address something many of you have been asking about the past few weeks, the recent election results. First, we congratulate President-elect Trump on his election victory. We look forward to working with Congress and the President-elect's team in the coming months. Some within the investment community have expressed concern about the possible negative implications for H&R Block that might result from the new administration's policies. I'd like to take a moment to provide an alternative viewpoint to these concerns. 
Like you, we have been listening closely to the comments of the President-elect and his nominees for key cabinet positions. Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin has talked about the desire to lower corporate tax rates and to have a middle-class tax cut that includes increased Child Tax Credits and other rebates. There's also been discussion of limiting mortgages and charitable deductions and raising standard deductions. So as you can tell, there are a lot of moving parts. 
On the Affordable Care Act, Health and Human Services nominee Congressman Tom Price has talked about repealing the ACA and replacing it with a new program that could include refundable credits. The President-elect is on record for wanting to retain certain aspects of the ACA, such as coverage for dependent children up to age 26 and covering people with preexisting conditions. It's also our understanding that any proposed changes will not impact this tax season, and as media are reporting, they may not be effective for 2 or 3 more years. While there are many questions about changes to the ACA, we don't expect there to be a material impact to H&R Block, regardless of the outcome. 
Finally, potential changes to the corporate tax rate, specifically reducing the rate to as low as 15%, could be a significant benefit for H&R Block. Given our historical effective tax rates in the mid-30% range, such reductions would have a material positive impact on our net income and cash flow.
So as you can tell, the dialogue on tax policy is far from baked. Mostly, what we've heard is from the incoming administration, but Congress will have a great deal to say too. Regardless of the outcome, people will still need help to sort through the changes and the impact on their taxes. Thus, I'm absolutely certain of one thing, taxpayers will continue to need and want H&R Block's help. The tax code was much simpler when this company began in 1955. People wanted our help then, just as they will in the future. We remain laser focused on helping our clients this coming season, the season after that and for many years to come.
Shifting gears, let me talk about our plan for the future, specifically focusing on defining what success means to H&R Block. Ultimately, return volume is key to how we will measure success. We understand this and are focused on addressing recent client losses, but this is not something that can be solved in one season. To that end, we would like to share you with how we're defining success in both the short and long term. 
In the short term, we're focused on arresting the client decline. In our assisted business, given the losses we've experienced over the last several years, it is unrealistic to think that, in 1 year, we'll be able to move from losing clients to client growth. We believe, however, that we will be able to significantly reduce the client loss this year as we move toward client growth in the future. And for our DIY business, we do consider last year's performance to be an anomaly as we were able to successfully grow clients for 5 consecutive years prior to last tax season.
In the long term, our goal is to grow clients in both the assisted and the DIY categories. To accomplish this, we're approaching assisted tax preparation in a different way, by focusing on enhancing our client service delivery model, which really hasn't changed much in decades. In DIY, we've made significant progress in our user experience over the last several years, as validated by the strong independent reviews we received last tax season. We're building on this progress by adding more client-friendly features designed to improve the DIY tax preparation experience. 
While the objectives I just outlined center on arresting the client decline this tax season and growing clients in the long term, they must be accomplished while maintaining our financial health. We are a financially sound company with enviable margins, strong free cash flow and a solid balance sheet, and we intend to stay that way.
So let's talk more specifically about the changes we're making to achieve this success. We've been hard at work this preseason developing a winning approach for tax season '17, which includes changes in all customer-facing areas of the business including our sales and service model, promotion, pricing and products and market. I'll now talk specifically about each of these areas, providing details on what we plan to do and how we believe these plans will translate into results.
Let's start first with sales and service. After last season, it was clear that changes at the office level were necessary. This included a new approach at the local level regarding how we attract our clients and improvements at the tax desk or how we serve our clients. Ultimately, it was time for cultural changes in both areas. 
From a sales perspective, we have spent the preseason emphasizing with our field management and associates that not only is delivering excellent service important but that they are also the best sales agents for our brand. We have provided trading opportunities to enhance their sales skills, develop new sales programs, including a B2B sales plan in which we're partnering with local and national businesses and hired experienced sales managers to further the sales culture. Our field leadership has been energized by this new approach, and I am extremely pleased with the level of engagement we've seen to date. 
So while that addresses how we can drive client volume at the local level, we also recognize that we need to enhance the client experience once they are in our offices. Our service delivery model hasn't changed significantly in decades, and we felt it was time to deliver a fresh new approach to tax preparation. We know from our market research that consumers want a more dynamic, personalized and engaging experience, which we intend to deliver. We expect most of those changes to the client experience to occur in the second half of the season. So you'll hear more about this later this fiscal year.
In addition to instilling a sales and service mentality, we've also addressed gaps in our product and pricing strategies this off-season with a particular focus on early-season assisted clients and DIY tax filers. I'll address our 3 most significant efforts in these areas: the Refund Advance, our free federal 1040EZ promotion and free DIY. 
Starting with the Refund Advance. Early-season clients typically have a compelling need for cash and want to access their tax refund faster than the customary 2 to 3 weeks. The impact of the PATH Act make further increases need as refunds for over 15 million early-season filers will be delayed until late February. In tax season 2017, H&R Block's Refund Advance will directly meet that need. The Refund Advance is a no-interest, no-fee loan that provides our clients quicker access to their cash. We've worked hard with our bank partners to develop a program that will be seamless for the client, built into the tax interview and will provide the best product and service experience available. Tony will cover the details of this offer later during his remarks. 
The next offer on our lineup is the reintroduction of our free federal 1040EZ promotion in our retail offices. The market is not the same as it was when we last offered this promotion. Specifically, the competitive landscape and the fight to attract simple tax returns has changed dramatically over the past couple of years with the introduction of numerous DIY free product offerings. For similar returns, free is now the norm rather than the exception. That said, we believe that there are tax filers using a free DIY products who would prefer assistance but are swayed by the free offers in the digital space. The free federal 1040EZ offer will address those taxpayers' needs, providing tremendous value and driving filers to our offices during the early part of the tax season.
Finally, given the changes in the DIY category, we recognize that to compete, we had to reevaluate our pricing structure. Last year, our product lineup and pricing did not align well with the competition. As such, we have made changes to our product line and are now offering a free federal, free straight -- free state product for 1040EZ and 1040A returns. But it's not just about the offer. We're also stepping up our game in terms of the product. We're excited about the new features and capabilities we will offer, such as the ability to easily import last year's tax return from any other tax preparation service or provider or the capability to take a picture of your W-2 to easily import your information and get started quickly. With a user experience that can stand up to any in the DIY category and the right products at the right price, we believe we can achieve DIY client growth this season. 
Now that we have discussed our approach to sales and service and our pricing and product changes for this season, I'll mention a few things about our marketing efforts. We know that last year, our message missed the mark and did not yield desired results. Thus, we spent the preseason working to ensure that we better understood the value that clients are seeking and aligning our value proposition accordingly. What you will see is a more cohesive marketing approach for H&R Block with a new look, a new tone and a new value proposition that will appeal to tax filers. Additionally, we will more efficiently allocate our resources. We've eliminated programs that were not yielding results. In tax season '17, we will have lower marketing expense overall, but it will be spent more effectively. We will communicate our new assisted products and promotions timely and loudly, and our messaging will be stronger in our DIY business with a goal of driving awareness and highlighting our value proposition in that category. 
So I covered a lot of ground describing our vision of success and the changes we're making to achieve our objectives. I'll now turn the call over to Tony to talk about the details of the second quarter look -- second quarter results and to provide a financial view of the upcoming season."
276601,410255769,1099889,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 07, 2016",2016-12-07,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Let me start by taking a few minutes to review the results of the second quarter. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of our business, the results in the second quarter are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Additionally,",1897,"Thanks, Bill. Let me start by taking a few minutes to review the results of the second quarter. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of our business, the results in the second quarter are not indicative of our performance for the full year. Additionally, this will be the last time in which year-over-year comparisons for the quarter are impacted by the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and the capital structure changes, which occurred last year. 
In the quarter, revenues increased approximately 2% to $131 million, primarily driven by foreign exchange in our international operations as well as improved product revenue in the U.S. Total operating expenses decreased from the prior year by $23 million or 6% due primarily to onetime cost of $21 million incurred in the prior year related to the divestiture of H&R Block Bank and our capital structure changes. Even excluding this impact, operating expenses declined due to our cost-reduction efforts, which were mainly realized through lower compensation and benefits. Partially offsetting these reductions were occupancy and amortization expenses related to franchise and independent acquisitions in the prior year. The favorability in revenues and operating expenses were partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of the long-term debt issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and prior year gain on sale of securities. Netting all of the changes, pretax loss improved 4% or $9 million. 
Our income tax benefit was lower in the quarter primarily due to a lower base tax rate. As a reminder, a reduction in our tax rate will be beneficial for the full fiscal year but reduces the benefit in quarters in which we record a loss. I'll provide additional thoughts on our income tax rate when discussing our outlook for the fiscal year.
Finally, loss per share increased $0.13 to $0.67, which was entirely due to the reduction in share count as a result of our share repurchases over the last 12 months. As a reminder, in quarters with a loss, reducing the share count negatively impacts the loss per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet, there are a couple of areas I'd like to highlight. You may recall that H&R Block Bank owned a mortgage portfolio to satisfy regulatory requirements. When we divested the bank, we decided to retain the mortgage portfolio as market conditions were not favorable at the time. Given improving market conditions, we have now decided to sell this noncore asset and have moved mortgage loans held for investment to held for sale. We expect to complete the sale in the fiscal third quarter and receive cash proceeds of approximately $190 million, which is above current book value of $183 million. This allows us to streamline the balance sheet and accelerate cash flow, which we will fold into our overall capital allocation approach. 
In the second quarter, we also continued to take advantage of the current share price, repurchasing 7.6 million shares at a total cost of $168 million. In total, we have repurchased 9.6 million shares for $217 million in fiscal year 2017. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing shares as a component of our overall capital allocation strategy. 
As we look forward to tax season 2017, we're very excited about our new offerings. Following the announcement in late October regarding our Refund Advance product, many of you have inquired about how the product will work for the consumer and what the financial implications are for H&R Block. 
So I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the details. The Refund Advance is an interest-free, no-fee loan available to our assisted tax preparation clients. We have partnered with our existing bank partner BofI and MetaBank to offer this consumer-friendly product. From an operational perspective, we feel it is important to make the application and approval process as easy as possible for our clients. 
To obtain the loan, the client completes the application at the tax desk during the preparation of their tax return. The tax professional then submits the loan application electronically to MetaBank for loan decision. Loans will be made in amounts of $500, $750 or $1,250, and most approved clients will have funds loaded onto their Emerald Cards within 24 hours. This will be a seamless process for our clients. 
H&R Block will pay a fee of $32 to $36 on average for each loan, which is intended to cover loan origination fees, servicing cost and expected losses among other items. The fees will be recorded as a cost of revenue and will not be passed along to our clients, either upfront or on the back end. Franchisees will pay H&R Block a royalty for each loan at an amount slightly lower than the fee H&R Block is paying BofI and MetaBank. 
And while Refund Advance will not directly increase revenues, it will provide a tangible benefit to our clients and positive -- positively contribute to Emerald Card revenue and volume. Ultimately, the financial results of the program will be dependent on the number and mix of clients electing to take a Refund Advance. 
One final note. To ensure we had the appropriate level of funding in place, we have secured an additional $200 million of capacity from our Refund Advance partners under the same economic terms as the original agreement. This brings our total available funds under this program to $1.65 billion. We're excited to offer this valuable product that will appeal to many early-season assisted tax filers. 
Turning to our financial outlook, let's start by discussing return volume and pricing. As Bill mentioned, we don't expect to grow assisted return volume this tax season, but we have the right strategy in place to deliver client growth over the long term. We do, however, expect to significantly reduce the client loss this tax season. 
With regards to assisted pricing, let me walk through some of the specifics. Given the changes in the competitive landscape we discussed earlier, free has become the new norm for the simple tax return. As Bill mentioned, we will be offering the free federal 1040EZ promotion in the early part of the tax season. Other forms in our assisted business will see moderate price increases, recognizing we cannot expect -- or expect to arrest the client decline and ultimately grow clients while aggressively increasing price. We expect these changes to result in a flat to slightly down net average charge in our assisted business when compared to the prior year. 
Turning to our DIY business. We believe that last year was an anomaly. And with the enhancements to the user experience, changes in pricing and increased awareness, we can grow clients this tax season and beyond. In terms of DIY pricing, our approach the past couple of years is varied from the market leader. For example, our free product did not include EITC or a free state return. In tax season 2017, we will be more aggressive in our approach, which will require modifications to our product lineup. By making changes, such as including EITC in our free product, we will better align with other providers in the marketplace and appeal to more DIY tax filers. 
The changes to our product lineup, coupled with our free federal, free state promotion that Bill discussed, will result in a lower overall net average charge this season for our DIY business. This essentially represents a bit of a reset year for us with regard to pricing, especially in our DIY business. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate the optimal pricing model to achieve client growth while not sacrificing the overall financial health of the business. These pricing changes, coupled with our promotional efforts, including the Refund Advance, will make us more competitive in both the short and long term. 
Turning to EBITDA. To offset the incremental expense of these initiatives, we have announced cost -- we announced cost-reduction efforts in June. I am pleased that as a result, we will continue to maintain a healthy EBITDA margin. When considering these changes as well as the ongoing impact of the bank transaction, we're setting our expected long-term EBITDA margin at 27% to 30%. We anticipate fiscal year 2017 to come in at the lower end of this range, which is comparable to last year's adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.6%. 
I'll now move through other areas of our financial statements. Starting with CapEx, we're capital-light with minimal investment needed to run our business successfully. After peaking in fiscal year 2014 due to needed office improvements, CapEx levels have moderated to levels we would expect for the foreseeable future. In fiscal '17, we expect CapEx of approximately $90 million to $95 million. Long term, we expect CapEx to run at approximately 3% to 4% of revenues. 
In regards to acquisitions, over the past 2 years, we have purchased approximately 600 locations that were previously franchised. These acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our trading multiples and, as such, are accretive to earnings. As we've discussed in previous calls, however, the opportunity for franchise acquisitions will moderate while we expect to continue with similar levels of independent acquisitions. We anticipate closing out the year having repurchased approximately 145 franchise locations and acquiring 65 independent locations for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $60 million. 
Moving to depreciation and amortization. Given the level of franchise repurchases and capital expenditures, we anticipate fiscal year '17 to be the peak year at approximately $175 million to $180 million. In general, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is CapEx-related while the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. 
In regards to capital structure, you recall -- you'll recall that last year, we made significant changes, issuing long-term debt and putting into place our $2 billion line of credit. I'm pleased that we were able to extend the maturity date of the line of credit an additional year to September 2021. And regarding our overall level of debt, we continue to target adjusted gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA levels of 2.5 to 3x and are currently within that range. We believe this will help us achieve our stated objective of maintaining investment-grade credit ratings metrics. Following these capital structure changes last fiscal year, interest expense is expected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million. 
In regards to share repurchases, the year-to-date weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter was approximately 218 million shares. This number will decline on a full year basis due to the weighted average share calculation as our shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were approximately 212 million. As I mentioned earlier, going forward, we will continue to purchase shares opportunistically and have approximately $1.3 billion of our $3.5 billion share repurchase authorization remaining. 
Finally, we continue to do a lot of work around our corporate taxes, and going forward, we expect our long-term effective tax rate to be approximately 34% to 36% with fiscal year 2017 coming in at the low end of this range. Note that this range does not consider any implications of future corporate tax reform, which, as Bill mentioned, would likely be positive for the company. 
I'm excited about what we have in store for this upcoming tax season and beyond, and I look forward to sharing the results with you after the third quarter.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for some closing comments."
276601,410255769,1099889,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 07, 2016",2016-12-07,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. I thought it was important to share all that detail regarding our plans and outlook, so thanks again, Tony.

I thought it was important to share all that detail regarding our plans and outlook, so thanks again, Tony. 
Before I conclude, I want to address the personnel change that we just announced in an 8-K filed this afternoon. Greg Macfarlane, our Senior Vice President of U.S. Retail Operations and Products, has decided to leave the company at the end of this month. Earlier this year, he transitioned to an operating role and performed as his usual high level, as evidenced by his many contributions to our tax season readiness. He will be missed, but we have a strong bench of leaders who are ready to seamlessly take over Greg's responsibilities and execute our plans in season. Personally, I want to thank Greg for his leadership over the past 4.5 years in both his current role and, previously, as our CFO. I am grateful for his many contributions and his friendship. We wish Greg all the best as he pursues the next phase of his career.
Now I'd like to wrap up by spending a few minutes discussing why we believe H&R Block is a strong long-term investment. H&R Block offers investors an opportunity for growth, value and stability. We participate in an industry that offers predictable and consistent growth. Tax filings in the U.S. have historically grown at 1% to 2%, and we expect that to continue. 
Our Tax Plus products contributed over $400 million of revenue in fiscal year '16 and are a differentiator in the marketplace. While the addition of the Refund Advance product does not generate standalone revenue, it is expected to positively impact client volumes and increase the usage of other key products, such as our Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. 
Opportunity for growth in the DIY tax preparation category continue. We are the #2 player in the category and are well positioned for future growth. And as a reminder, H&R Block is the only tax-preparation company that offers taxpayers the ability to complete their taxes in whatever way they choose. Whether that be through assistance, using a DIY method or options that incorporate aspects of both methods, H&R Block provide solutions for all tax filers. 
And finally, there continues to be growth in the international space. Our operations in Canada and Australia provide tangible value to H&R Block, and the opportunities we are cultivating in India will benefit us in the long term. 
From a value perspective, we're taking measures to ensure that our growth will not come at the expense of the bottom line. By taking the previously discussed cost reductions to fund client growth initiatives, we are able to maintain enviable EBITDA margins. We run a capital-light business, which requires minimal infrastructure investment to operate successfully. In fact, our return on invested capital is consistently in the top quartile of the S&P 500. 
And ultimately, the excess cash we generate is returned to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. This fiscal year, we announced a 10% dividend increase. We've paid quarterly dividends consecutively since going public over 50 years ago and deliver a strong dividend yield well above the average in the S&P 500. Finally, regarding share repurchases. Since the start of my tenure, we have repurchased approximately 102 million shares for $2.7 billion. Including dividends, total cash returned to shareholders over this time about -- amounts to $3.9 billion, which is more than double our net income over the same period.
In closing, I want to thank our shareholders. Last year was challenging, and we appreciate the support you've shown. Although we believe we have a plan that will deliver stronger results in tax season '17, we understand that plans are just that, and it's what we deliver that matters. We are playing to win, and we look forward to sharing this season results with you after the third quarter. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Mike?"
