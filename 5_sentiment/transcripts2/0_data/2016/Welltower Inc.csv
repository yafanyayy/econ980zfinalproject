I'm pleased that we finished 2015 with our strongest quarterly performance of the year. These results are driven by solid fundamentals, a disciplined investment thesis and the unique operating platform that we have developed and employed at Welltower over many years. 
Today, I want to highlight 3 topics that are top-of-mind: capital allocation, genesis and senior housing supply. On to the first topic: Capital allocation. This is the most important exercise of any management team and how I spend most of my time. We think about this as the framework for how we maximize shareholder returns. Essentially, every public company has 5 primary ways to deploy capital: acquisitions, investing in the existing business, paying down debt, paying dividends and buying back stock. And four ways to raise capital: internal cash flow, issuing debt, issuing equity, and disposing of assets. So as the equity capital markets were favorable, we took full advantage and built the industry-leading health care real estate portfolio. For us, it was not about winning a pie eating contest, but building unmatched local scale in major metro markets with the best operators in the business. Simply put, we have created a real operating platform, not a passive collection of assets in which success is measured only by year 1 after FO accretion. The good news for our shareholders is we don't take access to the capital markets for granted, and we don't gamble with our shareholder capital. Hence, we took advantage of the strong equity markets to significantly delever our balance sheet.  Now at a less than accommodating public capital market, we are sitting in an enviable position. 
We are also proud that in 2015, the Canadian pension plan, one of the largest investors in commercial real estate in the world, chose Welltower to be its joint-venture partner to make its first investments in health care real estate. Scott Brinker will talk about our most recent venture with CPP as well as our ongoing successful partnership with PSP. 
Welltower has always seen targeted dispositions as an important component of our capital allocation strategy, and 2015 was no exception. We sold the strategic assets, such as our last U.S. hospital asset, realizing an 11% unlevered IRR, and we took advantage of robust pricing and sold our life science portfolio at a 5% yield, realizing an unlevered IRR of 15%. May I remind you that we have sold $4 billion in assets over the last 5 years for cash and used that cash to buy better quality real estate and delever the balance sheet. 
Over the medium-term, we still see opportunity for targeted acquisitions to go deeper into markets where we have local scale in our senior housing business, and we also see enormous opportunity to grow our outpatient medical business. But only with the best health systems in this country. 
I talked about our desire to develop relationships with the leading academic medical centers on my very first investor call in May 2014. I told you that this would not happen overnight as institutions like Johns Hopkins and Cleveland Clinic really don't need our capital. However, increasingly, what they do realize they need from Welltower is our expertise in seniors housing, residential Alzheimer's care and read my lips, post-acute care, and the connectivity of the best-in-class operators that we bring to the table. I'm happy to tell you that these discussions are now starting to bear fruit and, for example, we now own 3 facilities with Johns Hopkins, which is the number one rated health system in the United States. 
So to talk about Genesis. I want to make it very clear, we believe in Genesis and the value that post-acute operators, like Genesis, bring to lowering health care costs and improving outcomes. 
The challenges facing the post-acute industry as a transition to a value-based care system are well known. If you sit with the CEOs of the leading nonprofit health systems in the U.S. like we do at Welltower, they realize that they need to connect to this expertise more than ever as they move to the reality of bundled payments. Have you seen the performance of the for-profit acute care hospital sector lately? After a brief benefit from the ACA that peaked in the second quarter of 2015, the cold reality is that higher co-pays are translating into a drop in hospital visits. This is why Welltower, as of year end 2015, no longer owns acute care hospitals in the U.S. We believe operating in margin pressures will push acute care operators to move patients to lower cost outpatient and post-acute settings. 
We are optimistic that operators like Genesis, that are delivering next-generation post-acute care, will become the preferred providers to the top end health systems and add a large inventory of low Q-Mix sniffs get taken out of service. 
We understand the market is a voting machine in the short run and the votes are in. While the market has implied the destruction of the majority of the equity value in our investment in Genesis, I can assure you that there is significant value in this relationship and in this investment. Scott Brinker is going to talk more about that in detail. 
Finally, to the topic of senior housing supply. You may recall we had a long discussion about this topic on the third quarter call. We continue to believe the fear of supply in the U.S. is overblown. There's no doubt that certain markets are oversupplied, but we are primarily in markets where it is difficult to build and hence, believe our performance will be resilient. You can look at the portfolio performance this quarter as evidence of this resiliency, as senior housing operating occupancy is rebounded sequentially, up 80 basis points, and same-store NOI was up 4.3% in the U.S. 
Like most companies in health care, and I know you're seeing this in the retail sector as well, we are seeing wage pressure in some parts of the U.S. due to increases in the minimum wage, and we're seeing it in the U.K. due to the imposition of the national living wage. Increased supply where it has impact will most likely exacerbate that problem. We are working with our operating partners to capture new labor efficiencies and identify opportunities for enhanced pricing power. 
In conclusion, we believe we have a superior portfolio in superior markets, best-in-class operating and capital partners and a seasoned team to execute across all markets. With the right assets in the right markets, we will prove the thesis that health care real estate has lower downside and better upside over the cycle. 
Now I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker."

We now have unmatched scale in the markets where you want to own real estate. 77 properties in Southern California, 47 in greater London and 281 on the eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C. Our history in the business tells us these markets will produce superior results. 
We're entering a period of increased separation among companies. Our real estate quality will stand out more than ever. Each business segment turned in a strong fourth quarter, the results showed that our capital allocation is paying off. The operating portfolio trended higher, with 3.3% same-store NOI growth. Fundamentals are solid. Occupancy was up 20 basis points and rates increased 3.2%. Importantly, we're not buying the growth, as CapEx remains at very modest levels. The age of our properties is a material competitive advantage. 
Performance in the U.S. continues to be strong, with 4.3% same-store NOI growth. Large metro markets once again outperformed, validating our capital allocation. 
Same-store NOI in Canada grew 4.6%, despite an economy with near 0 inflation, highlighting the resiliency of our business. The U.K. portfolio is poised for a rebound this year based on recent revenue trends. 
Several Wall Street analysts recently ranked our outpatient medical portfolio as #1 in asset quality. The impact can be seen in our results. We hit all-time highs in occupancy and tenant retention last year, leading to another solid quarter, with 3.1% same-store NOI growth. Visibility is the key word here, and there are 3 drivers: one, very little lease rollover; two, when leases do roll, we typically renew more than 80% of them; and three, nearly all of our buildings are sponsored by health system. That's important because they act as a magnet for other tenants. The space leased directly to a health system is climbing and now sits at 60%. We see that number moving even higher as hospitals transition more and more services to outpatient settings. 
I'll move to triple net, a highly visible income stream that contributes half of our earnings. Same-store seniors housing NOI increased 3.2%, while post-acute long-term care increased 3.1%. 
We've been eagerly anticipating a chance to talk about the next topic, which is Genesis. Dramatic underperformance by managed care who is not in our portfolio is unfairly implicating Genesis, if not, the entire industry. Industry headwinds clearly exist, but they are not new. In fact, we've been preparing for years, including selling nearly $1 billion of last generation skilled nursing assets. And rather than focusing exclusively on the short-term headwinds, we also considered the bigger picture. According to Avalir, a highly regarded research firm, the dramatic increase in the Medicare population will more than offset the decline in length of stay and per capita utilization. As a result, the number of skilled nursing Medicare days is expected to increase by more than 10% over the next 5 years. That data reminds us that skilled nursing plays an important role in cost effective health care delivery. 
There's a reason we haven't suffered any lease rejections or rent reductions like other skilled nursing landlords. One, strong payment coverage. The cash flow from the Genesis properties that we own fully supports the rent payment to Genesis -- to Welltower. Our Genesis properties generate nearly $1.60 of operating income for every $1 of rent. Given the profitability inside the walls of our buildings that parent guarantee is simply an additional security blanket. And that parent guarantee does have value. Parent company fixed charge coverage increased last year and Genesis expects further improvement this year to north of 1.3x. 
Two, we've been actively managing the portfolio since the day we closed the sale lease back 5 years ago. That includes selling underperforming buildings, funding new development and acquisitions with strong coverage and facilitating mergers that generate synergies. And three, Genesis is a superior operator. Despite the challenging environment, our property level of Genesis payment coverage is only 1 basis point lower than it was 4 years ago -- 1 basis point. Property level EBITDAR increased a healthy 2.5% per year during that period. And remember that we own the legacy Genesis portfolio, which is concentrated in the mid-Atlantic and New England. These are hands down, their absolute core assets. 
Final comment here is that we expect Genesis to refinance our mortgage loans, with significant pay downs coming this year in line with the business plan. 
Turning to 4Q investments. We closed $1.5 billion at a 6.8% initial yield. It's fair to say that 2016 investment of volume will look much different than previous years. Capital allocation helped drive our historical outperformance and remained a top priority. Every day, we looked at the relationship between cap rates and our cost of capital. Discrepancies, plus or minus, provide an opportunity to create value. We have the luxury of not needing to make any rash decisions but if buyers have an aggressive yield asset value, we'll be happy to crystallize value in select properties. 
By design, our investment pipeline is quite limited today, and we can fully fund it with operating cash flow and in-process asset sales. 
I want to share color on a new relationship, a superb operator called Discovery Senior Living. Last quarter, we acquired 6 high-performing independent living communities in Florida that Discovery built and will continue to co-own and manage. The properties are typically 100% full with a waiting list. Significant renovations are nearly complete, which would allow Discovery to market the properties at a higher price point, generating strong earnings growth. 
To fund the acquisition, we partnered with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, or CPP. This marks their first investment in U.S. senior housing, again highlighting the confidence in our platform by one of the world's leading investors. 
The other major acquisition last quarter was with Riviera, where we partnered with PSP, a long time and important pension fund partner of ours. The acquisition deepens our large metro market footprint. Welltower will receive a 6.1% preferred return that grows by 4% per year through 2020. We sold our final U.S. inpatient hospital last quarter. The number of hospital beds has been nearly cut in half the past few decades and there are foreclosures coming. The old physical plants require massive CapEx and even then, the buildings are often unprepared for advances in technology. 
We also see an adverse selection problem. The hospitals looking for sale-leasebacks are too often the ones you don't want to do business with. 
I'll wrap up with our excitement about the current environment. The last down cycle laid the foundation for what Welltower has come. The next few years will be the ideal environment to take another leap forward. 
Now, to Scott Estes."

My financial message today echoes the capital allocation team that has been essential to our long-term successes and organization. Calendar 2015 was an important year for HCN and that we positioned the balance sheet for the current period of volatility by opportunistically raising equity in response to the strength of our investment pipeline. 90% of the investments closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 were negotiated during the first half of the year. And while there's always an urge to perfectly time the equity market, we're glad that we chose to prefund the majority of this activity, allowing us to end the year with essentially the same conservative leverage ratios that we started within 2015. 
While we're poised to generate another year of solid financial results and dividend growth in 2016, our net asset seller message and public guidance for the upcoming year reflects our current mindset of remaining both disciplined and opportunistic while protecting our downside. More specifically, our ability to utilize dispositions as a source of capital in the current environment should provide multiple benefits. It should allow us to maintain or further reduce leverage. We can enhance our asset quality in private pay mix, and we can maintain adequate liquidity and execute our 2016 capital plan within a self-funded framework. 
Given the recent uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic fact drop, our conservative approach leaves us well-positioned to wait out the current storm as we continue to appropriately allocate capital to maximize shareholder value. 
I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our fourth quarter financial performance and changes in our supplemental disclosure. As Tom said, we had a great fourth quarter as normalized FFO came in at $1.13 per share and normalized FAD was $0.99 per share, representing strong 10% and 9% year-over-year increases, respectively. Results were driven primarily by the solid same-store cash NOI increase, averaging 3.1% for the full year, and the $3.6 billion of net investments completed over the last 12 months. 
I note that our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the fourth quarter declined to 73% and 83%, respectively. There were two noteworthy items on our income statement this quarter that I'd like to take a moment to explain. First, we incurred $35.6 million in other expenses this quarter which represented a noncash charge related to marking the value of our Genesis stockholdings to market at year end. And as a reminder, we essentially received our initial $58.5 million in stock for free and as represented the amount our purchase option for 9.9% of Genesis within the money at the time they went public. 
Conversely on the positive side of the ledger, we realized a gain on the sale of asset of $31.4 million in the quarter, which is largely due to the profitable disposition of our final U.S. acute care hospital during the period. 
In terms of dividends, we'll pay our 179th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on February 22 of $0.86 per share. This new annualized rate of $3.44 per share represents a 4.2% increase over our 2015 dividend level and a current yield of 6.1%. 
In terms of our supplement this quarter, the only notable changes on page 2 where we did add a table providing detail on the number and dollar value of the individual acquisitions and joint ventures completed each year. 
Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The fourth quarter was an active one in terms of capital raising activity for the company. In October, we completed the sale of $500 million of unsecured debt, price yields of just under 4.3% through a reopening of our 10-year notes due June 2025. And in November, we successfully tapped the Canadian senior note market for the first time in our history, completing the sale of CAD 300 million of 5-year notes, priced yield just over 3.4%. 
In terms of equity, we issued 1.1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program, generating $66 million in proceeds, and we tapped our ATM program for the first time since 2012, issuing 696,000 shares at an average price of $69.23, raising another $47 million. 
We also generated $225 million of proceeds through the sale of non-strategic assets and loan payoffs. And finally, we repaid approximately $104 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.9% and assumed or issued $674 million of secured debt at a blended 3.3% rate. 
So importantly, as a result, we have over $2 billion of liquidity entering 2016, with only $350 million of line borrowings, net of the $361 million in cash on balance sheet and the $124 million of cash received from CPP's Discovery portfolio buy-ins subsequent to year-end. 
Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of 2015 remain in excellent shape. As of December 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 39.9% and net debt to enterprise value was 32.7%. 
Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA stood at 5.6x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter was strong at 4.3x and 3.4x, respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 12% of total assets to quarter end. 
In light of the recent strength of the U.S. dollar against both the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar, I would like to remind you of our hedging strategy entering 2016. We've minimized any material risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Through a combination of unsecured and property level debt denominated in local currencies and other currency hedges in place, our international investments are approximately 87% hedged from a balance sheet perspective and 83% hedged from an earnings perspective. So as a result, the sensitivity of both currencies moving 10% in relation to the U.S. dollar from current levels would impact our earnings either up or down by only $0.01 per share this year. 
Finally, I'll conclude my comments today with an overview of the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. In terms of same-store cash NOI growth, we're forecasting blended growth of 2.5% to 3% in 2016, as we continue to project solid predictable internal growth across our portfolio. 
To further break down this forecast by asset type, first, for our seniors housing operating portfolio, we're projecting growth in the 2% to 3% range as we remain confident in the operating environment and our operator's relative performance. 
For our seniors housing triple net portfolio, we anticipate growth of approximately 2.5% to 3%. For our long-term care post-acute portfolio, we're projecting an increase of approximately 3%. And last, for our outpatient medical portfolio, we project an increase of approximately 2% to 2.5%, driven primarily by annual rate increases, continued strong occupancy, very low turnover and a retention rate of approximately 80%. 
In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions beyond what we've announced to date in our formal guidance. As a result, the only acquisitions included in our 2016 guidance are the approximate $163 million of investments through our main street partnership and an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. Our 2016 guidance also includes $419 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 8.2%. 
In terms of dispositions, we've included $1 billion of dispositions in our forecast. This is comprised of $178 million of proceeds from assets currently held for sale at a blended yield on sale of 7.2%, with the remainder representing loan payoffs and other potential property sales. 
Although we prefer to avoid any specifics of what we might sell this year, Tom said earlier, we have a successful history of selling not only non-strategic assets, but also more opportunistic asset sales to lock in attractive values. My point here is that we have multiple options in our approach to sales this year and believe there are no pools of assets that are off limits as we evaluate asset sales to most efficiently allocate capital. 
Our capital expenditure forecast this year is $83 million, which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $28 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio. As Scott mentioned, these amounts continue to represent a relatively modest 7% to 8% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories due to our generally more modern portfolio. 
Our G&A forecast is approximately $160 million to $165 million for 2016, as the majority of growth on a year-over-year basis is due to the annualized 2016 impact of hires and infrastructure investments made during 2015. We remain very comfortable with these spending levels to support the continued growth of the organization. 
I would also note that we expect first quarter G&A to be slightly higher than the average for the year as it typically includes accelerated expensing of stock-based compensation for certain employees and directors. 
We anticipate incurring income tax expense of approximately $16 million to $18 million in 2016, based on our latest estimation of taxable income that is largely generated by our seniors housing operating portfolio. 
And finally, as a result of all these assumptions, we expect to report 2016 FFO in a range of 4 50 to 4 60 per diluted share, and FAD in the range of 3 95 to 4 05 per diluted share, both of which represents 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results. 
So in conclusion, our focus on capital allocation entering 2016 prioritizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage, and retaining ample liquidity until the broader capital markets environment improves. 
So at this point in time, I'll turn it back to you for your closing remarks."

The first, I think, was the 2% to 3% growth outlook and how did we get there. And from where we sit today, our same-store occupancy is slightly above last year, so that's a good starting point. I've said on a number of occasions that 90-plus percent of NOI in the senior housing space can be explained in 3 variables: Occupancy rate in labor. So I just talked about one of them. Occupancy looks good, but we've been conservative in our guidance and assumed essentially no change in occupancy through the year. Just given what's happening in the economy and the recent new supply, hopefully, we'll be better than that, but that's what's within our guidance. And then on rate, we've continued to grow in the 3% to 3.5% range and that's generally what we expect in 2016. And the third component is labor, and that's probably the one where -- I wouldn't say we're worried, but it could be a bit higher this year than it has been recently. A number of stage and cities have increases in the minimum wage and certainly, the new supply in certain markets does impact the labor pool. So we're expecting compensation expense to be a bit higher in the rate growth this year in our budget. And that's what leads into the 2% to 3% projection for the year.  Now longer term, what I'd tell you is we projected in the 4% to 5%, when we made our first [indiscernible] investment more than 5 years ago. Obviously, we've done better than that on average. There will be fluctuations. We also probably didn't expect the inflation would be virtually 0 when we made that projection, which is where it's at today in a lot of our core markets and yet we're still growing in the low 3s. So what we feel confident in is that we'll continue to outperform this sector, which we've done year-after-year after year and then we'll outperform our peers. And that's probably a better way to answer the long-term growth outlook, Josh. It's so hard to say for sure what the overall economy is going to look like."

And the other thing I would mention is, they have a much lower Medicare mix and that probably has an impact on why they've held up better over the past 4 years because a lot of the pressure has been on the Medicare side of the business. And the other distinction I would make is the results of the corporate level. So I talked about property level cash flow being more than adequate to pay their rent, but there's also a huge difference in terms of the corporate cash flow, which provides a significant security blanket for our rent payment, and they've been able to grow that cash flow through merger synergies and they'll growth it going forward to refinancing and probably some asset buybacks."

We have a lot of antiquated acute care hospital infrastructure in this country. So while I'd like to think we could go it alone and the capital markets will accommodate us to fund every bit of capital need that we will -- that we will need to build this infrastructure, we aren't that -- we're not that big of a gambler.

I think the number that you're referring to is in the supplement. So I'll just use the 3-mile radius as an example, because we still think that's the most appropriate for our urban locations based on where residents usually come from. We had a more suburban or world market portfolio, I think, 5, 10 miles is more appropriate but for Welltower, I think 3 miles really is the best radius to be looking at. So in this quarter's supplement, we say that 1.7% of our total NOI is impacted by new supply, okay. And that assumes that all of the NOI from the properties that we own will be impacted 100% by the new supplies, so it's kind of a worst-case scenario, meaning if you take all the properties in our portfolio, they're impacted by new supply. That 1.7% assumes that NOI in those properties goes to 0, which is obviously not going to happen. In fact, our history is that properties in our portfolio that are subject to new supply have actually held up quite well when new supply enters the market. And we've studied it for years. If we look at the performance before and after the new competition enters the market and on average, occupancy is pretty much flat and NOI has been up 4% on average. So it's not the draconian downside necessarily that people assume."

And so yes, there's a need for post-acute, of course, over the long term, but the question is, no one really knows what the ultimate landing point of all this is. And could there be a significant enough upspread versus your rents so there's a possibility that will ultimately make this okay? So while the temptation is to maybe grossly [indiscernible] as much as possible, do you think the ending here ultimately over the long term, will be lower rent growth in the industry so that you're partnering correctly with post-acute -- post-acute operator, Genesis, Genesis and others?

You can only buy hospitals that we would, today, that we consider not good long-term investments. We believe that much of the hospital supply that exist today in this country will be taken out of service. It will follow the path of many other sectors of real estate that you've seen taken out of service. We got a lot of empty department stores [indiscernible], struggling malls in this country. Remember, there was a day that every city in America had its own unique department stores that were part of the social fabric. And those don't exist today because most of them have gone away or they're called Macy's. And you'll -- I predict that many of these communities that all have numerous acute care hospital systems in the next 10, 20 years, you'll see very few and you'll see the big not-for-profit brand names in health care. So the Cleveland clinic's, the Mayo Clinic's, the Johns Hopkins start to proliferate into other markets. So I think you can look a little bit of history and for a real estate perspective to know that a lot of hospital supply that you could buy today is probably going to be if you think the cap rates are attractive today, just with little while because there going to be more attentive when you're buying buildings that are taken out of service. So this is not an area that we built deploy capital equipment we think that is not that a strategy for our shareholders."

I'm pleased that we finished 2015 with our strongest quarterly performance of the year. These results are driven by solid fundamentals, a disciplined investment thesis and the unique operating platform that we have developed and employed at Welltower over many years.
Today, I want to highlight 3 topics that are top of mind: capital allocation, Genesis and senior housing supply. On to the first topic, capital allocation. This is the most important exercise of any management team and how I spend most of my time. We think about this as the framework for how we maximize shareholder returns. Essentially, every public company has 5 primary ways to deploy capital: acquisitions, investing in the existing business, paying down debt, paying dividends and buying back stock. And 4 ways to raise capital: internal cash flow, issuing debt, issuing equity and disposing of assets. So when the equity capital markets were favorable, we took full advantage and built the industry-leading health care real estate portfolio. For us, it was not about winning a pie eating contest, but building unmatched local scale in major metro markets with the best operators in the business. Simply put, we have created a real operating platform, not a passive collection of assets in which success is measured only by year 1 FFO accretion. The good news for our shareholders is we don't take access to the capital markets for granted and we don't gamble with our shareholder capital. Hence, we took advantage of the strong equity market to significantly delever our balance sheet. Now in a less than accommodating public capital market, we are sitting in an enviable position.
We are also proud that in 2015, the Canadian Pension Plan, one of the largest investors in commercial real estate in the world, chose Welltower to be its joint-venture partner to make its first investment in health care real estate. Scott Brinker will talk about our most recent venture with CPP as well as our ongoing successful partnership with PSP.
Welltower has always seen targeted dispositions as an important component of our capital allocation strategy, and 2015 was no exception. We sold less strategic assets, such as our last U.S. hospital asset, realizing an 11% unlevered IRR, and we took advantage of robust pricing and sold our Life Science portfolio at a 5% yield, realizing an unlevered IRR of 15%. May I remind you that we have sold $4 billion in assets over the last 5 years for cash and used that cash to buy better quality real estate and delever the balance sheet.
Over the medium term, we still see opportunity for targeted acquisitions to go deeper into markets where we have local scale in our senior housing business, and we also see enormous opportunity to grow our outpatient medical business, but only with the best health systems in this country.
I talked about our desire to develop relationships with the leading academic medical centers on my very first investor call in May 2014. I told you that this would not happen overnight as institutions like Johns Hopkins and Cleveland Clinic really don't need our capital. However, increasingly, what they do realize they need from Welltower is our expertise in seniors housing, residential Alzheimer's care and read my lips, post-acute care, and the connectivity of the best-in-class operators that we bring to the table. I am happy to tell you that these discussions are now starting to bear fruit and for example, we now own 3 facilities with Johns Hopkins, which is the #1 rated health system in the United States.
So let's talk about Genesis. I want to make it very clear, we believe in Genesis and the value that post-acute operators like Genesis bring to lowering health care costs and improving outcomes. The challenges facing the post-acute industry as it transitions to a value-based care system are well known. If you sit with the CEOs of the leading nonprofit health systems in the U.S., like we do at Welltower, they realize that they need to connect to this expertise more than ever as they move to the reality of bundled payments. Have you seen the performance of the for-profit acute care hospital sector lately? After a brief benefit from the ACA that peaked in the second quarter of 2015, the cold reality is that higher co-pays are translating to a drop in hospital visits. This is why Welltower, as of year end 2015, no longer owns acute care hospitals in the U.S. We believe operating and margin pressures will push acute care operators to move patients to lower cost outpatient and post-acute settings.
We are optimistic that operators like Genesis, that are delivering next-generation post-acute care, will become the preferred providers to the top end health systems and have a large inventory of low Q-Mix SNFs get taken out of service.
We understand the market is a voting machine in the short run and the votes are in. While the market has implied the destruction of the majority of the equity value in our investment in Genesis, I can assure you that there is significant value in this relationship and in this investment. Scott Brinker is going to talk more about that in detail.
Finally, to the topic of senior housing supply. You may recall we had a long discussion about this topic on the third quarter call. We continue to believe the fear of supply in the U.S. is overblown. There's no doubt that certain markets are oversupplied, but we are primarily in markets where it is difficult to build and hence, believe our performance will be resilient. You can look at the portfolio performance this quarter as evidence of this resiliency, as senior housing operating occupancy has rebounded sequentially, up 80 basis points, and same-store NOI was up 4.3% in the U.S.
Like most companies in health care, and I know you're seeing this in the retail sector as well, we are seeing wage pressure in some parts of the U.S. due to increases in the minimum wage, and we're seeing it in the U.K. due to the imposition of the national living wage. Increased supply where it has impact will most likely exacerbate that problem. We are working with our operating partners to capture new labor efficiencies and identify opportunities for enhanced pricing power.
In conclusion, we believe we have a superior portfolio in superior markets, best-in-class operating and capital partners and a seasoned team to execute across all markets. With the right assets in the right markets, we will prove the thesis that health care real estate has lower downside and better upside over a cycle.
Now I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker."

We now have unmatched scale in the markets where you want to own real estate: 77 properties in Southern California, 47 in Greater London and 281 on the Eastern Seaboard from Boston to D.C. Our history in the business tells us these markets will produce superior results.
We're entering a period of increased separation among companies. Our real estate quality will stand out more than ever. Each business segment turned in a strong fourth quarter. The results show that our capital allocation is paying off. The operating portfolio trended higher, with 3.3% same-store NOI growth. Fundamentals are solid. Occupancy was up 20 basis points and rates increased 3.2%. Importantly, we're not buying the growth, as CapEx remains at very modest levels. The age of our properties is a material competitive advantage.
Performance in the U.S. continues to be strong, with 4.3% same-store NOI growth. Large metro markets once again outperformed, validating our capital allocation.
Same-store NOI in Canada grew 4.6% despite an economy with near 0 inflation, highlighting the resiliency of our business. The U.K. portfolio is poised for a rebound this year based on recent revenue trends.
Several Wall Street analysts recently ranked our outpatient medical portfolio as #1 in asset quality. The impact can be seen in our results. We hit all-time highs in occupancy and tenant retention last year, leading to another solid quarter with 3.1% same-store NOI growth. Visibility is the key word here, and there are 3 drivers: one, very little lease rollover; two, when leases do roll, we typically renew more than 80% of them; and three, nearly all of our buildings are sponsored by a health system. That's important because they act as a magnet for other tenants. The space leased directly to a health system is climbing and now sits at 60%. We see that number moving even higher as hospitals transition more and more services to outpatient settings.
I'll move to triple net, a highly visible income stream that contributes half of our earnings. Same-store seniors housing NOI increased 3.2%, while post-acute long-term care increased 3.1%.
We've been eagerly anticipating a chance to talk about the next topic, which is Genesis. Dramatic underperformance by ManorCare, who is not in our portfolio, is unfairly implicating Genesis, if not an entire industry. Industry headwinds clearly exist, but they are not new. In fact, we've been preparing for years, including selling nearly $1 billion of last-generation skilled nursing assets. And rather than focusing exclusively on the short-term headwinds, we also consider the bigger picture. According to Avalere, a highly regarded research firm, the dramatic increase in the Medicare population will more than offset the decline in length of stay and per capita utilization. As a result, the number of skilled nursing Medicare days is expected to increase by more than 10% over the next 5 years. That data reminds us that skilled nursing plays an important role in cost effective health care delivery.
There's a reason we haven't suffered any lease rejections or rent reductions like other skilled nursing landlords. One, strong payment coverage. The cash flow from the Genesis properties that we own fully supports the rent payment to Genesis -- to Welltower. Our Genesis properties generate nearly $1.60 of operating income for every $1 of rent. Given the profitability inside the walls of our buildings, the parent guarantee is simply an additional security blanket. And that parent guarantee does have value. Parent company fixed charge coverage increased last year and Genesis expects further improvement this year to north of 1.3x.
Two, we've been actively managing the portfolio since the day we closed the sale leaseback 5 years ago. That includes selling underperforming buildings, funding new development and acquisitions with strong coverage and facilitating mergers that generate synergies. And three, Genesis is a superior operator. Despite the challenging environment, our property level Genesis payment coverage is only 1 basis point lower than it was 4 years ago, 1 basis point. Property level EBITDAR increased a healthy 2.5% per year during that period. And remember that we own the legacy Genesis portfolio, which is concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic and New England. These are hands down their absolute core assets.
Final comment here is that we expect Genesis to refinance our mortgage loans, with significant pay-downs coming this year in line with the business plan.
Turning to 4Q investments. We closed $1.5 billion at a 6.8% initial yield. It's fair to say that 2016 investment volume will look much different than previous years. Capital allocation help drive our historical outperformance and remains a top priority. Every day, we look at the relationship between cap rates and our cost of capital. Discrepancies, plus or minus, provide an opportunity to create value. We have the luxury of not needing to make any rash decisions, but if buyers have an aggressive view of asset value, we'll be happy to crystallize value in select properties. By design, our investment pipeline is quite limited today, and we can fully fund it with operating cash flow and in-process asset sales.
I want to share color on a new relationship, a superb operator called Discovery Senior Living. Last quarter, we acquired 6 high-performing independent living communities in Florida that Discovery built and will continue to co-own and manage. The properties are typically 100% full with a waiting list. Significant renovations are nearly complete, which will allow Discovery to market the properties at a higher price point, generating strong earnings growth.
To fund the acquisition, we partnered with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board or CPP. This marks their first investment in U.S. senior housing, again, highlighting the confidence in our platform by one of the world's leading investors.
The other major acquisition last quarter was with Revera, where we partnered with PSP, a long time and important pension fund partner of ours. The acquisition deepens our large metro market footprint. Welltower will receive a 6.1% preferred return that grows by 4% per year through 2020.
We sold our final U.S. inpatient hospital last quarter. The number of hospital beds has been nearly cut in half the past few decades and there are more closures coming. The old physical plants require massive CapEx and even then, the buildings are often unprepared for advances in technology. We also see an adverse selection problem. The hospitals looking for sale leasebacks are too often the ones you don't want to do business with.
I'll wrap up with our excitement about the current environment. The last down cycle laid the foundation for what Welltower has become. The next few years will be the ideal environment to take another leap forward.
Now to Scott Estes."

My financial message today echoes the capital allocation theme that has been essential to our long-term success as an organization. Calendar 2015 was an important year for HCN in that we positioned the balance sheet for the current period of volatility by opportunistically raising equity in response to the strength of our investment pipeline. 90% of the investments closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 were negotiated during the first half of the year. And while there's always an urge to perfectly time the equity market, we're glad that we chose to prefund the majority of this activity, allowing us to end the year with essentially the same conservative leverage ratios that we started with in 2015.
While we're poised to generate another year of solid financial results and dividend growth in 2016, our net asset seller message and public guidance for the upcoming year reflects our current mindset of remaining both disciplined and opportunistic while protecting our downside. More specifically, our ability to utilize dispositions as a source of capital in the current environment should provide multiple benefits. It should allow us to maintain or further reduce leverage. We can enhance our asset quality in private pay mix, and we can maintain adequate liquidity and execute our 2016 capital plan within a self-funded framework.
Given the recent uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic backdrop, our conservative approach leaves us well positioned to wait out the current storm as we continue to appropriately allocate capital to maximize shareholder value.
I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our fourth quarter financial performance and changes in our supplemental disclosure. As Tom said, we had a great fourth quarter as normalized FFO came in at $1.13 per share and normalized FAD was $0.99 per share, representing strong 10% and 9% year-over-year increases, respectively. Results were driven primarily by the solid same-store cash NOI increase, averaging 3.1% for the full year, and the $3.6 billion of net investments completed over the last 12 months.
I note that our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the fourth quarter declined to 73% and 83%, respectively. There were 2 noteworthy items on our income statement this quarter that I'd like to take a moment to explain. First, we incurred $35.6 million in other expenses this quarter, which represented a noncash charge related to marking the value of our Genesis stockholdings to market at year end. And as a reminder, we essentially received our initial $58.5 million in stock for free as it represented the amount or purchase option for 9.9% of Genesis that was in the money at the time they went public.
Conversely on the positive side of the ledger, we realized a gain on the sale of assets of $31.4 million in the quarter, which was largely due to the profitable disposition of our final U.S. acute care hospital during the period.
In terms of dividends, we'll pay our 179th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on February 22 of $0.86 per share. This new annualized rate of $3.44 per share represents a 4.2% increase over our 2015 dividend level and a current yield of 6.1%.
In terms of our supplement this quarter, the only notable change is on Page 2, where we did add a table providing detail on the number and dollar value of the individual acquisitions and joint ventures completed each year.
Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The fourth quarter was an active one in terms of capital raising activity for the company. In October, we completed the sale of $500 million of unsecured debt priced to yield just under 4.3% through a reopening of our 10-year notes due June 2025. And in November, we successfully tapped the Canadian senior note market for the first time in our history, completing the sale of CAD 300 million of 5-year notes priced to yield just over 3.4%.
In terms of equity, we issued 1.1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program, generating $66 million in proceeds, and we tapped our ATM program for the first time since 2012, issuing 696,000 shares at an average price of $69.23, raising another $47 million.
We also generated $225 million of proceeds through the sale of nonstrategic assets and loan payoffs. And finally, we repaid approximately $104 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.9% and assumed or issued $674 million of secured debt at a blended 3.3% rate.
So importantly, as a result, we have over $2 billion of liquidity entering 2016, with only $350 million of line borrowings, net of the $361 million in cash on balance sheet and the $124 million of cash received from CPP's Discovery portfolio buy-in subsequent to year-end.
Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of 2015 remain in excellent shape. As of December 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 39.9% and net debt to enterprise value was 32.7%.
Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA stood at 5.6x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter were strong at 4.3x and 3.4x, respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 12% of total assets at quarter end.
In light of the recent strength of the U.S. dollar against both the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar, I would like to remind you of our hedging strategy entering 2016. We've minimized any material risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Through a combination of unsecured and property level debt denominated in local currencies and other currency hedges in place, our international investments are approximately 87% hedged from a balance sheet perspective and 83% hedged from an earnings perspective. So as a result, the sensitivity of both currencies moving 10% in relation to the U.S. dollar from current levels would impact our earnings either up or down by only $0.01 per share this year.
Finally, I'll conclude my comments today with an overview of the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. In terms of same-store cash NOI growth, we're forecasting blended growth of 2.5% to 3% in 2016, as we continue to project solid predictable internal growth across our portfolio.
To further break down this forecast by asset type, first, for our seniors housing operating portfolio, we're projecting growth in the 2% to 3% range as we remain confident in the operating environment and our operators' relative performance.
For our seniors housing triple net portfolio, we anticipate growth of approximately 2.5% to 3%. For our long-term care post-acute portfolio, we're projecting an increase of approximately 3%. And last, for our outpatient medical portfolio, we project an increase of approximately 2% to 2.5%, driven primarily by annual rate increases, continued strong occupancy, very low turnover and a retention rate of approximately 80%.
In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions beyond what we've announced to date in our formal guidance. As a result, the only acquisitions included in our 2016 guidance are the approximate $163 million of investments through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. Our 2016 guidance also includes $419 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 8.2%.
In terms of dispositions, we have included $1 billion of dispositions in our forecast. This is comprised of $178 million of proceeds from assets currently held for sale at a blended yield on sale of 7.2%, with the remainder representing loan payoffs and other potential property sales.
Although we prefer to avoid any specifics of what we might sell this year, as Tom said earlier, we have a successful history of selling not only nonstrategic assets, but also more opportunistic asset sales to lock in attractive values. My point here is that we have multiple options in our approach to sales this year and believe there are no pools of assets that are off limits as we evaluate asset sales to most efficiently allocate capital.
Our capital expenditure forecast this year is $83 million, which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $28 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio. As Scott mentioned, these amounts continue to represent a relatively modest 7% to 8% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories due to our generally more modern portfolio.
Our G&A forecast is approximately $160 million to $165 million for 2016. The majority of growth on a year-over-year basis is due to the annualized 2016 impact of hires and infrastructure investments made during 2015. We remain very comfortable with these spending levels to support the continued growth of the organization.
I would also note that we expect first quarter G&A to be slightly higher than the average for the year as it typically includes accelerated expensing of stock-based compensation for certain employees and directors.
We anticipate incurring income tax expense of approximately $16 million to $18 million in 2016, based on our latest estimation of taxable income that is largely generated by our seniors housing operating portfolio.
And finally, as a result of all these assumptions, we expect to report 2016 FFO in a range of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represent 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
So in conclusion, our focus on capital allocation entering 2016 prioritizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage, and retaining ample liquidity until the broader capital markets environment improves.
So at this point, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for your closing remarks."

I want to leave you with the message that we are confident in our ability to create shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. Let me remind you that when senior housing was in disarray because of lack of capital post financial crisis or because of the oversupply in the early part of the century, our shareholders benefited tremendously and we grew exponentially by recapitalizing the industry.
Today, we are in the strongest position we have ever been with our leading balance sheet, long-term institutional capital partners like CPP and PSP, our portfolio of best-in-class operators, significant local scale in top markets and a deep understanding of how all these work together as a real operating platform, not a financially engineered yield portfolio.
I could not be more excited of what lies ahead for Welltower. So for the Q&A, we have a few other folks in the room here. We've got 2 that are well known to you, Paul Nungester and Steve Schroeder. And 2 that are new on the Q&A, but who I think are well known to lots of people on the phone, Tim Lordan and Shankh Mitra.

The first, I think, was the 2% to 3% growth outlook and how did we get there. And from where we sit today, our same-store occupancy is slightly above last year, so that's a good starting point. I've said on a number of occasions that 90-plus percent of NOI in the senior housing space can be explained in 3 variables: occupancy, rate and labor. So I just talked about one of them. Occupancy looks good, but we've been conservative in our guidance and assumed essentially no change in occupancy through the year, just given what's happening in the economy and there is some new supply. Now hopefully, we'll do better than that, but that's what's in our guidance. And then on rate, we've continued to grow in the 3% to 3.5% range. And that's generally what we expect in 2016. And the third component is labor. And that's probably the one where -- I wouldn't say we're worried, but it could be a bit higher this year than it has been recently. A number of states and cities have increases in the minimum wage. And certainly, the new supply in certain markets does impact the labor pool. So we're expecting compensation expense to be a bit higher than rate growth this year in our budget. And that's what leads into the 2% to 3% projection for the year. Now longer term, what I'd tell you is we projected in the 4% to 5% range when we made our first RIDEA investment more than 5 years ago. Obviously, we've done better than that on average. There will be fluctuations. We also probably didn't expect that inflation would be virtually 0 when we made that projection, which is where it's at today in a lot of our core markets, and yet we're still growing in the low 3s. So what we feel confident in is that we'll continue to outperform the sector, which we've done year after year after year and then we'll outperform our peers. And that's probably a better way to answer the long-term growth outlook, Josh. It's so hard to say for sure what the overall economy is going to look like."

They clearly are facing some industry headwinds, but those headwinds aren't new. Medicare Advantage has been an issue for years and years, putting pressure on length of stay and rate and Genesis has stayed ahead by getting out of certain assets, acquiring assets that are better fits for the current environment and actively managing their labor cost, which again is the most significant operating expense. And the other thing I would mention is, they have a much lower Medicare mix, and that probably has an impact on why they've held up better over the past 4 years because a lot of the pressure has been on the Medicare side of the business. And the other distinction I would make is the results at the corporate level. So I talked about property level cash flow being more than adequate to pay the rent, but there's also a huge difference in terms of the corporate cash flow, which provide a significant security blanket for our rent payment.

And I get back to the comment I made about the 3 variables that really impact performance. The first is occupancy, and there is clearly a rebuilding that was necessary after the flu season last year, but we've seen it. Across that portfolio, occupancy is coming back very strongly. The second variable being rate, and we continue to increase rates in the 3% range, if not higher this year. The third variable is more challenging, and that's labor because of the impact of the living wage, which is up 7% throughout the country and even higher in other markets. So unrelated to anything that Sunrise can control, there's just an external factor that's going to be a headwind on NOI growth this year."

And Chad, we believe that there is going to be an increasing need for senior housing in the major metro markets. And if you think about the cost of building in midtown Manhattan or Central Washington, D.C. or San Francisco, it's significant and it's important that institutions like CPP now understand the investment thesis for deploying capital to seniors housing. The other piece of this is that we, again, very much believe is that it's going to take trillions of dollars to rebuild the acute care hospital system in this country to basically accommodate technology that is with us today or will be developed in the future that will dramatically allow us to lower health care costs and improve outcomes. We have a lot of antiquated acute care hospital infrastructure in this country. So while I'd like to think we could go it alone and the capital markets will accommodate us to fund every bit of capital need that we will need to build this infrastructure, we aren't that -- we're not that big a gambler. So it's been very important for us to spend time with institutions like PSP and CPPIB. And we'll bring others in because I think they understand we're smart, and we can provide them opportunities that they cannot find on their own. And they will also see interesting opportunities to deploy capital at returns that possibly aren't available in other sectors -- in the traditional sectors of real estate where they are one of the major owners."

There are very limited people that could write a check that size, private equity is one, but frankly, generally speaking, they don't align with our approach to business.

We had a more suburban or world market portfolio, I think, 5 to 10 miles is more appropriate, but for Welltower, I think 3 miles really is the best radius to be looking at. So in this quarter's supplement, we say that 1.7% of our total NOI is impacted by new supply, okay? And that assumes that all of the NOI from the properties that we own will be impacted 100% by the new supplies, so it's kind of a worst-case scenario, meaning if you take all the properties in our portfolio, they are impacted by new supply. That 1.7% assumes that NOI at those properties goes to 0, which is obviously not going to happen. In fact, our history is that properties in our portfolio that are subject to new supply have actually held up quite well when new supply enters the market. And we've -- we studied it for years. If you look at the performance before and after the new competition enters the market -- and on average, occupancy is pretty much flat and NOI has been up 4% on average.

We think that is a good place to commit capital, we think. Recently, just this past Monday, we were with Cleveland Clinic, and they mentioned that they had just formed a relationship with Select Medical, where they're actually in a new suburban setting where they have an outpatient in a smaller hospital. They're actually putting Select Medical post-acute beds attached to the hospital that Select Medical will run. So hospitals, more than ever, need strong post-acute operators, and so that's where we will deploy capital. We're not looking to acquire skilled nursing beds because the cap rates look attractive.

We think about a lot of care home operators in the U.K. being fairly levered entities. What do you actually think is the ultimate outcome here in the U.K? Do we go through a round of consolidation? Or do you kind of somehow think that's somehow the other local authorities will be forced to continue [indiscernible] system as is?"

And I think that business is in a lot of trouble. That's why we did not invest any capital into that space over the past 4 years when we so aggressively pursued the high-end private pay market. And I say that because, one, the real estate quality is low. But two, think about the minimum wage impacts when government reimbursement rates are increasing maybe 1% a year and your staffing costs are going up 8% to 10%, that's a tough dynamic to manage through. And I contrast that with the 3 portfolios that we own in the U.K, Sunrise, Signature and Avery, all of which have 90-plus percent private pay. They actually increased rates at pretty substantial percentages this year to offset most of that wage increase. And that's why you really do need to think about 2 different sectors that are targeting 2 very different residence."

We believe that much of the hospital supply that exists today in this country will be taken out of service. It will follow the path of many other sectors of real estate that you've seen taken out of service. We got a lot of empty department stores anchoring, struggling malls in this country. Remember, there was a day that every city in America had its own unique department stores that were part of the social fabric. And those don't exist today because most of them have gone away or they're called Macy's. And you -- I predict that many of these communities that all have numerous acute care hospital systems in the next 10, 20 years, you'll see very few and you'll see the big non-for-profit brand names in healthcare. So the Cleveland Clinics, the Mayo Clinics, the Johns Hopkins start to proliferate into other markets. So I think you can look a little bit at history and for a real estate perspective to know that a lot of hospital supply that you could buy today is probably going to be -- if you think the cap rates are attractive today, just wait a little while because they're going to be more attentive when you're buying buildings that are being taken out of service.

I'm pleased that we finished 2015 with our strongest quarterly performance of the year. These results are driven by solid fundamentals, a disciplined investment thesis and the unique operating platform that we have developed and employed at Welltower over many years.
Today, I want to highlight 3 topics that are top of mind: capital allocation, Genesis and senior housing supply. On to the first topic, capital allocation. This is the most important exercise of any management team and how I spend most of my time. We think about this as the framework for how we maximize shareholder returns. Essentially, every public company has 5 primary ways to deploy capital: acquisitions, investing in the existing business, paying down debt, paying dividends and buying back stock. And 4 ways to raise capital: internal cash flow, issuing debt, issuing equity and disposing of assets. So when the equity capital markets were favorable, we took full advantage and built the industry-leading healthcare real estate portfolio. For us, it was not about winning a pie-eating contest but building unmatched local scale in major metro markets with the best operators in the business. Simply put, we have created a real operating platform, not a passive collection of assets in which success is measured only by year 1 FFO accretion. The good news for our shareholders is we don't take access to the capital markets for granted and we don't gamble with our shareholder capital. Hence, we took advantage of the strong equity market to significantly delever our balance sheet. Now in a less-than-accommodating public capital market, we are sitting in an enviable position.
We are also proud that in 2015 the Canadian Pension Plan, one of the largest investors in commercial real estate in the world, chose Welltower to be its joint-venture partner to make its first investment in healthcare real estate. Scott Brinker will talk about our most recent venture with CPP as well as our ongoing successful partnership with PSP.
Welltower has always seen targeted dispositions as an important component of our capital allocation strategy, and 2015 was no exception. We sold less-strategic assets, such as our last U.S. hospital asset, realizing an 11% unlevered IRR; and we took advantage of robust pricing and sold our Life Science portfolio at a 5% yield, realizing an unlevered IRR of 15%. May I remind you that we have sold $4 billion in assets over the last 5 years for cash and used that cash to buy better-quality real estate and delever the balance sheet.
Over the medium term, we still see opportunity for targeted acquisitions to go deeper into markets where we have local scale in our senior housing business, and we also see enormous opportunity to grow our outpatient medical business, but only with the best health systems in this country.
I talked about our desire to develop relationships with the leading academic medical centers on my very first investor call in May 2014. I told you that this would not happen overnight, as institutions like Johns Hopkins and Cleveland Clinic really don't need our capital. However, increasingly, what they do realize they need from Welltower is our expertise in seniors housing, residential Alzheimer's care and -- read my lips -- post-acute care, and the connectivity of the best-in-class operators that we bring to the table. I am happy to tell you that these discussions are now starting to bear fruit, and for example, we now own 3 facilities with Johns Hopkins, which is the #1 rated health system in the United States.
So let's talk about Genesis. I want to make it very clear. We believe in Genesis and the value that post-acute operators like Genesis bring to lowering healthcare costs and improving outcomes. The challenges facing the post-acute industry as it transitions to a value-based care system are well known. If you sit with the CEOs of the leading nonprofit health systems in the U.S., like we do at Welltower, they realize that they need to connect to this expertise more than ever, as they move to the reality of bundled payments. Have you seen the performance of the for-profit acute care hospital sector lately? After a brief benefit from the ACA that peaked in the second quarter of 2015, the cold reality is that higher co-pays are translating to a drop in hospital visits. This is why Welltower, as of year end 2015, no longer owns acute care hospitals in the U.S. We believe operating and margin pressures will push acute care operators to move patients to lower-cost outpatient and post-acute settings.
We are optimistic that operators like Genesis that are delivering next-generation post-acute care will become the preferred providers to the top-end health systems and have a large inventory of low Q-Mix SNFs get taken out of service.
We understand the market is a voting machine in the short run, and the votes are in. While the market has implied the destruction of the majority of the equity value in our investment in Genesis, I can assure you that there is significant value in this relationship and in this investment. Scott Brinker is going to talk more about that in detail.
Finally, to the topic of senior housing supply. You may recall we had a long discussion about this topic on the third quarter call. We continue to believe the fear of supply in the U.S. is overblown. There's no doubt that certain markets are oversupplied, but we are primarily in markets where it is difficult to build and, hence, believe our performance will be resilient. You can look at the portfolio performance this quarter as evidence of this resiliency, as senior housing operating occupancy has rebounded sequentially, up 80 basis points, and same-store NOI was up 4.3% in the U.S.
Like most companies in health care, and I know you're seeing this in the retail sector as well, we are seeing wage pressure in some parts of the U.S. due to increases in the minimum wage, and we're seeing it in the U.K. due to the imposition of the national living wage. Increased supply where it has impact will most likely exacerbate that problem. We are working with our operating partners to capture new labor efficiencies and identify opportunities for enhanced pricing power.
In conclusion, we believe we have a superior portfolio in superior markets, best-in-class operating and capital partners and a seasoned team to execute across all markets. With the right assets in the right markets, we will prove the thesis that healthcare real estate has lower downside and better upside over a cycle.
Now I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker."

We now have unmatched scale in the markets where you want to own real estate: 77 properties in Southern California, 47 in Greater London and 281 on the Eastern Seaboard from Boston to D.C. Our history in the business tells us these markets will produce superior results.
We're entering a period of increased separation among companies. Our real estate quality will stand out more than ever. Each business segment turned in a strong fourth quarter. The results show that our capital allocation is paying off. The operating portfolio trended higher, with 3.3% same-store NOI growth. Fundamentals are solid. Occupancy was up 20 basis points, and rate increased 3.2%. Importantly, we're not buying the growth, as CapEx remains at very modest levels. The age of our properties is a material competitive advantage.
Performance in the U.S. continues to be strong, with 4.3% same-store NOI growth. Large metro markets once again outperformed, validating our capital allocation.
Same-store NOI in Canada grew 4.6% despite an economy with near 0 inflation, highlighting the resiliency of our business. The U.K. portfolio is poised for a rebound this year based on recent revenue trends.
Several Wall Street analysts recently ranked our outpatient medical portfolio as #1 in asset quality. The impact can be seen in our results. We hit all-time highs in occupancy and tenant retention last year, leading to another solid quarter, with 3.1% same-store NOI growth. Visibility is the key word here, and there are 3 drivers: one, very little lease rollover; two, when leases do roll, we typically renew more than 80% of them; and three, nearly all of our buildings are sponsored by a health system. That's important because they act as a magnet for other tenants. The space leased directly to a health system is climbing and now sits at 60%. We see that number moving even higher as hospitals transition more and more services to outpatient settings.
I'll move to triple net, a highly visible income stream that contributes half of our earnings. Same-store seniors housing NOI increased 3.2%, while post-acute long-term care increased 3.1%.
We've been eagerly anticipating a chance to talk about the next topic, which is Genesis. Dramatic underperformance by ManorCare, who is not in our portfolio, is unfairly implicating Genesis, if not an entire industry. Industry headwinds clearly exist, but they are not new. In fact, we've been preparing for years, including selling nearly $1 billion of last-generation skilled nursing assets. And rather than focusing exclusively on the short-term headwinds, we also consider the bigger picture. According to Avalere, a highly regarded research firm, the dramatic increase in the Medicare population will more than offset the decline in length of stay and per capita utilization. As a result, the number of skilled nursing Medicare days is expected to increase by more than 10% over the next 5 years. That data reminds us that skilled nursing plays an important role in cost-effective healthcare delivery.
There's a reason we haven't suffered any lease rejections or rent reductions like other skilled nursing landlords. One, strong payment coverage. The cash flow from the Genesis properties that we own fully supports the rent payment to Genesis -- to Welltower. Our Genesis properties generate nearly $1.60 of operating income for every $1 of rent. Given the profitability inside the walls of our buildings, the parent guarantee is simply an additional security blanket. And that parent guarantee does have value. Parent company fixed-charge coverage increased last year, and Genesis expects further improvement this year to north of 1.3x.
Two, we've been actively managing the portfolio since the day we closed the sale leaseback 5 years ago. That includes selling underperforming buildings, funding new development and acquisitions with strong coverage and facilitating mergers that generate synergies. And three, Genesis is a superior operator. Despite the challenging environment, our property-level Genesis payment coverage is only 1 basis point lower than it was 4 years ago, 1 basis point. Property-level EBITDAR increased a healthy 2.5% per year during that period. And remember that we own the legacy Genesis portfolio, which is concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic and New England. These are hands down their absolute core assets.
Final comment here is that we expect Genesis to refinance our mortgage loans, with significant paydowns coming this year, in line with the business plan.
Turning to 4Q investments. We closed $1.5 billion at a 6.8% initial yield. It's fair to say that 2016 investment volume will look much different than previous years. Capital allocation help drive our historical outperformance and remained a top priority. Every day we look at the relationship between cap rates and our cost of capital. Discrepancies, plus or minus, provide an opportunity to create value. We have the luxury of not needing to make any rash decisions, but if buyers have an aggressive view of asset value, we'll be happy to crystallize value in select properties. By design, our investment pipeline is quite limited today, and we can fully fund it with operating cash flow and in-process asset sales.
I want to share color on a new relationship, a superb operator called Discovery Senior Living. Last quarter, we acquired 6 high-performing, independent-living communities in Florida that Discovery built and will continue to co-own and manage. The properties are typically 100% full, with a waiting list. Significant renovations are nearly complete, which will allow Discovery to market the properties at a higher price point, generating strong earnings growth.
To fund the acquisition, we partnered with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board or CPP. This marks their first investment in U.S. senior housing, again, highlighting the confidence in our platform by one of the world's leading investors.
The other major acquisition last quarter was with Revera, where we partnered with PSP, a longtime and important pension fund partner of ours. The acquisition deepens our large metro market footprint. Welltower will receive a 6.1% preferred return that grows by 4% per year through 2020.
We sold our final U.S. inpatient hospital last quarter. The number of hospital beds has been nearly cut in half the past few decades, and there are more closures coming. The old physical plants require massive CapEx, and even then, the buildings are often unprepared for advances in technology. We also see an adverse selection problem. The hospitals looking for sale leasebacks are too often the ones you don't want to do business with.
I'll wrap up with our excitement about the current environment. The last down cycle laid the foundation for what Welltower has become. The next few years will be the ideal environment to take another leap forward.
Now to Scott Estes."

My financial message today echoes the capital allocation theme that has been essential to our long-term success as an organization. Calendar 2015 was an important year for HCN in that we positioned the balance sheet for the current period of volatility by opportunistically raising equity in response to the strength of our investment pipeline. 90% of the investments closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 were negotiated during the first half of the year. And while there's always an urge to perfectly time the equity market, we're glad that we chose to prefund the majority of this activity, allowing us to end the year with essentially the same conservative leverage ratios that we started with in 2015.
While we're poised to generate another year of solid financial results and dividend growth in 2016, our net asset seller message and public guidance for the upcoming year reflects our current mindset of remaining both disciplined and opportunistic, while protecting our downside. More specifically, our ability to utilize dispositions as a source of capital in the current environment should provide multiple benefits. It should allow us to maintain or further reduce leverage. We can enhance our asset quality in private-pay mix, and we can maintain adequate liquidity and execute our 2016 capital plan within a self-funded framework.
Given the recent uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic backdrop, our conservative approach leaves us well positioned to wait out the current storm as we continue to appropriately allocate capital to maximize shareholder value.
I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our fourth quarter financial performance and changes in our supplemental disclosure. As Tom said, we had a great fourth quarter, as normalized FFO came in at $1.13 per share; and normalized FAD was $0.99 per share, representing strong 10% and 9% year-over-year increases, respectively. Results were driven primarily by the solid same-store cash NOI increase, averaging 3.1% for the full year, and the $3.6 billion of net investments completed over the last 12 months.
I note that our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the fourth quarter declined to 73% and 83%, respectively. There were 2 noteworthy items on our income statement this quarter that I'd like to take a moment to explain. First, we incurred $35.6 million in other expenses this quarter, which represented a noncash charge related to marking the value of our Genesis stockholdings to market at year end. And as a reminder, we essentially received our initial $58.5 million in stock for free, as it represented the amount or purchase option for 9.9% of Genesis within the money at the time they went public.
Conversely on the positive side of the ledger, we realized a gain on the sale of assets of $31.4 million in the quarter, which was largely due to the profitable disposition of our final U.S. acute care hospital during the period.
In terms of dividends, we'll pay our 179th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on February 22 of $0.86 per share. This new annualized rate of $3.44 per share represents a 4.2% increase over our 2015 dividend level and a current yield of 6.1%.
In terms of our supplement this quarter, the only notable change is on Page 2, where we did add a table providing detail on the number and dollar value of the individual acquisitions and joint ventures completed each year.
Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The fourth quarter was an active one in terms of capital-raising activity for the company. In October, we completed the sale of $500 million of unsecured debt priced to yield just under 4.3% through a reopening of our 10-year notes due June 2025. And in November, we successfully tapped the Canadian senior note market for the first time in our history, completing the sale of CAD 300 million of 5-year notes priced to yield just over 3.4%.
In terms of equity, we issued 1.1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program, generating $66 million in proceeds. And we tapped our ATM program for the first time since 2012, issuing 696,000 shares at an average price of $69.23, raising another $47 million.
We also generated $225 million of proceeds through the sale of nonstrategic assets and loan payoffs. And finally, we repaid approximately $104 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.9% and assumed or issued $674 million of secured debt at a blended 3.3% rate.
So importantly, as a result, we have over $2 billion of liquidity entering 2016, with only $350 million of line borrowings, net of the $361 million in cash on balance sheet and the $124 million of cash received from CPP's Discovery portfolio buy-in subsequent to year-end.
Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of 2015 remain in excellent shape. As of December 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 39.9%, and net debt to enterprise value was 32.7%.
Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA stood at 5.6x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter were strong at 4.3x and 3.4x, respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 12% of total assets at quarter end.
In light of the recent strength of the U.S. dollar against both the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar, I would like to remind you of our hedging strategy entering 2016. We've minimized any material risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Through a combination of unsecured and property-level debt denominated in local currencies and other currency hedges in place, our international investments are approximately 87% hedged from a balance sheet perspective and 83% hedged from an earnings perspective. So as a result, the sensitivity of both currencies moving 10% in relation to the U.S. dollar from current levels would impact our earnings either up or down by only $0.01 per share this year.
Finally, I'll conclude my comments today with an overview of the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. In terms of same-store cash NOI growth, we're forecasting blended growth of 2.5% to 3% in 2016, as we continue to project solid predictable internal growth across our portfolio.
To further break down this forecast by asset type. First, for our seniors housing operating portfolio, we're projecting growth in the 2% to 3% range, as we remain confident in the operating environment and our operators' relative performance.
For our seniors housing triple-net portfolio, we anticipate growth of approximately 2.5% to 3%. For our long-term care post-acute portfolio, we're projecting an increase of approximately 3%. And last, for our outpatient medical portfolio, we project an increase of approximately 2% to 2.5%, driven primarily by annual rate increases, continued strong occupancy, very low turnover and a retention rate of approximately 80%.
In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions beyond what we've announced to date in our formal guidance. As a result, the only acquisitions included in our 2016 guidance are the approximate $163 million of investments through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. Our 2016 guidance also includes $419 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 8.2%.
In terms of dispositions, we have included $1 billion of dispositions in our forecast. This is comprised of $178 million of proceeds from assets currently held for sale at a blended yield on sale of 7.2%, with the remainder representing loan payoffs and other potential property sales.
Although we prefer to avoid any specifics of what we might sell this year, as Tom said earlier we have a successful history of selling not only nonstrategic assets but also more opportunistic asset sales to lock in attractive values. My point here is that we have multiple options in our approach to sales this year and believe there are no pools of assets that are off limits as we evaluate asset sales to most efficiently allocate capital.
Our capital expenditure forecast this year is $83 million, which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $28 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio. As Scott mentioned, these amounts continue to represent a relatively modest 7% to 8% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories due to our generally more modern portfolio.
Our G&A forecast is approximately $160 million to $165 million for 2016. The majority of growth on a year-over-year basis is due to the annualized 2016 impact of hires and infrastructure investments made during 2015. We remain very comfortable with these spending levels to support the continued growth of the organization.
I would also note that we expect first quarter G&A to be slightly higher than the average for the year, as it typically includes accelerated expensing of stock-based compensation for certain employees and directors.
We anticipate incurring income tax expense of approximately $16 million to $18 million in 2016, based on our latest estimation of taxable income that is largely generated by our seniors housing operating portfolio.
And finally, as a result of all these assumptions, we expect to report 2016 FFO in a range of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represent 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
So in conclusion, our focus on capital allocation entering 2016 prioritizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage and retaining ample liquidity until the broader capital markets environment improves.
So at this point, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for your closing remarks."

I want to leave you with the message that we are confident in our ability to create shareholder value in 2016 and beyond.

Today, we are in the strongest position we have ever been with our leading balance sheet, long-term institutional capital partners like CPP and PSP, our portfolio of best-in-class operators, significant local scale in top markets and a deep understanding of how all these work together as a real operating platform, not a financially engineered yield portfolio.

The first, I think, was the 2% to 3% growth outlook and how did we get there. And from where we sit today, our same-store occupancy is slightly above last year, so that's a good starting point. I've said on a number of occasions that 90-plus percent of NOI in the senior housing space can be explained in 3 variables: occupancy, rate and labor. So I just talked about one of them, occupancy. It looks good. But we've been conservative in our guidance and assumed essentially no change in occupancy through the year, just given what's happening in the economy and there is some new supply. Now hopefully, we'll be better than that, but that's what's in our guidance. And then on rate, we've continued to grow in the 3% to 3.5% range. And that's generally what we expect in 2016. And the third component is labor. And that's probably the one where -- I wouldn't say we're worried, but it could be a bit higher this year than it has been recently. A number of states and cities have increases in the minimum wage. And certainly the new supply in certain markets does impact the labor pool. So we're expecting compensation expense to be a bit higher than rate growth this year in our budget. And that's what leads into the 2% to 3% projection for the year. Now longer term, what I'd tell you is we projected in the 4% to 5% range when we made our first RIDEA investment more than 5 years ago. Obviously, we've done better than that on average. There will be fluctuations. We also probably didn't expect that inflation would be virtually 0 when we made that projection, which is where it's at today in a lot of our core markets, and yet we're still growing in the low 3s. So what we feel confident in is that we'll continue to outperform the sector, which we've done year after year after year, and then we'll outperform our peers. And that's probably a better way to answer the long-term growth outlook, Josh. It's so hard to say for sure what the overall economy is going to look like."

They clearly are facing some industry headwinds, but those headwinds aren't new. Medicare Advantage has been an issue for years and years, putting pressure on length of stay and rate; and Genesis has stayed ahead by getting out of certain assets, acquiring assets that are better fits for the current environment and actively managing their labor cost, which again is the most significant operating expense. And the other thing I would mention is they have a much lower Medicare mix, and that probably has an impact on why they've held up better over the past 4 years because a lot of the pressure has been on the Medicare side of the business. And the other distinction I would make is the results at the corporate level. So I talked about property level cash flow being more than adequate to pay the rent, but there's also a huge difference in terms of the corporate cash flow, which provide a significant security blanket for our rent payment. And they've been able to grow that cash flow through merger synergies, and they'll grow it going forward through refinancing and probably some asset buybacks."

The third variable is more challenging, and that's labor because of the impact of the living wage, which is up 7% throughout the country and even higher in other markets.

And Chad, we believe that there is going to be an increasing need for senior housing in the major metro markets. And if you think about the cost of building in midtown Manhattan or Central Washington, D.C., or San Francisco, it's significant, and it's important that institutions like CPP now understand the investment thesis for deploying capital to seniors housing. The other piece of this is that we, again, very much believe is that it's going to take trillions of dollars to rebuild the acute care hospital system in this country to basically accommodate technology that is with us today or will be developed in the future that will dramatically allow us to lower health care costs and improve outcomes. We have a lot of antiquated acute care hospital infrastructure in this country. So while I'd like to think we could go it alone and the capital markets will accommodate us to fund every bit of capital need that we will need to build this infrastructure, we aren't that -- we're not that big a gambler. So it's been very important for us to spend time with institutions like PSP and CPPIB. And we'll bring others in because I think they understand we're smart, and we can provide them opportunities that they cannot find on their own.

So in this quarter's supplement, we say that 1.7% of our total NOI is impacted by new supply, okay? And that assumes that all of the NOI from the properties that we own will be impacted 100% by the new supplies,. So it's kind of a worst-case scenario, meaning if you take all the properties in our portfolio that are impacted by new supply, that 1.7% assumes that NOI at those properties goes to 0, which is obviously not going to happen. In fact our history is that properties in our portfolio that are subject to new supply have actually held up quite well when new supply enters the market. And we've -- we studied it for years. If you look at the performance before and after the new competition enters the market -- and on average, occupancy is pretty much flat, and NOI has been up 4% on average.

We are not interested in owning lots of low Q-Mix nursing assets, and you know we've sold lots of them over the years that Scott mentioned, though it's been a component of the $4 billion in dispositions we've made. We believe in the post-acute sector. We do not think it's going away. And so we will deploy capital into the next-generation of post-acute, of which Genesis is one of the operators that is offering that product through its PowerBack facilities. We think that is a good place to commit capital, we think. Recently, just this past Monday, we were with Cleveland Clinic. And they mentioned that they had just formed a relationship with Select Medical, where they're actually in a new suburban setting where they have an outpatient in a smaller hospital. They're actually putting Select Medical post-acute beds attached to the hospital that Select Medical will run. So hospitals, more than ever, need strong post-acute operators, and so that's where we will deploy capital. We're not looking to acquire skilled nursing beds because the cap rates look attractive. That is not what we do as a company. And I think that's a very important differentiating point about Welltower."

The states are throwing up their hands and giving their entire programs to commercial insurers who will continue to squeeze this business. And to me, government-funded long-term care is the high-cost setting for those residents when you consider the alternatives. Post-acute is the low-cost setting for those residents, so you have to think about a market and what it looks like 5 to 10 years from now and not just what the headlines suggest. So we continue to be a lot more bullish about this sector for post-acute than for long-term residential care, which frankly, every state is doing everything they can to keep patients out of long-term care nursing homes."

Remember, there was a day that every city in America had its own unique department stores that were part of the social fabric.

And you -- I predict that many of these communities that all have numerous acute care hospital systems, in the next 10, 20 years you'll see very few, and you'll see the big non-for-profit brand names in health care.

The power of owning Class A real estate. What do I mean by that? I mean, real estate that is in locations and markets that cannot be easily duplicated. Real estate that is nimble, and adaptive to changing consumer preferences. 
Real estate that defies the conventional wisdom about supply and retain value across economic cycles. Overtime, the REITs that on Class A real estate have produced superior and resilient results as compared to our REITs that have not followed the strategy. Our quarter is yet another example, of a phenomenon that began for us in 2010. This my friends is why you own Welltower. 
The headline number that supports our thesis is that all operating same-store NOI grew by 5.5% in the first quarter. Now this number does not come as a surprise to us, in fact, it's totally consistent with the operating same-store NOI growth we have reported for our portfolio over the last 5 years. 
Our total portfolio NOI grew 3.8% and FFO has grown 9%, all parts of our business produced good results, but we did have a phenomenal quarter in our senior housing operating portfolio. While there have been real headwinds from increases in labor costs and other operating expenses, our Class A real estate was able to pass this along to the consumer in strong rate growth, while at the same time increasing occupancy by 60 basis points to 19.7%. 
Now on the last 2 earnings call, we told you that we remain bullish about the senior housing business, and continue to believe that despite pockets of oversupply in the industry, our portfolio of high barrier to entry markets, premier operators and modern assets will continue to create tremendous value for shareholders by generating attractive growth with minimal CapEx. 
We see the market taking the data on new supply and applying it broadly across the entire senior housing market. 
We think that is a mistake and our performance supports that.
We had a long conversation about our strategy around post-acute and Genesis last quarter. Despite short-term challenges, we continue to believe, you need to look beyond headlines and understand how the skilled nursing industry fits in the continuum of care. 
I'm very pleased by the fact that CMS recommended a 2.1% rate growth last week. The biggest Medicare increase in 7 years, and I think this supports our thesis. May I remind you that our Genesis portfolio remains concentrated in high density East Coast markets with significant 4 wall profitability. 
On our last call, we also discussed at length our capital allocation framework. Our sustained  relative out performance in same-store NOI growth is a product of the strategy as well as smart highly targeted investment discipline. 
Capital allocation is not just about when to buy, but also about what to buy, and what not to buy. You may have heard about our acquisition of a site on the corner of 56 Street in Lexington in New York City that together with Heines, we will build the Welltower, a state-of-the-art largely dimensional Alzheimer's care facility. The supply of residential care options for the growing elderly population of Manhattan is at best pathetic. 
For a population of over 1 million people, there are only 70 -- 70 marginal memory care beds in Manhattan. And I can tell you that they are a marginal quality, because we used to own them. The Welltower will be an anchor for an affluent challenge population that has been forced to live in the shadows. 
The Welltower will make them part of a larger community, which includes billionaires row 1 block away. Now we are limited by nondisclosure agreement and what I can share with you today, we hope to give you more color in the coming months. But what I can tell you is that we didn't sacrifice our return expectations and underwriting criteria to be in Manhattan. Frankly, I cannot think of a more Class A real estate opportunity. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott Brinker."
277914,330709419,970657,"Welltower Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Welltower Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom. A common question from investors the past few years was what would happen when the cycle turn? The answer today is very positive. Today's more challenging environment is highlighting that not all properties are the same, not all markets",834,"Thank you, Tom. A common question from investors the past few years was what would happen when the cycle turn? The answer today is very positive. 
Today's more challenging environment is highlighting that not all properties are the same, not all markets are the same, and not all operators are the same. Our portfolio outperformed in the up cycle, and today, we're seeing that continue. Each segment turned in a strong quarter with same-store results above guidance. That being said, I want to repeat something we said in the past. We don't overemphasize any one quarter good or bad. We think about our results overtime to reduce the noise that can occur over 90-day increments. 
I'll start with the operating portfolio, where top line fundamentals were incredibly strong. We increased rates 4.2%, out sacrificing sensors, as occupancy increased 60 basis points. The result was 5.5% same-store NOI growth well above expectations. 
CapEx remained at modest levels, the age of our properties is a material advantage, it allows us to generate superior, organic growth, while retaining earnings to fund new investments. 
Here are some color on each country. Performance in the U.S. was outstanding. Same-store NOI grew 5.1%, this is not a case of easy comps as we reported 5.2% growth in 1Q '15, not to mention in 8% CAGR in the first quarter of 2012, '13 and '14. An important takeaways that our core markets extended their long track record of out performance. And we'll continue to prioritize these markets with our capital allocation. 
Turning to Canada. Our 2 partners Revera and Chartwell delivered strong results, despite a sluggish economy. Same-store NOI grew 7.2% last quarter. Revenue increased nearly 5%, while expenses growth was in the mid-3s. It's to remind you seniors housing isn't perfectly correlated with the broader economy.
The U.K. bounce back with 6.1% same-store NOI growth. We're seeing very strong demand for our properties. Revenue grew by more than 5%, while expenses increased in the high-4s. By design, we are a private pay high end business in the U.K. This gives us the ability to better offset cost pressures like the increased minimum wage. It is equally true in the U.S..
Next I want to share you an observation on broader topic. Seniors housing is a private pay business, and it allows a supply and demand apply. That's why we chose to concentrate in markets with the ability and willingness to pay. These also happening to markets, which are more difficult to bring new supply. We know that location impacts performance, because we've been tracking the data inside a portfolio for years. 
Our data is a very powerful in a sector with the window in the industry level performance is limited to asking rents and occupancy. As a result, seniors housing remains an inefficient market, cap rates hardly vary at all based on locations. We think that will change as operating data in the industry becomes more transparent. When that happens, our unmatched scale in premier markets will be highly valuable.
Turning to outpatient medical. We extended our track record of consistent results, with 2.6% same-store NOI growth. We have excellent long-term visibility into this earning stream, driven by a low roll over and our history of renewing the vast majority of maturing pieces. 
Next up is the e triple-net portfolio. Quarter-after-quarter, including 1Q, the blended growth rate in this segment is in the 3% range. The lease structure gives us consistent and growing our rental income notwithstanding any volatility in the underlying operations. That's especially true of skilled nursing, a business that's long been subject to cycles. Public sentiment is even more volatile than the underlying business. And right now, the pendulum has clearly swung towards the negative. I'll contrast this volatility with skilled nursing valuations in the private market, which have been remarkably consistent overtime. If there is a prolonged disconnect between public and private valuations, we may look to take advantage to selective asset sales. 
Moving to investments. Our activity in 1Q was intentionally low given the environment. We funded $350 million at a 7.7% initial cash yield. As usual, these were done in private negotiations, not auctions, which helps explain the healthy yield. We expanded relationships with leading health systems like Accenture and Adventis, and we grew with core partners including Sunrise, Silverado and Signature. Each investment builds on what makes Welltower unique, premier markets, leading operators, and modern buildings. 
Our stock come back a bit since our last earnings call, but this still feels like a time to be highly selective with new investments. Our strong balance sheet and unmatched relationships allow us to be flexible, if conditions change. As expected, we had a $116 million loans pass last quarter, including $68 million of Genesis mortgage loans. We received continued repayments from Genesis throughout the year. The bridge to heart business plan is working as planned, will benefit Genesis cash flow and enhance the credit that stands behind our master lease. Now over to Scott Estes."

We're off to a great start to the year, with strong quarterly earnings growth, and an increase in our same-store NOI forecast, reflecting our confidence in the continued strength of our portfolio. While significa",1465,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start to the year, with strong quarterly earnings growth, and an increase in our same-store NOI forecast, reflecting our confidence in the continued strength of our portfolio. While significant stock market volatility occurred during the first quarter, we remain highly focused on capital allocation. 
Our current earnings guidance continue to assume that we remain net sellers of assets for the full year. We're also able to enhance our liquidity position during the quarter, by opportunistically raising a $700 million of 10-year unsecured debt. Importantly, we are able to raise this debt in an overall leverage neutral manner through offsetting debt payoffs and a small amount of equity raise through our drip and ATM programs. As a result, we have no senior debt maturing until September 2017, and have only $398 million of secured debt maturing over the remainder of the year. With over $2 billion of current liquidity and a continued focus on capital allocation, our strong financial position allows us to remain both disciplined and opportunistic in regard to any incremental investments, dispositions and capital raises throughout the remainder of the year.
I'll again begin my detailed remarks with perspective on the first quarter performance and a minor change we made to our supplement this quarter. We started off the year with strong quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons, generating normalized FFO of $1.13 per share, up 9% versus last year, and normalized FAD of $1.01 per share, increasing 10% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth, and a $1.8 billion of net investments completed over the last four quarters. 
I'll comment briefly on several of the more noteworthy income statement items this quarter. First, our G&A came in at $46 million for the first quarter, this was in line with our expectations, as the first quarter is typically our highest of the year, due to the timing of expensing stock compensation grants for certain employees and directors. 
After a detailed review of our cost this year, we now expect to comment towards the low end of our initial guidance range of $160 million to $165 million for the full year. We recognized impairments of slightly $14 million in the first quarter, these impairments were result of a slight reductions in the carrying value of 2 relatively small seniors housing portfolios currently held-for-sale, which are now expected to be sold for roughly $167 million in the aggregate. And lastly, we recognized a tax benefit of $1.7 million in the first quarter. Our taxes came in slightly below our expectations for the quarter, as a result of both tax planning initiatives and several revisions to our TRS taxable income forecast. Based on this revised expectations, we now anticipate incurring quarterly tax expense of approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. 
In terms of dividends, we'll pay our 180th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 20 of $0.86 per share, rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year, and represents a current dividend yield of 4.9%.
In terms of our supplement, we made only one relatively minor adjustments in this quarter, as we moved our U.K.-based private pay outpatient facilities from our hospital getting ready to our outpatient medical category. This was done to reflect the fact that the vast majority of revenue comes from outpatient care and short stage surgery just like our outpatient surgical facilities in the U.S.. 
I'll now turn now to liquidity picture and balance sheet. I think the highlight of our first quarter capital markets activity was the unsecured debt offering, which closed on March 1. We completed the sale of $700 million of 10 years senior unsecured notes price to yield just over 4.3%. And took advantage of strong investor demand to upsize the transaction from the origin I announced size of $400 million. This offering help to extend our weighted average senior not maturities 10 and .2 years, and as a reminder, that this debt offering was not included in our initial earnings guidance for 2016. In terms of equity, we should over 1 million shares to our ATM program this quarter, raising $93 million in proceeds. As Scott mentioned, we generated $115 million of proceeds through loan payoffs, which included $68 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. 
In terms of debt repayments, we repaid off $400 million of the 5-year 3 and 58 senior unsecured debt that matured on March 15 of 2016. 
And lastly, repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.5%, while refinancing $75 million of secured debt at a blended 3.1% rate. 
So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.2 billion available at quarter-end with only $645 million of line borrowings and $356 million in cash on balance sheet. Our balance sheet and financial metrics at end of the first quarter remain strong. As of March 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization of 39.6% was consistent with last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improve 40 basis points to 32.3%. 
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.7x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage the quarter remained solid at 4.1x and 3.2x, respectively. 
Our secured debt level remained at only 12.1% of total assets at quarter end. We were pleased to receive an affirmation of our BBB+ ratings from Fitch last week. And as a reminder, we set BAA2 BBB flat weddings with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P. 
I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance.
First, in terms of same-store cash NOI growth. Based on our strong first quarter results across our entire portfolio, we're comfortable raising our same-store cash NOI guidance for the full year by 25 basis points to 2.75% to 3.25%. For same strength across virtually all of our respective portfolio components and as Scott mentioned, I think it's appropriate to remain focused on the blended forecast for our entire portfolio for the full year.
In terms of our expectations, the only acquisitions in our forecast beyond those closed in the first quarter are an additional $98 million of investments expected through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. In terms of development, we expect to fund an additional $363 million on projects currently under construction, and expect $283 million of additional development conversions at a blended project yield of 7.9%.
Now moving to a dispositions. We continue to include a total of $1 billion in our forecast. This is comprised of the $116 million of loan payoffs during the first quarter. Our current projection of $303 million in proceeds from properties currently held-for-sale at a blended yield on sale of 6.5%, with the remainder representing loan payoffs and other potential property sales over the rest of the year. 
Our capital expenditure forecast remains $83 million for 2016, which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $28 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. 
We typically see a lower cap expending during the first quarter, we do expect the remaining CapEx will be higher during the last 3 quarters of the year. 
As previously mentioned, our G&A forecast is tracking around a $160 million for the full year at this point. And as I also discussed earlier, our tax expenses are likely to be about $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. So finally, as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share. And FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represents 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
I think it's important to note that our decision to maintain both our FFO and FAD guidance ranges is today was related to the fact that our $700 million bond offering was not in our original forecast, and that there is still considerable variability around the timing of the approximate $900 million of dispositions that have yet to occur. 
Most importantly, we continue to focus on making prudent capital allocation decisions to sent in our balance sheet, and maintain significant liquidity and the current environment. So in conclusion, our continued focus on capital allocation this year will continue to prioritize enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private payments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage, and retaining ample liquidity is through greater stability in the broader capital markets environment. So at that point, I'll turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments."

It's interesting, when you look at the star ratings, which I know there are several components, Genesis screen sort of average versus the U.S., but actually very well on the readmission side. Just wondering, if you dug into it or have any thoughts around that as to how that could be a future differentiator?"

So it won't surprise us, coverage paid down, but keep in mind where we are starting from. The corporate coverage is around 1.3, the facility levered coverage is said, on 1.6, management for the year high 1.2 after management fees.

The power of owning Class A real estate. What do I mean by that? I mean real estate that is in locations and markets that cannot be easily duplicated. Real estate that is nimble, and adaptive to changing consumer preferences. 
Real estate that defies the conventional wisdom about supply and retain value across economic cycles. Overtime, the REITs that own Class A real estate have produced superior and resilient results as compared to REITs that have not followed this strategy. Our quarter is yet another example of a phenomenon that began for us in 2010. This, my friends, is why you own Welltower. 
The headline number that supports our thesis is that our operating same-store NOI grew by 5.5% in the first quarter. Now this number does not come as a surprise to us. In fact, it's totally consistent with the operating same-store NOI growth we have reported for our portfolio over the last 5 years. 
Our total portfolio NOI grew 3.8% and FFO has grown 9%. All parts of our business produced good results, but we did have a phenomenal quarter in our senior housing operating portfolio. While there have been real headwinds from increases in labor costs and other operating expenses, our Class A real estate was able to pass this along to the consumer in strong rate growth while at the same time, increasing occupancy by 60 basis points to 90.7%. 
Now on the last 2 earnings calls, we told you that we remain bullish about the senior housing business, and continue to believe that despite pockets of oversupply in the industry, our portfolio of high barrier to entry markets, premier operators and modern assets will continue to create tremendous value for shareholders by generating attractive growth with minimal CapEx. 
We see the market taking the data on new supply and applying it broadly across the entire senior housing market. 
We think that is a mistake and our performance supports that.
We had a long conversation about our strategy around post-acute and Genesis last quarter. Despite short-term challenges, we continue to believe you need to look beyond headlines and understand how the skilled nursing industry fits in the continuum of care. 
I am very pleased by the fact that CMS recommended a 2.1% rate growth last week. The biggest Medicare increase in 7 years, and I think this supports our thesis. May I remind you that our Genesis portfolio remains concentrated in high density East Coast markets with significant 4-wall profitability. 
On our last call, we also discussed at length our capital allocation framework. Our sustained relative out performance in same-store NOI growth is a product of this strategy as well as a smart highly targeted investment discipline. 
Capital allocation is not just about when to buy, but also about what to buy, and what not to buy. You may have heard about our acquisition of a site on the corner of 56th Street and Lexington in New York City. That, together with Hines, we will build the Welltower, a state-of-the-art largely dementia Alzheimer's care facility. The supply of residential care options for the growing elderly population of Manhattan is, at best, pathetic. 
For a population of over 1 million people, there are only 70, 7-0 marginal memory care beds in Manhattan. And I can tell you that they are of marginal quality because we used to own them. The Welltower will be an anchor for an affluent cognitively challenged population that has been forced to live in the shadows. 
The Welltower will make them part of a larger community, which includes Billionaires' Row one block away. Now we are limited by a nondisclosure agreement in what I can share with you today. We hope to give you more color in the coming months. But what I can tell you is that we didn't sacrifice our return expectations and underwriting criteria to be in Manhattan. Frankly, I cannot think of a more Class A real estate opportunity. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott Brinker."
277914,330709419,971413,"Welltower Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Welltower Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Tom. A common question from investors the past few years was what would happen when the cycle turned? The answer today is very positive. Today's more challenging environment is highlighting that not all properties are the same, not all",834,"Okay. Thank you, Tom. A common question from investors the past few years was what would happen when the cycle turned? The answer today is very positive. 
Today's more challenging environment is highlighting that not all properties are the same, not all markets are the same, and not all operators are the same. Our portfolio outperformed in the up cycle, and today, we're seeing that continue. Each segment turned in a strong quarter with same-store results above guidance. That being said, I want to repeat something we've said in the past. We don't overemphasize any one quarter good or bad. We think about our results overtime to reduce the noise that can occur over 90-day increments. 
I'll start with the operating portfolio, where top line fundamentals were incredibly strong. We increased rates 4.2% without sacrificing census, as occupancy increased 60 basis points. The result was 5.5% same-store NOI growth well above expectations. 
CapEx remains at modest levels. The age of our properties is a material advantage. It allows us to generate superior, organic growth, while retaining earnings to fund new investments. 
Here are some color on each country. Performance in the U.S. was outstanding. Same-store NOI grew 5.1%. This is not a case of easy comps as we reported 5.2% growth in 1Q '15, not to mention an 8% CAGR in the first quarter of 2012, '13 and '14. An important takeaway is that our core markets extended their long track record of out performance. And we'll continue to prioritize these markets with our capital allocation. 
Turning to Canada. Our 2 partners, Revera and Chartwell, delivered strong results despite a sluggish economy. Same-store NOI grew 7.2% last quarter. Revenue increased nearly 5% while expense growth was in the mid-3s, to remind you that seniors housing isn't perfectly correlated with the broader economy.
The U.K. bounced back with 6.1% same-store NOI growth. We're seeing very strong demand for our properties. Revenue grew by more than 5% while expenses increased in the high-4s. By design, we're a private pay high end business in the U.K. This gives us the ability to better offset cost pressures like the increased minimum wage. It is equally true in the U.S..
Next, I want to share an observation on a broader topic. Seniors housing is a private pay business, and the laws of supply and demand apply. That's why we chose to concentrate in markets with the ability and willingness to pay. This is also happening to markets where it's more difficult to bring new supply. We know that location impacts performance because we've been tracking the data inside our portfolio for years. 
Our data is very powerful in a sector where the window in the industry level performance is limited to asking rents and occupancy. As a result, seniors housing remains an inefficient market. Cap rates hardly vary at all based on location. We think that will change as operating data in the industry becomes more transparent. And when that happens, our unmatched scale in premier markets will be highly valuable.
Turning to outpatient medical. We extended our track record of consistent results, with 2.6% same-store NOI growth. We have excellent long-term visibility into this earning stream, driven by low rollover and our history of renewing the vast majority of maturing leases. 
Next up is the triple-net portfolio. Quarter-after-quarter, including 1Q, the blended growth rate in this segment is in the 3% range. The lease structure gives us consistent and growing rental income notwithstanding any volatility in the underlying operations. That's especially true of skilled nursing, a business that's long been subject to cycles. Public sentiment is even more volatile than the underlying business. And right now, the pendulum has clearly swung toward the negative. I'll contrast this volatility with skilled nursing valuations in the private market, which have been remarkably consistent overtime. If there is a prolonged disconnect between public and private valuations, we may look to take advantage through selective asset sales. 
Moving to investments. Our activity in 1Q was intentionally low given the environment. We funded $350 million at a 7.7% initial cash yield. As usual, these were done in private negotiations, not auctions, which helps explain the healthy yield. We expanded relationships with leading health systems like Ascension and Adventist, and we grew with core partners, including Sunrise, Silverado and Signature. Each investment builds on what makes Welltower unique, premier markets, leading operators, and modern buildings. 
Our stock has come back a bit since our last earnings call, but this still feels like a time to be highly, highly selective with new investments. Our strong balance sheet and unmatched relationships allow us to be flexible, if conditions change. As expected, we had $116 million of loan payoffs last quarter, including $68 million of Genesis mortgage loans. We'll receive continued repayments from Genesis throughout the year. The bridge to HUD business plan is working as planned, will benefit Genesis cash flow and enhance the credit that stands behind our master lease. Now over to Scott Estes."

While signifi",1464,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start to the year with strong quarterly earnings growth, and an increase in our same-store NOI forecast, reflecting our confidence in the continued strength of our portfolio. While significant stock market volatility occurred during the first quarter, we remain highly focused on capital allocation. 
Our current earnings guidance continues to assume that we remain net sellers of assets for the full year. We are also able to enhance our liquidity position during the quarter by opportunistically raising $700 million of 10-year unsecured debt. Importantly, we were able to raise this debt in an overall leverage neutral manner through offsetting debt payoffs and a small amount of equity raise through our DRIP and ATM programs. As a result, we have no senior debt maturing until September 2017, and have only $398 million of secured debt maturing over the remainder of the year. With over $2 billion of current liquidity and a continued focus on capital allocation, our strong financial position allows us to remain both disciplined and opportunistic in regard to any incremental investments, dispositions and capital raises throughout the remainder of the year.
I'll again begin my detailed remarks with perspective on our first quarter financial performance and a minor change we made to our supplement this quarter. We started off the year with strong quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons, generating normalized FFO of $1.13 per share, up 9% versus last year, and normalized FAD of $1.01 per share, increasing 10% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth, and a $1.8 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. 
I'll comment briefly on several of the more noteworthy income statement items this quarter. First, our G&A came in at $46 million for the first quarter. This was in line with our expectations, as the first quarter is typically our highest of the year due to the timing of expensing stock compensation grants for certain employees and directors. 
After a detailed review of our cost this year, we now expect to comment towards the low end of our initial guidance range of $160 million to $165 million for the full year. We recognized impairments of slightly over $14 million in the first quarter. These impairments were a result of slight reductions in the carrying value of 2 relatively small seniors housing portfolios currently held-for-sale, which are now expected to be sold for roughly $167 million in the aggregate. And last, we recognized a tax benefit of $1.7 million in the first quarter. Taxes came in slightly below our expectations for the quarter as a result of both tax planning initiatives and several revisions to our TRS taxable income forecasts. Based on these revised expectations, we now anticipate incurring quarterly tax expense of approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. 
In terms of dividends, we'll pay our 180th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 20 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year, and represents a current dividend yield of 4.9%.
In terms of our supplement, we made only one relatively minor adjustment this quarter, as we moved our U.K.-based private pay outpatient facilities from our hospital category to our outpatient medical category. This was done to reflect the fact that the vast majority of revenue comes from outpatient care and elective short stage surgery just like our outpatient surgical facilities in the U.S. 
I'll turn now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. I think the highlight of our first quarter capital markets activity was the unsecured debt offering, which closed on March 1. We completed the sale of $700 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes price to yield just over 4.3%. We took advantage of strong investor demand to upsize the transaction from the originally announced size of $400 million. This offering helped extend our weighted average senior note maturities to 9.2 years. And as a reminder, that this debt offering was not included in our initial earnings guidance for 2016. In terms of equity, we issued over 1 million shares through our DRIP and ATM program this quarter, raising $93 million in proceeds. As Scott mentioned, we generated $116 million of proceeds through loan payoffs, which included the $68 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. 
In terms of debt repayments, we repaid off $400 million of the 5-year 3 5/8 senior unsecured debt that matured on March 15, 2016. 
And last, we repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.5%, while refinancing $75 million of secured debt at a blended 3.1% rate. 
So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.2 billion available at quarter end with only $645 million of line borrowings and $356 million in cash on balance sheet. Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of the first quarter remained strong. As of March 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization of 39.6% was consistent with last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improve 40 basis points to 32.3%. 
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.7x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage the quarter remained solid at 4.1x and 3.2x, respectively. 
Our secured debt level remained at only 12.1% of total assets at quarter end. We were pleased to receive an affirmation of our BBB+ ratings from Fitch last week. And as a reminder, we sit at Baa2 BBB flat ratings with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P. 
I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance.
First, in terms of same-store cash NOI growth. Based on our strong first quarter result across our entire portfolio, we're comfortable raising our same-store cash NOI guidance for the full year by 25 basis points to 2.75% to 3.25%. We're seeing strength across virtually all of our respective portfolio components, and as Scott mentioned, I think it's appropriate to remain focused on the blended forecast for our entire portfolio for the full year.
In terms of our expectations, the only acquisitions in our forecast beyond those closed in the first quarter are an additional $98 million of investments expected through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. In terms of development, we expect to fund an additional $363 million on projects currently under construction, and expect $283 million of additional development conversions at a blended projected yield of 7.9%.
Moving to dispositions. We continue to include a total of $1 billion in our forecast. This is comprised of the $116 million of loan payoffs during the first quarter. Our current projection of $303 million in proceeds from properties currently held-for-sale at a blended yield on sale of 6.5%, with the remainder representing loan payoffs and other potential property sales over the rest of the year. 
Our capital expenditure forecast remains $83 million for 2016, which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $28 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. 
We typically see lower CapEx spending during the first quarter, so we do expect the remaining CapEx will be higher during the last 3 quarters of the year. 
As previously mentioned, our G&A forecast is tracking around $160 million for the full year at this point. And as I also discussed earlier, our tax expenses are likely to be about $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. So finally, as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represents 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
I think it's important to note that our decision to maintain both our FFO and FAD guidance ranges today was related to the fact that our $700 million bond offering was not in our original forecast, and that there is also still considerable variability around the timing of the approximate $900 million of dispositions that have yet to occur. 
Most importantly, we continue to focus on making prudent capital allocation decisions to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain significant liquidity in the current environment. So in conclusion, our continued focus on capital allocation this year will continue to prioritize enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private payments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage, and retaining ample liquidity and build a greater stability in the broader capital markets environment. So at that point, I'll turn it back to Tom for some closing comments."

And then the third bucket is with Gracewell, which was essentially taken over by Sunrise. And those have been a bit below the underwriting expectations.

But if you look at CMS data, almost $86 million of overpayment was collected in 2014. The -- there's -- the CMS is limited to the recovery audit or look-back period to 6 months from the date of service for patient status reviews as May 15, 2015. And most importantly is that our operator are prepared for this. They have rigorous compliance and documentation procedures, medical necessity is established with the physician at admission. Our care plan is established with patient and therapy team. And therapy encounters are thoroughly documented. So this is not a random process on the part of our operators. It's one of the reasons why we're very concentrated with Genesis because Genesis has the scale, and resources to invest in compliance procedures that helped them operate in an environment, where they are principally being paid by Medicare and Medicaid."

It gets to the point I was making earlier about there is variation in performance by market, by operator. And I don't think the market fully appreciates that yet. We're trying to tell the story. I think a longer-time history will be helpful, but we have seen that in our data. The industry data just isn't there for people to see. There isn't even a reliable source of NOI in the industry. I mean it -- I hate to say it, NIC is doing a great job of trying to change that. But as of today, the best you can get is occupancy and asking rent at the national level.

So one, no coverage, high escalators, and life is great. Press release looks fantastic, and it only took some times a year to -- for people to realize that if the asset quality isn't very good notwithstanding that lease structure, which, on the surface, seems to provide protection for the landlord, at the end of the day is a very risky investment. In our view, it is always been that the higher risk investment is actually those triple-net leases with low assets coverage and low asset quality in comparison to doing RIDEA, which, granted, has some quarter-to-quarter volatility in NOI.

It's certainly nice to have the 2.1% Medicare increase, but there are well-documented headwinds on the skilled side of the business as well as occupancy with length of stay. So it wouldn't surprise us if coverage ticked down, but keep in mind where we're starting from, right? The corporate coverage is around 1.3, the facility level coverage is around 1.6 before management fee or in the year high 1.2s after management fees. So there's a lot of cushion there. We're not talking about will they pay the rent. We're talking about will coverage be 1.24 or 1.28. And at the end of the day, 4 basis points doesn't really impact Welltower a whole lot other than a lot of questions. They pay the rent. If it was substantially lower payment coverage, then I'd be really worried about 1 or 2 basis points."

This morning, I want to talk to you about real estate. The power of owning Class A real estate. What do I mean by that? I mean real estate that is in locations and markets that cannot be easily duplicated. Real estate that is nimble, and",688,"Thank you, Jeff. This morning, I want to talk to you about real estate. The power of owning Class A real estate. What do I mean by that? I mean real estate that is in locations and markets that cannot be easily duplicated. Real estate that is nimble, and adaptive to changing consumer preferences. 
Real estate that defies the conventional wisdom about supply and retains value across economic cycles. Over time, the REITs that own Class A real estate have produced superior and resilient results as compared to REITs that have not followed this strategy. Our quarter is yet another example of a phenomenon that began for us in 2010. This, my friends, is why you own Welltower. 
The headline number that supports our thesis is that our operating same-store NOI grew by 5.5% in the first quarter. Now this number does not come as a surprise to us. In fact, it's totally consistent with the operating same-store NOI growth we have reported for our portfolio over the last 5 years. 
Our total portfolio NOI grew 3.8% and FFO has grown 9%. All parts of our business produced good results, but we did have a phenomenal quarter in our senior housing operating portfolio. While there have been real headwinds from increases in labor costs and other operating expenses, our Class A real estate was able to pass this along to the consumer in strong rate growth while at the same time, increasing occupancy by 60 basis points to 90.7%. 
Now on the last 2 earnings calls, we told you that we remain bullish about the senior housing business, and continue to believe that despite pockets of oversupply in the industry, our portfolio of high barrier to entry markets, premier operators and modern assets will continue to create tremendous value for shareholders by generating attractive growth with minimal CapEx. 
We see the market taking the data on new supply and applying it broadly across the entire senior housing market. 
We think that is a mistake and our performance supports that.
We had a long conversation about our strategy around post-acute and Genesis last quarter. Despite short-term challenges, we continue to believe you need to look beyond headlines and understand how the skilled nursing industry fits in the continuum of care. 
I am very pleased by the fact that CMS recommended a 2.1% rate growth last week. The biggest Medicare increase in 7 years, and I think this supports our thesis. May I remind you that our Genesis portfolio remains concentrated in high density East Coast markets with significant 4-wall profitability. 
On our last call, we also discussed at length our capital allocation framework. Our sustained relative outperformance in same-store NOI growth is a product of this strategy as well as a smart highly targeted investment discipline. 
Capital allocation is not just about when to buy, but also about what to buy, and what not to buy. You may have heard about our acquisition of a site on the corner of 56th Street and Lexington Avenue in New York City. That, together with Hines, we will build the Welltower, a state-of-the-art largely dementia Alzheimer's care facility. The supply of residential care options for the growing elderly population of Manhattan is, at best, pathetic. 
For a population of over 1 million people, there are only 70, 7-0 marginal memory care beds in Manhattan. And I can tell you that they are of marginal quality because we used to own them. The Welltower will be an anchor for an affluent cognitively challenged population that has been forced to live in the shadows. 
The Welltower will make them part of a larger community, which includes Billionaires' Row one block away. Now we are limited by a nondisclosure agreement in what I can share with you today. We hope to give you more color in the coming months. But what I can tell you is that we didn't sacrifice our return expectations and underwriting criteria to be in Manhattan. Frankly, I cannot think of a more Class A real estate opportunity. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott Brinker."

A common question from investors the past few years was what would happen when the cycle turned? The answer today is very positive. 
Today's more challenging environment is highlighting that not all properties are the same, not all markets are the same, and not all operators are the same. Our portfolio outperformed in the up cycle, and today, we're seeing that continue. Each segment turned in a strong quarter with same-store results above guidance. That being said, I want to repeat something we've said in the past. We don't overemphasize any one quarter good or bad. We think about our results over time to reduce the noise that can occur over 90-day increments. 
I'll start with the operating portfolio, where top line fundamentals were incredibly strong. We increased rates 4.2% without sacrificing census, as occupancy increased 60 basis points. The result was 5.5% same-store NOI growth well above expectations. 
CapEx remains at modest levels. The age of our properties is a material advantage. It allows us to generate superior, organic growth, while retaining earnings to fund new investments. 
Here are some color on each country. Performance in the U.S. was outstanding. Same-store NOI grew 5.1%. This is not a case of easy comps as we reported 5.2% growth in 1Q '15, not to mention an 8% CAGR in the first quarter of 2012, '13 and '14. An important takeaway is that our core markets extended their long track record of out performance. And we'll continue to prioritize these markets with our capital allocation. 
Turning to Canada. Our 2 partners, Revera and Chartwell, delivered strong results despite a sluggish economy. Same-store NOI grew 7.2% last quarter. Revenue increased nearly 5% while expense growth was in the mid-3s, to remind you that seniors housing isn't perfectly correlated with the broader economy.
The U.K. bounced back with 6.1% same-store NOI growth. We're seeing very strong demand for our properties. Revenue grew by more than 5% while expenses increased in the high-4s. By design, we're a private pay high end business in the U.K. This gives us the ability to better offset cost pressures like the increased minimum wage. It is equally true in the U.S.
Next, I want to share an observation on a broader topic. Seniors housing is a private pay business, and the laws of supply and demand apply. That's why we chose to concentrate in markets with the ability and willingness to pay. This is also happening to markets where it's more difficult to bring new supply. We know that location impacts performance because we've been tracking the data inside our portfolio for years. 
Our data is very powerful in a sector where the window in the industry level performance is limited to asking rents and occupancy. As a result, seniors housing remains an inefficient market. Cap rates hardly vary at all based on location. We think that will change as operating data in the industry becomes more transparent. And when that happens, our unmatched scale in premier markets will be highly valuable.
Turning to outpatient medical. We extended our track record of consistent results, with 2.6% same-store NOI growth. We have excellent long-term visibility into this earning stream, driven by low rollover and our history of renewing the vast majority of maturing leases. 
Next up is the triple-net portfolio. Quarter-after-quarter, including 1Q, the blended growth rate in this segment is in the 3% range. The lease structure gives us consistent and growing rental income notwithstanding any volatility in the underlying operations. That's especially true of skilled nursing, a business that's long been subject to cycles. Public sentiment is even more volatile than the underlying business. And right now, the pendulum has clearly swung toward the negative. I'll contrast this volatility with skilled nursing valuations in the private market, which have been remarkably consistent over time. If there is a prolonged disconnect between public and private valuations, we may look to take advantage through selective asset sales. 
Moving to investments. Our activity in 1Q was intentionally low given the environment. We funded $350 million at a 7.7% initial cash yield. As usual, these were done in private negotiations, not auctions, which helps explain the healthy yield. We expanded relationships with leading health systems like Ascension and Adventist, and we grew with core partners, including Sunrise, Silverado and Signature. Each investment builds on what makes Welltower unique, premier markets, leading operators, and modern buildings. 
Our stock has come back a bit since our last earnings call, but this still feels like a time to be highly, highly selective with new investments. Our strong balance sheet and unmatched relationships allow us to be flexible, if conditions change. As expected, we had $116 million of loan payoffs last quarter, including $68 million of Genesis mortgage loans. We'll receive continued repayments from Genesis throughout the year. The bridge to HUD business plan is working as planned, will benefit Genesis cash flow and enhance the credit that stands behind our master lease. Now over to Scott Estes."

While signifi",1465,"Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start to the year with strong quarterly earnings growth, and an increase in our same-store NOI forecast, reflecting our confidence in the continued strength of our portfolio. While significant stock market volatility occurred during the first quarter, we remain highly focused on capital allocation. 
Our current earnings guidance continues to assume that we remain net sellers of assets for the full year. We were also able to enhance our liquidity position during the quarter by opportunistically raising $700 million of 10-year unsecured debt. Importantly, we were able to raise this debt in an overall leverage neutral manner through offsetting debt payoffs and a small amount of equity raise through our DRIP and ATM programs. As a result, we have no senior debt maturing until September 2017, and have only $398 million of secured debt maturing over the remainder of the year. With over $2 billion of current liquidity and a continued focus on capital allocation, our strong financial position allows us to remain both disciplined and opportunistic in regard to any incremental investments, dispositions and capital raises throughout the remainder of the year.
I'll again begin my detailed remarks with perspective on our first quarter financial performance and a minor change we made to our supplement this quarter. We started off the year with strong quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons, generating normalized FFO of $1.13 per share, up 9% versus last year, and normalized FAD of $1.01 per share, increasing 10% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth, and the $1.8 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. 
I'll comment briefly on several of the more noteworthy income statement items this quarter. First, our G&A came in at $46 million for the first quarter. This was in line with our expectations, as the first quarter is typically our highest of the year due to the timing of expensing stock compensation grants for certain employees and directors. 
After a detailed review of our cost this year, we now expect to come in towards the low end of our initial guidance range of $160 million to $165 million for the full year. We recognized impairments of slightly over $14 million in the first quarter. These impairments were a result of slight reductions in the carrying value of 2 relatively small seniors housing portfolios currently held-for-sale, which are now expected to be sold for roughly $167 million in the aggregate. And last, we recognized a tax benefit of $1.7 million in the first quarter. Taxes came in slightly below our expectations for the quarter as a result of both tax planning initiatives and several revisions to our TRS taxable income forecasts. Based on these revised expectations, we now anticipate incurring quarterly tax expense of approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. 
In terms of dividends, we'll pay our 180th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 20 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year, and represents a current dividend yield of 4.9%.
In terms of our supplement, we made only one relatively minor adjustment this quarter, as we moved our U.K.-based private pay outpatient facilities from our hospital category to our outpatient medical category. This was done to reflect the fact that the vast majority of revenue comes from outpatient care and elective short stage surgery just like our outpatient surgical facilities in the U.S. 
I'll turn now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. I think the highlight of our first quarter capital markets activity was the unsecured debt offering, which closed on March 1. We completed the sale of $700 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes priced to yield just over 4.3%. We took advantage of strong investor demand to upsize the transaction from the originally announced size of $400 million. This offering helped extend our weighted average senior note maturity to 9.2 years. And as a reminder, this debt offering was not included in our initial earnings guidance for 2016. In terms of equity, we issued over 1 million shares through our DRIP and ATM program this quarter, raising $93 million in proceeds. As Scott mentioned, we generated $116 million of proceeds through loan payoffs, which included the $68 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. 
In terms of debt repayments, we repaid off $400 million of the 5-year 3 5/8 senior unsecured debt that matured on March 15, 2016. 
And last, we repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.5%, while refinancing $75 million of secured debt at a blended 3.1% rate. 
So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.2 billion available at quarter end with only $645 million of line borrowings and $356 million in cash on balance sheet. Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of the first quarter remained strong. As of March 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization of 39.6% was consistent with last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improved 40 basis points to 32.3%. 
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.7x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remained solid at 4.1x and 3.2x, respectively. 
Our secured debt level remained at only 12.1% of total assets at quarter end. We were pleased to receive an affirmation of our BBB+ ratings from Fitch last week. And as a reminder, we sit at Baa2 BBB flat ratings with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P. 
I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance.
First, in terms of same-store cash NOI growth. Based on our strong first quarter result across our entire portfolio, we're comfortable raising our same-store cash NOI guidance for the full year by 25 basis points to 2.75% to 3.25%. We're seeing strength across virtually all of our respective portfolio components, and as Scott mentioned, I think it's appropriate to remain focused on the blended forecast for our entire portfolio for the full year.
In terms of our expectations, the only acquisitions in our forecast beyond those closed in the first quarter are an additional $98 million of investments expected through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. In terms of development, we expect to fund an additional $363 million on projects currently under construction, and expect $283 million of additional development conversions at a blended projected yield of 7.9%.
Moving to dispositions. We continue to include a total of $1 billion in our forecast. This is comprised of the $116 million of loan payoffs during the first quarter. Our current projection of $303 million in proceeds from properties currently held-for-sale at a blended yield on sale of 6.5%, with the remainder representing loan payoffs and other potential property sales over the rest of the year. 
Our capital expenditure forecast remains $83 million for 2016, which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $28 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. 
We typically see lower CapEx spending during the first quarter, so we do expect the remaining CapEx will be higher during the last 3 quarters of the year. 
As previously mentioned, our G&A forecast is tracking around $160 million for the full year at this point. And as I also discussed earlier, our tax expenses are likely to be about $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. So finally, as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represents 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
I think it's important to note that our decision to maintain both our FFO and FAD guidance ranges today was related to the fact that our $700 million bond offering was not in our original forecast, and that there is also still considerable variability around the timing of the approximate $900 million of dispositions that have yet to occur. 
Most importantly, we continue to focus on making prudent capital allocation decisions to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain significant liquidity in the current environment. So in conclusion, our continued focus on capital allocation this year will continue to prioritize enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private payments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage, and retaining ample liquidity and build a greater stability in the broader capital markets environment. So at that point, I'll turn it back to Tom for some closing comments."

We're not really changing the guidance that we gave for the data portfolio. We've increased the company's overall same-store growth projection for the year, and that's, of course, driven in part by the outperformance on the operating portfolio. But we're trying to keep people away from being overly focused on every single segment quarter-to-quarter. This is a portfolio, and it outperformed in the first quarter. And that's why we raised the guidance. Your question is, do we feel good about the operating portfolio at the end of the day. The answer is yes. We have much better revenue growth driven by occupancy and rate and we were expecting at the beginning of the year, we don't see that changing overnight, but we also don't see a need to continue to update every quarter what the guidance is going to be."

And then the third bucket is with Gracewell, which was essentially taken over by Sunrise. And those have been a bit below the underwriting expectations. I think Sunrise, to my point earlier to John's question, is just a lower price point than Sunrise is accustomed to operate in the U.K. And I think they're still trying to figure out what the right cost structure is for that lower revenue building.

The -- there's -- the CMS has limited the recovery audit or look-back period to 6 months from the date of service for patient status reviews as of May 15, 2015. And most importantly is that our operator are prepared for this. They have rigorous compliance and documentation procedures, medical necessity is established with the physician at admission. A care plan is established with patient and therapy team. And therapy encounters are thoroughly documented. So this is not a random process on the part of our operators.

Ours are at roughly 10%, HUD is in low 4s. That's a big difference for them. But longer term, we actually think the story is very positive. I mean our master lease is 187 properties and it matures in 16 years. They have a lot of individual leases or smaller leases that mature either next year or in the next 5 years that, frankly, have very low coverage. And either they'll reject them or they will substantially renegotiate the rents downwards. So I think there's a lot of those types of opportunities. They could certainly exit some of the lower quality buildings that they've acquired, and we'd support them in that effort. There are optimization opportunities in the assets that they acquired because they are a premier operator. And if you think long term with bundling, I mean, the challenge right now is that hospitals and managed care payers are already starting to reduce admissions to skilled nursing. But I don't think it really started the process of targeting the best-in-class properties in each market. And when that happens I think there actually is an opportunity for Genesis to outperform and take market share. But we're just not in that phase of the bundling rollout yet."

And clearly, we've done a lot better than that in our RIDEA portfolio. So there is a divergence. It gets to the point I was making earlier about there is variation in performance by market, by operator. And I don't think the market fully appreciates that yet. We're trying to tell the story. I think a longer-time history will be helpful, but we have seen that in our data. The industry data just isn't there for people to see. There isn't even a reliable source of NOI in the industry. I mean it -- I hate to say it, NIC is doing a great job of trying to change that. But as of today, the best you can get is occupancy and asking rent at the national level. I mean, man, you talked about a lot of room to go, you can pair that with 15 to 20 years of data in our portfolio that is an excruciating detail for us to look at and help make investment decisions, we feel like it's a huge proprietary advantage that we have."

But the reality is it's the main reason you haven't seen us do a lot of triple-net lease acquisitions in recent years because I think there was a mindset by some, and this is going back a couple of years, that if you could put something in the triple-net lease, it was a low risk investment, right? So one, no coverage, high escalators, and life is great. Press release looks fantastic, and it only took some times a year to -- for people to realize that if the asset quality isn't very good notwithstanding that lease structure, which, on the surface, seems to provide protection for the landlord, at the end of the day is a very risky investment. In our view, it is always been that the higher risk investment is actually those triple-net leases with low assets coverage and low asset quality in comparison to doing RIDEA, which, granted, has some quarter-to-quarter volatility in NOI.

The power of owning Class A real estate. What do I mean by that? I mean real estate that is in locations and markets that cannot be easily duplicated. Real estate that is nimble, and adaptive to changing consumer preferences. 
Real estate that defies the conventional wisdom about supply and retains value across economic cycles. Over time, the REITs that own Class A real estate have produced superior and resilient results as compared to REITs that have not followed this strategy. Our quarter is yet another example of a phenomenon that began for us in 2010. This, my friends, is why you own Welltower. 
The headline number that supports our thesis is that our operating same-store NOI grew by 5.5% in the first quarter. Now this number does not come as a surprise to us. In fact, it's totally consistent with the operating same-store NOI growth we have reported for our portfolio over the last 5 years. 
Our total portfolio NOI grew 3.8% and FFO has grown 9%. All parts of our business produced good results, but we did have a phenomenal quarter in our senior housing operating portfolio. While there have been real headwinds from increases in labor costs and other operating expenses, our Class A real estate was able to pass this along to the consumer in strong rate growth while at the same time, increasing occupancy by 60 basis points to 90.7%. 
Now on the last 2 earnings calls, we told you that we remain bullish about the senior housing business, and continue to believe that despite pockets of oversupply in the industry, our portfolio of high barrier to entry markets, premier operators and modern assets will continue to create tremendous value for shareholders by generating attractive growth with minimal CapEx. 
We see the market taking the data on new supply and applying it broadly across the entire senior housing market. 
We think that is a mistake and our performance supports that.
We had a long conversation about our strategy around post-acute and Genesis last quarter. Despite short-term challenges, we continue to believe you need to look beyond headlines and understand how the skilled nursing industry fits in the continuum of care. 
I am very pleased by the fact that CMS recommended a 2.1% rate growth last week. The biggest Medicare increase in 7 years, and I think this supports our thesis. May I remind you that our Genesis portfolio remains concentrated in high density East Coast markets with significant 4-wall profitability. 
On our last call, we also discussed at length our capital allocation framework. Our sustained relative outperformance in same-store NOI growth is a product of this strategy as well as a smart highly targeted investment discipline. 
Capital allocation is not just about when to buy, but also about what to buy, and what not to buy. You may have heard about our acquisition of a site on the corner of 56th Street and Lexington Avenue in New York City. That, together with Hines, we will build the Welltower, a state-of-the-art largely dementia Alzheimer's care facility. The supply of residential care options for the growing elderly population of Manhattan is, at best, pathetic. 
For a population of over 1 million people, there are only 70, 7-0 marginal memory care beds in Manhattan. And I can tell you that they are of marginal quality because we used to own them. The Welltower will be an anchor for an affluent cognitively challenged population that has been forced to live in the shadows. 
The Welltower will make them part of a larger community, which includes Billionaires' Row one block away. Now we are limited by a nondisclosure agreement in what I can share with you today. We hope to give you more color in the coming months. But what I can tell you is that we didn't sacrifice our return expectations and underwriting criteria to be in Manhattan. Frankly, I cannot think of a more Class A real estate opportunity. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott Brinker."

A common question from investors the past few years was what would happen when the cycle turned? The answer today is very positive. Today's more challenging environment is highlighting that not all properties are the same, not all",836,"Okay. Thank you, Tom. A common question from investors the past few years was what would happen when the cycle turned? The answer today is very positive. 
Today's more challenging environment is highlighting that not all properties are the same, not all markets are the same, and not all operators are the same. Our portfolio outperformed in the up cycle, and today, we're seeing that continue. Each segment turned in a strong quarter with same-store results above guidance. That being said, I want to repeat something we've said in the past. We don't overemphasize any one quarter good or bad. We think about our results over time to reduce the noise that can occur over 90-day increments. 
I'll start with the operating portfolio, where top line fundamentals were incredibly strong. We increased rates 4.2% without sacrificing census, as occupancy increased 60 basis points. The result was 5.5% same-store NOI growth well above expectations. 
CapEx remains at modest levels. The age of our properties is a material advantage. It allows us to generate superior, organic growth, while retaining earnings to fund new investments. 
Here are some color on each country. Performance in the U.S. was outstanding. Same-store NOI grew 5.1%. This is not a case of easy comps as we reported 5.2% growth in 1Q '15, not to mention an 8% CAGR in the first quarter of 2012, '13 and '14. An important takeaway is that our core markets extended their long track record of out performance. And we'll continue to prioritize these markets with our capital allocation. 
Turning to Canada. Our 2 partners, Revera and Chartwell, delivered strong results despite a sluggish economy. Same-store NOI grew 7.2% last quarter. Revenue increased nearly 5% while expense growth was in the mid-3s, to remind you that seniors housing isn't perfectly correlated with the broader economy.
The U.K. bounced back with 6.1% same-store NOI growth. We're seeing very strong demand for our properties. Revenue grew by more than 5% while expenses increased in the high-4s. By design, we're a private pay high end business in the U.K. This gives us the ability to better offset cost pressures like the increased minimum wage. It is equally true in the U.S.
Next, I want to share an observation on a broader topic. Seniors housing is a private pay business, and the laws of supply and demand apply. That's why we chose to concentrate in markets with the ability and willingness to pay. This is also happening to markets where it's more difficult to bring new supply. We know that location impacts performance because we've been tracking the data inside our portfolio for years. 
Our data is very powerful in a sector where the window in the industry level performance is limited to asking rents and occupancy. As a result, seniors housing remains an inefficient market. Cap rates hardly vary at all based on location. We think that will change as operating data in the industry becomes more transparent. And when that happens, our unmatched scale in premier markets will be highly valuable.
Turning to outpatient medical. We extended our track record of consistent results, with 2.6% same-store NOI growth. We have excellent long-term visibility into this earning stream, driven by low rollover and our history of renewing the vast majority of maturing leases. 
Next up is the triple-net portfolio. Quarter-after-quarter, including 1Q, the blended growth rate in this segment is in the 3% range. The lease structure gives us consistent and growing rental income notwithstanding any volatility in the underlying operations. That's especially true of skilled nursing, a business that's long been subject to cycles. Public sentiment is even more volatile than the underlying business. And right now, the pendulum has clearly swung toward the negative. I'll contrast this volatility with skilled nursing valuations in the private market, which have been remarkably consistent over time. If there is a prolonged disconnect between public and private valuations, we may look to take advantage through selective asset sales. 
Moving to investments. Our activity in 1Q was intentionally low given the environment. We funded $350 million at a 7.7% initial cash yield. As usual, these were done in private negotiations, not auctions, which helps explain the healthy yield. We expanded relationships with leading health systems like Ascension and Adventist, and we grew with core partners, including Sunrise, Silverado and Signature. Each investment builds on what makes Welltower unique, premier markets, leading operators, and modern buildings. 
Our stock has come back a bit since our last earnings call, but this still feels like a time to be highly, highly selective with new investments. Our strong balance sheet and unmatched relationships allow us to be flexible, if conditions change. As expected, we had $116 million of loan payoffs last quarter, including $68 million of Genesis mortgage loans. We'll receive continued repayments from Genesis throughout the year. The bridge to HUD business plan is working as planned, will benefit Genesis cash flow and enhance the credit that stands behind our master lease. Now over to Scott Estes."

We're off to a great start to the year with strong quarterly earnings growth, and an increase in our same-store NOI forecast, reflecting our confidence in the continued strength of our portfolio. While significant stock market volatility occurred during the first quarter, we remain highly focused on capital allocation. 
Our current earnings guidance continues to assume that we remain net sellers of assets for the full year. We were also able to enhance our liquidity position during the quarter by opportunistically raising $700 million of 10-year unsecured debt. Importantly, we were able to raise this debt in an overall leverage neutral manner through offsetting debt payoffs and a small amount of equity raise through our DRIP and ATM programs. As a result, we have no senior debt maturing until September 2017, and have only $398 million of secured debt maturing over the remainder of the year. With over $2 billion of current liquidity and a continued focus on capital allocation, our strong financial position allows us to remain both disciplined and opportunistic in regard to any incremental investments, dispositions and capital raises throughout the remainder of the year.
I'll again begin my detailed remarks with perspective on our first quarter financial performance and a minor change we made to our supplement this quarter. We started off the year with strong quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons, generating normalized FFO of $1.13 per share, up 9% versus last year, and normalized FAD of $1.01 per share, increasing 10% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth, and the $1.8 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. 
I'll comment briefly on several of the more noteworthy income statement items this quarter. First, our G&A came in at $46 million for the first quarter. This was in line with our expectations, as the first quarter is typically our highest of the year due to the timing of expensing stock compensation grants for certain employees and directors. 
After a detailed review of our cost this year, we now expect to come in towards the low end of our initial guidance range of $160 million to $165 million for the full year. We recognized impairments of slightly over $14 million in the first quarter. These impairments were a result of slight reductions in the carrying value of 2 relatively small seniors housing portfolios currently held-for-sale, which are now expected to be sold for roughly $167 million in the aggregate. And last, we recognized a tax benefit of $1.7 million in the first quarter. Taxes came in slightly below our expectations for the quarter as a result of both tax planning initiatives and several revisions to our TRS taxable income forecasts. Based on these revised expectations, we now anticipate incurring quarterly tax expense of approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. 
In terms of dividends, we'll pay our 180th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 20 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year, and represents a current dividend yield of 4.9%.
In terms of our supplement, we made only one relatively minor adjustment this quarter, as we moved our U.K.-based private pay outpatient facilities from our hospital category to our outpatient medical category. This was done to reflect the fact that the vast majority of revenue comes from outpatient care and elective short stage surgery just like our outpatient surgical facilities in the U.S. 
I'll turn now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. I think the highlight of our first quarter capital markets activity was the unsecured debt offering, which closed on March 1. We completed the sale of $700 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes priced to yield just over 4.3%. We took advantage of strong investor demand to upsize the transaction from the originally announced size of $400 million. This offering helped extend our weighted average senior note maturity to 9.2 years. And as a reminder, this debt offering was not included in our initial earnings guidance for 2016. In terms of equity, we issued over 1 million shares through our DRIP and ATM program this quarter, raising $93 million in proceeds. As Scott mentioned, we generated $116 million of proceeds through loan payoffs, which included the $68 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. 
In terms of debt repayments, we repaid off $400 million of the 5-year 3 5/8 senior unsecured debt that matured on March 15, 2016. 
And last, we repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.5%, while refinancing $75 million of secured debt at a blended 3.1% rate. 
So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.2 billion available at quarter end with only $645 million of line borrowings and $356 million in cash on balance sheet. Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of the first quarter remained strong. As of March 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization of 39.6% was consistent with last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improved 40 basis points to 32.3%. 
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.7x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remained solid at 4.1x and 3.2x, respectively. 
Our secured debt level remained at only 12.1% of total assets at quarter end. We were pleased to receive an affirmation of our BBB+ ratings from Fitch last week. And as a reminder, we sit at Baa2 BBB flat ratings with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P. 
I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance.
First, in terms of same-store cash NOI growth. Based on our strong first quarter result across our entire portfolio, we're comfortable raising our same-store cash NOI guidance for the full year by 25 basis points to 2.75% to 3.25%. We're seeing strength across virtually all of our respective portfolio components, and as Scott mentioned, I think it's appropriate to remain focused on the blended forecast for our entire portfolio for the full year.
In terms of our expectations, the only acquisitions in our forecast beyond those closed in the first quarter are an additional $98 million of investments expected through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. In terms of development, we expect to fund an additional $363 million on projects currently under construction, and expect $283 million of additional development conversions at a blended projected yield of 7.9%.
Moving to dispositions. We continue to include a total of $1 billion in our forecast. This is comprised of the $116 million of loan payoffs during the first quarter. Our current projection of $303 million in proceeds from properties currently held-for-sale at a blended yield on sale of 6.5%, with the remainder representing loan payoffs and other potential property sales over the rest of the year. 
Our capital expenditure forecast remains $83 million for 2016, which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $28 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. 
We typically see lower CapEx spending during the first quarter, so we do expect the remaining CapEx will be higher during the last 3 quarters of the year. 
As previously mentioned, our G&A forecast is tracking around $160 million for the full year at this point. And as I also discussed earlier, our tax expenses are likely to be about $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. So finally, as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represents 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
I think it's important to note that our decision to maintain both our FFO and FAD guidance ranges today was related to the fact that our $700 million bond offering was not in our original forecast, and that there is also still considerable variability around the timing of the approximate $900 million of dispositions that have yet to occur. 
Most importantly, we continue to focus on making prudent capital allocation decisions to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain significant liquidity in the current environment. So in conclusion, our continued focus on capital allocation this year will continue to prioritize enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private payments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage, and retaining ample liquidity and build a greater stability in the broader capital markets environment. So at that point, I'll turn it back to Tom for some closing comments."

And today, look, skilled nursing is only 15-or-so percent of our overall company. So it's hard to say how much it impacts our stock price.

And then the third bucket is with Gracewell, which was essentially taken over by Sunrise. And those have been a bit below the underwriting expectations.

The -- there's -- the CMS has limited the recovery audit or look-back period to 6 months from the date of service for patient status reviews as of May 15, 2015. And most importantly is that our operator are prepared for this. They have rigorous compliance and documentation procedures, medical necessity is established with the physician at admission. A care plan is established with patient and therapy team. And therapy encounters are thoroughly documented. So this is not a random process on the part of our operators.

And Cleveland Clinic isn't running that facility. There's another operator going to be running that facility. I believe it's Select Medical. That, to me, is a good indication of where the future might be going. And it validates the fact that the sector is not going away when you have one of the finest hospital systems in the world now putting skilled nursing, not only on their campus, but actually attached to the building. So I think that more and more from our conversations with the leading health systems, we don't spend a lot of time with the nonleading health systems. So all I can tell you is the view from talking to the major players who will survive in the hospital sector that they want to see a strong skilled nursing industry. They know it is part of the future, and part of their ability to manage profitably under an ever-changing reimbursement environment."

And if anything, you're seeing payment coverages unfortunately decline a bit or, at best, stay flat, which suggest the underlying NOI at the property is only growing 3%. And clearly, we've done a lot better than that in our RIDEA portfolio. So there is a divergence. It gets to the point I was making earlier about there is variation in performance by market, by operator. And I don't think the market fully appreciates that yet. We're trying to tell the story. I think a longer-time history will be helpful, but we have seen that in our data. The industry data just isn't there for people to see. There isn't even a reliable source of NOI in the industry. I mean it -- I hate to say it, NIC is doing a great job of trying to change that. But as of today, the best you can get is occupancy and asking rent at the national level. I mean, man, you talked about a lot of room to go, you can pair that with 15 to 20 years of data in our portfolio that is an excruciating detail for us to look at and help make investment decisions, we feel like it's a huge proprietary advantage that we have."

But the reality is it's the main reason you haven't seen us do a lot of triple-net lease acquisitions in recent years because I think there was a mindset by some, and this is going back a couple of years, that if you could put something in the triple-net lease, it was a low risk investment, right? So one, no coverage, high escalators, and life is great. Press release looks fantastic, and it only took some times a year to -- for people to realize that if the asset quality isn't very good notwithstanding that lease structure, which, on the surface, seems to provide protection for the landlord, at the end of the day is a very risky investment. In our view, it is always been that the higher risk investment is actually those triple-net leases with low assets coverage and low asset quality in comparison to doing RIDEA, which, granted, has some quarter-to-quarter volatility in NOI.

And hopefully, that situation is now right sized and their coverages can start to pick up again."

Our strong results for this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments.From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6% and funds available for distribution was up 9%. Scot",545,"Thanks, Jeff. Our strong results for this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments.
From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6% and funds available for distribution was up 9%. Scott will take you through a deeper dive on what is driving our performance, but first, let me give you the high points.
Overall same-store NOI for all of Welltower was up 3.3% versus last year. This is largely being driven by the performance of our seniors housing business. The senior housing operating portfolio registered 4% same-store NOI growth versus a year earlier. Despite the industry concerns about new supply and wage expense growth, the Welltower family of operators were able to pass along, on average, 4% rate increases, while increasing occupancy by 100 basis points. These results can only be realized from owning A quality real estate in A quality markets. That is the Welltower story.
A key differentiator for Welltower is that 90% of our revenue is from private pay sources. You should expect to see our private pay percentage increase through this year. However, we also have a strong history of managing the credit exposure to government reimbursement for our shareholders, so regarding our Genesis assets, we believe Genesis is continuing to strengthen its business platform and financial position. I can only speak to our Genesis portfolio, and I can tell you that the operating performance of our portfolio improved during the quarter.
We are pleased to see a strong final Medicare rate increase, the DOJ settlement that was announced by Genesis yesterday and both Welltower and Genesis shareholders should be pleased to have some clarity around their capital structure. This goes a long way towards adding some balance to the Genesis story, and we believe positions the Genesis management team to focus their time and energy on the future of their business.
Speaking of the future, we are pleased to announce the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition this morning. This is an ideal, strategic acquisition for us. It allows us to go deeper into 2 important core markets, significantly solidifying our #1 market share in Los Angeles, gaining the #1 position in San Francisco and which, by the way, adds to our already #1 market positions in New York, Boston and Seattle. 5 of the sexy 6 core markets in the United States.
The Vintage portfolio will be managed by Sunrise, Silverado and SRG, 3 of our operators with a strong position in these markets. The Vintage team has built a great business with some irreplaceable assets. We expect rebranding and connecting these assets to the broader Welltower senior care network will enhance their value and capture significant upside for our shareholders. I do hope you will review the Vintage portfolio slide presentation available on our website.
Our strategy of building scale in A quality real estate in the leading core markets in the U.S., U.K. and Canada is driving the excellent results we are reporting today. Our ability to bolt-on a large acquisition like Vintage underscores the dominance of the Welltower franchise and enhances our ability to continue to drive best-in-class operating results and growth for our shareholders.
Now Scott Brinker will give you a closer look at our operating performance."

Welltower is known for discipline around high-quality real estate and operating partners. That discipline delivered another solid quarter, with 3.3% same-store NOI growth, just above the high end of annual guidance. The operating portfolio led the way.
Same-store NOI grew 4%, rental rates were up 3.8% and occupancy increased 100 basis points, all were above expectations. To date, we're proving resilient to new supply and higher labor costs. Our diversification by operator, service type and geography is a key attribute. An example is that same-store NOI in Canada last quarter increased 7.1%, outstanding work by our partners at Chartwell and Revera. Their performance offset more modest growth in U.K. 2 years ago, the roles were reversed, showing the benefit of diversification.
By design, more than half of our Canadian NOI comes from Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver and Ottawa, the 4 largest markets in Canada. Over the past few years, our properties in these 4 core markets have produced 5-plus percent annual NOI growth, far above any comparative benchmarks. We have #1 market share in several of these markets and intend to go deeper over time.
Same-store NOI in the U.S. grew 3.5% last quarter. We continue to see wide variance by market, with clear outperformance from our core markets. Those being Southern and Northern California, Seattle, Boston, New York, New Jersey and D.C., Northern Virginia. Including the Vintage acquisition, our 6 core markets will account for nearly 60% of the NOI in our U.S. operating portfolio. We've always liked the supply and demand fundamentals in these markets and they've rewarded us with consistently higher rate growth, better margins and same-store NOI growth in the mid- to high single digits.
We very deliberately formed partnerships with the leading operators in these markets, including Sunrise, Silverado, Belmont Village, SRG, Benchmark, Epic, Mayo Gardens and Brandywine. Their operating expertise helps our real estate avoid commodity status. They make our market position even more defensible.
Including the Vintage acquisition, we'll have #1 market share in 5 of these 6 core markets and #2 share in the 6. Any other market share is only in the mid-teens, leaving plenty of room for growth.
The U.K. operating portfolio produced 2.7% same-store NOI growth last quarter. As expected, labor cost are headwind. To date, thanks to our premium locations, we've had enough pricing power to offset most of those costs. Half of our NOI in the U.K. comes from the RIDEA structure and the other half is triple-net, with 2% to 3% annual rent escalators. This 50-50 mix in the U.K. this is a nice balance of upside and stability.
Outpatient medical results continue to be boring but in a good way, with another quarter of same-store growth in the mid-2% range. There's excellent visibility into this income stream, driven by low lease roll over and a high retention rate. Also, the vast majority of the leases are triple-net, which gives us reliable earnings growth because expenses are passed through to tenants.
Moving to triple-net seniors housing. Same-store NOI grew 2.8%, in line with history and our expectations. Payment coverage moved higher, and we see potential for a slow upward trend over time.
Skilled nursing and post-acute. Same-store NOI increased 3.6%. Payment coverage declined a few basis points, primarily due to certain assets being moved to held for sale, and therefore, out of the calculation. More important, our Genesis properties continue to perform well given the environment. Our master lease saw a nice improvement in 2Q versus the previous 2 quarters as Genesis adapts to the new environment. Yesterday, Genesis made several positive announcements, including covenant relief and a term loan refinancing through Welltower and Omega on a 60/40 basis. For Welltower shareholders, this should be viewed as an important first step in a much larger process. As of yesterday, we are better positioned to reduce our Genesis concentration. We own our core assets in their core markets, so getting buyers comfortable with our real estate has never been our concern.
3 things changed yesterday: One, the hospital lender is gone; two, buyers can underwrite the corporate credit with more clarity; and three, Genesis can now focus on running their business rather than on inherited DOJ investigations, covenants and debt maturities.
We had already been seeing inbound interest in acquiring Genesis real estate from us, and we expect the interest level to have increased over the past 24 hours. We raised $227 million of capital last quarter through dispositions and loan payoffs, including $61 million of Genesis mortgage loan repayments. The largest asset sale was in Canada where senior housing cap rates are now right on top of the U.S. When we entered Canada nearly 5 years ago, the spreads in the U.S. was at least 100 basis points. Since then, institutional capital is poured into the sector, driving down cap rates. We took advantage last quarter by selling a noncore triple-net portfolio in Alberta for $125 million, which is a mid-5% cap rate. The price was particularly attractive to us in light of the weak economy in that province.
We closed $356 million of new investments last quarter at a 7.2% initial cash yield, a healthy spread to our cost of capital. Our operating partners continued to be a unique source of high quality investments at reasonable prices. And that takes us a to our pending acquisition of the Vintage portfolio in California for $1.15 billion. This portfolio is middle of the fairway for us. First, 100% of the NOI is in our core markets. We're going deeper in the markets where we have an incredible footprint and a track record of success. Second, Welltower is uniquely positioned to unlock value here. We chose SRG, Sunrise and Silverado to take over management of the properties. Seniors housing is not a one-size-fits-all business, and we have the unique luxury of hand picking among our operating partners for the task at hand. SRG is an expert at large communities. Sunrise excels in midsize properties, and Silverado is the memory care specialist, and that's exactly how we allocated the 19 properties.
The cap rate is expected to improve from about 5% in Year 1 to the mid- to high-6s at stabilization. That improvement is driven by occupancy, rate and expense assumptions that are based on our partners deep experience in these markets. Vintage is a very unique opportunity due to its scale in high-barrier markets. It includes irreplaceable properties in San Francisco, including 1 a few blocks from Knob Hill and 1 a few blocks from Golden Gate Park. Also, the timing for a big core acquisition is perfect for us, given our pending dispositions.
And that's a good segue to Scott Estes."

We were pleased to generate another solid quarter of earnings results and operating performance at our portfolio. I'd like to focus my comments this morning on how we're thinking about our business from",1562,"All right. Thanks, Scot, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to generate another solid quarter of earnings results and operating performance at our portfolio. I'd like to focus my comments this morning on how we're thinking about our business from a financial perspective as we enter the second half of the year.
As Tom and Scott mentioned, we will not be shy about looking for incremental disposition opportunities throughout the remainder of 2016. As a result, you should expect it to remain focused around our capital allocation theme this year, which emphasizes the following 3 components: First, we'll look to maximize our financial flexibility through enhanced liquidity, as evidenced by the recent increase in our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion; second, we intend to further strengthen our balance sheet by using incremental disposition proceeds to fund announced investments and continue to reduce leverage and strengthen our credit metrics; and third, we intend to further enhance the quality of our portfolio through targeted asset sales, which will remain focused on reducing our skilled nursing exposure and increasing our private pay mix.
So again, begin my detailed remarks with some perspective on our second quarter financial performance and several of the more significant changes made to our supplemental package this quarter. In terms of second quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.15 per share, up a solid 6% versus last year and normalized debt of $1.04 per share, which increased 9% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $1.9 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. Overall, I think this is a fairly straightforward quarterly report as our net investment volume of $129 million was relatively light, a G&A of $39.9 million was in line with expectations and tax expenses only slightly less than expected.
The only somewhat unusual item was on our other income line, which included an additional $11.8 million related to the receipt of insurance proceeds and the release of an escrow. The benefit of both of which were backed out of our normalized earnings results.
Moving on to dividends. We will pay our 181st consecutive quarterly cash dividend on August 22 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents the current dividend yield of 4.3%. I'd also like to point out 3 fairly significant enhancements we made to our supplemental package this quarter. First, you can see at the bottom of Page 5, that we enhanced our CapEx disclosure to include both recurring CapEx that impacts our normalized but also the other CapEx amounts that are generally the value enhancing larger renovation project throughout our portfolio.
Second, on Page 8, we added detailed triple-net payment coverage data that highlights both the EBITDAR coverage and duration of the individual leases in our portfolio.
And third, on Page 29, we added disclosure related to our same-store NOI calculation methodology, which details the specific adjustments made to arrive at our same property count at the top of the page and the adjustments to arrive at the same-store NOI by property type at the bottom of the page. I think our intent here is to be as transparent as possible in showing you how we calculate our same-store results.
Now turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The second quarter was fairly quiet from a capital market activity perspective. I think the highlight of the quarter occurred in May when we further enhanced our financial flexibility by increasing our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion, while extending the initial term through May of 2020. Our new line is priced at LIBOR plus 90 basis points, represents savings of 2.5 basis points from our previous line and carries a 1 year extension option and an accordion feature for additional $1 billion. This brings our total unsecured credit facility to $3.7 billion when including our U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar term loans, which were also extended for another 5 years.
In terms of equity. We raised $64 million by issuing 914,000 shares through our DRIP program this quarter, but we also generated $227 million of proceeds through dispositions and loan payoffs, which importantly, included $61 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. And last, we repaid approximately $151 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.2%, while issuing $87 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3%. So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.7 billion available at quarter end with only $745 million of line borrowings and $467 million in cash on balance sheet.
Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of the second quarter remain strong. As of June 30, our net debt to unappreciated books cap of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improved 230 basis points to 30%. Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA improved to 5.5x. While our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remains solid at 4.2x and 3.3x, respectively. Our secured debt remains at only 11.9% of total assets to quarter end. In addition, we were pleased to receive an upgrade in our senior debt ratings from Moody's to Baa1 in June.
In light of the recent Brexit vote, I'd like to take just a moment to remind you that we have fairly little financial exposure to the recent weakness in the pound sterling as a result of our hedging program. More specifically, as of June 30, our U.K. exposure from a balance sheet perspective is over 80% hedged, through a combination of sterling denominated unsecured debt and other currency hedges in place while our earnings out of the U.K. are approximately 90% hedged, year interest expense on debt, G&A, CapEx and cash flow hedges. Since the U.K. does represent only 8% of our total NOI, each 10% move in the pound against the dollar currently has an annualized earnings impact of less than $0.01 per year.
I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our acquisition guidance includes those completed during the first half of the year, the $1.15 billion Vintage portfolio and an additional $48 million of investments expected through our 3 main partnerships.
Moving to dispositions. We've increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $1.3 billion in proceeds from the previous $1 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $343 million in proceeds received during the first half of the year, $769 million of proceeds from properties currently held for sale with the remainder representing loan pay off and other potential property sales over the rest of the year. Most of the $300 million of incremental disposition proceeds that were added to our guidance this quarter are skilled nursing assets and do include $68 million from our Genesis portfolio.
As Tom and Scott mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell additional Genesis assets above and beyond those included in our current guidance. And just to be clear, our exposure to Genesis has declined by $57 million for the 3 Genesis-related items that have been disclosed over the past 2 days, which includes the $61 million in mortgage loans repaid through the quarter, the $68 million in pending dispositions, partially offset by the $72 million new term loan.
In terms of our same-store NOI growth forecast. There's no change to our blended full year estimate of 2.75% to 3.25%. So I would say that we're tracking towards the higher end of the range at this point, driven largely by the strength of our seniors housing operating portfolio. Our FAD CapEx forecast is currently $82 million for 2016 comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $27 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. We do expect CapEx spending to ramp a bit during the latter half of the year due to the timing of projected expenditures.
Our G&A forecast continues to track towards the low end of our initial guidance at approximately $160 million for the full year at this point. Our tax line item is projected to return to an expense of about $3 million to $4 million per quarter during each of the last 2 quarters of this year based on slightly higher taxable income forecast. And as a result of all of these assumptions, we're maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represents 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
I think our decision to maintain guidance was largely based on the fact that the incremental dispositions added to our guidance this quarter should be roughly offset by the Vintage portfolio acquisition and continued solid operating portfolio performance through the second quarter.
So in conclusion, we remain focused on our capital allocation efforts this year that will continue to prioritize, maximizing financial flexibility through increased liquidity, strengthening our balance sheet by lowering leverage and enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix.
So that concludes my remarks. And I think at this point in time, I'll turn it to you for some closing comments."

I think the service level, the pricepoint is going to change pretty dramatically, and we've chosen 3 operating partners to do that with who have extremely deep experience in this market so we underwritten occupancy rate and expenses assumptions that a very much based on the historical experience in these markets. In any time you do an operator transition, you have to assume there's going to be a decline in Year 1, especially if you're increasing the service next, it's just the way it works. It expenses go up first and it takes time to be able to increase occupancy and rate to match the service level that you implement Day 1, and no doubt, you have staffing changes as well as turnover within the rest of the population. So the Year 1 is always a bit depressed."

I think we've seen a very different view of the impact of Brexit over the last couple of weeks. The think you have to understand is 99% of the population in our buildings are U.K. residents. So they are not leaving the U.K. because of Brexit. The U.K. is not going to be building new assisted living assets for its population. More and more, the U.K. residents will have to turn to a private pay alternative to local authority funded eldercare. And the bulk of our assets are in the one that's in metropolitan area, which I don't think you bet against London long-term. I think London is at a 30-year head start on building an irreplaceable infrastructure and economic machine that will prevail regardless of what happens here. So I don't think we're losing sleep over it. I think there are some challenges. You've heard us talk about on the wage side in the U.K. but we continue to manage through that again for the same reasons why we're managing through that in the U.S. I said we have the best located real estate with the best operators and people want to live in this portfolio.

I would say that we are laser-focused on building scale in the top markets in the country. Scott mentioned that the sixth of the Sexy 6 is D.C., where we're #2. But expect that we are very focused on building scale in D.C.. A number of our operators have development properties being constructed in the Greater D.C. market. That's an important market for us. But you've heard us say this before, we are looking to go deep in the top core markets in the 3 countries in which we operate and get as close to the center of the core as possible, which is not typically where you found senior housing assets. So that speaks to what we're doing in New York City, which we talked about on our last call, and it speaks to some of the things we're doing in markets like Toronto, very much in the center of the urban market there. You will see assets we are either own today are developing in Los Angeles. So it's very much our strategy, expects you're going to continue to see us to follow that strategy.

I didn't comment much on that but again, our guidance was $300 million of incremental dispositions largely in the third quarter, about evenly offset by the benefits of the Vintage acquisition with probably more towards the later part of the year, end of the fourth quarter, plus some better operating performance kind of netted each other out."

Our strong results for this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments.From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6%,  and funds available for distribution was up 9%. Th",546,"Thanks, Jeff. Our strong results for this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments.
From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6%,  and funds available for distribution was up 9%. The Scotts will take you through a deeper dive on what is driving our performance, but first, let me give you the high points.
Overall, same-store NOI for all of Welltower was up 3.3% versus last year. This is largely being driven by the performance of our seniors housing business. The senior housing operating portfolio registered 4% same-store NOI growth versus a year earlier. Despite the industry concerns about new supply and wage expense growth, the Welltower family of operators were able to pass along, on average, 4% rate increases, while increasing occupancy by 100 basis points. These results can only be realized from owning A quality real estate in A quality markets. That is the Welltower story.
A key differentiator for Welltower is that 90% of our revenue is from private pay sources. You should expect to see our private pay percentage increase through this year. However, we also have a strong history of managing the credit exposure to government reimbursement for our shareholders. So regarding our Genesis assets, we believe Genesis is continuing to strengthen its business platform and financial position. I can only speak to our Genesis portfolio, and I can tell you that the operating performance of our portfolio improved during the quarter.
We are pleased to see a strong final Medicare rate increase, the DOJ settlement that was announced by Genesis yesterday and both Welltower and Genesis shareholders should be pleased to have some clarity around their capital structure. This goes a long way toward adding some balance to the Genesis story, and we believe positions the Genesis management team to focus their time and energy on the future of their business.
Speaking of the future, we are pleased to announce the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition this morning. This is an ideal, strategic acquisition for us. It allows us to go deeper into 2 important core markets, significantly solidifying our #1 market share in Los Angeles, gaining the #1 position in San Francisco and which, by the way, adds to our already #1 market positions in New York, Boston and Seattle. 5 of the sexy 6 core markets in the United States.
The Vintage portfolio will be managed by Sunrise, Silverado and SRG, 3 of our operators with a strong position in these markets. The Vintage team has built a great business with some irreplaceable assets. We expect rebranding and connecting these assets to the broader Welltower senior care network will enhance their value and capture significant upside for our shareholders. I do hope you will review the Vintage portfolio slide presentation available on our website.
Our strategy of building scale in A quality real estate in the leading core markets in the U.S., U.K. and Canada is driving the excellent results we are reporting today. Our ability to bolt-on a large acquisition like Vintage underscores the dominance of the Welltower franchise and enhances our ability to continue to drive best-in-class operating results and growth for our shareholders.
Now Scott Brinker will give you a closer look at our operating performance."

Welltower is known for discipline around high-quality real estate and operating partners. That discipline delivered another solid quarter, with 3.3% same-store NOI growth, just above the high end of annual guidance. The operating portfolio led the way.
Same-store NOI grew 4%, rental rates were up 3.8% and occupancy increased 100 basis points, all were above expectations. To date, we're proving resilient to new supply and higher labor costs. Our diversification by operator, service type and geography is a key attribute. An example is that same-store NOI in Canada last quarter increased 7.1%, outstanding work by our partners at Chartwell and Revera. Their performance offset more modest growth in the U.K. 2 years ago, the roles were reversed, showing the benefit of diversification.
By design, more than half of our Canadian NOI comes from Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver and Ottawa, the 4 largest markets in Canada. Over the past few years, our properties in these 4 core markets have produced 5-plus percent annual NOI growth, far above any comparative benchmark. We have #1 market share in several of these markets and intend to go deeper over time.
Same-store NOI in the U.S. grew 3.5% last quarter. We continue to see wide variance by market, with clear outperformance from our core markets, those being Southern and Northern California, Seattle, Boston, New York, New Jersey and D.C., Northern Virginia. Including the Vintage acquisition, our 6 core markets will account for nearly 60% of the NOI in our U.S. operating portfolio. We've always liked the supply and demand fundamentals in these markets, and they've rewarded us with consistently higher rate growth, better margins and same-store NOI growth in the mid- to high single digits.
We very deliberately formed partnerships with the leading operators in these markets, including Sunrise, Silverado, Belmont Village, SRG, Benchmark, Epic, Mayo Gardens and Brandywine. Their operating expertise helps our real estate avoid commodity status. They make our market position even more defensible.
Including the Vintage acquisition, we'll have #1 market share in 5 of these 6 core markets and #2 share in the 6. And yet our market share is only in the mid-teens, leaving plenty of room for growth.
The U.K. operating portfolio produced 2.7% same-store NOI growth last quarter. As expected, labor costs are a headwind. To date, thanks to our premium locations, we've had enough pricing power to offset most of those costs. Half of our NOI in the U.K. comes from the RIDEA structure and the other half is triple-net, with 2% to 3% annual rent escalators. This 50-50 mix in the U.K. gives us a nice balance of upside and stability.
Outpatient medical results continue to be boring but in a good way, with another quarter of same-store growth in the mid-2% range. There's excellent visibility into this income stream, driven by low lease rollover and a high retention rate. Also, the vast majority of the leases are triple-net, which gives us reliable earnings growth because expenses are passed through to tenants.
Moving to triple-net seniors housing. Same-store NOI grew 2.8%, in line with history and our expectations. Payment coverage moved higher, and we see potential for a slow upward trend over time.
Skilled nursing and post-acute. Same-store NOI increased 3.6%. Payment coverage declined a few basis points, primarily due to certain assets being moved to held for sale, and therefore, out of the calculation. More important, our Genesis properties continue to perform well given the environment. Our master lease saw a nice improvement in 2Q versus the previous 2 quarters, as Genesis adapts to the new environment. Yesterday, Genesis made several positive announcements, including covenant relief and a term loan refinancing through Welltower and Omega on a 60/40 basis. For Welltower shareholders, this should be viewed as an important first step in a much larger process. As of yesterday, we are better positioned to reduce our Genesis concentration. We own their core assets in their core markets, so getting buyers comfortable with our real estate has never been our concern.
3 things changed yesterday: One, the hospital lender is gone; two, buyers can underwrite the corporate credit with more clarity; and three, Genesis can now focus on running their business rather than on inherited DOJ investigations, covenants and debt maturities.
We had already been seeing inbound interest in acquiring Genesis real estate from us, and we expect the interest level to have increased over the past 24 hours. We raised $227 million of capital last quarter through dispositions and loan payoffs, including $61 million of Genesis mortgage loan repayments. The largest asset sale was in Canada where senior housing cap rates are now right on top of the U.S. When we entered Canada nearly 5 years ago, the spread to the U.S. was at least 100 basis points. Since then, institutional capital has poured into the sector, driving down cap rates. We took advantage last quarter by selling a noncore triple-net portfolio in Alberta for $125 million, which is a mid-5% cap rate. The price was particularly attractive to us in light of the weak economy in that province.
We closed $356 million of new investments last quarter at a 7.2% initial cash yield, a healthy spread to our cost of capital. Our operating partners continue to be a unique source of high-quality investments at reasonable prices. And that takes us to our pending acquisition of the Vintage portfolio in California for $1.15 billion. This portfolio is middle of the fairway for us. First, 100% of the NOI is in our core markets. We're going deeper in the markets where we have an incredible footprint and a track record of success. Second, Welltower is uniquely positioned to unlock value here. We chose SRG, Sunrise and Silverado to take over management of the properties. Seniors housing is not a one-size-fits-all business, and we have the unique luxury of hand-picking among our operating partners for the task at hand. SRG is an expert at large communities. Sunrise excels at midsize properties, and Silverado is the memory care specialist, and that's exactly how we allocated the 19 properties.
The cap rate is expected to improve from about 5% in Year 1 to the mid- to high-6s at stabilization. That improvement is driven by occupancy, rate and expense assumptions that are based on our partner's deep experience in these markets. Vintage is a very unique opportunity due to its scale in high-barrier markets. It includes irreplaceable properties in San Francisco, including one, a few blocks from Knob Hill and one, a few blocks from Golden Gate Park. Also, the timing for a big core acquisition is perfect for us, given our pending dispositions.
And that's a good segue to Scott Estes."
277914,372579791,1021580,"Welltower Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Welltower Inc.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to generate another solid quarter of earnings results and operating performance out of our portfolio. I'd like to focus my comments this morning on how we're thinking about our business",1563,"All right. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to generate another solid quarter of earnings results and operating performance out of our portfolio. I'd like to focus my comments this morning on how we're thinking about our business from a financial perspective, as we enter the second half of the year.
As Tom and Scott mentioned, we will not be shy about looking for incremental disposition opportunities throughout the remainder of 2016. As a result, you should expect it to remain focused around our capital allocation theme this year, which emphasizes the following 3 components: First, we'll look to maximize our financial flexibility through enhanced liquidity, as evidenced by the recent increase in our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion; second, we intend to further strengthen our balance sheet by using incremental disposition proceeds to fund announced investments and continue to reduce leverage and strengthen our credit metrics; and third, we intend to further enhance the quality of our portfolio through targeted asset sales, which will remain focused on reducing our skilled nursing exposure and increasing our private pay mix.
So I'll again begin my detailed remarks with some perspective on our second quarter financial performance and several of the more significant changes made to our supplemental package this quarter. In terms of second quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.15 per share, up a solid 6% versus last year and normalized FAD of $1.04 per share, which increased 9% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $1.9 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. Overall, I think this is a fairly straightforward quarterly report as our net investment volume of $129 million was relatively light, a G&A of $39.9 million was in line with expectations and tax expenses only slightly less than expected.
The only somewhat unusual item was on our other income line, which included an additional $11.8 million related to the receipt of insurance proceeds and the release of an escrow, the benefit of both of which were backed out of our normalized earnings results.
Moving on to dividends. We will pay our 181st consecutive quarterly cash dividend on August 22 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.3%. I'd also like to point out 3 fairly significant enhancements we made to our supplemental package this quarter. First, you can see at the bottom of Page 5, we enhanced our CapEx disclosure to include both recurring CapEx that impacts our normalized FAD, but also the other CapEx amounts that are generally the value-enhancing larger renovation projects throughout our portfolio.
Second, on Page 8, we added detailed triple-net payment coverage data that highlights both the EBITDAR coverage and duration of the individual leases in our portfolio.
And third, on Page 29, we added disclosure related to our same-store NOI calculation methodology, which details the specific adjustments made to arrive at our same property count at the top of the page and the adjustments to arrive at the same-store NOI by property type at the bottom of the page. I think our intent here is to be as transparent as possible in showing you how we calculate our same-store results.
Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The second quarter was fairly quiet from a capital markets activity perspective. I think the highlight of the quarter occurred in May when we further enhanced our financial flexibility by increasing our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion, while extending the initial term through May of 2020. Our new line is priced at LIBOR plus 90 basis points, represents savings of 2.5 basis points from our previous line and carries a 1 year extension option and an accordion feature for additional $1 billion. This brings our total unsecured credit facility to $3.7 billion when including our U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar term loans, which were also extended for another 5 years.
In terms of equity, we raised $64 million by issuing 914,000 shares through our DRIP program this quarter, but we also generated $227 million of proceeds through dispositions and loan payoffs, which importantly, included $61 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. And last, we repaid approximately $151 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.2%, while issuing $87 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3%. So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.7 billion available at quarter end with only $745 million of line borrowings and $467 million in cash on balance sheet.
Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of the second quarter remain strong. As of June 30, our net debt to underappreciated [ph] books cap of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improved 230 basis points to 30%. Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA improved to 5.5x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remains solid at 4.2x and 3.3x, respectively. Our secured debt remains at only 11.9% of total assets at quarter end. In addition, we were pleased to receive an upgrade in our senior debt ratings from Moody's to Baa1 in June.
In light of the recent Brexit vote, I'd like to take just a moment to remind you that we have fairly little financial exposure to the recent weakness in the pound sterling, as a result of our hedging program. More specifically, as of June 30, our U.K. exposure from a balance sheet perspective is over 80% hedged, through a combination of sterling-denominated unsecured debt and other currency hedges in place, while our earnings out of the U.K. are approximately 90% hedged, year interest expense on debt, G&A, CapEx and cash flow hedges. Since the U.K. does represent only 8% of our total NOI, each 10% move in the pound against the dollar currently has an annualized earnings impact of less than $0.01 per year.
I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our acquisition guidance includes those completed during the first half of the year, the $1.15 billion Vintage portfolio and an additional $48 million of investments expected through our 3 main partnerships.
Moving to dispositions. We've increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $1.3 billion in proceeds from the previous $1 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $343 million in proceeds received during the first half of the year, $769 million of proceeds from properties currently held for sale, with the remainder representing loan pay off and other potential property sales over the rest of the year. Most of the $300 million of incremental disposition proceeds that were added to our guidance this quarter are skilled nursing assets and do include $68 million from our Genesis portfolio.
As Tom and Scott mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell additional Genesis assets above and beyond those included in our current guidance. And just to be clear, our exposure to Genesis has declined by $57 million for the 3 Genesis-related items that have been disclosed over the past 2 days, which include the $61 million in mortgage loans repaid through the quarter, the $68 million in pending dispositions, partially offset by the $72 million new term loan.
In terms of our same-store NOI growth forecast, there's no change to our blended full year estimate of 2.75% to 3.25%. So I would say that we're tracking toward the higher end of the range at this point, driven largely by the strength of our seniors housing operating portfolio. Our FAD CapEx forecast is currently $82 million for 2016 comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $27 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. We do expect CapEx spending to ramp up a bit during the latter half of the year due to the timing of projected expenditures.
Our G&A forecast continues to track towards the low end of our initial guidance at approximately $160 million for the full year at this point. Our tax line item is projected to return to an expense of about $3 million to $4 million per quarter during each of the last 2 quarters of this year based on slightly higher taxable income forecast. And as a result of all of these assumptions, we're maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represents 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
I think our decision to maintain guidance was largely based on the fact that the incremental dispositions added to our guidance this quarter should be roughly offset by the Vintage portfolio acquisition and continued solid operating portfolio performance through the second quarter.
So in conclusion, we remain focused on our capital allocation efforts this year that will continue to prioritize, maximizing financial flexibility through increased liquidity, strengthening our balance sheet by lowering leverage and enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix.
So that concludes my remarks. And I think at this point in time, I'll turn it to you for some closing comments."

The held-for-sale bucket includes $68 million of Genesis properties that are already under contract and that should close in the next 60 days or so. Those are unique in that Genesis is actually exiting the operations as well. So we're selling the real estate, they are exiting operations, and I say that's unusual or unique because, for the most part, we own core Genesis assets that they want to stay in as the operator. So we would be selling our real estate, and Genesis would remain as the operating partner. So I think that's a less complex transaction in trying to sell the real estate and the operations together. And in terms of interest level, it's strong and it's from a number of different sources, private equity for sure, overseas capital for sure and we're actually starting to see the private and public REITs show interest again, which have not been the case in the past 3 to 6 months, as the stock prices have come back and the capital raising has improved. So there's actually a pretty deep buyer pool, and the lenders continue to be interested in the space as well, provided the payment coverage is reasonable."

It's more that we're going to pretty dramatically change the service profile of the communities. I think the service level, the price point is going to change pretty dramatically, and we've chosen 3 operating partners to do that with, who have extremely deep experience in these markets. So we've underwritten occupancy rate and expense assumptions that are very much based on their historical experience in these markets. And any time you do an operator transition, you have to assume that there's going to be a decline in year 1, especially if you're increasing the service mix. It's just the way it works is the expenses go up first and it takes time to be able to increase occupancy and rate to match the service level that you implement day 1, and no doubt, you have staffing changes as well as turnover within the rest of the population. So the Year 1 is always a bit depressed."

So you're not going to see us do things like this very often, on occasion to accomplish a longer-term, bigger goal, we'll extend the loan. And we have a good history of having those loans repaid. And in this situation, we can't speak for Omega but for Welltower, we told George and his team to go out and talk to the marketplace, see what a third party was willing to lend at, and we would be waiting to match it and that's what we did. Because this is an important security in the Genesis capital structure, and we prefer to control it rather than have a hospital third-party be in that position holding the cards even though they have 1% or less of the capital at risk. So the situation existed a week ago to us was untenable and was not allowing us to accomplish important goals. It was distracting Genesis, but we did not do a below-market loan, we didn't do an above-market loan. This is a market rate. Clearly, they are not a AAA credit. So we are being paid for the risks that we're taking."

And to us, that was a structure that made sense for the landlord and the tenant. And as the businesses become more competitive, the coverage ratios have declined and declined. And 1.1 today is sort of the market. And for years, operators are willing to enter into leases of those coverages. Frankly, we were not doing many, if any, acquisitions at those coverages. We have been saying for years now that to us, the distinction of risk in focusing on triple-net versus RIDEA was really not the way we think about risk, and we would always prefer to own a Class A asset in a Class A market and deal with the quarter-to-quarter variation in results. And that's exactly why you're seeing us concentrate our investments where you have. For the past 6 years, we've done very few triple-net investments. When we do, it tends to be a new development where there's an opportunity and enough profit in the development for there to be strong payment coverage or a turnaround opportunity, which is -- we don't like the thought of doing big acquisitions at near 1.0 coverage. It looks great on the press release because you've got great structural protection or so-called structural protection, but we've seen already that those don't always work out as planned. And if a deal doesn't work for both parties, it eventually doesn't work for either party. And I think you've seen that.

And then a yield in a world with yields that are pushing 0% in most developed economies, you can still buy skilled nursing in the high single digits unlevered and get attractive financing, and it generates an awfully attractive return on equity immediately. And the payment coverage is -- unlike seniors housing where they're awfully low with 1.3x coverage, it's a pretty stable yield, particularly if you own good real estate with the good operators. So look, it actually still is a good investment. It's just not for us."

I would even remind everybody, I think it's important to everyone. So focus on Genesis that we actually are, and even today, just announcing incremental progress on disposing of skilled nursing assets. So within our $1.3 billion of projected the disposition proceeds, about 60% of it or so of that is skilled nursing, and pro forma for what we've announced through today were already at 90% private pay. So Genesis is just a little bit a part of those numbers currently, but we're actually seeing those reasonable prices. We have $760-some million of potential proceeds from assets held for sale, and that low 9% is kind of cap rate. And that's kind of, I think, a good example of how we're continuing to improve the quality of the portfolio."

I think we've seen a very different view of the impact of Brexit over the last couple of weeks. The thing you have to understand is 99% of the population in our buildings are U.K. residents. So they are not leaving the U.K. because of Brexit. The U.K. is not going to be building new assisted living assets for its population. More and more, the U.K. residents will have to turn to a private pay alternative to local authority-funded eldercare. And the bulk of our assets are in the one in metropolitan area, which -- I don't think you bet against London long term. I think London has had a 30-year head start on building an irreplaceable infrastructure and economic machine that will prevail regardless of what happens here. So I don't think we're losing sleep over it. I think there are some challenges. You've heard us talk about on the wage side in the U.K., but we continue to manage through that again for the same reasons why we're managing through that in the U.S. I said we have the best located real estate with the best operators, and people want to live in this portfolio.

I would say that we are laser-focused on building scale in the top markets in the country. Scott mentioned that the sixth of the sexy 6 is D.C., where we're #2. But expect that we are very focused on building scale in D.C. And a number of our operators have development properties being constructed in the Greater D.C. market. That's an important market for us. But you've heard us say this before, we are looking to go deep in the top core markets in the 3 countries in which we operate and get as close to the center of the core as possible, which is not typically where you found senior housing assets. So that speaks to what we're doing in New York City, which we talked about on our last call. And it speaks to some of the things we're doing in markets like Toronto, very much in the center of the urban market there. You will see assets we are -- either own today or developing in Los Angeles. So it's very much our strategy. Expect you're going to continue to see us to follow that strategy.

Our strong results this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments.From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6%,  and funds available for distribution was up 9%. The Sc",546,"Thanks, Jeff. Our strong results this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments.
From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6%,  and funds available for distribution was up 9%. The Scotts will take you through a deeper dive on what is driving our performance, but first let me give you the high points.
Overall same-store NOI for all of Welltower was up 3.3% versus last year. This is largely being driven by the performance of our seniors housing business. The senior housing operating portfolio registered 4% same-store NOI growth versus a year earlier. Despite the industry concerns about new supply and wage expense growth, the Welltower family of operators were able to pass along, on average, 4% rate increases, while increasing occupancy by 100 basis points. These results can only be realized from owning A quality real estate in A quality markets. That is the Welltower story.
A key differentiator for Welltower is that 90% of our revenue is from private pay sources. You should expect to see our private pay percentage increase through this year. However, we also have a strong history of managing the credit exposure to government reimbursement for our shareholders. So regarding our Genesis assets, we believe Genesis is continuing to strengthen its business platform and financial position. I can only speak to our Genesis portfolio, and I can tell you that the operating performance of our portfolio improved during the quarter.
We are pleased to see a strong final Medicare rate increase, the DOJ settlement that was announced by Genesis yesterday and both Welltower and Genesis shareholders should be pleased to have some clarity around their capital structure. This goes a long way toward adding some ballast to the Genesis story, and we believe positions the Genesis management team to focus their time and energy on the future of their business.
Speaking of the future, we are pleased to announce the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition this morning. This is an ideal, strategic acquisition for us. It allows us to go deeper into 2 important core markets, significantly solidifying our #1 market share in Los Angeles, gaining the #1 position in San Francisco and which, by the way, adds to our already #1 market positions in New York, Boston and Seattle, 5 of the sexy 6 core markets in the United States.
The Vintage portfolio will be managed by Sunrise, Silverado and SRG, 3 of our operators with a strong position in these markets. The Vintage team has built a great business with some irreplaceable assets. We expect rebranding and connecting these assets to the broader Welltower senior care network will enhance their value and capture significant upside for our shareholders. I do hope you will review the Vintage portfolio slide presentation available on our website.
Our strategy of building scale in A quality real estate in the leading core markets in the U.S., U.K. and Canada is driving the excellent results we are reporting today. Our ability to bolt on a large acquisition like Vintage underscores the dominance of the Welltower franchise and enhances our ability to continue to drive best-in-class operating results and growth for our shareholders.
Now Scott Brinker will give you a closer look at our operating performance."

Welltower is known for discipline around high-quality real estate and operating partners. That discipline delivered another solid quarter, with 3.3% same-store NOI growth, just above the high end of annual guidance. The operating por",1115,"Okay. Thank you, Tom. Welltower is known for discipline around high-quality real estate and operating partners. That discipline delivered another solid quarter, with 3.3% same-store NOI growth, just above the high end of annual guidance. The operating portfolio led the way.
Same-store NOI grew 4%, rental rates were up 3.8% and occupancy increased 100 basis points. All were above expectations. To date, we're proving resilient to new supply and higher labor costs. Our diversification by operator, service type and geography is a key attribute. An example is that same-store NOI in Canada last quarter increased 7.1%; outstanding work by our partners at Chartwell and Revera. Their performance offset more modest growth in the U.K. 2 years ago, the roles were reversed, showing the benefit of diversification.
By design, more than half of our Canadian NOI comes from Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver and Ottawa, the 4 largest markets in Canada. Over the past few years, our properties in these 4 core markets have produced 5-plus percent annual NOI growth, far above any comparative benchmark. We have #1 market share in several of these markets and intend to go deeper over time.
Same-store NOI in the U.S. grew 3.5% last quarter. We continue to see wide variance by market, with clear outperformance from our core markets, those being Southern and Northern California, Seattle, Boston, New York/New Jersey and D.C., Northern Virginia. Including the Vintage acquisition, our 6 core markets will account for nearly 60% of the NOI in our U.S. operating portfolio. We've always liked the supply and demand fundamentals in these markets, and they've rewarded us with consistently higher rate growth, better margins and same-store NOI growth in the mid- to high single digits.
We very deliberately formed partnerships with the leading operators in these markets, including Sunrise, Silverado, Belmont Village, SRG, Benchmark, Epic, Merrill Gardens and Brandywine. Their operating expertise helps our real estate avoid commodity status. They make our market position even more defensible.
Including the Vintage acquisition, we'll have #1 market share in 5 of these 6 core markets and #2 share in the sixth. And yet our market share is only in the mid-teens, leaving plenty of room for growth.
The U.K. operating portfolio produced 2.7% same-store NOI growth last quarter. As expected, labor costs are a headwind. To date, thanks to our premium locations, we've had enough pricing power to offset most of those costs. Half of our NOI in the U.K. comes from the RIDEA structure and the other half is triple-net, with 2% to 3% annual rent escalators. This 50-50 mix in the U.K. gives us a nice balance of upside and stability.
Outpatient medical results continue to be boring but in a good way, with another quarter of same-store growth in the mid-2% range. There's excellent visibility into this income stream, driven by low lease rollover and a high retention rate. Also, the vast majority of the leases are triple-net, which gives us reliable earnings growth because expenses are passed through to the tenants.
Moving to triple-net seniors housing. Same-store NOI grew 2.8%, in line with history and our expectations. Payment coverage moved higher, and we see potential for a slow upward trend over time.
Skilled nursing and post-acute. Same-store NOI increased 3.6%. Payment coverage declined a few basis points, primarily due to certain assets being moved to held for sale and therefore out of the calculation. More important, our Genesis properties continue to perform well given the environment. Our master lease saw a nice improvement in 2Q versus the previous 2 quarters, as Genesis adapts to the new environment. 
Yesterday Genesis made several positive announcements, including covenant relief and a term loan refinancing through Welltower and Omega on a 60/40 basis. For Welltower shareholders, this should be viewed as an important first step in a much larger process. As of yesterday, we are better positioned to reduce our Genesis concentration. We own their core assets in their core markets, so getting buyers comfortable with our real estate has never been our concern.
3 things changed yesterday: One, the hostile lender is gone; two, buyers can underwrite the corporate credit with more clarity; and three, Genesis can now focus on running their business rather than on inherited DOJ investigations, covenants and debt maturities.
We had already been seeing inbound interest in acquiring Genesis real estate from us, and we expect the interest level to have increased over the past 24 hours. We raised $227 million of capital last quarter through dispositions and loan payoffs, including $61 million of Genesis mortgage loan repayments. The largest asset sale was in Canada, where senior housing cap rates are now right on top of the U.S. When we entered Canada nearly 5 years ago, the spread to the U.S. was at least 100 basis points. Since then, institutional capital has poured into the sector, driving down cap rates. We took advantage last quarter by selling a noncore triple-net portfolio in Alberta for $125 million, which is a mid-5% cap rate. The price was particularly attractive to us in light of the weak economy in that province.
We closed $356 million of new investments last quarter at a 7.2% initial cash yield, a healthy spread to our cost of capital. Our operating partners continue to be a unique source of high-quality investments at reasonable prices. And that takes us to our pending acquisition of the Vintage portfolio in California for $1.15 billion. This portfolio is middle of the fairway for us. First, 100% of the NOI is in our core markets. We're going deeper into markets where we have an incredible footprint and a track record of success. 
Second, Welltower is uniquely positioned to unlock value here. We chose SRG, Sunrise and Silverado to take over management of the properties. Seniors housing is not a one-size-fits-all business, and we have the unique luxury of hand-picking among our operating partners for the task at hand. SRG is an expert at large communities. Sunrise excels at midsize properties, and Silverado is the memory care specialist, and that's exactly how we allocated the 19 properties.
The cap rate is expected to improve from about 5% in year 1 to the mid- to high-6s at stabilization. That improvement is driven by occupancy, rate and expense assumptions that are based on our partners' deep experience in these markets. Vintage is a very unique opportunity due to its scale in high-barrier markets. It includes irreplaceable properties in San Francisco, including one a few blocks from Nob Hill and one a few blocks from Golden Gate Park. Also, the timing for a big core acquisition is perfect for us given our pending dispositions.
And that's a good segue to Scott Estes."

We were pleased to generate another solid quarter of earnings results and operating performance out of our portfolio. I'd like to focus my comments this morning on how we're thinking about our business from a financial perspective as we enter the second half of the year.
As Tom and Scott mentioned, we will not be shy about looking for incremental disposition opportunities throughout the remainder of 2016. As a result, you should expect us to remain focused around our capital allocation theme this year, which emphasizes the following 3 components: First, we'll look to maximize our financial flexibility through enhanced liquidity, as evidenced by the recent increase in our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion; second, we intend to further strengthen our balance sheet by using incremental disposition proceeds to fund announced investments and continue to reduce leverage and strengthen our credit metrics; and third, we intend to further enhance the quality of our portfolio through targeted asset sales, which will remain focused on reducing our skilled nursing exposure and increasing our private pay mix.
So I'll again begin my detailed remarks with some perspective on our second quarter financial performance and several of the more significant changes made to our supplemental package this quarter. In terms of second quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.15 per share, up a solid 6% versus last year; and normalized FAD of $1.04 per share, which increased 9% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $1.9 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. 
Overall, I think this is a fairly straightforward quarterly report as our net investment volume of $129 million was relatively light, a G&A of $39.9 million was in line with expectations and tax expenses only slightly less than expected.
The only somewhat unusual item was on our Other Income line, which included an additional $11.8 million related to the receipt of insurance proceeds and the release of an escrow, the benefit of both of which were backed out of our normalized earnings results.
Moving on to dividends. We will pay our 181st consecutive quarterly cash dividend on August 22 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.3%. 
I'd also like to point out 3 fairly significant enhancements we made to our supplemental package this quarter. First, you can see at the bottom of Page 5, we enhanced our CapEx disclosure to include both recurring CapEx that impacts our normalized FAD, but also the other CapEx amounts that are generally the value-enhancing larger renovation projects throughout our portfolio.
Second, on Page 8 we added detailed triple-net payment coverage data that highlights both the EBITDAR coverage and duration of the individual leases in our portfolio.
And third, on Page 29, we added disclosure related to our same-store NOI calculation methodology which details the specific adjustments made to arrive at our same property count at the top of the page and the adjustments to arrive at the same-store NOI by property type at the bottom of the page. I think our intent here is to be as transparent as possible in showing you how we calculate our same-store results.
Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The second quarter was fairly quiet from a capital markets activity perspective. I think the highlight of the quarter occurred in May when we further enhanced our financial flexibility by increasing our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion, while extending the initial term through May of 2020. Our new line is priced at LIBOR plus 90 basis points, represents savings of 2.5 basis points from our previous line and carries a 1-year extension option and an accordion feature for an additional $1 billion. This brings our total unsecured credit facility to $3.7 billion when including our U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar term loans, which were also extended for another 5 years.
In terms of equity, we raised $64 million by issuing 914,000 shares through our DRIP program this quarter, but we also generated $227 million of proceeds through dispositions and loan payoffs, which, importantly, included $61 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. And last, we repaid approximately $151 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.2%, while issuing $87 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3%. So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.7 billion available at quarter-end with only $745 million of line borrowings and $467 million in cash on balance sheet.
Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of the second quarter remain strong. As of June 30, our net debt to undepreciated book's cap of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improved 230 basis points to 30%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.5x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remains solid at 4.2x and 3.3x, respectively. Our secured debt remains at only 11.9% of total assets at quarter-end. In addition, we were pleased to receive an upgrade in our senior debt ratings from Moody's to Baa1 in June.
In light of the recent Brexit vote, I'd like to take just a moment to remind you that we have fairly little financial exposure to the recent weakness in the pound sterling as a result of our hedging program. More specifically, as of June 30, our U.K. exposure from a balance sheet perspective is over 80% hedged, through a combination of sterling-denominated unsecured debt and other currency hedges in place, while our earnings out of the U.K. are approximately 90% hedged through interest expense on debt, G&A, CapEx and cash flow hedges. Since the U.K. does represent only 8% of our total NOI, each 10% move in the pound against the dollar currently has an annualized earnings impact of less than $0.01 per year.
I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our acquisition guidance includes those completed during the first half of the year, the $1.15 billion Vintage portfolio and an additional $48 million of investments expected through our Mainstreet partnerships.
Moving to dispositions. We've increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $1.3 billion in proceeds from the previous $1 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $343 million in proceeds received during the first half of the year, $769 million of proceeds from properties currently held for sale, with the remainder representing loan pay-off and other potential property sales over the rest of the year. Most of the $300 million of incremental disposition proceeds that were added to our guidance this quarter are skilled nursing assets and do include $68 million from our Genesis portfolio.
As Tom and Scott mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell additional Genesis assets above and beyond those included in our current guidance. And just to be clear, our exposure to Genesis has declined by $57 million for the 3 Genesis-related items that have been disclosed over the past 2 days, which include the $61 million in mortgage loans repaid during the quarter, the $68 million in pending dispositions, partially offset by the $72 million new term loan.
In terms of our same-store NOI growth forecast, there's no change to our blended full-year estimate of 2.75% to 3.25%. So I would say that we're tracking toward the higher end of the range at this point, driven largely by the strength of our seniors housing operating portfolio. Our FAD CapEx forecast is currently $82 million for 2016, comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $27 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. We do expect CapEx spending to ramp up a bit during the latter half of the year due to the timing of projected expenditures.
Our G&A forecast continues to track towards the low end of our initial guidance at approximately $160 million for the full year at this point. Our tax line item is projected to return to an expense of about $3 million to $4 million per quarter during each of the last 2 quarters of this year based on slightly higher taxable income forecast. And as a result of all of these assumptions, we're maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represent 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
I think our decision to maintain guidance was largely based on the fact that the incremental dispositions added to our guidance this quarter should be roughly offset by the Vintage portfolio acquisition and continued solid operating portfolio performance through the second quarter.
So in conclusion, we remain focused on our capital allocation efforts this year that we'll continue to prioritize, maximizing financial flexibility through increased liquidity, strengthening our balance sheet by lowering leverage and enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix.
So that concludes my remarks. And I think at this point in time I'll turn it to you for some closing comments."

The held-for-sale bucket includes $68 million of Genesis properties that are already under contract and that should close in the next 60 days or so. Those are unique in that Genesis is actually exiting the operations as well. So we're selling the real estate; they're exiting operations. And I say that's unusual or unique because, for the most part, we own core Genesis assets that they want to stay in as the operator. So we would be selling our real estate, and Genesis would remain as the operating partner. So I think it's a less complex transaction than trying to sell the real estate and the operations together. 
And in terms of interest level, it's strong, and it's from a number of different sources; private equity for sure, overseas capital for sure; and we're actually starting to see the private and public REITs show interest again, which have not been the case in the past 3 to 6 months, as the stock prices have come back and the capital raising has improved. So there's actually a pretty deep buyer pool, and the lenders continue to be interested in this space as well, provided the payment coverage is reasonable."

It's more that we're going to pretty dramatically change the service profile at the communities. I think the service level, the price point is going to change pretty dramatically, and we've chosen 3 operating partners to do that with who have extremely deep experience in these markets. So we've underwritten occupancy rate and expense assumptions that are very much based on their historical experience in these markets. 
And any time you do an operator transition, you have to assume that there's going to be a decline in year 1, especially if you're increasing the service mix. It's just the way it works, is the expenses go up first, and it takes time to be able to increase occupancy and rate to match the service level that you implement day 1. And no doubt you have staffing changes as well as turnover within the resident the population. So the Year 1 is always a bit depressed."

I mean, you said that one of the motivations here to do the term loan -- to become the term lender is to remove other lender parties from the discussion table, make it easier when trying to sell a chunk of the Genesis real estate in deals where Genesis would stay as a tenant. So I get some of that motivation, but I guess the skeptic would say it looks like no other lenders were willing to step in on a new term loan besides you and Omega. And then looking at the LIBOR plus 13% rate, doesn't that signal a very weak credit profile and that you were forced into becoming a lender of last resort here?"

So 98% plus or minus of what we do is high-quality real estate. So you're not going to see us do things like this very often. On occasion, to accomplish a longer-term, bigger goal, we'll extend a loan. And we have a good history of having those loans repaid. 
And in this situation, we can't speak for Omega, but for Welltower, we told George and his team to go out and talk to the marketplace, see what a third party was willing to lend at, and we would be willing to match it. And that's what we did, because this is an important security in the Genesis capital structure, and we'd prefer to control it rather than have a hospital third-party be in that position holding the cards, even though they have 1% or less of the capital at risk. 
So the situation that existed a week ago to us was untenable and was not allowing us to accomplish important goals. It was distracting Genesis. But we did not do a below-market loan; we didn't do an above-market loan. This is a market rate. Clearly they are not a AAA credit, so we're being paid for the risk that we're taking."

And to us, that was a structure that made sense for the landlord and the tenant. And as the businesses become more competitive, the coverage ratios have declined and declined. And 1.1 today is sort of the market. And for years, operators weren't willing to enter into leases at those coverages. Frankly, we were not doing many, if any, acquisitions at those coverages. 
We have been saying for years now that, to us, the distinction of risk in focusing on triple-net versus RIDEA was really not the way we think about risk, and we would always prefer to own a Class A asset in a Class A market and deal with the quarter-to-quarter variation in results. And that's exactly why you've seen us concentrate our investments where you have for the past 6 years. We've done very few triple-net investments. When we do, it tends to be a new development where there's an opportunity and enough profit in the development for there to be strong payment coverage or a turnaround opportunity. 
We're just -- we don't like the thought of doing big acquisitions at near 1.0 coverage. It looks great on a press release because you've got great structural protection, or so-called structural protection, but we've seen already that those don't always work out as planned. And if a deal doesn't work for both parties, it eventually doesn't work for either party. And I think you've seen that.

It's just, as we think about the direction of our company, it's probably best not in Welltower's portfolio. So the fact is the population that uses those properties is going to double in size over 20 years and the supply of properties is declining. So when you think about the longer term rather than the next 3 quarters or 3 months, I think the supply/demand dynamics are still quite favorable for that business despite the headwinds that exist. 
And in a yield -- in a world with yields that are pushing 0% in most developed economies, you can still buy skilled nursing in the high single digits unlevered and get attractive financing, and it generates an awfully attractive return on equity immediately. And the payment coverage is, unlike seniors housing, where they're awfully low with 1.3x coverage, it's a pretty stable yield, particularly if you own good real estate with a good operator. So look, it actually still is a good investment. It's just not for us."

So Genesis is just a little bit a part of those numbers currently, but we're actually seeing those reasonable prices.

More and more the U.K. residents will have to turn to a private pay alternative to local authority-funded eldercare.

What today is a good market may not be a great market in the future. So expect that we are always looking for opportunities to recycle capital and constantly improve the quality of the portfolio. 
I would say that we are laser-focused on building scale in the top markets in the country. Scott mentioned that the sixth of the sexy 6 is D.C., where we're #2. But expect that we are very focused on building scale in D.C. And a number of our operators have development properties being constructed in the Greater D.C. market. That's an important market for us. 
But you've heard us say this before. We are looking to go deep in the top core markets in the 3 countries in which we operate and get as close to the center of the core as possible, which is not typically where you found senior housing assets. So that speaks to what we're doing in New York City, which we talked about on our last call. And it speaks to some of the things we're doing in markets like Toronto, very much in the center of the urban market there. You will see assets we are -- either own today or developing in Los Angeles. So it's very much our strategy. Expect you're going to continue to see us to follow that strategy.

Our strong results this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments.From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6%, and funds available for distribution was up 9%. The Sco",546,"Thanks, Jeff. Our strong results this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments.
From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6%, and funds available for distribution was up 9%. The Scotts will take you through a deeper dive on what is driving our performance, but first let me give you the high points.
Overall same-store NOI for all of Welltower was up 3.3% versus last year. This is largely being driven by the performance of our seniors housing business. The senior housing operating portfolio registered 4% same-store NOI growth versus a year earlier. Despite the industry concerns about new supply and wage expense growth, the Welltower family of operators were able to pass along, on average, 4% rate increases, while increasing occupancy by 100 basis points. These results can only be realized from owning A quality real estate in A quality markets. That is the Welltower story.
A key differentiator for Welltower is that 90% of our revenue is from private pay sources. You should expect to see our private pay percentage increase through this year. However, we also have a strong history of managing the credit exposure to government reimbursement for our shareholders. So regarding our Genesis assets, we believe Genesis is continuing to strengthen its business platform and financial position. I can only speak to our Genesis portfolio, and I can tell you that the operating performance of our portfolio improved during the quarter.
We are pleased to see a strong final Medicare rate increase, the DOJ settlement that was announced by Genesis yesterday and both Welltower and Genesis shareholders should be pleased to have some clarity around their capital structure. This goes a long way toward adding some ballast to the Genesis story, and we believe positions the Genesis management team to focus their time and energy on the future of their business.
Speaking of the future, we are pleased to announce the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition this morning. This is an ideal, strategic acquisition for us. It allows us to go deeper into 2 important core markets, significantly solidifying our #1 market share in Los Angeles, gaining the #1 position in San Francisco and which, by the way, adds to our already #1 market positions in New York, Boston and Seattle, 5 of the sexy 6 core markets in the United States.
The Vintage portfolio will be managed by Sunrise, Silverado and SRG, 3 of our operators with a strong position in these markets. The Vintage team has built a great business with some irreplaceable assets. We expect rebranding and connecting these assets to the broader Welltower senior care network will enhance their value and capture significant upside for our shareholders. I do hope you will review the Vintage portfolio slide presentation available on our website.
Our strategy of building scale in A quality real estate in the leading core markets in the U.S., U.K. and Canada is driving the excellent results we are reporting today. Our ability to bolt on a large acquisition like Vintage underscores the dominance of the Welltower franchise and enhances our ability to continue to drive best-in-class operating results and growth for our shareholders.
Now Scott Brinker will give you a closer look at our operating performance."

Welltower is known for discipline around high-quality real estate and operating partners. That discipline delivered another solid quarter, with 3.3% same-store NOI growth, just above the high end of annual guidance. The operating por",1115,"Okay. Thank you, Tom. Welltower is known for discipline around high-quality real estate and operating partners. That discipline delivered another solid quarter, with 3.3% same-store NOI growth, just above the high end of annual guidance. The operating portfolio led the way.
Same-store NOI grew 4%, rental rates were up 3.8% and occupancy increased 100 basis points. All were above expectations. To date, we're proving resilient to new supply and higher labor costs. Our diversification by operator, service type and geography is a key attribute. An example is that same-store NOI in Canada last quarter increased 7.1%; outstanding work by our partners at Chartwell and Revera. Their performance offset more modest growth in the U.K. 2 years ago, the roles were reversed, showing the benefit of diversification.
By design, more than half of our Canadian NOI comes from Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver and Ottawa, the 4 largest markets in Canada. Over the past few years, our properties in these 4 core markets have produced 5-plus percent annual NOI growth, far above any comparative benchmark. We have #1 market share in several of these markets and intend to go deeper over time.
Same-store NOI in the U.S. grew 3.5% last quarter. We continue to see wide variance by market, with clear outperformance from our core markets, those being Southern and Northern California, Seattle, Boston, New York/New Jersey and D.C., Northern Virginia. Including the Vintage acquisition, our 6 core markets will account for nearly 60% of the NOI in our U.S. operating portfolio. We've always liked the supply and demand fundamentals in these markets, and they've rewarded us with consistently higher rate growth, better margins and same-store NOI growth in the mid- to high single digits.
We very deliberately formed partnerships with the leading operators in these markets, including Sunrise, Silverado, Belmont Village, SRG, Benchmark, Epic, Merrill Gardens and Brandywine. Their operating expertise helps our real estate avoid commodity status. They make our market position even more defensible.
Including the Vintage acquisition, we'll have #1 market share in 5 of these 6 core markets and #2 share in the sixth. And yet our market share is only in the mid-teens, leaving plenty of room for growth.
The U.K. operating portfolio produced 2.7% same-store NOI growth last quarter. As expected, labor costs are a headwind. To date, thanks to our premium locations, we've had enough pricing power to offset most of those costs. Half of our NOI in the U.K. comes from the RIDEA structure and the other half is triple-net, with 2% to 3% annual rent escalators. This 50-50 mix in the U.K. gives us a nice balance of upside and stability.
Outpatient medical results continue to be boring but in a good way, with another quarter of same-store growth in the mid-2% range. There's excellent visibility into this income stream, driven by low lease rollover and a high retention rate. Also, the vast majority of the leases are triple-net, which gives us reliable earnings growth because expenses are passed through to the tenants.
Moving to triple-net seniors housing. Same-store NOI grew 2.8%, in line with history and our expectations. Payment coverage moved higher, and we see potential for a slow upward trend over time.
Skilled nursing and post-acute. Same-store NOI increased 3.6%. Payment coverage declined a few basis points, primarily due to certain assets being moved to held for sale and therefore out of the calculation. More important, our Genesis properties continue to perform well given the environment. Our master lease saw a nice improvement in 2Q versus the previous 2 quarters, as Genesis adapts to the new environment. 
Yesterday Genesis made several positive announcements, including covenant relief and a term loan refinancing through Welltower and Omega on a 60/40 basis. For Welltower shareholders, this should be viewed as an important first step in a much larger process. As of yesterday, we are better positioned to reduce our Genesis concentration. We own their core assets in their core markets, so getting buyers comfortable with our real estate has never been our concern.
3 things changed yesterday: One, the hostile lender is gone; two, buyers can underwrite the corporate credit with more clarity; and three, Genesis can now focus on running their business rather than on inherited DOJ investigations, covenants and debt maturities.
We had already been seeing inbound interest in acquiring Genesis real estate from us, and we expect the interest level to have increased over the past 24 hours. We raised $227 million of capital last quarter through dispositions and loan payoffs, including $61 million of Genesis mortgage loan repayments. The largest asset sale was in Canada, where senior housing cap rates are now right on top of the U.S. When we entered Canada nearly 5 years ago, the spread to the U.S. was at least 100 basis points. Since then, institutional capital has poured into the sector, driving down cap rates. We took advantage last quarter by selling a noncore triple-net portfolio in Alberta for $125 million, which is a mid-5% cap rate. The price was particularly attractive to us in light of the weak economy in that province.
We closed $356 million of new investments last quarter at a 7.2% initial cash yield, a healthy spread to our cost of capital. Our operating partners continue to be a unique source of high-quality investments at reasonable prices. And that takes us to our pending acquisition of the Vintage portfolio in California for $1.15 billion. This portfolio is middle of the fairway for us. First, 100% of the NOI is in our core markets. We're going deeper into markets where we have an incredible footprint and a track record of success. 
Second, Welltower is uniquely positioned to unlock value here. We chose SRG, Sunrise and Silverado to take over management of the properties. Seniors housing is not a one-size-fits-all business, and we have the unique luxury of hand-picking among our operating partners for the task at hand. SRG is an expert at large communities. Sunrise excels at midsize properties, and Silverado is the memory care specialist, and that's exactly how we allocated the 19 properties.
The cap rate is expected to improve from about 5% in year 1 to the mid- to high-6s at stabilization. That improvement is driven by occupancy, rate and expense assumptions that are based on our partners' deep experience in these markets. Vintage is a very unique opportunity due to its scale in high-barrier markets. It includes irreplaceable properties in San Francisco, including one a few blocks from Nob Hill and one a few blocks from Golden Gate Park. Also, the timing for a big core acquisition is perfect for us given our pending dispositions.
And that's a good segue to Scott Estes."
277914,372579791,1022446,"Welltower Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Welltower Inc.","Executives","All right. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to generate another solid quarter of earnings results and operating performance out of our portfolio. I'd like to focus my comments this morning on how we're thinking about our business",1560,"All right. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to generate another solid quarter of earnings results and operating performance out of our portfolio. I'd like to focus my comments this morning on how we're thinking about our business from a financial perspective as we enter the second half of the year.
As Tom and Scott mentioned, we will not be shy about looking for incremental disposition opportunities throughout the remainder of 2016. As a result, you should expect us to remain focused around our capital allocation theme this year, which emphasizes the following 3 components: First, we'll look to maximize our financial flexibility through enhanced liquidity, as evidenced by the recent increase in our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion; second, we intend to further strengthen our balance sheet by using incremental disposition proceeds to fund announced investments and continue to reduce leverage and strengthen our credit metrics; and third, we intend to further enhance the quality of our portfolio through targeted asset sales, which will remain focused on reducing our skilled nursing exposure and increasing our private pay mix.
So I'll again begin my detailed remarks with some perspective on our second quarter financial performance and several of the more significant changes made to our supplemental package this quarter. In terms of second quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.15 per share, up a solid 6% versus last year; and normalized FAD of $1.04 per share, which increased 9% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $1.9 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. 
Overall, I think this is a fairly straightforward quarterly report as our net investment volume of $129 million was relatively light, a G&A of $39.9 million was in line with expectations and tax expenses only slightly less than expected.
The only somewhat unusual item was on our Other Income line, which included an additional $11.8 million related to the receipt of insurance proceeds and the release of an escrow, the benefit of both of which were backed out of our normalized earnings results.
Moving on to dividends. We will pay our 181st consecutive quarterly cash dividend on August 22 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.3%. 
I'd also like to point out 3 fairly significant enhancements we made to our supplemental package this quarter. First, you can see at the bottom of Page 5, we enhanced our CapEx disclosure to include both recurring CapEx that impacts our normalized FAD, but also the other CapEx amounts that are generally the value-enhancing larger renovation projects throughout our portfolio.
Second, on Page 8 we added detailed triple-net payment coverage data that highlights both the EBITDAR coverage and duration of the individual leases in our portfolio.
And third, on Page 29, we added disclosure related to our same-store NOI calculation methodology which details the specific adjustments made to arrive at our same property count at the top of the page and the adjustments to arrive at the same-store NOI by property type at the bottom of the page. I think our intent here is to be as transparent as possible in showing you how we calculate our same-store results.
Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The second quarter was fairly quiet from a capital markets activity perspective. I think the highlight of the quarter occurred in May when we further enhanced our financial flexibility by increasing our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion, while extending the initial term through May of 2020. Our new line is priced at LIBOR plus 90 basis points, represents savings of 2.5 basis points from our previous line and carries a 1-year extension option and an accordion feature for an additional $1 billion. This brings our total unsecured credit facility to $3.7 billion when including our U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar term loans, which were also extended for another 5 years.
In terms of equity, we raised $64 million by issuing 914,000 shares through our DRIP program this quarter, but we also generated $227 million of proceeds through dispositions and loan payoffs, which, importantly, included $61 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. And last, we repaid approximately $151 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.2%, while issuing $87 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3%. So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.7 billion available at quarter-end with only $745 million of line borrowings and $467 million in cash on balance sheet.
Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of the second quarter remain strong. As of June 30, our net debt to undepreciated book's cap of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improved 230 basis points to 30%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.5x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remains solid at 4.2x and 3.3x, respectively. Our secured debt remains at only 11.9% of total assets at quarter-end. In addition, we were pleased to receive an upgrade in our senior debt ratings from Moody's to Baa1 in June.
In light of the recent Brexit vote, I'd like to take just a moment to remind you that we have fairly little financial exposure to the recent weakness in the pound sterling as a result of our hedging program. More specifically, as of June 30, our U.K. exposure from a balance sheet perspective is over 80% hedged, through a combination of sterling-denominated unsecured debt and other currency hedges in place, while our earnings out of the U.K. are approximately 90% hedged through interest expense on debt, G&A, CapEx and cash flow hedges. Since the U.K. does represent only 8% of our total NOI, each 10% move in the pound against the dollar currently has an annualized earnings impact of less than $0.01 per year.
I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our acquisition guidance includes those completed during the first half of the year, the $1.15 billion Vintage portfolio and an additional $48 million of investments expected through our Mainstreet partnerships.
Moving to dispositions. We've increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $1.3 billion in proceeds from the previous $1 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $343 million in proceeds received during the first half of the year, $769 million of proceeds from properties currently held for sale, with the remainder representing loan pay-off and other potential property sales over the rest of the year. Most of the $300 million of incremental disposition proceeds that were added to our guidance this quarter are skilled nursing assets and do include $68 million from our Genesis portfolio.
As Tom and Scott mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell additional Genesis assets above and beyond those included in our current guidance. And just to be clear, our exposure to Genesis has declined by $57 million for the 3 Genesis-related items that have been disclosed over the past 2 days, which include the $61 million in mortgage loans repaid during the quarter, the $68 million in pending dispositions, partially offset by the $72 million new term loan.
In terms of our same-store NOI growth forecast, there's no change to our blended full-year estimate of 2.75% to 3.25%. So I would say that we're tracking toward the higher end of the range at this point, driven largely by the strength of our seniors housing operating portfolio. Our FAD CapEx forecast is currently $82 million for 2016, comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $27 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. We do expect CapEx spending to ramp up a bit during the latter half of the year due to the timing of projected expenditures.
Our G&A forecast continues to track towards the low end of our initial guidance at approximately $160 million for the full year at this point. Our tax line item is projected to return to an expense of about $3 million to $4 million per quarter during each of the last 2 quarters of this year based on slightly higher taxable income forecast. And as a result of all of these assumptions, we're maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represent 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.
I think our decision to maintain guidance was largely based on the fact that the incremental dispositions added to our guidance this quarter should be roughly offset by the Vintage portfolio acquisition and continued solid operating portfolio performance through the second quarter.
So in conclusion, we remain focused on our capital allocation efforts this year that we'll continue to prioritize, maximizing financial flexibility through increased liquidity, strengthening our balance sheet by lowering leverage and enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix.
So that concludes my remarks. And I think at this point in time I'll turn it to you for some closing comments."

The held-for-sale bucket includes $68 million of Genesis properties that are already under contract and that should close in the next 60 days or so. Those are unique in that Genesis is actually exiting the operations as well. So we're selling the real estate; they're exiting operations. And I say that's unusual or unique because, for the most part, we own core Genesis assets that they want to stay in as the operator. So we would be selling our real estate, and Genesis would remain as the operating partner. So I think it's a less complex transaction than trying to sell the real estate and the operations together. And in terms of interest level, it's strong, and it's from a number of different sources; private equity for sure, overseas capital for sure; and we're actually starting to see the private and public REITs show interest again, which have not been the case in the past 3 to 6 months, as the stock prices have come back and the capital raising has improved. So there's actually a pretty deep buyer pool, and the lenders continue to be interested in this space as well, provided the payment coverage is reasonable."

It's more that we're going to pretty dramatically change the service profile at the communities. I think the service level, the price point is going to change pretty dramatically, and we've chosen 3 operating partners to do that with who have extremely deep experience in these markets. So we've underwritten occupancy rate and expense assumptions that are very much based on their historical experience in these markets. And any time you do an operator transition, you have to assume that there's going to be a decline in year 1, especially if you're increasing the service mix. It's just the way it works, is the expenses go up first, and it takes time to be able to increase occupancy and rate to match the service level that you implement day 1. And no doubt you have staffing changes as well as turnover within the resident the population. So the Year 1 is always a bit depressed."

On occasion, to accomplish a longer-term, bigger goal, we'll extend a loan. And we have a good history of having those loans repaid. And in this situation, we can't speak for Omega, but for Welltower, we told George and his team to go out and talk to the marketplace, see what a third party was willing to lend at, and we would be willing to match it. And that's what we did, because this is an important security in the Genesis capital structure, and we'd prefer to control it rather than have a hospital third-party be in that position holding the cards, even though they have 1% or less of the capital at risk. So the situation that existed a week ago to us was untenable and was not allowing us to accomplish important goals. It was distracting Genesis. But we did not do a below-market loan; we didn't do an above-market loan. This is a market rate. Clearly they are not a AAA credit, so we're being paid for the risk that we're taking."

And to us, that was a structure that made sense for the landlord and the tenant. And as the businesses become more competitive, the coverage ratios have declined and declined. And 1.1 today is sort of the market. And for years, operators weren't willing to enter into leases at those coverages. Frankly, we were not doing many, if any, acquisitions at those coverages. We have been saying for years now that, to us, the distinction of risk in focusing on triple-net versus RIDEA was really not the way we think about risk, and we would always prefer to own a Class A asset in a Class A market and deal with the quarter-to-quarter variation in results. And that's exactly why you've seen us concentrate our investments where you have for the past 6 years. We've done very few triple-net investments. When we do, it tends to be a new development where there's an opportunity and enough profit in the development for there to be strong payment coverage or a turnaround opportunity.

There are properties that we think have the opportunity to grow census pretty materially. And almost across the board we feel like there are opportunities to change the service mix, the service level and change the value proposition pretty dramatically for the residents. So that's -- in addition to the occupancy upside, it's really on the rate and service level that we see the portfolio changing the most over the years. But that will take some time. And it is a drag in the early years because you've got to put the new service platform in place before you can charge for it, right? People need to see it before they will pay for it. And it takes time to turn over the population. So this is a long-term investment for us. The 5% cap rate is what we prefer. It was accretive day 1, but the fact is, where cost of capital is today, it probably is accretive at 5%. But this is very much a long-term play for us."

It's just, as we think about the direction of our company, it's probably best not in Welltower's portfolio. So the fact is the population that uses those properties is going to double in size over 20 years and the supply of properties is declining. So when you think about the longer term rather than the next 3 quarters or 3 months, I think the supply/demand dynamics are still quite favorable for that business despite the headwinds that exist. And in a yield -- in a world with yields that are pushing 0% in most developed economies, you can still buy skilled nursing in the high single digits unlevered and get attractive financing, and it generates an awfully attractive return on equity immediately. And the payment coverage is, unlike seniors housing, where they're awfully low with 1.3x coverage, it's a pretty stable yield, particularly if you own good real estate with a good operator.

More and more the U.K. residents will have to turn to a private pay alternative to local authority-funded eldercare.

I'm pleased that the strong results we announced today reflects solid operating performance across all business segments, as well as strategic capital allocation decisions.

I'm pleased that the strong results we announced today reflects solid operating performance across all business segments, as well as strategic capital allocation decisions. Normalized FFO and FAD were up 4% and 5%, respectively. These excellent results were driven by core growth, same-store NOI was up 2.6% and our track record of making accretive investments. Our Class A health care real estate concentrated in major markets has consistently demonstrated resilience and in a year where wage pressures are challenging operators across the senior care industry, as well as new supply coming in to many secondary markets, we are confident in our position and we are raising 2016 same-store NOI guidance to 3% to 3.25%.
Let's take a closer look at our senior housing operating portfolio. Year-to-date, same-store NOI growth in this business has averaged 3.9% relative to our initial guidance of 2% to 3%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, these assets saw a strong occupancy increase of 70 basis points and rental rate growth of 4%. Offsetting this strong top line results has been wage increases, which have been growing at 6% plus year-to-date. Our focus on major markets allows us to pass along much of this expense growth to the consumer. And same-store NOI growth for our operating portfolio resulted in an expected 2.2% increase for the quarter. 
Wage inflation is not unique to the senior care industry. It's impact is being felt across all sectors of health care. This creates particularly unique challenges for government reimbursement focus models that do not have the same ability to pass along increases in operating expenses. This is another reason behind Welltower's strategy of focusing on private pay sectors. You all know the aging demographic wave will positively impact utilization across all sectors of health care. Welltower, however, is capitalizing on this demographic trend by investing in health care assets, where commercial forces determine price and where market forces limit supply.
Given that, let me make a few comments regarding our capital allocation strategy and the press releases we issued this morning. The execution of the announced asset sales will have the effect of meaningfully reducing our government pay exposure and significantly lowering our leverage in order to create future capacity and seize opportunities that may result from unpredictable central bank actions and expected interest rate increases. Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet were rewarded this morning by S&P, with an upgrade on our credit rating to BBB+. We are delighted with this news, as I'm sure our bondholders are as well. We are a long-term investor in health care real estate and believe that skilled nursing, while historically a more volatile asset class will remain an important component of the health care delivery continuum. 
Given our strategy to increase private pay sources of revenue, we indicated that we would explore interest we were seeing from private real estate buyers looking to establish a position in this sector. We listened to and considered the views of our shareholders and undertook a thoughtful and measured approach. This led to numerous discussions that have resulted in a series of transactions that will take our private pay revenue mix up to 92.4% and long-term post-acute care concentration from 19.9% down to 13.5% of NOI. Combine this with our sector leading balance sheet and you have a stable ship that is positioned to seize external growth opportunities as they arise and drive continued sector leading operating performance. I want to thank our shareholders for their confidence in allowing us to take a patient approach to unlocking significant value for these dispositions.
Welltower takes great pride in the capital partnership we established last year with CPPIB. This partnership not only diversifies our source of funding but also validates health care real estate as a true institutional asset class. Today, we welcome our first China-based institutional partner, Cindat, to the Welltower family through our joint venture investment in post-acute long-term care and seniors housing. Cindat's vision and significant interest in the U.S. health care real estate sector exemplifies the natural fit between long-term investors seeking returns driven by unmatched demographic trends. We could not be more pleased to be working with these fine partners.
With that, I will pass the mic to Scott Brinker to shed additional light on our operating performance and acquisition and disposition activities. Scott?"

Very happy to tell you about several big steps we've taken to increase our tenant diversification and private pay mix. First, in September we closed the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition, highlighting our focus on best-in-class real estate. The acquisition solidifies our #1 market share in Northern and Southern California. Both of these markets have outstanding supply and demand fundamentals.
We chose to bring in 3 existing operating partners: SRG, Sunrise and Silverado, to add their unsurpassed local market expertise. Together, we'll create a lot of value in these communities. And second, this morning we reported a number of dispositions. We've always been an active portfolio manager that includes selling nearly $1 billion of skilled nursing over the past few years. Those efforts continued last quarter as we sold a non-Genesis skilled portfolio in the Southeast for $300 million. We realized $140 million gain on sale and a 13% unlevered IRR. We've also substantially repositioned our relationship with Genesis in a way that is beneficial to both parties.
So far, in the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of $1.2 billion of real estate previously leased to Genesis in 2 separate transactions. We've also signed a definitive agreement to contribute a third Genesis portfolio into a joint venture with Cindat and Union Life. Cindat is a China-based institutional investor specializing in overseas real estate, and Union Life is one of the leading insurance companies in China. Together, they will contribute cash for a 75% interest in the venture and Welltower will retain the other 25%.
The joint venture also includes 11 seniors housing properties that we currently lease to Brookdale. Those 11 assets are being contributed at a $45 million gain above our original purchase price for the properties. The joint venture is valued at $930 million, roughly 70% of which represents Genesis assets. This is another example of us bringing first time cross-border capital into the sector to accomplish our strategic objectives.
These 3 Genesis sales aggregate to $1.7 billion in proceeds to Welltower, and have a blended cap rate of 9%. The sale [ph] price is $180 million above the price we paid for these assets in 2011 and will realize a mid-9% unlevered IRR. Importantly, our long-term post-acute payment coverage will improve because we're selling properties with low coverage. Genesis credit will improve because the leases with the new buyers have lower rent and escalators that exist today. The terms of our remaining Genesis master lease will not change, including 3% escalators and a 2032 maturity date.
To further strengthen the relationship, we've also signed a letter of understanding that has 2 components: First, Genesis will have the right to buy back certain properties from the Welltower master lease. Second, we'll jointly market the real estate and operations of 14 non-core properties. These 2 transactions should generate $600-plus million of additional proceeds to Welltower in 2017, and further improve our private pay mix and tenant diversification.
Below the headlines, our unique relationship-based business model continues without interruption. We're known for owning high barrier real estate, which is true, but it's the breadth and depth of these relationships that make our strategy so hard to replicate. More than 20 of the leading operators in the sector come to us first when they find an opportunity in their local markets. More and more institutional capital is flowing into the sector, so the ability to get a first look is invaluable. As an example, last quarter we exercised purchase options on 2 recently stabilized senior housing properties developed and operated by a longtime partner for an attractive 7.25% cap rate.
Turning to operating results, we delivered a solid quarter given the environment. Same-store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 2.2%, rental rates were up 4% and occupancy increased 70 basis points over the prior year. This allowed us to offset higher labor costs, which were a headwind as expected. Pricing power is critically important right now and that means owning a lot of real estate in markets like California. It's also important to understand that unlike many other real estate sectors, the new supply in seniors housing is more heavily concentrated in low-barrier markets. In fact, the percentage increase in new supply in our core markets has been less than the remainder of the country in every single year that NIC has tracked the data. To that point, the industry data shows that broad brush commentary about the sector is misleading, and quarter-after-quarter in our own portfolio, we see wide variance by market with clear outperformance from our core markets.
Turning to medical office. We've been allocating capital to this business for the past 10 years. Today, we're one of the largest owners in the sector. We've always liked the outpatient business because of its convenience for customers and its low cost for payers and providers. We self manage virtually the entire portfolio. Mike Noto and his team are invaluable when underwriting new investments as their market knowledge is unsurpassed. They also do a terrific job creating steady predictable growth. Last quarter, same-store NOI grew 2.5% consistent with prior quarters. That platform is also scalable, evidenced by increased operating margins as we've grown the portfolio.
Moving to triple net seniors housing. Same-store NOI increased 2.6% and payment coverage continues to move higher through improved operating performance and active portfolio management. The long-term post-acute portfolio had another strong quarter. Same-store NOI increased 3.4%. Payment coverage should improve by roughly 10 basis points upon completion of the 2016 dispositions, creating an even more secure income stream for Welltower.
I want to wrap up by sincerely thanking the Welltower team as well as our operating partners. The past few quarters in particular have required trust and perseverance. It was exhausting but also a lot of fun to watch them together rise to the challenge, the true test of our relationship. 
And now here's Scott Estes."

In my comments today, focus on the significant balance sheet and portfolio enhancements that are expected as a result of our portfolio repositioning plan announced this morning. Today's announcements a",1185,"All right. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In my comments today, focus on the significant balance sheet and portfolio enhancements that are expected as a result of our portfolio repositioning plan announced this morning. Today's announcements are the culmination of the capital allocation plan we've been discussing with all of you throughout 2016, which should importantly provide the following 3 benefits: First, we will significantly strengthen our balance sheet with leveraging credit metrics improving to their strongest levels in the modern history of the company. Second, we'll enhance the quality of our portfolio, increasing our private pay mix and reducing our long-term care exposure. And third, we'll improve our liquidity and financial flexibility in 2017 with our full $3 billion line of credit available, virtually no near-term debt maturities and an expected improvement in our cost of capital.
I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our third quarter financial results, our 2017 dividend payment rate and one addition we made to the supplement this quarter. In terms of third quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.16 per share up 4% versus last year and normalized FAD of $1.04 per share, which increased 5% versus the last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $2.6 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. The highlight of the quarter was closing the $1.15 billion Vintage portfolio acquisition earlier than anticipated.
G&A of $36.8 million for the quarter came in slightly below our expectations. We recognized the significant $162 million of gains on sale and did have $9.7 million of impairments associated with 3 small asset pools that are held for sale based on current price expectations. I think, otherwise, this is a fairly straightforward quarterly report.
Now moving on to dividends. We will pay our 182nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on November 21 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually and a current dividend yield of 5.1%. Our sizable disposition expectations were a significant consideration as we fed our dividend policy for 2017. Based on the strength of our platform and confidence in our longer-term earnings growth potential beyond 2017, we're announcing a 1.2% increase in our 2017 dividend payment rate today that will commence with the February payment. And we also made one notable addition to the supplement this quarter, and which is on the bottom of Page 16 where we're now providing the NOI contribution from the 13 core markets that comprise 57% of our RIDEA portfolio.
Now turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The most significant capital event this quarter was our decision to opportunistically raise a total of $358 million of equity through a combination of our ATM and DRIP programs, where we issued a total of 4.7 million shares at an average price of $76.98 per share. We also generated $489 million of proceeds through $60 million in loan payoffs and $429 million of property sales, which included the $162 million in gains on sale. And last, we did repay approximately $191 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.4% and we issued or assumed $79 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3.7%. 
However, really, the biggest story today is how we expect to improve our balance sheet upon completion of our portfolio repositioning plan. Importantly, we expect to use approximately $2.8 billion of the $3.3 billion in disposition proceeds expected in the fourth quarter to pay down debt and preferred stock. This will greatly strengthen our balance sheet on a pro forma basis. More specifically, net debt to undepreciated book capitalization will decline by roughly 5 full percentage points to the 34% area. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA will decline to approximately 5.1x and interest and fixed charge coverage will improved to 4.4x and 3.6x, respectively. Most importantly, these balance sheet enhancements should improve our cost of capital, allow us to be entirely self funding over the near term and provide considerable financial flexibility and optionality for the company over the next several years.
I was also excited that S&P recognized our improving balance sheet strength with a rating increase this morning, which brings Welltower to the BBB+ equivalent rating with all 3 agencies.
I will conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our 2016 guidance does include an addition of $314 million of acquisitions and loans at a 7.2% blended yield expected to close in the fourth quarter. We don't normally provide future acquisitions in our guidance, but we're doing so this quarter to allow us to provide the pro forma detail for the expected use of disposition proceeds that concluded in our portfolio repositioning press release.
In regard to dispositions, we have increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $4.1 billion from the previous $1.3 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $832 million in proceeds received through the third quarter, plus the remaining $3.3 billion detailed in our portfolio repositioning release. The $3.3 billion is comprised of approximately $1.9 billion of proceeds from long-term care post-acute assets, a $1.2 billion from seniors housing triple net assets, $51 million from seniors housing operating assets and a $151 million -- excuse me, $150 million in loan repayments.
In terms of our same-store NOI growth, as Tom mentioned, we're increasing the low end of our full year guidance to a range of 3% to 3.25% from the previous range of 2.75% to 3.25%. And I think while you'll always see some variance from quarter-to-quarter in our same-store results, we think it's increasingly important that everyone focus on the consistency and stability of our same-store results on an annual basis. I would note that our senior's housing operating portfolio, in particular, has again demonstrated its consistency this year generating meaningful occupancy and RevPAR increases in the face of significant industry supply and expense growth headwinds.
We continue to effectively manage our G&A expenses and now anticipate that we should come in at or slightly below the low end of our original 2016 guidance range of $160 million to $165 million. And with only 1 quarter remaining in 2016, we're revising our 2016 normalized FFO guidance to a range of $4.50 to $4.56 per share, and normalized FAD guidance to a range of $3.99 to $4.05 per share representing 3% and 4% increases, respectively, at the midpoint. The slight reduction in our FFO midpoint is primarily a function of the increase in our disposition guidance, while the FAD increase is primarily a result of lower CapEx than previously projected.
So in conclusion, we look forward to the continued execution of our portfolio repositioning plan and will provide additional detail on asset sales and debt repurchases as they occur over the next several months. Most importantly, our portfolio repositioning efforts will significantly improve the long-term growth profile of our portfolio, while dramatically improving the strength of our balance sheet and financial flexibility heading into 2017.
So with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for some closing comments."

The cap rate that we quoted is based on the in-place rent that exist today under the term master lease divided by the purchase price from the third party, so pretty straightforward. And in terms of the rent adjustment that Genesis received, I mean, our goal all along here was to create a better relationship, stronger relationship between Welltower and Genesis, and to improve Genesis credit. So I think we were able to come up with a pretty creative way to accomplish that in that we agreed with Genesis and the third-party buyers to essentially reduce the rent going forward by about 5% on both portfolios, so that's about $8 million of Year 1 rent. And in exchange for that, Genesis gave us a note with a 4-year term that bears interest at a 10% rate, but a good part of that is payable in kind versus in cash so that they have a sizable cash flow benefit in Year 1 from this transaction, not to mention materially lower [ph] going forward. So one of the challenges in the Genesis portfolio has been the 3.5% lease escalators for the last 5 years, which George and his team, frankly, have done an amazing job of keeping up with because our payment coverage have been basically flat for 5 years now after the big Medicare cut, but it's tough. I mean, Medicare and Medicaid rates are growing 1-ish percent per year at best, plus the occupancy challenges in the business. It's just -- it's tough to keep up with that kind of an escalator. So in the new leases with the new buyers, they've agreed to 2% or below escalators for the next 15 years so that, over time, there's a meaningful benefit to Genesis."

And that's why we've said it for years, there's no very little differential in cap rate when you look at differences in asset class, building the quality and particularly location. Everything is sort of the same and our view is that, that's going to change pretty dramatically. You've seen that other real estate sectors where there's a huge difference in cap rate, among building in New York, New Jersey, in California or secondary location in middle America. There's no question that health care real estate is going to move in that direction in our portfolio, and operating partners are going to benefit from that because the foreign capital is coming in a major way, and that's the thing they care about. You see the huge pricing differential in other real estate classes you don't yet see that in our sector but it's coming."

I'm pleased that the strong results we announced today reflects solid operating performance across all business segments, as well as strategic capital allocation decisions.

I'm pleased that the strong results we announced today reflects solid operating performance across all business segments, as well as strategic capital allocation decisions. Normalized FFO and FAD were up 4% and 5%, respectively. These excellent results were driven by core growth, same-store NOI was up 2.6% and our track record of making accretive investments. Our Class A health care real estate concentrated in major markets has consistently demonstrated resilience and in a year where wage pressures are challenging operators across the senior care industry, as well as new supply coming in to many secondary markets, we are confident in our position and we are raising 2016 same-store NOI guidance to 3% to 3.25%.
Let's take a closer look at our senior housing operating portfolio. Year-to-date, same-store NOI growth in this business has averaged 3.9% relative to our initial guidance of 2% to 3%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, these assets saw a strong occupancy increase of 70 basis points and rental rate growth of 4%. Offsetting this strong top line results has been wage increases, which have been growing at 6% plus year-to-date. Our focus on major markets allows us to pass along much of this expense growth to the consumer. And same-store NOI growth for our operating portfolio resulted in an expected 2.2% increase for the quarter. 
Wage inflation is not unique to the senior care industry. It's impact is being felt across all sectors of health care. This creates particularly unique challenges for government reimbursement focus models that do not have the same ability to pass along increases in operating expenses. This is another reason behind Welltower's strategy of focusing on private pay sectors. You all know the aging demographic wave will positively impact utilization across all sectors of health care. Welltower, however, is capitalizing on this demographic trend by investing in health care assets, where commercial forces determine price and where market forces limit supply.
Given that, let me make a few comments regarding our capital allocation strategy and the press releases we issued this morning. The execution of the announced asset sales will have the effect of meaningfully reducing our government pay exposure and significantly lowering our leverage in order to create future capacity and seize opportunities that may result from unpredictable central bank actions and expected interest rate increases. Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet were rewarded this morning by S&P, with an upgrade on our credit rating to BBB+. We are delighted with this news, as I'm sure our bondholders are as well. We are a long-term investor in health care real estate and believe that skilled nursing, while historically a more volatile asset class will remain an important component of the health care delivery continuum. 
Given our strategy to increase private pay sources of revenue, we indicated that we would explore interest we were seeing from private real estate buyers looking to establish a position in this sector. We listened to and considered the views of our shareholders and undertook a thoughtful and measured approach. This led to numerous discussions that have resulted in a series of transactions that will take our private pay revenue mix up to 92.4% and long-term post-acute care concentration from 19.9% down to 13.5% of NOI. Combine this with our sector leading balance sheet and you have a stable ship that is positioned to seize external growth opportunities as they arise and drive continued sector leading operating performance. I want to thank our shareholders for their confidence in allowing us to take a patient approach to unlocking significant value for these dispositions.
Welltower takes great pride in the capital partnership we established last year with CPPIB. This partnership not only diversifies our source of funding but also validates health care real estate as a true institutional asset class. Today, we welcome our first China-based institutional partner, Cindat, to the Welltower family through our joint venture investment in post-acute long-term care and seniors housing. Cindat's vision and significant interest in the U.S. health care real estate sector exemplifies the natural fit between long-term investors seeking returns driven by unmatched demographic trends. We could not be more pleased to be working with these fine partners.
With that, I will pass the mic to Scott Brinker to shed additional light on our operating performance and acquisition and disposition activities. Scott?"

Very happy to tell you about several big steps we've taken to increase our tenant diversification and private pay mix. First, in September we closed the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition, highlighting ou",990,"Okay. Thank you, Tom, and good morning to everyone. Very happy to tell you about several big steps we've taken to increase our tenant diversification and private pay mix. First, in September we closed the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition, highlighting our focus on best-in-class real estate. The acquisition solidifies our #1 market share in Northern and Southern California. Both of these markets have outstanding supply and demand fundamentals.
We chose to bring in 3 existing operating partners: SRG, Sunrise and Silverado, to add their unsurpassed local market expertise. Together, we'll create a lot of value in these communities. And second, this morning we reported a number of dispositions. We've always been an active portfolio manager that includes selling nearly $1 billion of skilled nursing over the past few years. Those efforts continued last quarter as we sold a non-Genesis skilled portfolio in the Southeast for $300 million. We realized $140 million gain on sale and a 13% unlevered IRR. We've also substantially repositioned our relationship with Genesis in a way that is beneficial to both parties.
So far, in the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of $1.2 billion of real estate previously leased to Genesis in 2 separate transactions. We've also signed a definitive agreement to contribute a third Genesis portfolio into a joint venture with Cindat and Union Life. Cindat is a China-based institutional investor specializing in overseas real estate, and Union Life is one of the leading insurance companies in China. Together, they will contribute cash for a 75% interest in the venture and Welltower will retain the other 25%.
The joint venture also includes 11 seniors housing properties that we currently lease to Brookdale. Those 11 assets are being contributed at a $45 million gain above our original purchase price for the properties. The joint venture is valued at $930 million, roughly 70% of which represents Genesis assets. This is another example of us bringing first time cross-border capital into the sector to accomplish our strategic objectives.
These 3 Genesis sales aggregate to $1.7 billion in proceeds to Welltower, and have a blended cap rate of 9%. The sale price is $180 million above the price we paid for these assets in 2011 and will realize a mid-9% unlevered IRR. Importantly, our long-term post-acute payment coverage will improve because we're selling properties with low coverage. Genesis credit will improve because the leases with the new buyers have lower rent and escalators that exist today. The terms of our remaining Genesis master lease will not change, including 3% escalators and a 2032 maturity date.
To further strengthen the relationship, we've also signed a letter of understanding that has 2 components: First, Genesis will have the right to buy back certain properties from the Welltower master lease. Second, we'll jointly market the real estate and operations of 14 non-core properties. These 2 transactions should generate $600-plus million of additional proceeds to Welltower in 2017, and further improve our private pay mix and tenant diversification.
Below the headlines, our unique relationship-based business model continues without interruption. We're known for owning high barrier real estate, which is true, but it's the breadth and depth of these relationships that make our strategy so hard to replicate. More than 20 of the leading operators in the sector come to us first when they find an opportunity in their local markets. More and more institutional capital is flowing into the sector, so the ability to get a first look is invaluable. As an example, last quarter we exercised purchase options on 2 recently stabilized senior housing properties developed and operated by a longtime partner for an attractive 7.25% cap rate.
Turning to operating results, we delivered a solid quarter given the environment. Same-store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 2.2%, rental rates were up 4% and occupancy increased 70 basis points over the prior year. This allowed us to offset higher labor costs, which were a headwind as expected. Pricing power is critically important right now and that means owning a lot of real estate in markets like California. It's also important to understand that unlike many other real estate sectors, the new supply in seniors housing is more heavily concentrated in low-barrier markets. In fact, the percentage increase in new supply in our core markets has been less than the remainder of the country in every single year that NIC has tracked the data. To that point, the industry data shows that broad brush commentary about the sector is misleading, and quarter-after-quarter in our own portfolio, we see wide variance by market with clear outperformance from our core markets.
Turning to medical office. We've been allocating capital to this business for the past 10 years. Today, we're one of the largest owners in the sector. We've always liked the outpatient business because of its convenience for customers and its low cost for payers and providers. We self manage virtually the entire portfolio. Mike Noto and his team are invaluable when underwriting new investments as their market knowledge is unsurpassed. They also do a terrific job creating steady predictable growth. Last quarter, same-store NOI grew 2.5% consistent with prior quarters. That platform is also scalable, evidenced by increased operating margins as we've grown the portfolio.
Moving to triple net seniors housing. Same-store NOI increased 2.6% and payment coverage continues to move higher through improved operating performance and active portfolio management. The long-term post-acute portfolio had another strong quarter. Same-store NOI increased 3.4%. Payment coverage should improve by roughly 10 basis points upon completion of the 2016 dispositions, creating an even more secure income stream for Welltower.
I want to wrap up by sincerely thanking the Welltower team as well as our operating partners. The past few quarters in particular have required trust and perseverance. It was exhausting but also a lot of fun to watch them together rise to the challenge, the true test of our relationship. 
And now here's Scott Estes."

Today's announcements a",1185,"All right. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In my comments today, focus on the significant balance sheet and portfolio enhancements that are expected as a result of our portfolio repositioning plan announced this morning. Today's announcements are the culmination of the capital allocation plan we've been discussing with all of you throughout 2016, which should importantly provide the following 3 benefits: First, we will significantly strengthen our balance sheet with leveraging credit metrics improving to their strongest levels in the modern history of the company. Second, we'll enhance the quality of our portfolio, increasing our private pay mix and reducing our long-term care exposure. And third, we'll improve our liquidity and financial flexibility in 2017 with our full $3 billion line of credit available, virtually no near-term debt maturities and an expected improvement in our cost of capital.
I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our third quarter financial results, our 2017 dividend payment rate and one addition we made to the supplement this quarter. In terms of third quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.16 per share up 4% versus last year and normalized FAD of $1.04 per share, which increased 5% versus the last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $2.6 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. The highlight of the quarter was closing the $1.15 billion Vintage portfolio acquisition earlier than anticipated.
G&A of $36.8 million for the quarter came in slightly below our expectations. We recognized the significant $162 million of gains on sale and did have $9.7 million of impairments associated with 3 small asset pools that are held for sale based on current price expectations. I think, otherwise, this is a fairly straightforward quarterly report.
Now moving on to dividends. We will pay our 182nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on November 21 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually and a current dividend yield of 5.1%. Our sizable disposition expectations were a significant consideration as we fed our dividend policy for 2017. Based on the strength of our platform and confidence in our longer-term earnings growth potential beyond 2017, we're announcing a 1.2% increase in our 2017 dividend payment rate today that will commence with the February payment. And we also made one notable addition to the supplement this quarter, and which is on the bottom of Page 16 where we're now providing the NOI contribution from the 13 core markets that comprise 57% of our RIDEA portfolio.
Now turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The most significant capital event this quarter was our decision to opportunistically raise a total of $358 million of equity through a combination of our ATM and DRIP programs, where we issued a total of 4.7 million shares at an average price of $76.98 per share. We also generated $489 million of proceeds through $60 million in loan payoffs and $429 million of property sales, which included the $162 million in gains on sale. And last, we did repay approximately $191 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.4% and we issued or assumed $79 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3.7%. 
However, really, the biggest story today is how we expect to improve our balance sheet upon completion of our portfolio repositioning plan. Importantly, we expect to use approximately $2.8 billion of the $3.3 billion in disposition proceeds expected in the fourth quarter to pay down debt and preferred stock. This will greatly strengthen our balance sheet on a pro forma basis. More specifically, net debt to undepreciated book capitalization will decline by roughly 5 full percentage points to the 34% area. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA will decline to approximately 5.1x and interest and fixed charge coverage will improved to 4.4x and 3.6x, respectively. Most importantly, these balance sheet enhancements should improve our cost of capital, allow us to be entirely self funding over the near term and provide considerable financial flexibility and optionality for the company over the next several years.
I was also excited that S&P recognized our improving balance sheet strength with a rating increase this morning, which brings Welltower to the BBB+ equivalent rating with all 3 agencies.
I will conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our 2016 guidance does include an addition of $314 million of acquisitions and loans at a 7.2% blended yield expected to close in the fourth quarter. We don't normally provide future acquisitions in our guidance, but we're doing so this quarter to allow us to provide the pro forma detail for the expected use of disposition proceeds that concluded in our portfolio repositioning press release.
In regard to dispositions, we have increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $4.1 billion from the previous $1.3 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $832 million in proceeds received through the third quarter, plus the remaining $3.3 billion detailed in our portfolio repositioning release. The $3.3 billion is comprised of approximately $1.9 billion of proceeds from long-term care post-acute assets, a $1.2 billion from seniors housing triple net assets, $51 million from seniors housing operating assets and a $151 million -- excuse me, $150 million in loan repayments.
In terms of our same-store NOI growth, as Tom mentioned, we're increasing the low end of our full year guidance to a range of 3% to 3.25% from the previous range of 2.75% to 3.25%. And I think while you'll always see some variance from quarter-to-quarter in our same-store results, we think it's increasingly important that everyone focus on the consistency and stability of our same-store results on an annual basis. I would note that our senior's housing operating portfolio, in particular, has again demonstrated its consistency this year generating meaningful occupancy and RevPAR increases in the face of significant industry supply and expense growth headwinds.
We continue to effectively manage our G&A expenses and now anticipate that we should come in at or slightly below the low end of our original 2016 guidance range of $160 million to $165 million. And with only 1 quarter remaining in 2016, we're revising our 2016 normalized FFO guidance to a range of $4.50 to $4.56 per share, and normalized FAD guidance to a range of $3.99 to $4.05 per share representing 3% and 4% increases, respectively, at the midpoint. The slight reduction in our FFO midpoint is primarily a function of the increase in our disposition guidance, while the FAD increase is primarily a result of lower CapEx than previously projected.
So in conclusion, we look forward to the continued execution of our portfolio repositioning plan and will provide additional detail on asset sales and debt repurchases as they occur over the next several months. Most importantly, our portfolio repositioning efforts will significantly improve the long-term growth profile of our portfolio, while dramatically improving the strength of our balance sheet and financial flexibility heading into 2017.
So with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for some closing comments."

You can see the disposition proceeds of $3.274 billion and then the specific uses. That's really the numbers, I think, everyone should use to start thinking about 2017. We will provide guidance in February once we get all the models and everything done at that point. The one thing that will benefit 2017 are a couple of things beyond what's just in this press release though. As a reminder, obviously, you should model same-store NOI growth. Were going to have some development conversions, and obviously, it doesn't include any acquisitions as well. So we give you our fourth quarter number effectively with our guidance this year and I think I would just model up the in-place NOI from the numbers we gave you in the release."

The cap rate that we quoted is based on the in-place rent that exist today under the term master lease divided by the purchase price from the third party, so pretty straightforward. And in terms of the rent adjustment that Genesis received, I mean, our goal all along here was to create a better relationship, stronger relationship between Welltower and Genesis, and to improve Genesis credit. So I think we were able to come up with a pretty creative way to accomplish that in that we agreed with Genesis and the third-party buyers to essentially reduce the rent going forward by about 5% on both portfolios, so that's about $8 million of Year 1 rent. And in exchange for that, Genesis gave us a note with a 4-year term that bears interest at a 10% rate, but a good part of that is payable in kind versus in cash so that they have a sizable cash flow benefit in Year 1 from this transaction, not to mention materially lower increasers going forward. So one of the challenges in the Genesis portfolio has been the 3.5% lease escalators for the last 5 years, which George and his team, frankly, have done an amazing job of keeping up with because our payment coverage have been basically flat for 5 years now after the big Medicare cut, but it's tough. I mean, Medicare and Medicaid rates are growing 1-ish percent per year at best, plus the occupancy challenges in the business. It's just -- it's tough to keep up with that kind of an escalator. So in the new leases with the new buyers, they've agreed to 2% or below escalators for the next 15 years so that, over time, there's a meaningful benefit to Genesis."

And that's why we've said it for years, there's no -- very little differential in cap rate when you look at differences in asset class, building quality and particularly location. Everything is sort of the same. And our view is that, that's going to change pretty dramatically. You've seen that in other real estate sectors where there's a huge difference in cap rate, among building in New York, New Jersey, in California or secondary location in middle America. There's no question that health care real estate is going to move in that direction in our portfolio, and operating partners are going to benefit from that because the foreign capital is coming in a major way, and that's the thing they care about.

So we believe this is not going away, and we also believe that post-acute care in the future may look different than the historic skilled nursing model that you're familiar with. So Scott used a word that we often use around here called optionality. We are a long-term investor in health care real estate, and we want to maintain optionality to be opportunistic and deploy capital across the spectrum if we believe it's in the best interest of our shareholders."

It's just that 90 days is just too short a period of time to make conclusions about performance of the portfolio or the trend or trajectory. It just -- $1 million is not much money in the scheme of things and yet, it moves the same-store growth rate by 50 basis points. So small accruals, adjustments that simply happen. And they're unpredictable. Moved that number a lot. So by the same argument, I wouldn't read too much into that other line item this quarter.

I'm pleased that the strong results we announced today reflect solid operating performance across all business segments, as well as strategic capital allocation decisions. Normalized FFO and FAD were up 4% and 5%, respectively. These excellent results were driven by core growth, same-store NOI was up 2.6% and our track record of making accretive investments. Our Class A health care real estate concentrated in major markets has consistently demonstrated resilience and in a year where wage pressures are challenging operators across the senior care industry, as well as new supply coming into many secondary markets, we are confident in our position and we are raising 2016 same-store NOI guidance to 3% to 3.25%.
Let's take a closer look at our senior housing operating portfolio. Year-to-date, same-store NOI growth in this business has averaged 3.9% relative to our initial guidance of 2% to 3%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, these assets saw a strong occupancy increase of 70 basis points and rental rate growth of 4%. Offsetting these strong top line results has been wage increases, which have been growing at 6% plus year-to-date. Our focus on major markets allows us to pass along much of this expense growth to the consumer. And same-store NOI growth for our operating portfolio resulted in an expected 2.2% increase for the quarter. 
Wage inflation is not unique to the senior care industry. Its impact is being felt across all sectors of health care. This creates particularly unique challenges for government reimbursement focus models that do not have the same ability to pass along increases in operating expenses. This is another reason behind Welltower's strategy of focusing on private pay sectors. You all know the aging demographic wave will positively impact utilization across all sectors of health care. Welltower, however, is capitalizing on this demographic trend by investing in health care assets where commercial forces determine price and where market forces limit supply.
Given that, let me make a few comments regarding our capital allocation strategy and the press releases we issued this morning. The execution of the announced asset sales will have the effect of meaningfully reducing our government pay exposure and significantly lowering our leverage in order to create future capacity and seize opportunities that may result from unpredictable central bank actions and expected interest rate increases. Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet were rewarded this morning by S&P, with an upgrade on our credit rating to BBB+. We are delighted with this news, as I'm sure our bondholders are as well. We are a long-term investor in healthcare real estate and believe that skilled nursing, while historically a more volatile asset class will remain an important component of the health care delivery continuum. 
Given our strategy to increase private pay sources of revenue, we indicated that we would explore interest we were seeing from private real estate buyers looking to establish a position in this sector. We listened to and considered the views of our shareholders and undertook a thoughtful and measured approach. This led to numerous discussions that have resulted in a series of transactions that will take our private pay revenue mix up to 92.4% and long-term post-acute care concentration from 19.9% down to 13.5% of NOI. Combine this with our sector leading balance sheet and you have a stable ship that is positioned to seize external growth opportunities as they arise and drive continued sector leading operating performance. I want to thank our shareholders for their confidence in allowing us to take a patient approach to unlocking significant value for these dispositions.
Welltower takes great pride in the capital partnership we established last year with CPPIB. This partnership not only diversifies our source of funding but also validates healthcare real estate as a true institutional asset class. Today, we welcome our first China-based institutional partner, Cindat, to the Welltower family through our joint venture investment in post-acute long-term care and seniors housing. Cindat's vision and significant interest in the U.S. healthcare real estate sector exemplifies the natural fit between long-term investors seeking returns driven by unmatched demographic trends. We could not be more pleased to be working with these fine partners.
With that, I will pass the mic to Scott Brinker to shed additional light on our operating performance and acquisition and disposition activities. Scott?"

Very happy to tell you about several big steps we've taken to increase our tenant diversification and private pay mix. First, in September we closed the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition, highlighting ou",987,"Okay. Thank you, Tom, and good morning to everyone. Very happy to tell you about several big steps we've taken to increase our tenant diversification and private pay mix. First, in September we closed the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition, highlighting our focus on best-in-class real estate. The acquisition solidifies our #1 market share in Northern and Southern California. Both of these markets have outstanding supply and demand fundamentals.
We chose to bring in 3 existing operating partners: SRG, Sunrise and Silverado, to add their unsurpassed local market expertise. Together, we'll create a lot of value in these communities. And second, this morning we reported a number of dispositions. We've always been an active portfolio manager that includes selling nearly $1 billion of skilled nursing over the past few years. Those efforts continued last quarter as we sold a non-Genesis skilled portfolio in the Southeast for $300 million. We realized $140 million gain on sale and a 13% unlevered IRR. We've also substantially repositioned our relationship with Genesis in a way that is beneficial to both parties.
So far, in the fourth quarter, we've closed on the sale of $1.2 billion of real estate previously leased to Genesis in 2 separate transactions. We've also signed a definitive agreement to contribute a third Genesis portfolio into a joint venture with Cindat and Union Life. Cindat is a China-based institutional investor specializing in overseas real estate, and Union Life is one of the leading insurance companies in China. Together, they will contribute cash for a 75% interest in the venture and Welltower will retain the other 25%.
The joint venture also includes 11 seniors housing properties that we currently lease to Brookdale. Those 11 assets are being contributed at a $45 million gain above our original purchase price for the properties. The joint venture is valued at $930 million, roughly 70% of which represents Genesis assets. This is another example of us bringing first-time cross-border capital into the sector to accomplish our strategic objectives.
These 3 Genesis sales aggregate to $1.7 billion in proceeds to Welltower and have a blended cap rate of 9%. The sale price is $180 million above the price we paid for these assets in 2011 and will realize a mid-9% unlevered IRR. Importantly, our long-term post-acute payment coverage will improve because we're selling properties with low coverage. Genesis credit will improve because the leases with the new buyers have lower rent and escalators that exist today. The terms of our remaining Genesis master lease will not change, including 3% escalators and a 2032 maturity date.
To further strengthen the relationship, we've also signed a letter of understanding that has 2 components: First, Genesis will have the right to buy back certain properties from the Welltower master lease. Second, we'll jointly market the real estate and operations of 14 non-core properties. These 2 transactions should generate $600-plus million of additional proceeds to Welltower in 2017, and further improve our private pay mix and tenant diversification.
Below the headlines, our unique relationship-based business model continues without interruption. We're known for owning high barrier real estate, which is true, but it's the breadth and depth of these relationships that make our strategy so hard to replicate. More than 20 of the leading operators in the sector come to us first when they find an opportunity in their local markets. More and more institutional capital is flowing into the sector, so the ability to get a first look is invaluable. As an example, last quarter we exercised purchase options on 2 recently stabilized senior housing properties developed and operated by a longtime partner for an attractive 7.25% cap rate.
Turning to operating results, we delivered a solid quarter given the environment. Same-store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 2.2%, rental rates were up 4% and occupancy increased 70 basis points over the prior year. This allowed us to offset higher labor costs, which were a headwind as expected. Pricing power is critically important right now and that means owning a lot of real estate in markets like California. It's also important to understand that unlike many other real estate sectors, the new supply in seniors housing is more heavily concentrated in low-barrier markets. In fact, the percentage increase in new supply in our core markets has been less than the remainder of the country in every single year that NIC has tracked the data. To that point, the industry data shows that broad brush commentary about the sector is misleading, and quarter-after-quarter in our own portfolio, we see wide variance by market with clear outperformance from our core markets.
Turning to medical office. We've been allocating capital to this business for the past 10 years. Today, we're one of the largest owners in the sector. We've always liked the outpatient business because of its convenience for customers and its low cost for payers and providers. We self-manage virtually the entire portfolio. Mike Noto and his team are invaluable when underwriting new investments as their market knowledge is unsurpassed. They also do a terrific job creating steady predictable growth. Last quarter, same-store NOI grew 2.5% consistent with prior quarters. That platform is also scalable, evidenced by increased operating margins as we've grown the portfolio.
Moving to triple-net seniors housing. Same-store NOI increased 2.6% and payment coverage continues to move higher through improved operating performance and active portfolio management. The long-term post-acute portfolio had another strong quarter. Same-store NOI increased 3.4%. Payment coverage should improve by roughly 10 basis points upon completion of the 2016 dispositions, creating an even more secure income stream for Welltower.
I want to wrap up by sincerely thanking the Welltower team as well as our operating partners. The past few quarters, in particular, have required trust and perseverance. It was exhausting but also a lot of fun to watch them together rise to the challenge, the true test of a relationship. 
And now here's Scott Estes."

My comments today, focus on the significant balance sheet and portfolio enhancements that are expected as a result of our portfolio repositioning plan announced this morning. Today's announcements are",1178,"All right. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone.  My comments today, focus on the significant balance sheet and portfolio enhancements that are expected as a result of our portfolio repositioning plan announced this morning. Today's announcements are the culmination of the capital allocation plan we've been discussing with all of you throughout 2016, which should importantly provide the following 3 benefits: First, we will significantly strengthen our balance sheet with leveraging credit metrics improving to their strongest levels in the modern history of the company. Second, we'll enhance the quality of our portfolio, increasing our private pay mix and reducing our long-term care exposure. And third, we'll improve our liquidity and financial flexibility in 2017 with our full $3 billion line of credit available, virtually no near-term debt maturities and an expected improvement in our cost of capital.
I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our third quarter financial results, our 2017 dividend payment rate and one addition we made to the supplement this quarter. In terms of third quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.16 per share up 4% versus last year and normalized FAD of $1.04 per share, which increased 5% versus the last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $2.6 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. The highlight of the quarter was closing the $1.15 billion Vintage portfolio acquisition earlier than anticipated.
G&A of $36.8 million for the quarter came in slightly below our expectations. We recognized the significant $162 million of gains on sale and did have $9.7 million of impairments associated with 3 small asset pools that are held for sale based on current price expectations. I think, otherwise, this is a fairly straightforward quarterly report.
Now moving on to dividends. We will pay our 182nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on November 21 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually and a current dividend yield of 5.1%. Our sizable disposition expectations were a significant consideration as we set our dividend policy for 2017. Based on the strength of our platform and confidence in our longer-term earnings growth potential beyond 2017, we're announcing a 1.2% increase in our 2017 dividend payment rate today that will commence with the February payment. And we also made one notable addition to the supplement this quarter, which is on the bottom of Page 16 where we're now providing the NOI contribution from the 13 core markets that comprise 57% of our RIDEA portfolio.
Now turning to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The most significant capital event this quarter was our decision to opportunistically raise a total of $358 million of equity through a combination of our ATM and DRIP programs, where we issued a total of 4.7 million shares at an average price of $76.98 per share. We also generated $489 million of proceeds through $60 million in loan payoffs and $429 million of property sales, which included the $162 million in gains on sale. And last, we did repay approximately $191 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.4% and we issued or assumed $79 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3.7%. 
However, really, the biggest story today is how we expect to improve our balance sheet upon completion of our portfolio repositioning plan. Importantly, we expect to use approximately $2.8 billion of the $3.3 billion in disposition proceeds expected in the fourth quarter to pay down debt and preferred stock. This will greatly strengthen our balance sheet on a pro forma basis. More specifically, net debt to undepreciated book capitalization will decline by roughly 5 full percentage points to the 34% area. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA will decline to approximately 5.1x and interest and fixed charge coverage will improve to 4.4x and 3.6x, respectively. Most importantly, these balance sheet enhancements should improve our cost of capital, allow us to be entirely self-funding over the near term and provide considerable financial flexibility and optionality for the company over the next several years.
I was also excited that S&P recognized our improving balance sheet strength with their rating increase this morning, which brings Welltower to the BBB+ equivalent rating with all 3 agencies.
I will conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our 2016 guidance does include an additional $314 million of acquisitions and loans at a 7.2% blended yield expected to close in the fourth quarter. We don't normally provide future acquisitions in our guidance, but we're doing so this quarter to allow us to provide the pro forma detail for the expected use of disposition proceeds that's included in our portfolio repositioning press release.
In regard to dispositions, we have increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $4.1 billion from the previous $1.3 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $832 million in proceeds received through the third quarter, plus the remaining $3.3 billion detailed in our portfolio repositioning release. The $3.3 billion is comprised of approximately $1.9 billion of proceeds from long-term care post-acute assets, a $1.2 billion from seniors housing triple-net assets, $51 million from seniors housing operating assets and a $151 million -- excuse me, $150 million in loan repayments.
In terms of our same-store NOI growth, as Tom mentioned, we're increasing the low end of our full-year guidance to a range of 3% to 3.25% from the previous range of 2.75% to 3.25%. And I think while you'll always see some variance from quarter-to-quarter in our same-store results, we think it's increasingly important that everyone focuses on the consistency and stability of our same-store results on an annual basis. I would note that our senior's housing operating portfolio, in particular, has again demonstrated its consistency this year generating meaningful occupancy and RevPAR increases in the face of significant industry supply and expense growth headwinds.
We continue to effectively manage our G&A expenses and now anticipate that we should come in at or slightly below the low end of our original 2016 guidance range of $160 million to $165 million. And with only 1 quarter remaining in 2016, we're revising our 2016 normalized FFO guidance to a range of $4.50 to $4.56 per share, and normalized FAD guidance to a range of $3.99 to $4.05 per share representing 3% and 4% increases, respectively, at the midpoint. The slight reduction in our FFO midpoint is primarily a function of the increase in our disposition guidance, while the FAD increase is primarily a result of lower CapEx than previously projected.
So in conclusion, we look forward to the continued execution of our portfolio repositioning plan and will provide additional detail on asset sales and debt repurchases as they occur over the next several months. Most importantly, our portfolio repositioning efforts will significantly improve the long-term growth profile of our portfolio, while dramatically improving the strength of our balance sheet and financial flexibility heading into 2017.
So with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for some closing comments."

The cap rate that we quoted is based on the in-place rent that exist today under the current master lease divided by the purchase price from the third party, so pretty straightforward. And in terms of the rent adjustment that Genesis received, I mean, our goal all along here was to create a better relationship, stronger relationship between Welltower and Genesis, and to improve Genesis' credit. So I think we were able to come up with pretty creative way to accomplish that in that we agreed with Genesis and the third-party buyers to essentially reduce the rent going forward by about 5% on both portfolios, so that's about $8 million of Year 1 rent. And in exchange for that, Genesis gave us a note with a 4-year term that bears interest at a 10% rate, but a good part of that is payable in kind versus in cash so that they have a sizable cash flow benefit in Year 1 from this transaction, not to mention materially lower increases going forward. So one of the challenges in the Genesis portfolio has been the 3.5% lease escalators for the last 5 years, which George and his team, frankly, have done an amazing job of keeping up with because our payment coverage has been basically flat for 5 years now after the big Medicare cut, but it's tough. I mean, Medicare and Medicaid rates are growing 1-ish percent per year at best, plus the occupancy challenges in the business. It's just -- it's tough to keep up with that kind of an escalator. So in the new leases with the new buyers, they've agreed to 2% or below escalators for the next 15 years so that, over time, there's a meaningful benefit to Genesis."

Scott talked about some development opportunities because their markets, like Manhattan, where the product does not exist for us to acquire, so we're developing it. And I think we will see some interesting opportunities that will come from other sectors of healthcare delivery where we like the medical office business and we will continue to look for opportunities to grow that business because not only are we a good acquirer, we also have an excellent management company based down in Jupiter, Florida."

Maybe the one addition would be is as the foreign institutional capital comes into U.S. healthcare real estate for the first time, almost across the board their first question is, do you have a portfolio or an opportunity on the East or West Coast? Like they always ask that question. You never hear that question from U.S. buyers, especially in seniors housing, medical office, nobody cares, right? And that's why we've said it for years, there's no -- very little differential in cap rate when you look at differences in asset class, building quality and particularly location. Everything is sort of the same. And our view is that that's going to change pretty dramatically. You've seen that in other real estate sectors where there's a huge difference in cap rate, among building in New York, New Jersey, in California or secondary location in middle America. There's no question that healthcare real estate is going to move in that direction in our portfolio, and operating partners are going to benefit from that because the foreign capital is coming in a major way, and that's the thing they care about. You see the -- again, huge pricing differential in other real estate classes, you don't yet see that in our sector but it's coming."

So it was a free and clear purchase versus a retained interest. But frankly, we're pretty happy about the joint venture with Cindat because it gives us a lot of optionality.

It just -- $1 million is not much money in the scheme of things and yet, it moves the same-store growth rate by 50 basis points. So small accruals, adjustments that simply happen, and they're unpredictable, move that number a lot. So by the same argument, I wouldn't read too much into that other line item this quarter.

But you're absolutely right, we don't want to do a knee-jerk dividend policy reaction what's based on an awesome long-term growth potential for the company. The balance sheet just made a humongous leap forward. Full line of credit available. You can think about all the optionality again that we've been talking about when we talk to the board and say, hey, over the next 3 years, let's look at what the earnings power of the company is. And we think it's very significant. So we concluded that a slight increase was right for next year, and I think it's more important to think about that context and the bigger picture."

But we're also of the opinion that healthcare will be moving much more in a private pay direction.  That in the future, those who can pay for their healthcare will be shouldering a bigger percentage of their healthcare costs. We know that Medicare is quite challenged and not prepared for the aging demographic that we're going to see over the next -- over the coming decades. So we believe that the markets that we're focused in, delivering a product that is a premium product for the upper end of the market who will have no choice as they age other than to seek an alternative residential setting to live productively. So we see this business as not a nice to but a must have. And Rich, we don't know what that world looks like.

I'm pleased that the strong results we announced today reflect solid operating performance across all business segments, as well as strategic capital allocation decisions.

I'm pleased that the strong results we announced today reflect solid operating performance across all business segments, as well as strategic capital allocation decisions. Normalized FFO and FAD were up 4% and 5%, respectively. These excellent results were driven by core growth, same-store NOI was up 2.6% and our track record of making accretive investments. Our Class A health care real estate concentrated in major markets has consistently demonstrated resilience and in a year where wage pressures are challenging operators across the senior care industry, as well as new supply coming into many secondary markets, we are confident in our position and we are raising 2016 same-store NOI guidance to 3% to 3.25%.
Let's take a closer look at our senior housing operating portfolio. Year-to-date, same-store NOI growth in this business has averaged 3.9% relative to our initial guidance of 2% to 3%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, these assets saw a strong occupancy increase of 70 basis points and rental rate growth of 4%. Offsetting these strong top line results has been wage increases, which have been growing at 6% plus year-to-date. Our focus on major markets allows us to pass along much of this expense growth to the consumer. And same-store NOI growth for our operating portfolio resulted in an expected 2.2% increase for the quarter. 
Wage inflation is not unique to the senior care industry. Its impact is being felt across all sectors of health care. This creates particularly unique challenges for government reimbursement focus models that do not have the same ability to pass along increases in operating expenses. This is another reason behind Welltower's strategy of focusing on private pay sectors. You all know the aging demographic wave will positively impact utilization across all sectors of health care. Welltower, however, is capitalizing on this demographic trend by investing in health care assets where commercial forces determine price and where market forces limit supply.
Given that, let me make a few comments regarding our capital allocation strategy and the press releases we issued this morning. The execution of the announced asset sales will have the effect of meaningfully reducing our government pay exposure and significantly lowering our leverage in order to create future capacity and seize opportunities that may result from unpredictable central bank actions and expected interest rate increases. Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet were rewarded this morning by S&P, with an upgrade on our credit rating to BBB+. We are delighted with this news, as I'm sure our bondholders are as well. We are a long-term investor in healthcare real estate and believe that skilled nursing, while historically a more volatile asset class will remain an important component of the health care delivery continuum. 
Given our strategy to increase private pay sources of revenue, we indicated that we would explore interest we were seeing from private real estate buyers looking to establish a position in this sector. We listened to and considered the views of our shareholders and undertook a thoughtful and measured approach. This led to numerous discussions that have resulted in a series of transactions that will take our private pay revenue mix up to 92.4% and long-term post-acute care concentration from 19.9% down to 13.5% of NOI. Combine this with our sector leading balance sheet and you have a stable ship that is positioned to seize external growth opportunities as they arise and drive continued sector leading operating performance. I want to thank our shareholders for their confidence in allowing us to take a patient approach to unlocking significant value for these dispositions.
Welltower takes great pride in the capital partnership we established last year with CPPIB. This partnership not only diversifies our source of funding but also validates healthcare real estate as a true institutional asset class. Today, we welcome our first China-based institutional partner, Cindat, to the Welltower family through our joint venture investment in post-acute long-term care and seniors housing. Cindat's vision and significant interest in the U.S. healthcare real estate sector exemplifies the natural fit between long-term investors seeking returns driven by unmatched demographic trends. We could not be more pleased to be working with these fine partners.
With that, I will pass the mic to Scott Brinker to shed additional light on our operating performance and acquisition and disposition activities. Scott?"

Very happy to tell you about several big steps we've taken to increase our tenant diversification and private pay mix.

Very happy to tell you about several big steps we've taken to increase our tenant diversification and private pay mix. First, in September we closed the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition, highlighting our focus on best-in-class real estate. The acquisition solidifies our #1 market share in Northern and Southern California. Both of these markets have outstanding supply and demand fundamentals.
We chose to bring in 3 existing operating partners: SRG, Sunrise and Silverado, to add their unsurpassed local market expertise. Together, we'll create a lot of value in these communities. And second, this morning we reported a number of dispositions. We've always been an active portfolio manager that includes selling nearly $1 billion of skilled nursing over the past few years. Those efforts continued last quarter as we sold a non-Genesis skilled portfolio in the Southeast for $300 million. We realized $140 million gain on sale and a 13% unlevered IRR. We've also substantially repositioned our relationship with Genesis in a way that is beneficial to both parties.
So far, in the fourth quarter, we've closed on the sale of $1.2 billion of real estate previously leased to Genesis in 2 separate transactions. We've also signed a definitive agreement to contribute a third Genesis portfolio into a joint venture with Cindat and Union Life. Cindat is a China-based institutional investor specializing in overseas real estate, and Union Life is one of the leading insurance companies in China. Together, they will contribute cash for a 75% interest in the venture and Welltower will retain the other 25%.
The joint venture also includes 11 seniors housing properties that we currently lease to Brookdale. Those 11 assets are being contributed at a $45 million gain above our original purchase price for the properties. The joint venture is valued at $930 million, roughly 70% of which represents Genesis assets. This is another example of us bringing first-time cross-border capital into the sector to accomplish our strategic objectives.
These 3 Genesis sales aggregate to $1.7 billion in proceeds to Welltower and have a blended cap rate of 9%. The sale price is $180 million above the price we paid for these assets in 2011 and will realize a mid-9% unlevered IRR. Importantly, our long-term post-acute payment coverage will improve because we're selling properties with low coverage. Genesis credit will improve because the leases with the new buyers have lower rent and escalators that exist today. The terms of our remaining Genesis master lease will not change, including 3% escalators and a 2032 maturity date.
To further strengthen the relationship, we've also signed a letter of understanding that has 2 components: First, Genesis will have the right to buy back certain properties from the Welltower master lease. Second, we'll jointly market the real estate and operations of 14 non-core properties. These 2 transactions should generate $600-plus million of additional proceeds to Welltower in 2017, and further improve our private pay mix and tenant diversification.
Below the headlines, our unique relationship-based business model continues without interruption. We're known for owning high barrier real estate, which is true, but it's the breadth and depth of these relationships that make our strategy so hard to replicate. More than 20 of the leading operators in the sector come to us first when they find an opportunity in their local markets. More and more institutional capital is flowing into the sector, so the ability to get a first look is invaluable. As an example, last quarter we exercised purchase options on 2 recently stabilized senior housing properties developed and operated by a longtime partner for an attractive 7.25% cap rate.
Turning to operating results, we delivered a solid quarter given the environment. Same-store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 2.2%, rental rates were up 4% and occupancy increased 70 basis points over the prior year. This allowed us to offset higher labor costs, which were a headwind as expected. Pricing power is critically important right now and that means owning a lot of real estate in markets like California. It's also important to understand that unlike many other real estate sectors, the new supply in seniors housing is more heavily concentrated in low-barrier markets. In fact, the percentage increase in new supply in our core markets has been less than the remainder of the country in every single year that NIC has tracked the data. To that point, the industry data shows that broad brush commentary about the sector is misleading, and quarter-after-quarter in our own portfolio, we see wide variance by market with clear outperformance from our core markets.
Turning to medical office. We've been allocating capital to this business for the past 10 years. Today, we're one of the largest owners in the sector. We've always liked the outpatient business because of its convenience for customers and its low cost for payers and providers. We self-manage virtually the entire portfolio. Mike Noto and his team are invaluable when underwriting new investments as their market knowledge is unsurpassed. They also do a terrific job creating steady predictable growth. Last quarter, same-store NOI grew 2.5% consistent with prior quarters. That platform is also scalable, evidenced by increased operating margins as we've grown the portfolio.
Moving to triple-net seniors housing. Same-store NOI increased 2.6% and payment coverage continues to move higher through improved operating performance and active portfolio management. The long-term post-acute portfolio had another strong quarter. Same-store NOI increased 3.4%. Payment coverage should improve by roughly 10 basis points upon completion of the 2016 dispositions, creating an even more secure income stream for Welltower.
I want to wrap up by sincerely thanking the Welltower team as well as our operating partners. The past few quarters, in particular, have required trust and perseverance. It was exhausting but also a lot of fun to watch them together rise to the challenge, the true test of a relationship. 
And now here's Scott Estes."

My comments today, focus on the significant balance sheet and portfolio enhancements that are expected as a result of our portfolio repositioning plan announced this morning. Today's announcements are",1178,"All right. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone.  My comments today, focus on the significant balance sheet and portfolio enhancements that are expected as a result of our portfolio repositioning plan announced this morning. Today's announcements are the culmination of the capital allocation plan we've been discussing with all of you throughout 2016, which should importantly provide the following 3 benefits: First, we will significantly strengthen our balance sheet with leveraging credit metrics improving to their strongest levels in the modern history of the company. Second, we'll enhance the quality of our portfolio, increasing our private pay mix and reducing our long-term care exposure. And third, we'll improve our liquidity and financial flexibility in 2017 with our full $3 billion line of credit available, virtually no near-term debt maturities and an expected improvement in our cost of capital.
I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our third quarter financial results, our 2017 dividend payment rate and one addition we made to the supplement this quarter. In terms of third quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.16 per share up 4% versus last year and normalized FAD of $1.04 per share, which increased 5% versus the last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $2.6 billion of net investments completed over the last 4 quarters. The highlight of the quarter was closing the $1.15 billion Vintage portfolio acquisition earlier than anticipated.
G&A of $36.8 million for the quarter came in slightly below our expectations. We recognized the significant $162 million of gains on sale and did have $9.7 million of impairments associated with 3 small asset pools that are held for sale based on current price expectations. I think, otherwise, this is a fairly straightforward quarterly report.
Now moving on to dividends. We will pay our 182nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on November 21 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually and a current dividend yield of 5.1%. Our sizable disposition expectations were a significant consideration as we set our dividend policy for 2017. Based on the strength of our platform and confidence in our longer-term earnings growth potential beyond 2017, we're announcing a 1.2% increase in our 2017 dividend payment rate today that will commence with the February payment. And we also made one notable addition to the supplement this quarter, which is on the bottom of Page 16 where we're now providing the NOI contribution from the 13 core markets that comprise 57% of our RIDEA portfolio.
Now turning to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The most significant capital event this quarter was our decision to opportunistically raise a total of $358 million of equity through a combination of our ATM and DRIP programs, where we issued a total of 4.7 million shares at an average price of $76.98 per share. We also generated $489 million of proceeds through $60 million in loan payoffs and $429 million of property sales, which included the $162 million in gains on sale. And last, we did repay approximately $191 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.4% and we issued or assumed $79 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3.7%. 
However, really, the biggest story today is how we expect to improve our balance sheet upon completion of our portfolio repositioning plan. Importantly, we expect to use approximately $2.8 billion of the $3.3 billion in disposition proceeds expected in the fourth quarter to pay down debt and preferred stock. This will greatly strengthen our balance sheet on a pro forma basis. More specifically, net debt to undepreciated book capitalization will decline by roughly 5 full percentage points to the 34% area. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA will decline to approximately 5.1x and interest and fixed charge coverage will improve to 4.4x and 3.6x, respectively. Most importantly, these balance sheet enhancements should improve our cost of capital, allow us to be entirely self-funding over the near term and provide considerable financial flexibility and optionality for the company over the next several years.
I was also excited that S&P recognized our improving balance sheet strength with their rating increase this morning, which brings Welltower to the BBB+ equivalent rating with all 3 agencies.
I will conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our 2016 guidance does include an additional $314 million of acquisitions and loans at a 7.2% blended yield expected to close in the fourth quarter. We don't normally provide future acquisitions in our guidance, but we're doing so this quarter to allow us to provide the pro forma detail for the expected use of disposition proceeds that's included in our portfolio repositioning press release.
In regard to dispositions, we have increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $4.1 billion from the previous $1.3 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $832 million in proceeds received through the third quarter, plus the remaining $3.3 billion detailed in our portfolio repositioning release. The $3.3 billion is comprised of approximately $1.9 billion of proceeds from long-term care post-acute assets, a $1.2 billion from seniors housing triple-net assets, $51 million from seniors housing operating assets and a $151 million -- excuse me, $150 million in loan repayments.
In terms of our same-store NOI growth, as Tom mentioned, we're increasing the low end of our full-year guidance to a range of 3% to 3.25% from the previous range of 2.75% to 3.25%. And I think while you'll always see some variance from quarter-to-quarter in our same-store results, we think it's increasingly important that everyone focuses on the consistency and stability of our same-store results on an annual basis. I would note that our senior's housing operating portfolio, in particular, has again demonstrated its consistency this year generating meaningful occupancy and RevPAR increases in the face of significant industry supply and expense growth headwinds.
We continue to effectively manage our G&A expenses and now anticipate that we should come in at or slightly below the low end of our original 2016 guidance range of $160 million to $165 million. And with only 1 quarter remaining in 2016, we're revising our 2016 normalized FFO guidance to a range of $4.50 to $4.56 per share, and normalized FAD guidance to a range of $3.99 to $4.05 per share representing 3% and 4% increases, respectively, at the midpoint. The slight reduction in our FFO midpoint is primarily a function of the increase in our disposition guidance, while the FAD increase is primarily a result of lower CapEx than previously projected.
So in conclusion, we look forward to the continued execution of our portfolio repositioning plan and will provide additional detail on asset sales and debt repurchases as they occur over the next several months. Most importantly, our portfolio repositioning efforts will significantly improve the long-term growth profile of our portfolio, while dramatically improving the strength of our balance sheet and financial flexibility heading into 2017.
So with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for some closing comments."

The cap rate that we quoted is based on the in-place rent that exist today under the current master lease divided by the purchase price from the third party, so pretty straightforward. And in terms of the rent adjustment that Genesis received, I mean, our goal all along here was to create a better relationship, stronger relationship between Welltower and Genesis, and to improve Genesis' credit. So I think we were able to come up with pretty creative way to accomplish that in that we agreed with Genesis and the third-party buyers to essentially reduce the rent going forward by about 5% on both portfolios, so that's about $8 million of Year 1 rent. And in exchange for that, Genesis gave us a note with a 4-year term that bears interest at a 10% rate, but a good part of that is payable in kind versus in cash so that they have a sizable cash flow benefit in Year 1 from this transaction, not to mention materially lower increases going forward. So one of the challenges in the Genesis portfolio has been the 3.5% lease escalators for the last 5 years, which George and his team, frankly, have done an amazing job of keeping up with because our payment coverage has been basically flat for 5 years now after the big Medicare cut, but it's tough. I mean, Medicare and Medicaid rates are growing 1-ish percent per year at best, plus the occupancy challenges in the business. It's just -- it's tough to keep up with that kind of an escalator. So in the new leases with the new buyers, they've agreed to 2% or below escalators for the next 15 years so that, over time, there's a meaningful benefit to Genesis."

But that's not because of lack of opportunity, that's because of conscious decisions we've made. And even though we now have a substantial free cash flow on our balance sheet, I don't think our mindset is going to change. There are deals that make a lot of sense with existing partners in our core markets, some of that is in the fourth quarter acquisition guidance that we gave this morning.

And that's why we've said it for years, there's no -- very little differential in cap rate when you look at differences in asset class, building quality and particularly location. Everything is sort of the same. And our view is that that's going to change pretty dramatically. You've seen that in other real estate sectors where there's a huge difference in cap rate, among building in New York, New Jersey, in California or secondary location in middle America. There's no question that healthcare real estate is going to move in that direction in our portfolio, and operating partners are going to benefit from that because the foreign capital is coming in a major way, and that's the thing they care about.

It wasn't easy to finance. That's a lot of money to raise in today's environment, so that was meaningful to us. And the last thing I would point out is that they bought 100% interest. So it was a free and clear purchase versus a retained interest. But frankly, we're pretty happy about the joint venture with Cindat because it gives us a lot of optionality. After 5 years, either party is able to create a liquidity event that we could either take more or exit the portfolio. And we're going in with the expectation that we're going to grow the partnership with Cindat and Union Life, but it's nice to have that optionality. So I think that mix of structures is actually quite beneficial to our shareholders."

So I wouldn't -- we've said this before, including the first quarter when we reported 5.5% NOI growth, and I'll say it again. This quarter, when we generated 2.2% NOI growth, is that 90 days is just too short a period of time to make conclusions about performance of the portfolio or the trend or trajectory. It just -- $1 million is not much money in the scheme of things and yet, it moves the same-store growth rate by 50 basis points. So small accruals, adjustments that simply happen, and they're unpredictable, move that number a lot. So by the same argument, I wouldn't read too much into that other line item this quarter. The fact is operating expenses are driven by labor at 60% or so of the total operating costs, and we've been saying for over a year now that labor costs are the headwind. That's the biggest challenge that our portfolio is facing. And to date, our operators, our properties have done a remarkable job offsetting that cost pressure."
