32215,324695010,936332,"Nordstrom Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We're encouraged that even through this current retail environment, we continue to gain market share. We added roughly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total sales growth of 8%. For the fourth quarter, we had",492,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We're encouraged that even through this current retail environment, we continue to gain market share. We added roughly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total sales growth of 8%. For the fourth quarter, we had a 1% comp increase as we anticipated, which was consistent with our third quarter's increase of 0.9%.
As we look ahead to 2016, we have always considered 2015 to be a peak investment year. That hasn't changed. What has changed is the current environment that we are facing, which requires us to pivot even more as we remain focused on improving profitability. In response, we are making adjustments to reduce expense and capital spending in 2016 and in the coming years.
For 2015, total sales in our full-price business, inclusive of Canada and Trunk Club, increased 5%. And off-price, inclusive of Rack stores and NordstromRack.com and HauteLook, sales increased 14%. 
From a merchandising perspective, we're always pursuing newness in fashion to increase our relevance with customers. For example, we've continued our success with brands like Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury. These brand partnerships have contributed to the strength of our contemporary departments and attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Additionally, we had continued momentum in beauty, which has been among our top-performing categories for the 4 straight year.
Going forward, it is even more important for us to remain focused on the customer as our business continues to evolve. We've made significant investments to enable customers to shop seamlessly across stores and online as well as to grow our business through new markets.
With over $3 billion invested in capital over the last 5 years, we grew our top line by 50%, which was nearly $5 billion. We're also mindful of the importance for these investments to flow through to the bottom line.
While we're on track with our $20 billion sales ambition by 2020, our efforts to serve customers in multiple channels are having an impact to our business model. In response to changes in our business and current conditions, we've started to implement a number of opportunities to improve profitability. From a CapEx perspective, we reduced our plan by $300 million over the next 5 years. From an earnings perspective, our expenses have grown faster than sales to support our multichannel growth. We are taking action to moderate our expense growth over the next several years. Specific to 2016, we have planned expense savings of $100 million relative to our plan to [ph] year ago. This equates to a reduction of $50 million relative to 2015.
We are actively pursuing additional opportunities to improve profitability this year and in the years to come. We view this fluid an interim process as we stay focused on the customer and proactively ensure resources are aligned with the customer expectations.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide more details on these changes with respect to our financial outlook."

We finished the year with our results in line with our expectations. Clearly, this was a difficult period, with industry sales declines and increased promotional activity resulting in compressed merchandise margins. As stated last quarter, we responded quickly and decisively to these trends with respect to inventory levels.
While we believe our inventory is current, we continue to monitor trends and make the appropriate adjustments to assure we remain price competitive and have the best product available for our customers.
On the expense side, overall operations were well managed, resulting in improved SG&A rate for the fourth quarter relative to our expectations.
Now I'd like to provide perspective on how we see our business evolving given current business conditions, our investment cycle and commitment to delivering top quartile shareholder returns. In evolving with our customers, we've made significant investments to enable customers to shop in multiple ways. This has resulted in market share gains, but also structural changes to our operating costs.  
For example, e-commerce now represents over 20% of our sales, a notable increase from 8% 5 years ago. This business model has a high variable cost structure driven by fulfillment and marketing costs, in addition to ongoing technology investments. With our increased investments to gain market share, along with the changing business model, expenses in recent years have grown faster than sales. As Blake mentioned, we are pursuing the following opportunities with focused efforts on increasing efficiency and lowering costs.
In technology, we are planning productivity improvements by focusing on fewer, more meaningful projects, such as a scalable merchandising solution that supports seamless integration across multiple channels. In addition, we are accelerating our efforts to re-platform our architecture to streamline development while reducing costs.
In fulfillment, we are assessing ways to improve efficiencies around delivering product to customers, which is expected to generate lower shipping costs. We are also refining our online assortments with a focus on unit profitability.
In marketing, we are focusing on improving our effectiveness across all channels. Consistent with our fulfillment efforts, we are measuring enterprise profitability of our total marketing spend. These and other initiatives are multiyear in nature. While we have successfully gained market share, we are also committed to growing profitability. With our investments moderating, we view 2016 as an inflection point of earnings growth improvement. We are focused on reshaping our business model and continuing that effort over the next several years to achieve our previously stated goal of mid-teens return on invested capital. As part of our regular communications, we'll keep you posted on our progress.
Moving to our capital investments. Our 5-year CapEx plan of $4 billion or 5% of sales represents a $300 million reduction in store investments relative to last year's plan. In 2016, we expect CapEx to be roughly $900 million, with 1/3 allocated to Canada and Manhattan. Technology and fulfillment, which represents another third, is planned flat to last year, a considerable production from the 35% annualized growth over the last 5 years.
Our investments in HauteLook, Canada and Trunk Club are beginning to pay off with over $400 million added to our top line growth in 2015. The dilutive impact of these growth initiatives has peaked in 2015, with expected EBIT improvement beginning in 2016.
In addition, our loyalty program is an enabler of growth to help increase our engagement with customers and attract new customers. With rewards members representing 40% of our sales volume, we look forward to expanding our program with a tender neutral offer in the second quarter.
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2016 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.10 to $3.35 assumes total sales growth of 3.5% to 5.5% and comps of flat to a 2% increase. Based on current trends, we remain cautious and have considered the impact of a continued promotional environment.
In the first half of the year, EPS is planned to decrease by roughly 30% due to the following: The impact of the sale of credit receivables; the impact of growth initiatives, including our third fulfillment center, which opened last August and new store pre-opening costs; and the shift of our anniversary event, which will span the second and third quarters in 2016.
In terms of our credit business, while we expect an initial reduction in EBIT from our revenue share reprogram with TD, we anticipate meaningful opportunities to increase earnings over time. Excluding the impact of the credit business, we expect improvement in retail EBIT growth, driven by the maturing of our growth investments in the operational improvements previously mentioned.
In closing, we continue to believe that we have the right strategies in place to profitably grow our business and successfully serve our current and future customers the Nordstrom way.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

I guess, what I'd say about it for us, the promotional and clearance activity drives some sales but not enough to make up for the reduced AUR. So that's where we had a lot of compression and then also what it does to our margin. So it's not a good situation for us. I mean, there maybe other retailers that really benefit from a lot of promotional activity that drive sales in disproportion always. So we spent a lot of time trying to be transparent in collaborating with vendors talking about our desire to have newness really be the component that drives our sales and not the promotional activity. I think we worked to identify vendors that operate cleaner businesses. It's a difficult balancing act because you want to make sure that you bring the things that customers want, to have things just uniquely our exclusive for exclusive the sake. That doesn't work either bigger there are some areas that help mitigate some of the pressure. For example, our own label product, what we call Nordstrom product group, it's to grow part of our business. We had a really good year with Nordstrom product group, and I think that's the way we can control and does sell a bit more we go forward. And I think [indiscernible] say ultimately on our ability to keep our inventories in line with our sales trends is going to be the biggest factor in terms of managing markdowns and well. We've missed sales by a little bit the last couple of months. We're in pretty decent shape, and we're going to be disciplined this year about keeping those inventories down."

When business is bad, it accelerates that clearance part of it. But the part that we're talking about is promotional activity where a retailer will take everything that's on -- they had to offer. Something that's a week old in the inventory and something that's 8 weeks old inventory mark everything down. And that's what really erodes the margins. For us, we don't generate any of those events ourselves, but we have to be competitive for price. So if it's a price that's available for the customer and for all customers to maintain integrity and trust and confidence of our customers, we're going to match that price. So that's what puts the pressure on us in terms of and promotional activity. We don't have any more promotional activities in terms of clearance days or events, no more planned that than ever. I think we're probably packing that up even a little bit from this last year. So I'm not sure that answers your question.

Our designer and handbag are pretty good even through some very challenging times. Apparels had a little bit of pressure, but I think there's a lot of things for us to be excited about. And that translates I think to excitement for our customers. So I think that's an excuse, you won't find us using. It's just a continuous matter of us trying to keep the focus on new product falling in. It's going to ebb and flow a little bit but as long as we can keep our inventories in line a don't think it's good to be a perfect problem. The Rack on the other hand, they benefit a lot of ways from some tough business out there because it means there's an excess of potentially really good product that we could get at great prices. And because we've got these great relationships with vendors, we can pass the savings along to customers. So I think that the difficult part is when you take -- when retailers or vendors take a price promotion on everything that they sell, they just -- they lessened the desirability of a product of why people pay price for. I think that's going to be an insidious part of what happens year maybe The Street the really good long-term decisions for health of the brand or even the trend. So that's something that we can't entirely control but. Obviously, we talked to vendors a lot about. I think one advantage that Nordstrom has people recognize out there, vendors recognize out there that we do run a good full-price business that does motivate our customers, and I think ultimately they like doing business with us because of that."

I think one of our slides indicated by the end of this decade that we're going to have a large proportion of our business, about 30% being done online. That's all the way from 5% than it was back in 2005. And that is a model that behaves enormously different than the mall-based model. And so we have a lot to learn about that, and we have to keep our lens on as it relates to how the customer sees us and how the customer wants to be served but at the same time, we have to do it effectively. And so that would be the theme and that will be the theme that we'll be sharing with you as we go forward."

The Rack brick-and-mortar part, the comp improved as the quarter -- the fourth quarter went on, the year went on. But no question, the first half or the first 3 quarters of the year, they were obviously running below our plans. And we shared with you both the full-price and off-price multichannel numbers, and that's something we've been talking about at least from a full-price point of view for a couple of years. Because most importantly, that's how the customer views the business and that's the how the customer shops. So we're trying to be clear about what that store businesses and what the online off-price businesses as well. We really look at it as an off-price multichannel business. And so for the year in the multichannel, I mentioned that was up 14% from a comp point of view, that's 4.3 for the quarter. Multichannel up price was up 12 and comp was up 3.6. So when we look at it in that regard, we're definitely gaining market share from our capacitors. The new Rack growth, which is the second part of your question, continues to be highly productive stores with terrific returns for our shareholders' investment. And so we feel good about this juncture, that 300 store commitment roughly that we talked about by the year 2020. Those lead times are short, so we can react to that quickly. We have 24 stores I believe slated to open in 2016. And again, we feel good about the off-price part of our business and the full-price part of it. And so we think there's a good balance between the full-price and off-price, and we're continuing nearing with that Rack growth."

One is having a scalable inventory management tool that can support as well past $20 billion and can support multichannel. And the second is to rearchitect how we think about our technology. So as we want to add new features and new applications, can do it the efficiently and cost-effectively. And we think over the long run, that's going to have big payback.

So we have some fairly big brands that had some pretty sizable decreases over the last year. I mean, the good news is we've got some new brands coming up that we think can fill that void. I mean, I think one of the messages we were able to send to market this past week is we have open to buy even though business looks pretty difficult because we are looking to replace some of these brands that are -- when we're troubled some of the promotional activity in the sales aren't get. So good news, I think of I attract a lot of people. Maybe the best examples that we have that other people don't. So Madewell, for example, J.Crew brand, is not available. It's something they sell themselves because they sell to was because they like the way they do our business, they like our customer and its been really effective. And you get insulated from some of these issues because it's not available in a lot of stores that are more promotional in nature. Topshop's been a version of that. Brandy Melville is a brand that's done really well for us. So there's good examples out there. And some of the things you talked about, some of more leading edge things around that and bury business. We're proud of our team in their ability to get the forging ahead ultimately our ability to give successful going forward is not by repeating and refining last year, but to try to find new things out there to buy and new things the kind stimulate customers interest. And that's really the -- our inspiration and our process going forward this year. And then you asked about the marketing campaign, and that was a little bit of a new deal that -- a new campaign for spring that Olivia Kim helped create for us. And It's interesting. It's cool. Probably the best thing about it is it just reflects an optimism and kind of cheerfulness, which really should be what our business is are about when you come into spring, when there's a lot of stuff going on out there that maybe isn't super cheerful and bright. But I mean, our job is to make shopping fun for customers and I think that's what that campaign really reflects. And so for at least the anecdotal evidence is customers really like that."

Traditionally, we run our own Nordstrom product group in our way with a very persisted percentage. As we've done more designer business in the last 15 years or so, it came down a little bit because that's the place we just don't participate and also with beauty to talk about. So if those 2 areas are big growth vehicles for us, at some place we don't principate with our own label product. But with the, for example, percent by business, have what we call it and what is apparel, which has a large component of our own label and that's been growing well. It's a little over 10% of our business. It's not going to change dramatically from that but can we do some more? Yes. We can do some more, and we pretty much been doing it not as an entitlement program where SPJs going to be a certain percent of the business, it has to grow because organically it belongs and customers have responded well to it. So the good news id customers have responded well to it. We've got some good momentum in a lot of places. I mean, we've had like a kid's brand like Tucker and Tate were just in 3 years. I think they're doing [indiscernible] $50 million in there. So I think that's a good business for us and it's a good business. So we -- there's a lot of confidence and a lot of great results that were towards. So yes, we think we can grow it in modest ways in the next few years. Related to beauty, that's it. That's a really interesting business. And the thing is probably best about it is for customers kind of enter Nordstrom through it and the most amounts of trips come to the beauty business. It tends to attract newer, younger customers as well. And so when that business is healthy, it really helps the acquisition part of what we're doing. It helps the traffic in the stores. So I think what we continue to focus on there is making sure that we keep moving forward. And because we've been pretty successful there, we do attract a lot of interesting opportunities. And I think one of the things that's particularly good about that business is the diversity where it's coming from, because it's coming really all different price points the design and luxury part of the business is really strong well the new things we've introduced the strong, the different categories, we've got a good thing there.

We're encouraged that even through this current retail environment, we continue to gain market share. We added roughly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total sales growth of 8%.

We added roughly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total sales growth of 8%. For the fourth quarter, we had a 1% comp increase as we anticipated, which was consistent with our third quarter's increase of 0.9%.
As we look ahead to 2016, we have always considered 2015 to be a peak investment year. That hasn't changed. What has changed is the current environment that we are facing, which requires us to pivot even more as we remain focused on improving profitability. In response, we are making adjustments to reduce expense and capital spending in 2016 and in the coming years.
For 2015, total sales in our full-price business, inclusive of Canada and Trunk Club, increased 5%. In off-price, inclusive of Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, sales increased 14%. 
From a merchandising perspective, we're always pursuing newness in fashion to increase our relevance with customers. For example, we continued our success with brands like Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury. These brand partnerships have contributed to the strength of our contemporary departments and attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Additionally, we had continued momentum in beauty, which has been among our top-performing categories for the fourth straight year.
Going forward, it is even more important for us to remain focused on the customer as our business continues to evolve. We've made significant investments to enable customers to shop seamlessly across stores and online as well as to grow our business through new markets. With over $3 billion invested in capital over the last 5 years, we grew our top line by 50%, which was nearly $5 billion. We're also mindful of the importance for these investments to flow through to the bottom line.
While we're on track with our $20 billion sales ambition by 2020, our efforts to serve customers in multiple channels are having an impact to our business model. In response to changes in our business and current conditions, we've started to implement a number of opportunities to improve profitability. From a CapEx perspective, we reduced our plan by $300 million over the next 5 years. From an earnings perspective, our expenses have grown faster than sales to support our multichannel growth. We are taking action to moderate our expense growth over the next several years. Specific to 2016, we have planned expense savings of $100 million relative to our plans a year ago. This equates to a reduction of $50 million relative to 2015.
We are actively pursuing additional opportunities to improve profitability this year and in the years to come. We view this as fluid and iterative process as we stay focused on the customer and proactively ensure resources are aligned with customer expectations.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide more details on these changes with respect to our financial outlook."

We finished the year with our results in line with our expectations. Clearly, this was a difficult period, with industry sales declines and increased promotional activity resulting in compressed merchandise margins. As stated last quarter, we responded quickly and decisively to these trends with respect to inventory levels.
While we believe our inventory is current, we continue to monitor trends and make the appropriate adjustments to assure we remain price-competitive and have the best product available for our customers.
On the expense side, overall operations were well managed, resulting in an improved SG&A rate for the fourth quarter relative to our expectations.
Now I'd like to provide perspective on how we see our business evolving given current business conditions, our investment cycle and commitment to delivering top-quartile shareholder returns. In evolving with our customers, we've made significant investments to enable customers to shop in multiple ways. This has resulted in market share gains but also structural changes to our operating costs.  
For example, e-commerce now represents over 20% of our sales, a notable increase from 8% 5 years ago. This business model has a high variable cost structure, driven by fulfillment and marketing costs in addition to ongoing technology investments. With our increased investments to gain market share, along with the changing business model, expenses in recent years have grown faster than sales. As Blake mentioned, we are pursuing the following opportunities with focused efforts on increasing efficiency and lowering costs.
In technology, we are planning productivity improvements by focusing on fewer, more meaningful projects, such as a scalable merchandising solution that supports seamless integration across multiple channels. In addition, we are accelerating our efforts to re-platform our architecture to streamline development while reducing costs.
In fulfillment, we are assessing ways to improve efficiencies around delivering product to customers, which is expected to generate lower shipping costs. We are also refining our online assortments with a focus on unit profitability.
In marketing, we are focusing on improving our effectiveness across all channels. Consistent with our fulfillment efforts, we are measuring enterprise profitability of our total marketing spend. These and other initiatives are multiyear in nature. While we have successfully gained market share, we are also committed to growing profitability. With our investments moderating, we view 2016 as an inflection point of earnings growth improvement. We are focused on reshaping our business model and continuing that effort over the next several years to achieve our previously stated goal of mid-teens return on invested capital. As part of our regular communications, we'll keep you posted on our progress.
Moving to our capital investments. Our 5-year CapEx plan of $4 billion or 5% of sales represents a $300 million reduction in store investments relative to last year's plan. In 2016, we expect CapEx to be roughly $900 million, with 1/3 allocated to Canada and Manhattan. Technology and fulfillment, which represents another 1/3, is planned flat to last year, a considerable reduction from the 35% annualized growth over the last 5 years.
Our investments in HauteLook, Canada and Trunk Club are beginning to pay off with over $400 million added to our top line growth in 2015. The dilutive impact of these growth initiatives has peaked in 2015, with expected EBIT improvement beginning in 2016.
In addition, our loyalty program is an enabler of growth to help increase our engagement with customers and attract new customers. With Rewards members representing 40% of our sales volume, we look forward to expanding our program with a tender-neutral offer in the second quarter.
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2016 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.10 to $3.35 assumes total sales growth of 3.5% to 5.5% and comps of flat to a 2% increase. Based on current trends, we remain cautious and have considered the impact of a continued promotional environment.
In the first half of the year, EPS is planned to decrease by roughly 30% due to the following: the impact of the sale of credit receivables; the impact of growth initiatives, including our third fulfillment center, which opened last August, and new store pre-opening costs; and the shift of our anniversary event, which will span the second and third quarters in 2016.
In terms of our credit business, while we expect an initial reduction in EBIT from our revenue-sharing program with TD, we anticipate meaningful opportunities to increase earnings over time. Excluding the impact of the credit business, we expect improvement in retail EBIT growth, driven by the maturing of our growth investments and the operational improvements previously mentioned.
In closing, we continue to believe that we have the right strategies in place to profitably grow our business and successfully serve our current and future customers the Nordstrom way.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

So that's where we had a lot of compression and then also what it does to our margin. So it's not a good situation for us. I mean, there may be other retailers that really benefit from a lot of promotional activity that drive sales in disproportionate ways. So we spent a lot of time trying to be transparent, collaborating with vendors, talking about our desire to have newness, really be the component that drives our sales and not the promotional activity. I think we worked to identify vendors that operate cleaner businesses. It's a difficult balancing act because you want to make sure that you're bringing the things that customers want, too. I mean, to have things just uniquely or exclusive for exclusive's sake, that doesn't work either. There are some areas that help mitigate some of the pressure. For example, our own label product, what we call Nordstrom product group. It's a growing part of our business. We had a really good year with Nordstrom product group, and I think that's the way we can control our own destiny a little bit more as we go forward. And then I guess lastly, what I would say is ultimately, our ability to keep our inventories in line with the sales trends is going to be the biggest factor in terms of managing markdowns. And while we've missed sales by a little bit the last couple of months, we're in pretty decent shape, and we're going to be disciplined this year about keeping those inventories down."

But the part that we're talking about is promotional activity, where a retailer will take everything that's -- they have to offer, something that's a week old in the inventory and something that's 8 weeks old in the inventory, mark everything down. And that's what really erodes the margins. For us, we don't generate any of those events ourselves, but we have to be competitive for price. So if it's a price that's available for the customer and for all customers to maintain integrity and trust and confidence of our customers, we're going to match that price. So that's what puts the pressure on us in terms of our promotional activity. We don't have any more promotional activity in terms of clearance days or events, no more planned than ever. Actually, I think we're probably packing that up even a little bit from this last year. I'm not sure if that answers your question, but philosophically, not much has changed in terms of what we've been doing for the last several years."

One of the nice things about our industry, there's always this internal optimism about new things coming out there and people excited to get it in front of customers. And there's evidence all through our business of pockets where business is really good because there's new things that have come in and done well. I mean, your comment about designer being off, that's actually not true for us. Our designer shoe and handbag business has been pretty good, even through some very challenging times. Apparels had a little bit of pressure, but there's -- I think there's a lot of things for us to be excited about, and that translates, I think, to excitement for our customers. So I think that's an excuse you won't find us using. It's just a -- it's a continuous matter of us trying to keep the focus on new product flowing in here. And it's going to ebb and flow a little bit, but as long as we can keep our inventories in line, I don't think it's going to be a big problem. The Rack, on the other hand, they benefit a lot of ways from some tough business out there because it means there's an excess of potentially really good product that we could get at great prices. And because we've got these great relationships with vendors, we can pass the savings along to customers. So I think that the difficult part is when you take -- I mean, when retailers or vendors take a price promotion on everything that they sell, they just -- they lessen the desirability of a product because why pay full price for. And I think that's going to be an insidious part of what happens here, and it maybe doesn't lead to good long-term decisions for the health of a brand or even a trend. So that's something that we can't entirely control, but obviously, we talk to the vendors a lot about -- and I think one of the advantages that Nordstrom has people recognize out there, vendors recognize out there, that we do run a good full-price business. It does motivate our customers, and I think ultimately, they like doing business with us because of that."

And I'm not going to get into a lot of detail there, but suffice it to say, over the last several years, we've clearly been investing aggressively to grow our business. We've grown our business successfully. It's a new channel that is being built out that is still in the relatively early stages of its process, and I think we've reached an inflection point where, after growing it to the level we have, that we're spending a little bit more time focused on then how to turn a lot of that growth into some more profit. And I would say that that is the common theme that you're going to hear from us as we talk about reductions without getting into anything overly specific. But clearly, we're seeing a -- what has been a very noticeable change in our business model. I think one of our slides indicated, by the end of this decade, that we're going to have a large proportion of our business, about 30%, being done online. That's all the way from 5% that it was back in 2005. And that is a model that behaves enormously different than the mall-based model. And so we have a lot to learn about that and we have to keep our lens on as it relates to how the customer sees us and how the customer wants to be served, but at the same time, we have to do it effectively. And so that would be the theme, and that will be the theme that we'll be sharing with you as we go forward."

The Rack brick-and-mortar part of it comp improved as the quarter -- the fourth quarter went on, the year went on. But no question, the first half or the first 3 quarters of the year, they were obviously running below our plans. And we shared with you both the full-price and off-price multichannel numbers, and that's something we've been talking about, at least from a full-price point of view, for a couple of years because most importantly, that's how the customer views the business, and that's how the customer shops. So we're trying to be clear about what that store business is and what the online off-price business is as well. But we really look at it as an off-price multichannel business. And so for the year, in the multichannel, I mentioned that was up 14% from a comp point of view. That's 4.3% for the quarter. Multichannel price was up 12%, and comp was up 3.6%. So when we look at it in that regard, we're definitely gaining market share from our competitors. The new Rack growth, which is the second part of your question, continues to be highly productive stores with terrific returns for our shareholders' investment. And so we feel good about this juncture, that 300 store commitment roughly that we've talked about by the year 2020. Those lead times are short, so we can react to that quickly. We have 24 stores, I believe, slated to open in 2016. And again, we feel good about the off-price part of our business and the full-price part of it. And so we think there's a good balance between the full-price and off-price, and we're continuing with that Rack growth."

And we highlighted a couple of things that we believe, long term, are going to generate a lot of value. One is having a scalable inventory management tool that can support us well past $20 billion and can support multichannel, and the second is to re-architect how we think about our technology. So as we want to add new features and new applications, we can do it very efficiently and cost-effectively. And we think over the long run, that's going to have big payback. In terms of the returns of the past, we've had some projects that have delivered some great returns and some that haven't. That, by the way, is part of the business.

And you can bring new brands in. That's great. That has its own risks. And brands don't grow to be really huge businesses overnight. It takes a lot of time to get it there. And so we have some fairly big brands that have had some pretty sizable decreases over the last year. I mean, the good news is we've got some new brands coming up that we think can fill that void. I mean, I think one of the messages we were able to send to market this last week is we have open to buy even though business has been pretty difficult because we're looking to replace some of these brands that are a little more troubled by some of that promotional activity and their sales aren't as good. So good news is that I think we I attract a lot of people interested in doing business with you. Maybe the best example of that as you look at some brands that we have that other people don't, so Madewell, for example. J.Crew brand, it's not available as a retailer. It's something they sell themselves, but they sell to us because they like the way we do business. They like our customer, and it's been really effective. And you get insulated from some of these issues because it's not available at a lot of stores that are a little more promotional in nature. Topshop has been a version of that. Brandy Melville is a brand that's done really well for us. So there's good examples out there and some of the stuff you talked about, some of the more leading-edge things around that contemporary business. We're proud of our team and their ability to kind of keep forging ahead. Ultimately, our ability to be successful, going forward, is not by repeating and refining last year but to try to find new things out there to buy and new things to do that will kind of stimulate customers' interest. And that's really the -- our inspiration, our process going forward this year. And then you asked about the marketing campaign, and that was a little bit of a new deal that this -- a new campaign for spring that Olivia Kim helped create for us. And it's interesting. It's cool. I think probably the best thing about it is just it reflects an optimism and kind of a cheerfulness, which really should be what our business is about, particularly as you come into spring. I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on out there that maybe isn't super cheerful and bright. But I mean, our job is to make shopping fun for customers, and I think that's what that campaign really reflects. And so far, at least the anecdotal evidence is customers really like that."

The second thing is -- and it's been a phenomena over the last couple of years is with the amount of stores that we've been opening, we have chain new stores opening in Canada. We have a number of Rack stores opening. We have a fair amount of pre-opening that sits in the spring that we don't get a lot of sales benefit from, and then it kicks into the back half of the year.

That creates not only additional labor costs, but it creates additional shipping costs because you're shipping multiple items per an order. We're also looking at how spread out we want our assortment to be because the more lower-priced items we have in it, the less unit profitability we gain. And so we're looking at a number of different things, but I think it all goes back to the rapid acceleration of the business and us continuing to feed that business and gain market share.

So in -- if those 2 areas are big growth vehicles for us, at some place, we don't participate with our own label product. But we do, for example, which we haven't talked about yet, but the young customer segment of our business kind of how -- what we call women's apparel, which has a large component of our own label, and that's been growing well. It's a little over 10% of our business. It's not going to change dramatically from that. But I mean, can we do some more? Yes. We can do some more, and we've pretty much been doing it not as an entitlement program where NPG is going to be a certain percent of the business. It has to grow because organically it belongs and customers have responded well to it. So the good news is customers have responded well to it. We've got some good momentum in a lot of places. I mean, we have like a kid's brand like Tucker + Tate, which just in 3 years, I think it has -- we're doing -- probably doing $50 million in there. So now it is a big business for us, and it's a good business. And so we -- there's a lot of confidence and a lot of great results there to work towards. So yes, we think we can grow it in modest ways in the next few years. Related to beauty, that's a really interesting business. And the thing that's probably best about it it's where most customers kind of enter Nordstrom through it. It has the most amount of trips come through the beauty business. It tends to attract newer, younger customers as well. And so when that business is healthy, it really helps the acquisition part of what we're doing. It helps the traffic in the stores. So I think what we continue to focus on there is making sure that we keep moving forward. And because we've been pretty successful there, we do attract a lot of interesting opportunities. And I think one of the things that's particularly good about that business is the diversity where the success is coming from because it's coming really all different price points. I mean, the Designer and Luxury part of that business is really strong. A lot of the new things we've introduced are strong, the different categories. We've got a good team there.

32215,324695010,936566,"Nordstrom Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We're encouraged that even through this current retail environment, we continue to gain market share. We added roughly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total sales growth of 8%. For the fourth quarter, we had",491,"Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We're encouraged that even through this current retail environment, we continue to gain market share. We added roughly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total sales growth of 8%. For the fourth quarter, we had a 1% comp increase as we anticipated, which was consistent with our third quarter's increase of 0.9%.
As we look ahead to 2016, we have always considered 2015 to be a peak investment year. That hasn't changed. What has changed is the current environment that we are facing, which requires us to pivot even more as we remain focused on improving profitability. In response, we are making adjustments to reduce expense and capital spending in 2016 and in the coming years.
For 2015, total sales in our full-price business, inclusive of Canada and Trunk Club, increased 5%. In off-price, inclusive of Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, sales increased 14%. 
From a merchandising perspective, we're always pursuing newness in fashion to increase our relevance with customers. For example, we continued our success with brands like Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury. These brand partnerships have contributed to the strength of our contemporary departments and attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Additionally, we had continued momentum in beauty, which has been among our top-performing categories for the fourth straight year.
Going forward, it is even more important for us to remain focused on the customer as our business continues to evolve. We've made significant investments to enable customers to shop seamlessly across stores and online as well as to grow our business through new markets. With over $3 billion invested in capital over the last 5 years, we grew our top line by 50%, which was nearly $5 billion. We're also mindful of the importance for these investments to flow through to the bottom line.
While we're on track with our $20 billion sales ambition by 2020, our efforts to serve customers in multiple channels are having an impact to our business model. In response to changes in our business and current conditions, we've started to implement a number of opportunities to improve profitability. From a CapEx perspective, we reduced our plan by $300 million over the next 5 years. From an earnings perspective, our expenses have grown faster than sales to support our multichannel growth. We are taking action to moderate our expense growth over the next several years. Specific to 2016, we have planned expense savings of $100 million relative to our plans a year ago. This equates to a reduction of $50 million relative to 2015.
We are actively pursuing additional opportunities to improve profitability this year and in the years to come. We view this as fluid and iterative process as we stay focused on the customer and proactively ensure resources are aligned with customer expectations.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide more details on these changes with respect to our financial outlook."

We finished the year with our results in line with our expectations. Clearly, this was a difficult period, with industry sales declines and increased promotional activity resulting in compressed merchandise margins. As stated last quarter, we responded quickly and decisively to these trends with respect to inventory levels.
While we believe our inventory is current, we continue to monitor trends and make the appropriate adjustments to assure we remain price-competitive and have the best product available for our customers.
On the expense side, overall operations were well managed, resulting in an improved SG&A rate for the fourth quarter relative to our expectations.
Now I'd like to provide perspective on how we see our business evolving given current business conditions, our investment cycle and commitment to delivering top-quartile shareholder returns. In evolving with our customers, we've made significant investments to enable customers to shop in multiple ways. This has resulted in market share gains but also structural changes to our operating costs.  
For example, e-commerce now represents over 20% of our sales, a notable increase from 8% 5 years ago. This business model has a high variable cost structure, driven by fulfillment and marketing costs in addition to ongoing technology investments. With our increased investments to gain market share, along with the changing business model, expenses in recent years have grown faster than sales. As Blake mentioned, we are pursuing the following opportunities with focused efforts on increasing efficiency and lowering costs.
In technology, we are planning productivity improvements by focusing on fewer, more meaningful projects, such as a scalable merchandising solution that supports seamless integration across multiple channels. In addition, we are accelerating our efforts to re-platform our architecture to streamline development while reducing costs.
In fulfillment, we are assessing ways to improve efficiencies around delivering product to customers, which is expected to generate lower shipping costs. We are also refining our online assortments with a focus on unit profitability.
In marketing, we are focusing on improving our effectiveness across all channels. Consistent with our fulfillment efforts, we are measuring enterprise profitability of our total marketing spend. These and other initiatives are multiyear in nature. While we have successfully gained market share, we are also committed to growing profitability. With our investments moderating, we view 2016 as an inflection point of earnings growth improvement. We are focused on reshaping our business model and continuing that effort over the next several years to achieve our previously stated goal of mid-teens return on invested capital. As part of our regular communications, we'll keep you posted on our progress.
Moving to our capital investments. Our 5-year CapEx plan of $4 billion or 5% of sales represents a $300 million reduction in store investments relative to last year's plan. In 2016, we expect CapEx to be roughly $900 million, with 1/3 allocated to Canada and Manhattan. Technology and fulfillment, which represents another 1/3, is planned flat to last year, a considerable reduction from the 35% annualized growth over the last 5 years.
Our investments in HauteLook, Canada and Trunk Club are beginning to pay off with over $400 million added to our top line growth in 2015. The dilutive impact of these growth initiatives has peaked in 2015, with expected EBIT improvement beginning in 2016.
In addition, our loyalty program is an enabler of growth to help increase our engagement with customers and attract new customers. With Rewards members representing 40% of our sales volume, we look forward to expanding our program with a tender-neutral offer in the second quarter.
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2016 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.10 to $3.35 assumes total sales growth of 3.5% to 5.5% and comps of flat to a 2% increase. Based on current trends, we remain cautious and have considered the impact of a continued promotional environment.
In the first half of the year, EPS is planned to decrease by roughly 30% due to the following: the impact of the sale of credit receivables; the impact of growth initiatives, including our third fulfillment center, which opened last August, and new store pre-opening costs; and the shift of our anniversary event, which will span the second and third quarters in 2016.
In terms of our credit business, while we expect an initial reduction in EBIT from our revenue-sharing program with TD, we anticipate meaningful opportunities to increase earnings over time. Excluding the impact of the credit business, we expect improvement in retail EBIT growth, driven by the maturing of our growth investments and the operational improvements previously mentioned.
In closing, we continue to believe that we have the right strategies in place to profitably grow our business and successfully serve our current and future customers the Nordstrom way.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

So we felt like we would -- responded appropriately to keep those inventories in line. Now clearly, it's still a little tenuous out there, and we're keeping a very close eye on it. But the aging is in a good place, and the levels relative to the investments we're making and our growth initiatives are in the right place as well. In terms of pricing, I'll let Pete take that."

I guess what I'd say about it, for us, the promotional and clearance activity drives some sales but not enough to make up for the reduced AUR. So that's where we had a lot of compression and then also what it does to our margin. So it's not a good situation for us. I mean, there may be other retailers that really benefit from a lot of promotional activity that drive sales in disproportionate ways. So we spent a lot of time trying to be transparent, collaborating with vendors, talking about our desire to have newness really be the component that drives our sales and not the promotional activity. I think we work to identify vendors that operate cleaner businesses. It's a difficult balancing act because you want to make sure that you're bringing the things that customers want, too. I mean, to have things just uniquely or exclusive for exclusive's sake, that doesn't work either. There are some areas that help mitigate some of the pressure. For example, our own label product, what we call Nordstrom product group. It's a growing part of our business. We had a really good year with Nordstrom product group, and I think that's the way we can control our own destiny a little bit more as we go forward. And then I guess lastly, what I would say is ultimately, our ability to keep our inventories in line with the sales trends is going to be the biggest factor in terms of managing markdowns. And while we've missed sales by a little bit the last couple of months, we're in pretty decent shape, and we're going to be disciplined this year about keeping those inventories down."

But the part that we're talking about is promotional activity, where a retailer will take everything that's -- they have to offer, something that's a week old in the inventory and something that's 8 weeks old in the inventory, mark everything down. And that's what really erodes the margins. For us, we don't generate any of those events ourselves, but we have to be competitive for price. So if it's a price that's available for the customer and for all customers to maintain integrity and trust and confidence of our customers, we're going to match that price. So that's what puts the pressure on us in terms of our promotional activity. We don't have any more promotional activity in terms of clearance days or events, no more planned than ever. Actually, I think we're probably tightening that up even a little bit from this last year. I'm not sure if that answers your question, but philosophically, not much has changed in terms of what we've been doing for the last several years."

One of the nice things about our industry, there's always this internal optimism about new things coming out there and people excited to get it in front of customers. And there's evidence all through our business of pockets where business is really good because there's new things that have come in and done well. I mean, your comment about designer being off, that's actually not true for us. But our designer shoe and handbag business has been pretty good, even through some very challenging times. Apparel's had a little bit of pressure, but there's -- I think there's a lot of things for us to be excited about, and that translates, I think, to excitement for our customers. So I think that's an excuse you won't find us using. It's just a -- it's a continuous matter of us trying to keep the focus on new product flowing in here. And it's going to ebb and flow a little bit, but as long as we can keep our inventories in line, I don't think it's going to be a big problem. The Rack, on the other hand, they benefit in a lot of ways from some tough business out there because it means there's an excess of potentially really good product that we could get at great prices. And because we've got these great relationships with vendors, we can pass the savings along to customers. So I think that the difficult part is when you take -- when retailers or vendors take a price promotion on everything that they sell, they just -- they lessen the desirability of a product because why pay full price for it. And I think that's going to be an insidious part of what happens here, and it maybe doesn't lead to good long-term decisions for the health of a brand or even a trend. So that's something that we can't entirely control, but obviously, we talk to the vendors a lot about -- and I think one of the advantages that Nordstrom has people recognize out there, vendors recognize out there, that we do run a good full-price business. It does motivate our customers, and I think ultimately, they like doing business with us because of that."

And I'm not going to get into a lot of detail there, but suffice it to say, over the last several years, we've clearly been investing aggressively to grow a business. We've grown our business successfully. It's a new channel that is being built out that is still in the relatively early stages of its process, and I think we've reached an inflection point where, after growing it to the level we have, that we're spending a little bit more time focused on then how to turn a lot of that growth into some more profit. And I would say that that is the common theme that you're going to hear from us as we talk about reductions without getting into anything overly specific. But clearly, we're seeing a -- what has been a very noticeable change in our business model. I think one of our slides indicated, by the end of this decade, that we're going to have a large proportion of our business, about 30%, being done online. That's all the way from 5% that it was back in 2005. And that is a model that behaves enormously different than the mall-based model. And so we have a lot to learn about that and we have to keep our lens on as it relates to how the customer sees us and how the customer wants to be served, but at the same time, we have to do it effectively. And so that would be the theme, and that will be the theme that we'll be sharing with you as we go forward."

The Rack brick-and-mortar part of it comp improved as the quarter -- the fourth quarter went on; the year went on. But no question, the first half or the first 3 quarters of the year, they were obviously running below our plans. And we shared with you both the full-price and off-price multichannel numbers, and that's something we've been talking about, at least from a full-price point of view, for a couple of years because most importantly, that's how the customer views the business, and that's how the customer shops. So we're trying to be clear about what that store business is and what the online off-price business is as well. But we really look at it as an off-price multichannel business. And so for the year, in the multichannel, I mentioned that was up 14% from a comp point of view. That's 4.3% for the quarter. Multichannel price was up 12%, and comp was up 3.6%. So when we look at it in that regard, we're definitely gaining market share from our competitors. The new Rack growth, which is the second part of your question, continues to be highly productive stores with terrific returns for our shareholders' investment. And so we feel good about this juncture, that 300 store commitment roughly that we've talked about by the year 2020. Those lead times are short, so we can react to that quickly. We have 24 stores, I believe, slated to open in 2016. And again, we feel good about the off-price part of our business and the full-price part of it. And so we think there's a good balance between the full-price and off-price, and we're continuing with that Rack growth."

So we've made a really, really big commitment there. And I think part of what we've learned along that journey is that we could likely be more productive with that capital. And we highlighted a couple of things that we believe, long term, are going to generate a lot of value. One is having a scalable inventory management tool that can support us well past $20 billion and can support multichannel, and the second is to re-architect how we think about our technology. So as we want to add new features and new applications, we can do it very efficiently and cost-effectively. And we think over the long run, that's going to have big payback. In terms of the returns of the past, we've had some projects that have delivered some great returns and some that haven't. That, by the way, is part of the business. It's a test and learn and iterate business. But that being said, as I think over the last several years, we've learned that we could like -- we do it better.

And you can bring new brands in. That's great. That has its own risks. And brands don't grow to be really huge businesses overnight. It takes a bit of time to get it there. And so we have some fairly big brands that have had some pretty sizable decreases over the last year. I mean, the good news is we've got some new brands coming up that we think can fill that void. I mean, I think one of the messages we were able to send to market this last week is we have open to buy even though business has been pretty difficult because we're looking to replace some of these brands that are a little more troubled by some of that promotional activity and their sales aren't as good. So good news is that I think we attract a lot of people interested in doing business with you. Maybe the best example of that as you look at some brands that we have that other people don't, so Madewell, for example, a J.Crew brand, it's not available as a retailer. It's something they sell themselves, but they sell to us because they like the way we do business. They like our customer, and it's been really effective. And you get insulated from some of these issues because it's not available at a lot of stores that are a little more promotional in nature. Topshop has been a version of that. Brandy Melville is a brand that's done really well for us. So there's good examples out there and some of the stuff you talk about, some of the more leading-edge things around that contemporary business. We're proud of our team and their ability to kind of keep forging ahead. Ultimately, our ability to be successful, going forward, is not by repeating and refining last year but to try to find new things out there to buy and new things to do that will kind of stimulate customers' interest. And that's really the -- our inspiration, our process going forward this year. And then you asked about the marketing campaign, and that was a little bit of a new deal that this -- a new campaign for spring that Olivia Kim helped create for us. And it's interesting. It's cool. I think probably the best thing about it is just it reflects an optimism and kind of a cheerfulness, which really should be what our business is about, particularly as you come into spring. I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on out there that maybe isn't super cheerful and bright. But I mean, our job is to make shopping fun for customers, and I think that's what that campaign really reflects. And so far, at least the anecdotal evidence is customers really like that."

We have a number of Rack stores opening. We have a fair amount of pre-opening that sits in the spring that we don't get a lot of sales benefit from, and then it kicks into the back half of the year. And so that's the other element. And then the third element we called out was the shift in the anniversary sale. So those are the big 3. In terms of specific margin guidance, I'm not going to get into that level of detail here on the call right now. But I think if you look at those 3 large directional elements, hopefully that will help you."

And there's a number of things we can do. Currently today, we fulfill out of multiple locations and are there opportunities for us to get more efficient at that. That creates not only additional labor costs, but it creates additional shipping costs because you're shipping multiple items per an order. We're also looking at how spread out we want our assortment to be because the more lower-priced items we have in it, the less unit profitability we gain. And so we're looking at a number of different things, but I think it all goes back to the rapid acceleration of the business and us continuing to feed that business and gain market share. And now we're learning an awful lot about how that business is behaving and how we can make it more productive."

As we've done more designer business in the last, oh, gosh, 15 years or so, it came down a little bit because that's the place that we just don't participate and also with beauty, as you talk about. So in -- if those 2 areas are big growth vehicles for us, at some place, we don't participate with our own label product. But we do, for example, which we haven't talked about yet, but the young customer segment of our business kind of how -- what we call women's apparel, which has a large component of our own label, and that's been growing well. It's a little over 10% of our business. It's not going to change dramatically from that. But I mean, can we do some more? Yes. We can do some more, and we've pretty much been doing it not as an entitlement program where NPG is going to be a certain percent of the business. It has to grow because organically it belongs and customers have responded well to it. So the good news is customers have responded well to it. We've got some good momentum in a lot of places. I mean, we have like a kid's brand like Tucker + Tate, which just in 3 years, I think it has -- we're doing -- what are we doing, $50 million in there. So now it is a big business for us, and it's a good business. And so we -- there's a lot of confidence and a lot of great results there to work towards. So yes, we think we can grow it in modest ways in the next few years. Related to beauty, that's a really interesting business. And the thing that's probably best about it is where most customers kind of enter Nordstrom through it. It has the most amount of trips come through the beauty business. It tends to attract newer, younger customers as well. And so when that business is healthy, it really helps the acquisition part of what we're doing. It helps the traffic in the stores. So I think what we continue to focus on there is making sure that we keep moving forward. And because we've been pretty successful there, we do attract a lot of interesting opportunities. And I think one of the things that's particularly good about that business is the diversity where the success is coming from because it's coming really all different price points. I mean, the Designer and Luxury part of that business is really strong. A lot of the new things we've introduced are strong, the different categories. We've got a good team there. So I think you'll just see us continue to try to follow the customers' interest there and make sure that we're best in class in that classification."

We're encouraged that even through this current retail environment, we continue to gain market share. We added roughly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total sales growth of 8%.

We added roughly $1 billion to our top line, delivering total sales growth of 8%. For the fourth quarter, we had a 1% comp increase as we anticipated, which was consistent with our third quarter's increase of 0.9%.
As we look ahead to 2016, we have always considered 2015 to be a peak investment year. That hasn't changed. What has changed is the current environment that we are facing, which requires us to pivot even more as we remain focused on improving profitability. In response, we are making adjustments to reduce expense and capital spending in 2016 and in the coming years.
For 2015, total sales in our full-price business, inclusive of Canada and Trunk Club, increased 5%. In off-price, inclusive of Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook, sales increased 14%. 
From a merchandising perspective, we're always pursuing newness in fashion to increase our relevance with customers. For example, we continued our success with brands like Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury. These brand partnerships have contributed to the strength of our contemporary departments and attracted new customers to Nordstrom. Additionally, we had continued momentum in beauty, which has been among our top-performing categories for the fourth straight year.
Going forward, it is even more important for us to remain focused on the customer as our business continues to evolve. We've made significant investments to enable customers to shop seamlessly across stores and online as well as to grow our business through new markets. With over $3 billion invested in capital over the last 5 years, we grew our top line by 50%, which was nearly $5 billion. We're also mindful of the importance for these investments to flow through to the bottom line.
While we're on track with our $20 billion sales ambition by 2020, our efforts to serve customers in multiple channels are having an impact to our business model. In response to changes in our business and current conditions, we've started to implement a number of opportunities to improve profitability. From a CapEx perspective, we reduced our plan by $300 million over the next 5 years. From an earnings perspective, our expenses have grown faster than sales to support our multichannel growth. We are taking action to moderate our expense growth over the next several years. Specific to 2016, we have planned expense savings of $100 million relative to our plans a year ago. This equates to a reduction of $50 million relative to 2015.
We are actively pursuing additional opportunities to improve profitability this year and in the years to come. We view this as fluid and iterative process as we stay focused on the customer and proactively ensure resources are aligned with customer expectations.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide more details on these changes with respect to our financial outlook."

We finished the year with our results in line with our expectations. Clearly, this was a difficult period, with industry sales declines and increased promotional activity resulting in compressed merchandise margins. As stated last quarter, we responded quickly and decisively to these trends with respect to inventory levels.
While we believe our inventory is current, we continue to monitor trends and make the appropriate adjustments to assure we remain price-competitive and have the best product available for our customers.
On the expense side, overall operations were well managed, resulting in an improved SG&A rate for the fourth quarter relative to our expectations.
Now I'd like to provide perspective on how we see our business evolving given current business conditions, our investment cycle and commitment to delivering top-quartile shareholder returns. In evolving with our customers, we've made significant investments to enable customers to shop in multiple ways. This has resulted in market share gains but also structural changes to our operating costs.  
For example, e-commerce now represents over 20% of our sales, a notable increase from 8% 5 years ago. This business model has a high variable cost structure, driven by fulfillment and marketing costs in addition to ongoing technology investments. With our increased investments to gain market share, along with the changing business model, expenses in recent years have grown faster than sales. As Blake mentioned, we are pursuing the following opportunities with focused efforts on increasing efficiency and lowering costs.
In technology, we are planning productivity improvements by focusing on fewer, more meaningful projects, such as a scalable merchandising solution that supports seamless integration across multiple channels. In addition, we are accelerating our efforts to re-platform our architecture to streamline development while reducing costs.
In fulfillment, we are assessing ways to improve efficiencies around delivering product to customers, which is expected to generate lower shipping costs. We are also refining our online assortments with a focus on unit profitability.
In marketing, we are focusing on improving our effectiveness across all channels. Consistent with our fulfillment efforts, we are measuring enterprise profitability of our total marketing spend. These and other initiatives are multiyear in nature. While we have successfully gained market share, we are also committed to growing profitability. With our investments moderating, we view 2016 as an inflection point of earnings growth improvement. We are focused on reshaping our business model and continuing that effort over the next several years to achieve our previously stated goal of mid-teens return on invested capital. As part of our regular communications, we'll keep you posted on our progress.
Moving to our capital investments. Our 5-year CapEx plan of $4 billion or 5% of sales represents a $300 million reduction in store investments relative to last year's plan. In 2016, we expect CapEx to be roughly $900 million, with 1/3 allocated to Canada and Manhattan. Technology and fulfillment, which represents another 1/3, is planned flat to last year, a considerable reduction from the 35% annualized growth over the last 5 years.
Our investments in HauteLook, Canada and Trunk Club are beginning to pay off with over $400 million added to our top line growth in 2015. The dilutive impact of these growth initiatives has peaked in 2015, with expected EBIT improvement beginning in 2016.
In addition, our loyalty program is an enabler of growth to help increase our engagement with customers and attract new customers. With Rewards members representing 40% of our sales volume, we look forward to expanding our program with a tender-neutral offer in the second quarter.
Finally, I'd like to turn to our 2016 financial outlook. Our plan for earnings per diluted share of $3.10 to $3.35 assumes total sales growth of 3.5% to 5.5% and comps of flat to a 2% increase. Based on current trends, we remain cautious and have considered the impact of a continued promotional environment.
In the first half of the year, EPS is planned to decrease by roughly 30% due to the following: the impact of the sale of credit receivables; the impact of growth initiatives, including our third fulfillment center, which opened last August, and new store pre-opening costs; and the shift of our anniversary event, which will span the second and third quarters in 2016.
In terms of our credit business, while we expect an initial reduction in EBIT from our revenue-sharing program with TD, we anticipate meaningful opportunities to increase earnings over time. Excluding the impact of the credit business, we expect improvement in retail EBIT growth, driven by the maturing of our growth investments and the operational improvements previously mentioned.
In closing, we continue to believe that we have the right strategies in place to profitably grow our business and successfully serve our current and future customers the Nordstrom way.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina."

So that's where we had a lot of compression and then also what it does to our margin. So it's not a good situation for us. I mean, there may be other retailers that really benefit from a lot of promotional activity that drive sales in disproportionate ways. So we spent a lot of time trying to be transparent, collaborating with vendors, talking about our desire to have newness really be the component that drives our sales and not the promotional activity. I think we work to identify vendors that operate cleaner businesses. It's a difficult balancing act because you want to make sure that you're bringing the things that customers want, too. I mean, to have things just uniquely or exclusive for exclusive's sake, that doesn't work either. There are some areas that help mitigate some of the pressure. For example, our own label product, what we call Nordstrom product group. It's a growing part of our business. We had a really good year with Nordstrom product group, and I think that's the way we can control our own destiny a little bit more as we go forward. And then I guess lastly, what I would say is ultimately, our ability to keep our inventories in line with the sales trends is going to be the biggest factor in terms of managing markdowns. And while we've missed sales by a little bit the last couple of months, we're in pretty decent shape, and we're going to be disciplined this year about keeping those inventories down."

You've kind of been a leader in trying to rationalize the promotional environment, so are there any distinctions we should know about on a year-over-year basis in terms of the sales that you'll be running versus last year?"

I mean, I think the rhythm of the business is the same in that there's a cycle to regular-price selling that we pretty much are in lockstep with the industry based on those rhythms. When business is bad, it accelerates that clearance part of it. But the part that we're talking about is promotional activity, where a retailer will take everything that's -- they have to offer, something that's a week old in the inventory and something that's 8 weeks old in the inventory, mark everything down. And that's what really erodes the margins. For us, we don't generate any of those events ourselves, but we have to be competitive for price. So if it's a price that's available for the customer and for all customers to maintain integrity and trust and confidence of our customers, we're going to match that price. So that's what puts the pressure on us in terms of our promotional activity. We don't have any more promotional activity in terms of clearance days or events, no more planned than ever. Actually, I think we're probably tightening that up even a little bit from this last year. I'm not sure if that answers your question, but philosophically, not much has changed in terms of what we've been doing for the last several years."

One of the nice things about our industry, there's always this internal optimism about new things coming out there and people excited to get it in front of customers. And there's evidence all through our business of pockets where business is really good because there's new things that have come in and done well. I mean, your comment about designer being off, that's actually not true for us. But our designer shoe and handbag business has been pretty good, even through some very challenging times. Apparel's had a little bit of pressure, but there's -- I think there's a lot of things for us to be excited about, and that translates, I think, to excitement for our customers. So I think that's an excuse you won't find us using. It's just a -- it's a continuous matter of us trying to keep the focus on new product flowing in here. And it's going to ebb and flow a little bit, but as long as we can keep our inventories in line, I don't think it's going to be a big problem. The Rack, on the other hand, they benefit in a lot of ways from some tough business out there because it means there's an excess of potentially really good product that we could get at great prices. And because we've got these great relationships with vendors, we can pass the savings along to customers. So I think that the difficult part is when you take -- when retailers or vendors take a price promotion on everything that they sell, they just -- they lessen the desirability of a product because why pay full price for it. And I think that's going to be an insidious part of what happens here, and it maybe doesn't lead to good long-term decisions for the health of a brand or even a trend. So that's something that we can't entirely control, but obviously, we talk to the vendors a lot about -- and I think one of the advantages that Nordstrom has people recognize out there, vendors recognize out there, that we do run a good full-price business. It does motivate our customers, and I think ultimately, they like doing business with us because of that."

And I'm not going to get into a lot of detail there, but suffice it to say, over the last several years, we've clearly been investing aggressively to grow a business. We've grown our business successfully. It's a new channel that is being built out that is still in the relatively early stages of its process, and I think we've reached an inflection point where, after growing it to the level we have, that we're spending a little bit more time focused on then how to turn a lot of that growth into some more profit. And I would say that that is the common theme that you're going to hear from us as we talk about reductions without getting into anything overly specific. But clearly, we're seeing a -- what has been a very noticeable change in our business model. I think one of our slides indicated, by the end of this decade, that we're going to have a large proportion of our business, about 30%, being done online. That's all the way from 5% that it was back in 2005. And that is a model that behaves enormously different than the mall-based model. And so we have a lot to learn about that and we have to keep our lens on as it relates to how the customer sees us and how the customer wants to be served, but at the same time, we have to do it effectively. And so that would be the theme, and that will be the theme that we'll be sharing with you as we go forward."

The Rack brick-and-mortar part of it comp improved as the quarter -- the fourth quarter went on; the year went on. But no question, the first half or the first 3 quarters of the year, they were obviously running below our plans. And we shared with you both the full-price and off-price multichannel numbers, and that's something we've been talking about, at least from a full-price point of view, for a couple of years because most importantly, that's how the customer views the business, and that's how the customer shops. So we're trying to be clear about what that store business is and what the online off-price business is as well. But we really look at it as an off-price multichannel business. And so for the year, in the multichannel, I mentioned that was up 14% from a comp point of view. That's 4.3% for the quarter. Multichannel price was up 12%, and comp was up 3.6%. So when we look at it in that regard, we're definitely gaining market share from our competitors. The new Rack growth, which is the second part of your question, continues to be highly productive stores with terrific returns for our shareholders' investment. And so we feel good about this juncture, that 300 store commitment roughly that we've talked about by the year 2020. Those lead times are short, so we can react to that quickly. We have 24 stores, I believe, slated to open in 2016. And again, we feel good about the off-price part of our business and the full-price part of it. And so we think there's a good balance between the full-price and off-price, and we're continuing with that Rack growth."

And we highlighted a couple of things that we believe, long term, are going to generate a lot of value. One is having a scalable inventory management tool that can support us well past $20 billion and can support multichannel, and the second is to re-architect how we think about our technology. So as we want to add new features and new applications, we can do it very efficiently and cost-effectively. And we think over the long run, that's going to have big payback. In terms of the returns of the past, we've had some projects that have delivered some great returns and some that haven't. That, by the way, is part of the business.

And you can bring new brands in. That's great. That has its own risks. And brands don't grow to be really huge businesses overnight. It takes a bit of time to get it there. And so we have some fairly big brands that have had some pretty sizable decreases over the last year. I mean, the good news is we've got some new brands coming up that we think can fill that void. I mean, I think one of the messages we were able to send to market this last week is we have open to buy even though business has been pretty difficult because we're looking to replace some of these brands that are a little more troubled by some of that promotional activity and their sales aren't as good. So good news is that I think we attract a lot of people interested in doing business with you. Maybe the best example of that as you look at some brands that we have that other people don't, so Madewell, for example, a J.Crew brand, it's not available as a retailer. It's something they sell themselves, but they sell to us because they like the way we do business. They like our customer, and it's been really effective. And you get insulated from some of these issues because it's not available at a lot of stores that are a little more promotional in nature. Topshop has been a version of that. Brandy Melville is a brand that's done really well for us. So there's good examples out there and some of the stuff you talk about, some of the more leading-edge things around that contemporary business. We're proud of our team and their ability to kind of keep forging ahead. Ultimately, our ability to be successful, going forward, is not by repeating and refining last year but to try to find new things out there to buy and new things to do that will kind of stimulate customers' interest. And that's really the -- our inspiration, our process going forward this year. And then you asked about the marketing campaign, and that was a little bit of a new deal that this -- a new campaign for spring that Olivia Kim helped create for us. And it's interesting. It's cool. I think probably the best thing about it is just it reflects an optimism and kind of a cheerfulness, which really should be what our business is about, particularly as you come into spring. I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on out there that maybe isn't super cheerful and bright. But I mean, our job is to make shopping fun for customers, and I think that's what that campaign really reflects. And so far, at least the anecdotal evidence is customers really like that."

The second thing is -- and it's been a phenomenon over the last couple of years is with the amount of stores that we've been opening, we have 2 new stores opening in Canada. We have a number of Rack stores opening. We have a fair amount of pre-opening that sits in the spring that we don't get a lot of sales benefit from, and then it kicks into the back half of the year.

That creates not only additional labor costs, but it creates additional shipping costs because you're shipping multiple items per an order. We're also looking at how spread out we want our assortment to be because the more lower-priced items we have in it, the less unit profitability we gain. And so we're looking at a number of different things, but I think it all goes back to the rapid acceleration of the business and us continuing to feed that business and gain market share.

So in -- if those 2 areas are big growth vehicles for us, at some place, we don't participate with our own label product. But we do, for example, which we haven't talked about yet, but the young customer segment of our business kind of how -- what we call women's apparel, which has a large component of our own label, and that's been growing well. It's a little over 10% of our business. It's not going to change dramatically from that. But I mean, can we do some more? Yes. We can do some more, and we've pretty much been doing it not as an entitlement program where NPG is going to be a certain percent of the business. It has to grow because organically it belongs and customers have responded well to it. So the good news is customers have responded well to it. We've got some good momentum in a lot of places. I mean, we have like a kid's brand like Tucker + Tate, which just in 3 years, I think it has -- we're doing -- what are we doing, $50 million in there. So now it is a big business for us, and it's a good business. And so we -- there's a lot of confidence and a lot of great results there to work towards. So yes, we think we can grow it in modest ways in the next few years. Related to beauty, that's a really interesting business. And the thing that's probably best about it is where most customers kind of enter Nordstrom through it. It has the most amount of trips come through the beauty business. It tends to attract newer, younger customers as well. And so when that business is healthy, it really helps the acquisition part of what we're doing. It helps the traffic in the stores. So I think what we continue to focus on there is making sure that we keep moving forward. And because we've been pretty successful there, we do attract a lot of interesting opportunities. And I think one of the things that's particularly good about that business is the diversity where the success is coming from because it's coming really all different price points. I mean, the Designer and Luxury part of that business is really strong. A lot of the new things we've introduced are strong, the different categories. We've got a good team there.

For the first quarter, we had a sales increase of 2.5% and a comp decrease of 1.7%, which fell short of our plan for a low single-digit increase.

For the first quarter, we had a sales increase of 2.5% and a comp decrease of 1.7%, which fell short of our plan for a low single-digit increase. Despite our focus efforts to manage through this current environment, we are not satisfied with our results. Given these sales trends, our inventories were too high, which puts pressure on our margins and necessitate additional markdowns. Our team has aggressively addressed our inventory position, and as a result, we ended the quarter with inventory up 5% versus sales growth of 2%. For the balance of the year, our lowered inventory plans puts us in a much stronger position to manage the business more proactively.
In addition to our inventory management efforts, we're continuing to evolve our operating model to support our growth strategy. On April 18, we announced expense reduction efforts, predominantly here in our Seattle headquarters, of $60 million. This includes elimination of approximately 400 roles, which is about 7% of our corporate positions. This will improve our focus and execution and make us more nimble to respond to the business environment. Later, Mike will share more in our expense reduction efforts.
As we look at the balance of the year, we are actively implementing a number of initiatives to drive top line growth and improve the customer experience. On May 18, we're rolling out an expanded Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program that will allow all of our customers to earn rewards with or without a Nordstrom card. Our Rewards customers are many of our most loyal and best customers, spending 4x more annually. Today, only about 1 out of 5 customers are part of our program, yet their spend contributes roughly 40% of our sales. This opportunity to reward all of our customers is big. Over the next 12 months, our goal is to add 5 million customers to our program. This will drive more sales and trips and more importantly, it will enable us to better engage with our customers.
On the technology and e-commerce side, we are investing to create a more seamless experience across stores and all lines. This reflects continued modernization of our technology platform, including a scalable merchandising solution as well as service and experience features. These are significant projects. They account for 2/3 of our overall technology investments this year.
We're building on the continued success of our Canada expansion, with 2 full-line store openings in Toronto this fall. With Toronto representing the most productive market in Canada and one of the top markets in all of North America, we see this as a significant opportunity. We believe these stores have the potential, along with our international flagship in Vancouver BC, to be among our highest volume stores.
In the U.S., we plan to open our second full-line store in Austin, Texas, which is a dynamic and growing market. Our strategy remains squarely focused on serving customers on their terms. Knowing customer's desire and experience as both personalized and convenient, we are making improvements to enable our customers to shop seamlessly anyway they choose. In our stores, our overall focus is to improve convenience.
As a recent example, we enhanced the buy online pick up in-store experience by providing curbside pickup in all of our full-line stores. Additionally, we are upgrading our scheduling tool to support our team's efforts to ensure we have the right people in the right place at the right time. This will help improve customer service and productivity.
On the merchandising side, we are dedicated to having the brands customers want with a keen eye towards product differentiation. We know customers desire newness in fashion, but are being more deliberate with their purchases. We are seeing great results from our recent collaborations such as Ivy Park, Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury. We will continue to introduce and grow relevant brands that are compelling to our customers while having limited distribution.
Moving to off-price. Nordstrom Rack represents an important channel for us to serve our customers and increase cross-shopping. Last year, 5 million new customers shopped at the Rack. This is meaningful because over 1/3 of our Rack customers will, over time, also shop in our full-price business. We've been pleased with our 6 stores that have opened so far this year. Their sales exceeded our expectations by more than 10%. We plan to open 15 more new stores this fall.
In closing, we recognize that the pace of change is increasing, so we're working diligently to evolve our business to best serve our customers. This means continuing to make the tough but necessary decisions that will ensure we are setup for continued success. We are confident that through our initiatives, we are competitively positioned to deliver the products and experiences our customers want.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who will provide more color on our performance, along with details on the changes we are making to our business."

As we head into the balance of the year, we expect that uncertainty in sales trends will continue and have built that into our outlook. We are implementing comprehensive plans to ensure that we can execute levers around inventory, expense and capital, all while maintaining our strong financial position. These plans also incorporate our commitment to liquidity and working capital needs by optimizing our inventory turns. We are aggressively prioritizing our resources to assure that every dollar spent is meaningful to the customer experience and will continue to challenge activities that are not.
Now I'll provide additional color on our first quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $0.26 were below our expectations, primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher markdowns as we align inventory to current sales trends. Our results also included credit chargebacks and severance charges of $0.10. These chargebacks, which were significantly higher than planned, related to an industry change in liability rules that took effect last October.
In early February, we completed the rollout of our trip-enabled point-of-sale system. As a result, we have begun to see these chargebacks decrease and anticipate a smaller residual impact in the second quarter.
Moving to the top line. We had a comp decrease of 1.7% and total sales increase of 2.5%. Our full-price businesses, which include our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Trunk Club and Canada had a comp decrease of 4.3%. This softness was broad-based across stores and online as well as across merchandise categories, although we had notably tougher trends in jewelry and handbags as well as some of our larger volume brands.
On a positive note, we continue to see customers desiring fashion and newness reflected in consistent regular price selling as well as strength in our new and emerging brands. Our off-price business, including stores and online, had a comp increase of 4.6%.
In addition to inventory management, expense rigor is a key component of our plan. We are making strategic decisions to invest in our future growth while focusing on areas where we can further streamline. We continue to move forward with our emphasis on technology as a top priority, committing 1/3 of our capital investments.
In March, after considerable planning, we implemented a new technology operating model, which included adding technical expertise at the senior management level. We are confident that these improvements will lead Nordstrom's next phase of growth and innovation while continuing to optimize productivity and reduce complexity.
We are also executing on a number of initiatives to increase efficiencies across our supply chain and marketing functions. In our supply chain, we had an ongoing opportunity to improve the unit economics of product delivered to customers. We are refining our online assortment to greater focus on key brands and categories, while editing less profitable items. We are also improving our merchandise allocation process between stores and fulfillment centers, leading to a reduction in split shipments, lower cancellation rates and better in-stock positions, all of which ultimately improve our customer experience.
Similar to our efforts with technology, we are taking steps to increase marketing effectiveness across our enterprise. All of these changes are part of a broader ongoing efforts in improving our operating model. Through our actions, we expect to generate this year over $150 million in expense savings, inclusive of $60 million from our corporate realigning efforts.
We continue to explore further opportunities to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in business conditions and customer expectations.
Our third lever, in addition to inventory and expense discipline, relates to capital deployment and allocation. Given the changes we are seeing in our industry, we are in the final stages of a thorough review of our 5-year capital plan. This includes prioritizing our investments to achieve our stated goal of mid-teens return on invested capital. We will provide updates on these plans once they are finalized.
Now I'd like to address our financial outlook. In updating our plans for the remainder of the year, we feel that it's appropriate to realign our outlook given the uncertainty and trends and expectations for a continued promotional environment. Comp sales are expected to be between a 1% decrease to a 1% increase compared with our prior outlook of flat to a 2% increase. Our earnings per diluted share expectation for this year is $2.50 to $2.70 compared with our prior outlook of $3.10 to $3.35.
In closing, while the pace of change continues to accelerate, our commitment to serving our customers remains unchanged. With our experienced leadership team, we are confident in our ability to manage through this current cycle. We maintain a healthy balance sheet and cash flow that will support the best interest of our customers, employees and shareholders over the long term.
Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

Number one, in looking at customer behavior, our conversion is up. Our customer acquisition, retention, AUR are all pretty much in line with our budget. Where we saw a drop off was on trips. We had fewer trips coming to our website last quarter. The second category, to shed some light, looking at regular versus off-price business on our NordstromRack.com site. Our regular priced demand is up in the mid-double digits and has remained healthy for quite some time. Where we're seeing a big miss is in our clearance and promo, promotional business. So we take lead from that is, number one, that the clearance and promotional environment is really noisy. There's a lot of excess product out in the marketplace. Certainly, easy to shop online. There's some heavy, heavy discounting going on, and we're seeing that effect in our business. Secondly, the customers are coming to us for newness, and our -- and a great experience, and that portion of our business remains pretty darn healthy. So that, looking forward, what gives us confidence and what we're determined to stay focused on is giving customers great merchandise to come and buy something new and give them a great experience. And I think it was in Blake's comments earlier, he mentioned some of the brands that were doing well with. That's more of what we see in our future. Something like Ivy Park that we launched, very limited distribution brand. We had great performance on that online and in our stores. The experience online was something we're pretty proud of and was a differentiated experience. And where we saw our weakness, it was in some very highly promotional brands that we had tough results with this quarter. So that's what we're seeing."

And that has served us well in gaining trust with the customers. We do not look to price matching or price promotion in any way as being a big strategic lever and a way of driving our top line. We look at price matching as a customer respect and a customer trust issue. That when a customer comes to us, they know that they're being treated fairly, and we think the clearest way of doing that and what customers expect is to not pay more for specific item when they're shopping with us. That's served us well in establishing that trust. We know from hearing our customers that they do have more confidence in our pricing than even just a couple of weeks -- couple of years ago. But strategically, where we're looking to win long term is at full price, is with newness, which as I mentioned, I think is increasingly with more limited distributed brands that really excite the fashion customer and gets them to look for something new."

So that will pressure margins. And we have made assumptions within our outlook that include that. As far as the a sale impact, the impact to the EPS is probably a couple of cents shift between the second and third quarter and about a 200 basis point shift out of Q2 into Q3 for comps. And just so everybody understands that every several years, our anniversary sale, the last week of that falls into the third quarter. This is a year where that happens, so you're going to see the shift that relates to that.

Those dollars and for the development of the tools that we're putting into place and the foundations that we're building not only come to the P&L but they go to our balance sheet and then find their way to the P&L relatively quickly.

For the first quarter, we had a sales increase of 2.5% and a comp decrease of 1.7%, which fell short of our plan for a low single-digit increase. Despite our focused efforts to manage through this current environment, we are not satisfied with our results. Given these sales trends, our inventories were too high, which puts pressure on our margins and necessitates addition markdowns. Our team has aggressively addressed our inventory position, and as a result, we ended the quarter with inventory up 5% versus sales growth of 2%. For the balance of the year, our lowered inventory plans puts us in a much stronger position to manage the business more proactively.
In addition to our inventory management efforts, we're continuing to evolve our operating model to support our growth strategy. On April 18, we announced expense reduction efforts, predominantly here in our Seattle headquarters, of $60 million. This includes elimination of approximately 400 roles, which is about 7% of our corporate positions. This will improve our focus and execution and make us more nimble to respond to the business environment. Later, Mike will share more on our expense reduction efforts.
As we look at the balance of the year, we are actively implementing a number of initiatives to drive top line growth and improve the customer experience. On May 18, we're rolling out an expanded Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program that will allow all of our customers to earn rewards with or without a Nordstrom card. Our Rewards customers are many of our most loyal and best customers, spending 4x more annually. Today, only about 1 out of 5 customers are part of our program, yet their spend contributes roughly 40% of our sales. This opportunity to reward all of our customers is big. Over the next 12 months, our goal is to add 5 million customers to our program. This will drive more sales and trips and more importantly, it will enable us to better engage with our customers.
On the technology and e-commerce side, we are investing to create a more seamless experience across stores and online. This reflects continued modernization of our technology platform, including a scalable merchandising solution as well as service and experience features. These are significant projects. They account for 2/3 of our overall technology investments this year.
We're building on the continued success of our Canada expansion with 2 full-line store openings in Toronto this fall. With Toronto representing the most productive market in Canada and one of the top markets in all of North America, we see this as a significant opportunity. We believe these stores have the potential, along with our international flagship in Vancouver BC, to be among our highest volume stores.
In the U.S., we plan to open our second full-line store in Austin, Texas, which is a dynamic and growing market. Our strategy remains squarely focused on serving customers on their terms. Knowing customer's desire and experience as both personalized and convenient, we are making improvements to enable our customers to shop seamlessly anyway they choose. In our stores, our overall focus is to improve convenience.
As a recent example, we enhanced the buy online pickup in store experience by providing curbside pickup in all of our full-line stores. Additionally, we are upgrading our scheduling tool to support our team's efforts to ensure we have the right people in the right place at the right time. This will help improve customer service and productivity.
On the merchandising side, we are dedicated to having the brands customers want with a keen eye towards product differentiation. We know customers desire newness in fashion, but are being more deliberate with their purchases. We are seeing great results from our recent collaborations such as Ivy Park, Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury. We will continue to introduce and grow relevant brands that are compelling to our customers, while having limited distribution.
Moving to off-price. Nordstrom Rack represents an important channel for us to serve more customers and increase cross-shopping. Last year, 5 million new customers shopped at the Rack. This is meaningful because over 1/3 of our Rack customers will, over time, also shop in our full-price business. We've been pleased with our 6 stores that have opened so far this year. Their sales exceeded our expectations by more than 10%. We plan to open 15 more new stores this fall.
In closing, we recognize that the pace of change is increasing, so we're working diligently to evolve our business to best serve our customers. This means continuing to make the tough, but necessary decisions that will ensure we are setup for continued success. We are confident that through our initiatives, we are competitively positioned to deliver the products and experiences our customers want.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who will provide more color on our performance, along with details on the changes we are making to our business."

As we head into the balance of the year, we expect that uncertainty in sales trends will continue and have built that into our outlook. We are implementing comprehensive plans to ensure that we can execute levers around inventory, expense and capital, all while maintaining our strong financial position. These plans also incorporate our commitment to liquidity and working capital needs by optimizing our inventory turns. We are aggressively prioritizing our resources to assure that every dollar spent is meaningful to the customer experience and will continue to challenge activities that are not.
Now I'll provide additional color on our first quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $0.26 were below our expectations, primarily due to lower sales volume and higher markdowns as we align inventory to current sales trends. Our results also included credit chargebacks and severance charges of $0.10. These chargebacks, which were significantly higher than planned, related to an industry change in liability rules that took effect last October.
In early February, we completed the rollout of our chip-enabled point-of-sale system. As a result, we have begun to see these chargebacks decrease and anticipate a smaller residual impact in the second quarter.
Moving to the top line. We had a comp decrease of 1.7% and total sales increase of 2.5%. Our full-price businesses, which include our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Trunk Club and Canada, had a comp decrease of 4.3%. This softness was broad-based across stores and online as well as across merchandise categories, although we had notably tougher trends in jewelry and handbags as well as some of our larger volume brands.
On a positive note, we continue to see customers desiring fashion and newness reflected in consistent regular price selling as well as strength in our new and emerging brands. Our off-price business, including stores and online, had a comp increase of 4.6%.
In addition to inventory management, expense rigor is a key component of our plan. We are making strategic decisions to invest in our future growth, while focusing on areas where we can further streamline. We continue to move forward with our emphasis on technology as a top priority, committing 1/3 of our capital investments.
In March, after considerable planning, we implemented a new technology operating model, which included adding technical expertise at the senior management level. We are confident that these improvements will lead Nordstrom's next phase of growth and innovation, while continuing to optimize productivity and reduce complexity.
We are also executing on a number of initiatives to increase efficiencies across our supply chain and marketing functions. In our supply chain, we have an ongoing opportunity to improve the unit economics of product delivered to customers. We are refining our online assortment to greater focus on key brands and categories, while editing less profitable items. We are also improving our merchandise allocation process between stores and fulfillment centers, leading to a reduction in split shipments, lower cancellation rates and better in-stock positions, all of which ultimately improve our customer experience.
Similar to our efforts with technology, we are taking steps to increase marketing effectiveness across our enterprise. All of these changes are part of a broader ongoing efforts in improving our operating model. Through our actions, we expect to generate this year over $150 million in expense savings, inclusive of $60 million from our corporate realignment efforts.
We continue to explore further opportunities to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in business conditions and customer expectations.
Our third lever, in addition to inventory and expense discipline, relates to capital deployment and allocation. Given the changes we are seeing in our industry, we are in the final stages of a thorough review of our 5-year capital plan. This includes prioritizing our investments to achieve our stated goal of mid-teens return on invested capital. We will provide updates on these plans once they are finalized.
Now I'd like to address our financial outlook. In updating our plans for the remainder of the year, we feel that it's appropriate to realign our outlook given the uncertainty and trends and expectations for a continued promotional environment. Comp sales are expected to be between a 1% decrease to a 1% increase compared with our prior outlook of flat to a 2% increase. Our earnings per diluted share expectation for this year is $2.50 to $2.70 compared with our prior outlook of $3.10 to $3.35.
In closing, while the pace of change continues to accelerate, our commitment to serving our customers remains unchanged. With our experienced leadership team, we are confident in our ability to manage through this current cycle. We maintain a healthy balance sheet and cash flow that will support the best interest of our customers, employees and shareholders over the long term.
Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

Number one, in looking at customer behavior, our conversion is up. Our customer acquisition, retention, AUR are all pretty much in line with our budget. Where we saw a drop off was on trips. We had fewer trips coming to our website last quarter. The second category, to shed some light, looking at regular versus off-price business on our NordstromRack.com site, our regular price demand is up in the mid-double digits and has remained healthy for quite some time. Where we're seeing a big miss is in our clearance and promo, promotional business. So we take lead from that is, number one, that the clearance and promotional environment is really noisy. There's a lot of excess product out in the marketplace. It's certainly easy to shop online. There's some heavy, heavy discounting going on, and we're seeing that effect in our business. Secondly, the customers are coming to us for newness, and our -- and a great experience, and that portion of our business remains pretty darn healthy. So that -- looking forward, what gives us confidence and what we're determined to stay focused on is giving customers great merchandise to come and buy something new and give them a great experience. And I think it was in Blake's comments earlier, he mentioned some of the brands that were doing well with. That's more what we see in our future. Something like Ivy Park that we launched, very limited distribution brand. We had great performance on that online and in our stores. The experience online was something we're pretty proud of and was a differentiated experience. And where we saw weakness, it was in some very highly promotional brands that we had tough results with this quarter. So that's what we're seeing."

And we have been more purposeful for, let's say, the last couple of years of matching price on products online really for big online retailers, whoever they maybe, because there is no regionality to e-commerce. And that has served us well in gaining trust with the customers. We do not look to price matching or price promotion in any way as being a big strategic lever in a way of driving our top line. We look at price matching as a customer respect and a customer trust issue. That when a customer comes to us, they know that they're being treated fairly, and we think the clearest way of doing that and what customers expect is to not pay more for specific item when they're shopping with us. That's served us well in establishing that trust. We know from hearing our customers that they do have more confidence in our pricing than even just a couple of weeks -- couple of years ago. But strategically, where we're looking to win long term is at full price, is with newness, which, as I mentioned, I think is increasingly with more limited distributed brands that really excite the fashion customer and gives them to look for something new."

As far as the a sale impact, the impact to the EPS is probably a couple cents shift between the second and third quarter and about a 200 basis point shift out of Q2 into Q3 for comps. And just so everybody understands that, every several years, our anniversary sale, the last week of that falls into the third quarter. This is a year where that happens, so you're going to see the shift that relates to that.

In terms of the leverage point, I think what you're seeing is that we continue to invest in the long-term growth of the company, which is having an impact on our -- on the leverage of the company, and primarily a lot of that is coming from the accelerated pace of the technology investment. Those dollars for the development of the tools that we're putting into place and the foundations that we're building, not only come to the P&L, but they go to our balance sheet and then find their way through the P&L relatively quickly. So that's a big element of it. The other element is, you may recall, we opened the East Coast fulfillment center last fall. And so we're still absorbing the incremental impact of the cost of that asset.

Do you have any more perspective on what's happening at your full-line stores right now?"

I think it's been pretty well documented out there that mall traffic overall has been soft over the last, probably, couple quarters. We've seen some data recently over the last month or 2 that it was down approaching double digits, and we noticed that. We are in -- we're primarily in malls, and when we see mall traffic go down, it hurts us. And we can see that in certain areas of our business. Clearance sales is a good example of that. While our full-price regular price sales have been hanging in there, our clearance sales over the last quarter or 2 have really been down. And I think that jives with mall traffic being off. So we're looking at how can we, regardless of the mall that we're in, give the customer a compelling reason to make a trip to the store. Obviously, that starts with the merchandise, but also it has to do with the kind of services that we're offering. And we mentioned we're making big improvements in things like the buy online pickup in store experience, things that we're doing online to flow into the store and vice versa. And so we're encouraged by things that we have in our control to compel customers to want to go -- come to the store, and we're excited about starting to leverage some of the investments we've made over the next year or so in creating some of these new customer experiences."

For the first quarter, we had a sales increase of 2.5% and a comp decrease of 1.7%, which fell short of our plan for a low single-digit increase.

For the first quarter, we had a sales increase of 2.5% and a comp decrease of 1.7%, which fell short of our plan for a low single-digit increase. Despite our focused efforts to manage through this current environment, we are not satisfied with our results. Given these sales trends, our inventories were too high, which puts pressure on our margins and necessitates addition markdowns. Our team has aggressively addressed our inventory position and, as a result, we ended the quarter with inventory up 5% versus sales growth of 2%. For the balance of the year, our lowered inventory plans puts us in a much stronger position to manage the business more proactively.
In addition to our inventory management efforts, we're continuing to evolve our operating model to support our growth strategy. On April 18, we announced expense reduction efforts, predominantly here in our Seattle headquarters, of $60 million. This includes elimination of approximately 400 roles, which is about 7% of our corporate positions. This will improve our focus and execution and make us more nimble to respond to the business environment. Later, Mike will share more on our expense reduction efforts.
As we look at the balance of the year, we are actively implementing a number of initiatives to drive top line growth and improve the customer experience. On May 18, we're rolling out an expanded Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program that will allow all of our customers to earn rewards with or without a Nordstrom card. Our Rewards customers are many of our most loyal and best customers, spending 4x more annually. Today, only about 1 out of 5 customers are part of our program, yet their spend contributes roughly 40% of our sales. This opportunity to reward all of our customers is big. Over the next 12 months, our goal is to add 5 million customers to our program. This will drive more sales and trips and more importantly, it will enable us to better engage with our customers.
On the technology and e-commerce side, we are investing to create a more seamless experience across stores and online. This reflects continued modernization of our technology platform, including a scalable merchandising solution, as well as service and experience features. These are significant projects. They account for 2/3 of our overall technology investments this year.
We're building on the continued success of our Canada expansion, with 2 full-line store openings in Toronto this fall. With Toronto representing the most productive market in Canada and one of the top markets in all of North America, we see this as a significant opportunity. We believe these stores have the potential, along with our international flagship in Vancouver BC, to be among our highest volume stores.
In the U.S., we plan to open our second full-line store in Austin, Texas, which is a dynamic and growing market. Our strategy remains squarely focused on serving customers on their terms. Knowing customers' desire and experience is both personalized and convenient, we are making improvements to enable our customers to shop seamlessly any way they choose. In our stores, our overall focus is to improve convenience.
As a recent example, we enhanced the buy online pickup in store experience by providing curbside pickup in all of our full-line stores. Additionally, we are upgrading our scheduling tool to support our teams' efforts to ensure we have the right people in the right place at the right time. This will help improve customer service and productivity.
On the merchandising side, we are dedicated to having the brands customers want, with a keen eye towards product differentiation. We know customers desire newness and fashion, but are being more deliberate with their purchases. We are seeing great results from our recent collaborations such as IVY PARK, Topshop, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury. We will continue to introduce and grow relevant brands that are compelling to our customers, while having limited distribution.
Moving to off-price. Nordstrom Rack represents an important channel for us to serve more customers and increase cross-shopping. Last year, 5 million new customers shopped at the Rack. This is meaningful because over 1/3 of our Rack customers will, over time, also shop in our full-price business. We've been pleased with our 6 stores that have opened so far this year. Their sales exceeded our expectations by more than 10%. We plan to open 15 more new stores this fall.
In closing, we recognize that the pace of change is increasing, so we're working diligently to evolve our business to best serve our customers. This means continuing to make the tough, but necessary decisions that will ensure we are set up for continued success. We are confident that through our initiatives, we are competitively positioned to deliver the products and experiences our customers want.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who will provide more color on our performance, along with details on the changes we are making to our business."

As we head into the balance of the year, we expect that uncertainty in sales trends will continue and have built that into our outlook. We are implementing comprehensive plans to ensure that we can execute levers around inventory, expense and capital, all while maintaining our strong financial position. These plans also incorporate our commitment to liquidity and working capital needs by optimizing our inventory turns. We are aggressively prioritizing our resources to assure that every dollar spent is meaningful to the customer experience and we'll continue to challenge activities that are not.
Now I'll provide additional color on our first quarter performance. Our earnings per diluted share of $0.26 were below our expectations, primarily due to lower sales volume and higher markdowns as we align inventory to current sales trends. Our results also included credit chargebacks and severance charges of $0.10. These chargebacks, which were significantly higher than planned, related to an industry change in liability rules that took effect last October.
In early February, we completed the rollout of our chip-enabled point-of-sale system. As a result, we have begun to see these chargebacks decrease and anticipate a smaller residual impact in the second quarter.
Moving to the top line. We had a comp decrease of 1.7% and total sales increase of 2.5%. Our full-price businesses, which include our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Trunk Club and Canada, had a comp decrease of 4.3%. This softness was broad-based across stores and online, as well as across merchandise categories, although we had notably tougher trends in jewelry and handbags, as well as some of our larger volume brands.
On a positive note, we continue to see customers desiring fashion and newness reflected in consistent regular price selling, as well as strength in our new and emerging brands. Our off-price business, including stores and online, had a comp increase of 4.6%.
In addition to inventory management, expense rigor is a key component of our plan. We are making strategic decisions to invest in our future growth, while focusing on areas where we can further streamline. We continue to move forward with our emphasis on technology as a top priority, committing 1/3 of our capital investments.
In March, after considerable planning, we implemented a new technology operating model, which included adding technical expertise at the senior management level. We are confident that these improvements will lead Nordstrom's next phase of growth and innovation, while continuing to optimize productivity and reduce complexity.
We are also executing on a number of initiatives to increase efficiencies across our supply chain and marketing functions. In our supply chain, we have an ongoing opportunity to improve the unit economics of product delivered to customers. We are refining our online assortment to greater focus on key brands and categories, while editing less profitable items. We are also improving our merchandise allocation process between stores and fulfillment centers, leading to a reduction in split shipments, lower cancellation rates and better in-stock positions, all of which ultimately improve our customer experience.
Similar to our efforts with technology, we are taking steps to increase marketing effectiveness across our enterprise. All of these changes are part of a broader ongoing efforts in improving our operating model. Through our actions, we expect to generate this year over $150 million in expense savings, inclusive of $60 million from our corporate realignment efforts.
We continue to explore further opportunities to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in business conditions and customer expectations.
Our third lever, in addition to inventory and expense discipline, relates to capital deployment and allocation. Given the changes we are seeing in our industry, we are in the final stages of a thorough review of our 5-year capital plan. This includes prioritizing our investments to achieve our stated goal of mid-teens return on invested capital. We will provide updates on these plans once they are finalized.
Now I'd like to address our financial outlook. In updating our plans for the remainder of the year, we feel it's appropriate to realign our outlook given the uncertainty and trends and expectations for a continued promotional environment. Comp sales are expected to be between a 1% decrease to a 1% increase compared with our prior outlook of flat to a 2% increase. Our earnings per diluted share expectation for this year is $2.50 to $2.70 compared with our prior outlook of $3.10 to $3.35.
In closing, while the pace of change continues to accelerate, our commitment to serving our customers remains unchanged. With our experienced leadership team, we are confident in our ability to manage through this current cycle. We maintain a healthy balance sheet and cash flow that will support the best interests of our customers, employees and shareholders over the long term.
Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

Number one, in looking at customer behavior, our conversion is up. Our customer acquisition, retention, AUR are all pretty much in line with our budget. Where we saw a drop-off was on trips. We had fewer trips coming to our website last quarter. The second category, to shed some light, looking at regular versus off-price business on our Nordstrom.com site, our regular price demand is up in the mid-double digits and has remained healthy for quite some time. Where we're seeing a big miss is in our clearance and promo, promotional business. So we take a lead from that is, number one, that the clearance and promotional environment is really noisy. There's a lot of excess product out in the marketplace. It's certainly easy to shop online. There's some heavy, heavy discounting going on, and we're seeing that effect in our business. Secondly, the customers are coming to us for newness, and our -- and a great experience, and that portion of our business remains pretty darn healthy. So that -- looking forward, what gives us confidence and what we're determined to stay focused on is giving customers great merchandise to come and buy something new and giving them a great experience. And I think it was in Blake's comments earlier, mentioned some of the brands that we're doing well with. That's more what we see in our future. Something like IVY PARK that we launched, a very limited distribution brand. We had great performance on that online and in our stores. The experience online was something we're pretty proud of and was a differentiated experience. And where we saw a lot of weakness, it was in some very highly promotional brands that we had tough results with this quarter. So that's what we're seeing."

On price matching, it's -- the cause and effect is a little clearer online than our stores, the price transparency that Internet provides. And we have been more purposeful for, I'd say, the last couple of years of matching price on products online really for big online retailers, whoever they maybe, because there is no regionality to e-commerce. And that has served us well in gaining trust with the customers. We do not look to price matching or price promotion in any way as being a big strategic lever in a way of driving our top line. We look at price matching as a customer respect and a customer trust issue, that when a customer comes to us, they know that they're being treated fairly, and we think the clearest way of doing that and what customers expect is to not pay more for specific item when they're shopping with us. So that's served us well in establishing that trust. We know from hearing our customers that they do have more confidence in our pricing than even just a couple of weeks -- couple of years ago. But strategically, where we're looking to win long term is at full price, is with newness, which, as I mentioned, I think is increasingly with more limited distributed brands that really excite the fashion customer and gets them to look for something new."

Well, it was alluded to in what Mike and Erik talked about. There're some businesses that we've been in, whether it was specific item or a brand, that might be pretty good for the top line, but over time, it may not be particularly good for the bottom line. So we've got to reconcile those issues. And you've heard us mention, there're some big brands that we have that have had some precipitous decline. A lot of that's related to promotion and how that's adversely impacted that brand with our customers. So yes, I mean, the good news is if you're a buyer here at Nordstrom, that creates an open [ph] to buy. It creates an opportunity to try some new vendors, some new programs, some new things. And so brands are important part of what we do. But if they're offering and the way things are going with certain brands are damaging our brand, then obviously, we've got to figure out alternatives and different things to try, and so that's part of it. You heard about these brands. You mentioned our own label product, the Nordstrom product group, which has been really pretty strong for us relatively as well, so we will continue on that path."

So that will pressure margins. And we have made assumptions within our outlook that include that. As far as the a sale impact, the impact to the EPS is probably a couple cents shift between the second and third quarter and about a 200 basis point shift out of Q2 into Q3 for comps. And just so everybody understands that, every several years, our anniversary sale, the last week of that falls into the third quarter. This is a year where that happens, so you're going to see the shift that relates to that. In terms of SG&A, again, we haven't broken that out by quarter or specifically by line item, but I will say that we've already begun to see the impacts of the things that we are talking about.

One is, as Blake mentioned, there's an opportunity to engage in a whole another pool of customers and to bring them into our loyalty program.

So that's a big element of it. The other element is, you may recall, we opened the East Coast fulfillment center last fall. And so we're still absorbing the incremental impact of the cost of that asset. So I would categorize the ability to leverage going forward as being more about the overall investments that we have made from an SG&A standpoint. And of course, in addition to that, we're seeing some pressure on our gross margin."

I think it's been pretty well documented out there that mall traffic overall has been soft over the last, probably, couple quarters. We've seen some data recently over the last month or 2 that it was down approaching double digits, and we noticed that. We are in -- we're primarily in malls, and when we see mall traffic go down, it hurts us. And we can see that in certain areas of our business. Clearance sales is a good example of that. While our full-price regular price sales have been hanging in there, our clearance sales over the last quarter or 2 have really been down. And I think that jives with mall traffic being off. So we're looking at how can we, regardless of the mall that we're in, give the customer a compelling reason to make a trip to the store. Obviously, that starts with the merchandise, but also, it has to do with the kind of services that we're offering. And we mentioned we're making big improvements in things like the buy online pickup in store experience, things that we're doing online that flow into the store and vice versa. And so we're encouraged by things that we have in our control to compel customers to want to go -- come to the store, and we're excited about starting to leverage some of the investments we've made over the next year or so in creating some of these new customer experiences."

Over the past several quarters, our team has been actively addressing our inventory expense and capital as we align the current sales trends. In the second quarter, the team made substantial progress by bringing down inventory in line with sales. We're also pleased with our customers' response to the Anniversary Sale. This year marked one of the best events we've had in our history, with an all-time high in sales volume. The strength of our anniversary event, along with the team's inventory and expense execution drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our anniversary performance reflected an improvement from our recent sales trends. We had a strong start to the sale, and the momentum continued throughout the event. Our sellthrough rates were at record highs, putting us in a clean inventory position for the second half of the year.
Customers responded favorably to newness, with shoes and beauty leading our results. As a reminder, historically, every several years, we have a shift in our anniversary event, which moves 1 week of the event into the third quarter. As a result, our comp decrease of 1.2% was unfavorably impacted by roughly 250 basis points.
On May 18, we achieved an important milestone with the expansion of our loyalty program. Nordstrom Rewards serves as a powerful tool to drive incremental sales and trips. Given more importantly, it gives us an opportunity to strengthen relationships with customers. In response to feedback for more flexibility in joining our program, we've expanded it so that all of our customers can earn rewards regardless of how they choose to pay. We're encouraged with the strong response. We now have around 6 million total Rewards customers who shop with us over the last year, up significantly from 4.7 million last quarter.
As we head into the second half of the year, we are focused on a number of initiatives to improve the customer experience and drive top line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we're expanding our reach to serve more customers. We're building on the success of our Canada expansion with 2 full-line store openings in Toronto. On September 16, we will open a flagship at Eaton center, followed by another store in Yorkville shopping center on October 21. 
In the U.S. we will open a second full-line store in Austin, Texas on September 30. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we open to open 15 stores this fall for a total of 215 by the end of the year.
Our merchandise strategy remains focused on providing our customers with newness. Our efforts to grow relevant brands that have limited distribution play an important role in creating excitement and tracking new customers. They now make up the majority of our top 20 fastest growing vendors, and we're continuing to expand the most highly sought-after brands like IVY PARK, Madewell and Charlotte Tilbury with new partnerships to come.
In addition to providing a differentiated product offering, we recognize that our customers desire of personalized and convenient experience. To meet their evolving expectations, we are making digital enhancements to better serve customers no matter how they choose to shop with us. We have several initiatives underway that include new mobile features, improvements to our website and enhanced selling tools.
In the second quarter, we've made ongoing improvements to our mobile app, including features that enable customers to shop their store of choice and shop for items they have done a visual search.
This fall, we are piloting a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try in our stores.
In closing, our ability to deliver strong anniversary results while realigning inventory expense speaks volumes to the quality of our team. We're proud of the team's high level of execution and remain committed to continuing this progress. Next quarter, we look forward to providing further updates on our efforts, including our extended loyalty program and performance in Canada.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who will provide additional color on our results and our ongoing efforts improve our business models."

Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations.

Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations. This includes the progress we have made adjusting our inventory and expense, which had a positive impact on our second quarter results. As we evolve our business model, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we can serve customers with high quality products and services while achieving profitable growth.
Our earnings per diluted share of $0.67 were ahead of our expectations driven by our strong execution of the Anniversary Sale, inventory management and expense control. We are also continuing to see benefits from the strategic growth investments we've made to fuel growth in new markets and e-commerce. These investments, HauteLook, our expansion into Canada and Trunk Club are expected to contribute over $1 billion to our top line in 2016.
Our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, had a combined comp decrease of 2.3%. This reflected an unfavorable impact of over 250 basis points from the event shift. The momentum of Nordstrom Rack consisting of stores and online continued with a comp increase of 5.3% on top of last year's increase of 6.5%.
Over the last several quarters, we have been aggressively adjusting our inventory plans as consumer demand has changed. We have a complex portfolio of businesses. And combined with the uncertainty of sales trends, our merchant and planning teams were making continuing adjustments. That high level of execution, combined with a compelling product offering for the Anniversary Sale, drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our inventories are well positioned, current and in line with our sales trends. As a result, we are on the offense focused on bringing in the latest and most compelling product offering that resonates with our customers.
In terms of our broader efforts to improve profitability, we recognize that the shift towards e-commerce is having an impact to our financial model. As we accelerate investments to support changes in customer expectations, our expenses, particularly in technology, supply chain and marketing, grew faster than sales.
To address this, we are continuing to make operational changes to rightsize this trajectory. 
As we shared last quarter, we identified over 150 million in productivity improvements this year, of which roughly half has been realized to date. We are streamlining corporate headquarters and executed on a number of initiatives that will enhance the customer experience and improve our operating model.
In technology, we're on a path to modernize our platform and increase the productivity of delivering features that will improve the customer experience. For example, this year, we implemented new technology solutions that support our expanded loyalty program and online search engine. These modernized platforms enable us to serve customers in a more personalized and relevant way.
In supply chain, we've executed on several initiatives to improve operating performance. This included optimizing our supplier network for both inbound and outbound carriers, reducing split shipments to a greater allocation of merchandise to our fulfillment centers and editing out less profitable items online. 
A year ago, we opened our East Coast fulfillment center, which has the potential to double our fulfillment capacity as we scale for growth. For customers we serve on the East Coast, we've been able to speed up delivery times by over 30% with lower unit shipping costs due to the increased proximity to our customers. In continuing these efforts, we are further integrating Trunk Club's operations into the Nordstrom fulfillment network with completion expected by mid-2017.
In marketing, we are repositioning our organization to better align with the customer journey and our strategic priorities around customer, acquisition and retention. This includes strengthening our capabilities around customer analytics and digital engagement so that we can reach customers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Our expanded loyalty program demonstrates our efforts to rebalance our marketing resources towards a greater focus on personalization. This will help us better serve customers and increase their lifetime value.
In addition to the adjustments we've made to inventory and expense, we have reprioritized our capital investments to better align with changing customer expectations and strengthen our financial position. This resulted in a 10% reduction to our 5-year capital plan. Our reduced CapEx plan of $3.6 billion is appropriately balanced between store and technology investments. We have made a modest reduction to our Rack store expansion plans given the growth of our online business, which has doubled since the launch of NordstromRack.com a couple years ago. All of these efforts to improve our productivity will result in a more productive use of financial resources, which is beginning to positively impact our results.
During the second quarter, our cash flow from operating activities was $853 million, more than twice what it was last year.
Now I'd like to address our financial outlook. We have adjusted our earnings per share outlook to $2.60 to $2.75 from our prior outlook of $2.50 to $2.70. As we head into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to manage our business while also being mindful of uncertainty in retail trends.
In closing, as our business evolves, we remain confident in our ability to serve customers in an exemplary way and achieve sustainable profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we believe Nordstrom will emerge stronger and better positioned for future success.

In terms of how that impacts our inventory plans going forward, I think for us, we're really well served to try to keep our inventory plans conservative. We've been able to prove over the years that we can exceed sales plans with concerted inventory plans. And when you do that, I mean, obviously, it just -- it creates a good scenario for us in reducing markdown. So I think while we're happy about the sales results, we're very cautious not to over invest either our plans or just in a way that we're allocating inventory.

Over the past several quarters, our team has been actively addressing our inventory expense and capital as we align the current sales trends. In the second quarter, the team made substantial progress by bringing down inventory in line with sales. We're also pleased with our customers' response to the Anniversary Sale. This year marked one of the best events we've had in our history, with an all-time high in sales volume. The strength of our anniversary event, along with the team's inventory and expense execution drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our anniversary performance reflected an improvement from our recent sales trends. We had a strong start to the sale, and the momentum continued throughout the event. Our sell-through rates were at record highs, putting us in a clean inventory position for the second half of the year.
Customers responded favorably to newness, with shoes and beauty leading our results. As a reminder, historically, every several years, we have a shift in our anniversary event, which moves 1 week of the event into the third quarter. As a result, our comp decrease of 1.2% was unfavorably impacted by roughly 250 basis points.
On May 18, we achieved an important milestone with the expansion of our loyalty program. Nordstrom Rewards serves as a powerful tool to drive incremental sales and trips. Even more importantly, it gives us an opportunity to strengthen relationships with customers. In response to feedback for more flexibility in joining our program, we've expanded it so that all of our customers can earn rewards regardless of how they choose to pay. We're encouraged with the strong response. We now have around 6 million total Rewards customers who shop with us over the last year, up significantly from 4.7 million last quarter.
As we head into the second half of the year, we are focused on a number of initiatives to improve the customer experience and drive top line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we're expanding our reach to serve more customers. We're building on the success of our Canada expansion with 2 full-line store openings in Toronto. On September 16, we will open a flagship at Eaton Centre, followed by another store at Yorkdale Shopping Centre on October 21. 
In the U.S., we will open a second full-line store in Austin, Texas, on September 30. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we plan to open 15 stores this fall for a total of 215 by the end of the year.
Our merchandise strategy remains focused on providing our customers with newness. Our efforts to grow relevant brands that have limited distribution play an important role in creating excitement and tracking new customers. They now make up the majority of our top 20 fastest growing vendors, and we're continuing to expand the most highly sought-after brands, like IVY PARK, Madewell and Charlotte Tilbury, with new partnerships to come.
In addition to providing a differentiated product offering, we've recognized that our customers desire a personalized and convenient experience. To meet their evolving expectations, we are making digital enhancements to better serve customers no matter how they choose to shop with us. We have several initiatives underway that include new mobile features, improvements to our website and enhanced selling tools.
In the second quarter, we've made ongoing improvements to our mobile app, including features that enable customers to shop their store of choice and shop for items based on a visual search. This fall, we are piloting a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try in our stores.
In closing, our ability to deliver strong anniversary results while realigning inventory expense speaks volumes to the quality of our team. We're proud of the team's high level of execution to remain committed to continuing this progress. Next quarter, we look forward to providing further updates on our efforts, including our expanded loyalty program and performance in Canada.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide additional color on our results and our ongoing efforts to improve our business models."

Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations.

Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations. This includes the progress we have made adjusting our inventory and expense, which had a positive impact on our second quarter results. As we evolve our business model, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we can serve customers with high-quality products and services while achieving profitable growth.
Our earnings per diluted share of $0.67 were ahead of our expectations driven by our strong execution of the Anniversary Sale, inventory management and expense control. We are also continuing to see benefits from the strategic growth investments we've made to fuel growth in new markets and e-commerce. These investments, HauteLook, our expansion into Canada and Trunk Club are expected to contribute over $1 billion to our top line in 2016.
Our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, had a combined comp decrease of 2.3%. This reflected an unfavorable impact of over 250 basis points from the event shift. The momentum of Nordstrom Rack, consisting of stores and online, continued with a comp increase of 5.3% on top of last year's increase of 6.5%.
Over the last several quarters, we have been aggressively adjusting our inventory plans as consumer demand has changed. We have a complex portfolio of businesses. And combined with the uncertainty of sales trends, our merchant and planning teams were making continuous adjustments. That high level of execution, combined with a compelling product offering for the Anniversary Sale, drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our inventories are well positioned, current and in line with our sales trends. As a result, we are on the offense, focused on bringing in the latest and most compelling product offering that resonates with our customers.
In terms of our broader efforts to improve profitability, we recognize that the shift towards e-commerce is having an impact to our financial model. As we accelerate investments to support changes in customer expectations, our expenses, particularly in technology, supply chain and marketing, grew faster than sales. To address this, we are continuing to make operational changes to rightsize this trajectory. 
As we shared last quarter, we identified over 150 million in productivity improvements this year, of which roughly half has been realized to date. We are streamlining corporate headquarters and executed on a number of initiatives that will enhance the customer experience and improve our operating model.
In technology, we're on a path to modernize our platform and increase the productivity of delivering features that will improve the customer experience. For example, this year, we implemented new technology solutions that support our expanded loyalty program and online search engine. These modernized platforms enable us to serve customers in a more personalized and relevant way.
In supply chain, we've executed on several initiatives to improve operating performance. This included optimizing our supplier network for both inbound and outbound carriers, reducing split shipments to a greater allocation of merchandise to our fulfillment centers and editing out less-profitable items online. 
A year ago, we opened our East Coast fulfillment center, which has the potential to double our fulfillment capacity as we scale for growth. For customers we serve on the East Coast, we've been able to speed up delivery times by over 30% with lower unit shipping costs due to the increased proximity to our customers. In continuing these efforts, we are further integrating Trunk Club's operations into the Nordstrom fulfillment network with completion expected by mid-2017.
In marketing, we are repositioning our organization to better align with the customer journey and our strategic priorities around customer acquisition and retention. This includes strengthening our capabilities around customer analytics and digital engagement so that we can reach customers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Our expanded loyalty program demonstrates our efforts to rebalance our marketing resources towards a greater focus on personalization. This will help us better serve customers and increase their lifetime value.
In addition to the adjustments we've made to inventory and expense, we have reprioritized our capital investments to better align with changing customer expectations and strengthen our financial position. This resulted in a 10% reduction to our 5-year capital plan. Our reduced CapEx plan of $3.6 billion is appropriately balanced between store and technology investments. We have made a modest reduction to our Rack store expansion plans, given the growth of our online business, which has doubled since the launch of Nordstromrack.com a couple years ago. All of these efforts to improve our productivity will result in a more productive use of financial resources, which is beginning to positively impact our results.
During the second quarter, our cash flow from operating activities was $853 million, more than twice what it was last year.
Now I'd like to address our financial outlook. We have adjusted our earnings per share outlook to $2.60 to $2.75 from our prior outlook of $2.50 to $2.70. As we head into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to manage our business while also being mindful of uncertainty in retail trends.
In closing, as our business evolves, we remain confident in our ability to serve customers in an exemplary way and achieve sustainable profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we believe Nordstrom will emerge stronger and better positioned for future success.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

In terms of how that impacts our inventory plans going forward, I think for us, we're really well served to try to keep our inventory plans conservative.

And certainly, we also ensure that we have the right level of staffing there to ensure that we can deliver the right level of service. So I think that's something that we prefer not to compromise."

So we're dealing with immediate impact to date, but there's also a tail to it. So as we're adjusting merchandise over the last first half of the year, it has to go through our system, both the full-line stores and online and then to our Rack. And so some of that stuff that didn't sell well at full price has been challenged a little bit at off-price, and so we're taking the necessary markdowns in all of our businesses upfront to try to address what is the right price to clear these goods.

As far as comparing our regular price customers to our sales customers, the first thing to understand is anniversary is unlike any other sales we have and I think unlike any sales out there. It's not a clearance sale. So it's not older merchandise that's priced to clear out broken size rents. It is brand-new merchandise that full-size runs that we mark back up after the sale. So the behavior we've long seen from customers around our anniversary is much more around a regular-priced customer who is motivated by newness than it is the sale customer that's motivated by a price promotion.

We think Canada could have roughly 15 Racks when we're done. We'd start with our first Rack in 2018, I believe. And so when we put the 15 with kind of the reduced number, we're just shy of 300 at this point, but it's not a linear thing. When these opportunities come forward in key locations, we take advantage of that. And that could go up a little bit or could come down. But to the best of our knowledge today, we think it's just under 300 at this point by 2020."

Over the past several quarters, our team has been actively addressing our inventory expense and capital as we align the current sales trends. In the second quarter, the team made substantial progress by bringing down inventory in line with sales. We're also pleased with our customers' response to the Anniversary Sale. This year marked one of the best events we've had in our history, with an all-time high in sales volume. The strength of our anniversary event, along with the team's inventory and expense execution drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our anniversary performance reflected an improvement from our recent sales trends. We had a strong start to the sale, and the momentum continued throughout the event. Our sell-through rates were at record highs, putting us in a clean inventory position for the second half of the year.
Customers responded favorably to newness, with shoes and beauty leading our results. As a reminder, historically, every several years, we have a shift in our anniversary event, which moves 1 week of the event into the third quarter. As a result, our comp decrease of 1.2% was unfavorably impacted by roughly 250 basis points.
On May 18, we achieved an important milestone with the expansion of our loyalty program. Nordstrom Rewards serves as a powerful tool to drive incremental sales and trips. Even more importantly, it gives us an opportunity to strengthen relationships with customers. In response to feedback for more flexibility in joining our program, we've expanded it so that all of our customers can earn rewards regardless of how they choose to pay. We're encouraged with the strong response. We now have around 6 million total Rewards customers who shopped with us over the last year, up significantly from 4.7 million last quarter.
As we head into the second half of the year, we are focused on a number of initiatives to improve the customer experience and drive top line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we're expanding our reach to serve more customers. We're building on the success of our Canada expansion with 2 full-line store openings in Toronto. On September 16, we will open a flagship at Eaton Centre, followed by another store at Yorkdale Shopping Centre on October 21. 
In the U.S., we will open a second full-line store in Austin, Texas, on September 30. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we plan to open 15 stores this fall for a total of 215 by the end of the year.
Our merchandise strategy remains focused on providing our customers with newness. Our efforts to grow relevant brands that have limited distribution play an important role in creating excitement and attracting new customers. They now make up the majority of our top 20 fastest growing vendors, and we're continuing to expand the most highly sought-after brands, like IVY PARK, Madewell and Charlotte Tilbury, with new partnerships to come.
In addition to providing a differentiated product offering, we've recognized that our customers desire a personalized and convenient experience. To meet their evolving expectations, we are making digital enhancements to better serve customers no matter how they choose to shop with us. We have several initiatives underway that include new mobile features, improvements to our website and enhanced selling tools.
In the second quarter, we've made ongoing improvements to our mobile app, including features that enable customers to shop their store of choice and shop for items based on a visual search. This fall, we are piloting a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try in our stores.
In closing, our ability to deliver strong anniversary results while realigning inventory and expense speaks volumes to the quality of our team. We're proud of the team's high level of execution and remain committed to continuing this progress. Next quarter, we look forward to providing further updates on our efforts, including our expanded loyalty program and performance in Canada.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide additional color on our results and our ongoing efforts to improve our business models."

Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations. This includes the progress we have made adjusting our inventory and expense, which had a positive impact on our second quarter results. As we evolve our business model, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we can serve customers with high-quality products and services while achieving profitable growth.
Our earnings per diluted share of $0.67 were ahead of our expectations driven by our strong execution of the Anniversary Sale, inventory management and expense control. We are also continuing to see benefits from the strategic growth investments we've made to fuel growth in new markets and e-commerce. These investments, HauteLook, our expansion into Canada and Trunk Club, are expected to contribute over $1 billion to our top line in 2016.
Our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, had a combined comp decrease of 2.3%. This reflected an unfavorable impact of over 250 basis points from the event shift. The momentum of Nordstrom Rack, consisting of stores and online, continued with a comp increase of 5.3% on top of last year's increase of 6.5%.
Over the last several quarters, we have been aggressively adjusting our inventory plans as consumer demand has changed. We have a complex portfolio of businesses. And combined with the uncertainty of sales trends, our merchant and planning teams were making continuous adjustments. That high level of execution, combined with a compelling product offering for the Anniversary Sale, drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our inventories are well positioned, current and in line with our sales trends. As a result, we are on the offense, focused on bringing in the latest and most compelling product offering that resonates with our customers.
In terms of our broader efforts to improve profitability, we recognize that the shift towards e-commerce is having an impact to our financial model. As we accelerate investments to support changes in customer expectations, our expenses, particularly in technology, supply chain and marketing, grew faster than sales. To address this, we are continuing to make operational changes to rightsize this trajectory. 
As we shared last quarter, we identified over 150 million in productivity improvements this year, of which roughly half has been realized to date. We are streamlining corporate headquarters and executed on a number of initiatives that will enhance the customer experience and improve our operating model.
In technology, we're on a path to modernize our platform and increase the productivity of delivering features that will improve the customer experience. For example, this year, we implemented new technology solutions that support our expanded loyalty program and online search engine. These modernized platforms enable us to serve customers in a more personalized and relevant way.
In supply chain, we've executed on several initiatives to improve operating performance. This included optimizing our supplier network for both inbound and outbound carriers, reducing split shipments to a greater allocation of merchandise to our fulfillment centers and editing out less-profitable items online. 
A year ago, we opened our East Coast fulfillment center, which has the potential to double our fulfillment capacity as we scale for growth. For customers we serve on the East Coast, we've been able to speed up delivery times by over 30% with lower unit shipping costs due to the increased proximity to our customers. In continuing these efforts, we are further integrating Trunk Club's operations into the Nordstrom fulfillment network with completion expected by mid-2017.
In marketing, we are repositioning our organization to better align with the customer journey and our strategic priorities around customer acquisition and retention. This includes strengthening our capabilities around customer analytics and digital engagement so that we can reach customers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Our expanded loyalty program demonstrates our efforts to rebalance our marketing resources towards a greater focus on personalization. This will help us better serve customers and increase their lifetime value.
In addition to the adjustments we've made to inventory and expense, we have reprioritized our capital investments to better align with changing customer expectations and strengthen our financial position. This resulted in a 10% reduction to our 5-year capital plan. Our reduced CapEx plan of $3.6 billion is appropriately balanced between store and technology investments. 
We have made a modest reduction to our Rack store expansion plans, given the growth of our online business, which has doubled since the launch of Nordstromrack.com a couple years ago. All of these efforts to improve our productivity will result in a more productive use of financial resources, which is beginning to positively impact our results.
During the second quarter, our cash flow from operating activities was $853 million, more than twice what it was last year.
Now I'd like to address our financial outlook. We have adjusted our earnings per share outlook to $2.60 to $2.75 from our prior outlook of $2.50 to $2.70. As we head into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to manage our business while also being mindful of uncertainty in retail trends.
In closing, as our business evolves, we remain confident in our ability to serve customers in an exemplary way and achieve sustainable profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we believe Nordstrom will emerge stronger and better positioned for future success.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

I think we've got categories within there. Boots were particularly good for us in shoes. In apparel, our denim business was strong as were sweaters. In terms of how that impacts our inventory plans going forward, I think for us, we're really well served to try to keep our inventory plans conservative. We've been able to prove over the years that we can exceed sales plans with concerted [ph] inventory plans. And when you do that, I mean, obviously, it just -- it creates a good scenario for us in reducing markdown. So I think while we're happy about the sales results, we're very cautious not to overinvest either our plans or just in a way that we're allocating inventory. So we're still taking a cautious approach over the second half."

So we're dealing with immediate impact to date, but there's also a tail to it. So as we're adjusting merchandise over the last first half of the year, it has to go through our system, both the full-line stores and online and then to our Racks.

Over the past several quarters, our team has been actively addressing our inventory expense and capital as we align the current sales trends. In the second quarter, the team made substantial progress by bringing down inventory in line with sales. We're also pleased with our customers' response to the Anniversary Sale. This year marked one of the best events we've had in our history, with an all-time high in sales volume. The strength of our anniversary event, along with the team's inventory and expense execution drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our anniversary performance reflected an improvement from our recent sales trends. We had a strong start to the sale, and the momentum continued throughout the event. Our sell-through rates were at record highs, putting us in a clean inventory position for the second half of the year.
Customers responded favorably to newness, with shoes and beauty leading our results. As a reminder, historically, every several years, we have a shift in our anniversary event, which moves 1 week of the event into the third quarter. As a result, our comp decrease of 1.2% was unfavorably impacted by roughly 250 basis points.
On May 18, we achieved an important milestone with the expansion of our loyalty program. Nordstrom Rewards serves as a powerful tool to drive incremental sales and trips. Even more importantly, it gives us an opportunity to strengthen relationships with customers. In response to feedback for more flexibility in joining our program, we've expanded it so that all of our customers can earn rewards regardless of how they choose to pay. We're encouraged with the strong response. We now have around 6 million total Rewards customers who shopped with us over the last year, up significantly from 4.7 million last quarter.
As we head into the second half of the year, we are focused on a number of initiatives to improve the customer experience and drive top line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we're expanding our reach to serve more customers. We're building on the success of our Canada expansion with 2 full-line store openings in Toronto. On September 16, we will open a flagship at Eaton Centre, followed by another store at Yorkdale Shopping Centre on October 21. 
In the U.S., we will open a second full-line store in Austin, Texas, on September 30. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we plan to open 15 stores this fall for a total of 215 by the end of the year.
Our merchandise strategy remains focused on providing our customers with newness. Our efforts to grow relevant brands that have limited distribution play an important role in creating excitement and attracting new customers. They now make up the majority of our top 20 fastest growing vendors, and we're continuing to expand the most highly sought-after brands, like IVY PARK, Madewell and Charlotte Tilbury, with new partnerships to come.
In addition to providing a differentiated product offering, we've recognized that our customers desire a personalized and convenient experience. To meet their evolving expectations, we are making digital enhancements to better serve customers no matter how they choose to shop with us. We have several initiatives underway that include new mobile features, improvements to our website and enhanced selling tools.
In the second quarter, we've made ongoing improvements to our mobile app, including features that enable customers to shop their store of choice and shop for items based on a visual search. This fall, we are piloting a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try in our stores.
In closing, our ability to deliver strong anniversary results while realigning inventory and expense speaks volumes to the quality of our team. We're proud of the team's high level of execution and remain committed to continuing this progress.

Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations. This includes the progress we have made adjusting our inventory and expense, which had a positive impact on o",899,"Thanks, Blake. Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations. This includes the progress we have made adjusting our inventory and expense, which had a positive impact on our second quarter results. As we evolve our business model, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we can serve customers with high-quality products and services while achieving profitable growth.
Our earnings per diluted share of $0.67 were ahead of our expectations driven by our strong execution of the Anniversary Sale, inventory management and expense control. We are also continuing to see benefits from the strategic growth investments we've made to fuel growth in new markets and e-commerce. These investments, HauteLook, our expansion into Canada and Trunk Club, are expected to contribute over $1 billion to our top line in 2016.
Our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, had a combined comp decrease of 2.3%. This reflected an unfavorable impact of over 250 basis points from the event shift. The momentum of Nordstrom Rack, consisting of stores and online, continued with a comp increase of 5.3% on top of last year's increase of 6.5%.
Over the last several quarters, we have been aggressively adjusting our inventory plans as consumer demand has changed. We have a complex portfolio of businesses. And combined with the uncertainty of sales trends, our merchant and planning teams were making continuous adjustments. That high level of execution, combined with a compelling product offering for the Anniversary Sale, drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our inventories are well positioned, current and in line with our sales trends. As a result, we are on the offense, focused on bringing in the latest and most compelling product offering that resonates with our customers.
In terms of our broader efforts to improve profitability, we recognize that the shift towards e-commerce is having an impact to our financial model. As we accelerate investments to support changes in customer expectations, our expenses, particularly in technology, supply chain and marketing, grew faster than sales. To address this, we are continuing to make operational changes to rightsize this trajectory. 
As we shared last quarter, we identified over 150 million in productivity improvements this year, of which roughly half has been realized to date. We are streamlining corporate headquarters and executed on a number of initiatives that will enhance the customer experience and improve our operating model.
In technology, we're on a path to modernize our platform and increase the productivity of delivering features that will improve the customer experience. For example, this year, we implemented new technology solutions that support our expanded loyalty program and online search engine. These modernized platforms enable us to serve customers in a more personalized and relevant way.
In supply chain, we've executed on several initiatives to improve operating performance. This included optimizing our supplier network for both inbound and outbound carriers, reducing split shipments to a greater allocation of merchandise to our fulfillment centers and editing out less-profitable items online. 
A year ago, we opened our East Coast fulfillment center, which has the potential to double our fulfillment capacity as we scale for growth. For customers we serve on the East Coast, we've been able to speed up delivery times by over 30% with lower unit shipping costs due to the increased proximity to our customers. In continuing these efforts, we are further integrating Trunk Club's operations into the Nordstrom fulfillment network with completion expected by mid-2017.
In marketing, we are repositioning our organization to better align with the customer journey and our strategic priorities around customer acquisition and retention. This includes strengthening our capabilities around customer analytics and digital engagement so that we can reach customers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Our expanded loyalty program demonstrates our efforts to rebalance our marketing resources towards a greater focus on personalization. This will help us better serve customers and increase their lifetime value.
In addition to the adjustments we've made to inventory and expense, we have reprioritized our capital investments to better align with changing customer expectations and strengthen our financial position. This resulted in a 10% reduction to our 5-year capital plan. Our reduced CapEx plan of $3.6 billion is appropriately balanced between store and technology investments. 
We have made a modest reduction to our Rack store expansion plans, given the growth of our online business, which has doubled since the launch of Nordstromrack.com a couple years ago. All of these efforts to improve our productivity will result in a more productive use of financial resources, which is beginning to positively impact our results.
During the second quarter, our cash flow from operating activities was $853 million, more than twice what it was last year.
Now I'd like to address our financial outlook. We have adjusted our earnings per share outlook to $2.60 to $2.75 from our prior outlook of $2.50 to $2.70. As we head into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to manage our business while also being mindful of uncertainty in retail trends.
In closing, as our business evolves, we remain confident in our ability to serve customers in an exemplary way and achieve sustainable profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we believe Nordstrom will emerge stronger and better positioned for future success.

And when you do that, I mean, obviously, it just -- it creates a good scenario for us in reducing markdown.

In terms of the margin, and Mike alluded to it earlier, there are different components that affect the markdowns, and part of it is the merchandise that comes from the full-line stores. So we're dealing with immediate impact to date, but there's also a tail to it. So as we're adjusting merchandise over the last first half of the year, it has to go through our system, both the full-line stores and online and then to our Racks. And so some of that stuff that didn't sell well at full price has been challenged a little bit at off-price, and so we're taking the necessary markdowns in all of our businesses upfront to try to address what is the right price to clear these goods.

So just wondering, prior to the Anniversary Sale, if you were seeing any change in customer shopping patterns.

This is Erik, and Pete can take the second. As far as comparing our regular price customers to our sales customers, the first thing to understand is anniversary is unlike any other sales we have and I think unlike any sales out there. It's not a clearance sale. So it's not older merchandise that's priced to clear out at broken size runs. It is brand-new merchandise that full-size runs that we mark back up after the sale. So the behavior we've long seen from customers around our anniversary is much more around a regular-priced customer who is motivated by newness than it is the sale customer that's motivated by a price promotion. So in that regard, I would say our trends have really been unchanged that our business continues to be driven by customers who are looking for newness as opposed to customers looking for a one-day sale."

But I think it's fair to say that the promotional activity has stabilized a bit during the last quarter or so. To the point you've made, there's vendors out there choosing to participate in different ways than they may have in the past with our competitors. What we're trying to do is put ourselves in a real favorable position with vendors to be the retailer of choice for them. And what that means for most of the vendors we deal with is our desire, strong desire to sell at full price. And so we focus a lot on flow and newness and all that. So I think in terms of the price matching thing, it's -- we've had a lot of success and growth with brands again that are aligned with us and trying to sell at full price. And where you see kind of the growth by brand in some of these brands that maybe aren't entirely ubiquitously distributed, but have growth process and try to identify those brands kind of early on in that trajectory so we can work [ph] with them to grow really healthy business together."

Over the past several quarters, our team has been actively addressing our inventory expense and capital as we align the current sales trends. In the second quarter, the team made substantial progress by bringing down inventory in line with sales. We're also pleased with our customers' response to the Anniversary Sale. This year marked one of the best events we've had in our history, with an all-time high in sales volume. The strength of our anniversary event, along with the team's inventory and expense execution drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our anniversary performance reflected an improvement from our recent sales trends. We had a strong start to the sale, and the momentum continued throughout the event. Our sell-through rates were at record highs, putting us in a clean inventory position for the second half of the year.
Customers responded favorably to newness, with shoes and beauty leading our results. As a reminder, historically, every several years, we have a shift in our anniversary event, which moves 1 week of the event into the third quarter. As a result, our comp decrease of 1.2% was unfavorably impacted by roughly 250 basis points.
On May 18, we achieved an important milestone with the expansion of our loyalty program. Nordstrom Rewards serves as a powerful tool to drive incremental sales and trips. Even more importantly, it gives us an opportunity to strengthen relationships with customers. In response to feedback for more flexibility in joining our program, we've expanded it so that all of our customers can earn rewards regardless of how they choose to pay. We're encouraged with the strong response. We now have around 6 million total Rewards customers who shopped with us over the last year, up significantly from 4.7 million last quarter.
As we head into the second half of the year, we are focused on a number of initiatives to improve the customer experience and drive top line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we're expanding our reach to serve more customers. We're building on the success of our Canada expansion with 2 full-line store openings in Toronto. On September 16, we will open a flagship at Eaton Centre, followed by another store at Yorkdale Shopping Centre on October 21. 
In the U.S., we will open a second full-line store in Austin, Texas, on September 30. In our Nordstrom Rack brand, we plan to open 15 stores this fall for a total of 215 by the end of the year.
Our merchandise strategy remains focused on providing our customers with newness. Our efforts to grow relevant brands that have limited distribution play an important role in creating excitement and attracting new customers. They now make up the majority of our top 20 fastest growing vendors, and we're continuing to expand the most highly sought-after brands, like IVY PARK, Madewell and Charlotte Tilbury, with new partnerships to come.
In addition to providing a differentiated product offering, we've recognized that our customers desire a personalized and convenient experience. To meet their evolving expectations, we are making digital enhancements to better serve customers no matter how they choose to shop with us. We have several initiatives underway that include new mobile features, improvements to our website and enhanced selling tools.
In the second quarter, we've made ongoing improvements to our mobile app, including features that enable customers to shop their store of choice and shop for items based on a visual search. This fall, we are piloting a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try in our stores.
In closing, our ability to deliver strong anniversary results while realigning inventory and expense speaks volumes to the quality of our team. We're proud of the team's high level of execution and remain committed to continuing this progress. Next quarter, we look forward to providing further updates on our efforts, including our expanded loyalty program and performance in Canada.
I'll now turn it over to Mike, who'll provide additional color on our results and our ongoing efforts to improve our business models."

Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations.

Our second quarter results are reflective of the ongoing efforts to realign our resources and priorities to customer expectations. This includes the progress we have made adjusting our inventory and expense, which had a positive impact on our second quarter results. As we evolve our business model, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we can serve customers with high-quality products and services while achieving profitable growth.
Our earnings per diluted share of $0.67 were ahead of our expectations driven by our strong execution of the Anniversary Sale, inventory management and expense control. We are also continuing to see benefits from the strategic growth investments we've made to fuel growth in new markets and e-commerce. These investments, HauteLook, our expansion into Canada and Trunk Club, are expected to contribute over $1 billion to our top line in 2016.
Our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, had a combined comp decrease of 2.3%. This reflected an unfavorable impact of over 250 basis points from the event shift. The momentum of Nordstrom Rack, consisting of stores and online, continued with a comp increase of 5.3% on top of last year's increase of 6.5%.
Over the last several quarters, we have been aggressively adjusting our inventory plans as consumer demand has changed. We have a complex portfolio of businesses. And combined with the uncertainty of sales trends, our merchant and planning teams were making continuous adjustments. That high level of execution, combined with a compelling product offering for the Anniversary Sale, drove better-than-expected results for the second quarter. Our inventories are well positioned, current and in line with our sales trends. As a result, we are on the offense, focused on bringing in the latest and most compelling product offering that resonates with our customers.
In terms of our broader efforts to improve profitability, we recognize that the shift towards e-commerce is having an impact to our financial model. As we accelerate investments to support changes in customer expectations, our expenses, particularly in technology, supply chain and marketing, grew faster than sales. To address this, we are continuing to make operational changes to rightsize this trajectory. 
As we shared last quarter, we identified over 150 million in productivity improvements this year, of which roughly half has been realized to date. We are streamlining corporate headquarters and executed on a number of initiatives that will enhance the customer experience and improve our operating model.
In technology, we're on a path to modernize our platform and increase the productivity of delivering features that will improve the customer experience. For example, this year, we implemented new technology solutions that support our expanded loyalty program and online search engine. These modernized platforms enable us to serve customers in a more personalized and relevant way.
In supply chain, we've executed on several initiatives to improve operating performance. This included optimizing our supplier network for both inbound and outbound carriers, reducing split shipments to a greater allocation of merchandise to our fulfillment centers and editing out less-profitable items online. 
A year ago, we opened our East Coast fulfillment center, which has the potential to double our fulfillment capacity as we scale for growth. For customers we serve on the East Coast, we've been able to speed up delivery times by over 30% with lower unit shipping costs due to the increased proximity to our customers. In continuing these efforts, we are further integrating Trunk Club's operations into the Nordstrom fulfillment network with completion expected by mid-2017.
In marketing, we are repositioning our organization to better align with the customer journey and our strategic priorities around customer acquisition and retention. This includes strengthening our capabilities around customer analytics and digital engagement so that we can reach customers in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Our expanded loyalty program demonstrates our efforts to rebalance our marketing resources towards a greater focus on personalization. This will help us better serve customers and increase their lifetime value.
In addition to the adjustments we've made to inventory and expense, we have reprioritized our capital investments to better align with changing customer expectations and strengthen our financial position. This resulted in a 10% reduction to our 5-year capital plan. Our reduced CapEx plan of $3.6 billion is appropriately balanced between store and technology investments. 
We have made a modest reduction to our Rack store expansion plans, given the growth of our online business, which has doubled since the launch of Nordstromrack.com a couple years ago. All of these efforts to improve our productivity will result in a more productive use of financial resources, which is beginning to positively impact our results.
During the second quarter, our cash flow from operating activities was $853 million, more than twice what it was last year.
Now I'd like to address our financial outlook. We have adjusted our earnings per share outlook to $2.60 to $2.75 from our prior outlook of $2.50 to $2.70. As we head into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to manage our business while also being mindful of uncertainty in retail trends.
In closing, as our business evolves, we remain confident in our ability to serve customers in an exemplary way and achieve sustainable profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we believe Nordstrom will emerge stronger and better positioned for future success.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

I think we've got categories within there. Boots were particularly good for us in shoes. In apparel, our denim business was strong as were sweaters. In terms of how that impacts our inventory plans going forward, I think for us, we're really well served to try to keep our inventory plans conservative. We've been able to prove over the years that we can exceed sales plans with conservative inventory plans. And when you do that, I mean, obviously, it just -- it creates a good scenario for us in reducing markdown. So I think while we're happy about the sales results, we're very cautious not to overinvest either our plans or just in a way that we're allocating inventory.

We're still working through the challenges of taking online returns in the stores and finding the right way to balance our inventories based on that kind of flow. And so that caused us to take some more markdowns. Now that being said, we continue to make progress there, and we're narrowing the gap. And I think as we go forward, that should continue to be a better news story for us. In terms of full-line, the markdowns, I wouldn't say the markdowns were necessarily better than they were last year, but they were certainly better than our plan for the second quarter."

And where it does change very slightly is if we change, in any material way, the amount of Racks we have because the full-line stores have been fairly consistent. But it's approximately 15% of the merchandise at this point comes from the full-line stores and then the rest of our merchandise are with our top vendors that have close-outs and it's -- and that merchandise allows us to be very current and have good offering and sizes and balance. In terms of the margin, and Mike alluded to it earlier, there are different components that affect the markdowns, and part of it is the merchandise that comes from the full-line stores. So we're dealing with immediate impact to date, but there's also a tail to it. So as we're adjusting merchandise over the last first half of the year, it has to go through our system, both the full-line stores and online and then to our Racks. And so some of that stuff that didn't sell well at full price has been challenged a little bit at off-price, and so we're taking the necessary markdowns in all of our businesses upfront to try to address what is the right price to clear these goods. And I think overall the most important thing is whether it's the Rack or our stores, we're in one of the best inventory positions we've been in many years. We're able to respond to the customer, partner with our vendors and have good flow, and a lot of good things come from that."

This is Erik, and Pete can take the second. As far as comparing our regular price customers to our sales customers, the first thing to understand is anniversary is unlike any other sales we have and I think unlike any sales out there. It's not a clearance sale. So it's not older merchandise that's priced to clear out at broken size runs. It is brand-new merchandise that full-size runs that we mark back up after the sale. So the behavior we've long seen from customers around our anniversary is much more around a regular-priced customer who is motivated by newness than it is the sale customer that's motivated by a price promotion.

So I think that that's going to be an ongoing deal for us. Outside of that if you look at it more kind of in the bigger picture, I mean, it has so much to do with what we have to offer, the products we have to offer, and a big part of our success online is we're able to add to our selection there, that was really helpful. Customers like that a lot. And I think one of the things that happens slightly on the downside, the context, it creates for some stores, there's so much more available online than there might be in any given store. I think our ongoing challenge just to do the best we can to make sure each store as the best possible product offer that it has. And the kind of stuff that customers ask about are the things that are hard to get, and they asked for that them everywhere and that has to do with some of the limited distribution stuff that's obvious -- that's usually connected to design or what have you. But knowing we can't get that everywhere, we do the best we can to put it in places we think it will be successful, but that's -- I mean, that been an ongoing subject for us forever, and it's just retailing stuff that we work on every day."

Our third quarter results reflected our team's substantial progress in making both adjustments to align the current business trends and longer-term changes to our business model. Before we get started, I'd like to first address",675,"Good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results reflected our team's substantial progress in making both adjustments to align the current business trends and longer-term changes to our business model. 
Before we get started, I'd like to first address the write-down related to Trunk Club. In August 2014, we acquired this start-up as a new channel to serve customers in a personalized and relevant way. Unfortunately, the business has not performed to the expectations we had when we acquired it, and as a result, we have reduced the value of that asset. Trunk Club continues to be well aligned with our customer service commitment and value proposition. We remain committed to this business and view it as a part of our customer strategy. Mike will later discuss the adjustments we are making to assure its future success.
Now I'd like to move on to our third quarter performance. From a top line perspective, our third quarter benefited from 1 week of our Anniversary Sale shifting into the quarter. This shift contributed to a comp increase of 2.4% over last year. To get a better sense of underlying trends, the combined second and third quarter comps were up 0.4%. This is consistent with the trends we've been seeing over the past year.
As the pace of customer expectations continues to accelerate, it's even more important for us to remain focused on the customer. We are in the midst of evolving our business model to better support shifts and how our customers are shopping with us. While this is a continuous journey, we've made considerable changes in the way we operate to improve the customer experience and increase our productivity. We're extremely proud of our team's efforts over the past year to align inventories and gain greater efficiencies. These outcomes have positively impacted our third quarter results and adds to our confidence as we continue to make improvements to our operating model. Our strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms with a high level of product and service they expect from us.
This quarter, we have executed on a number of initiatives to better serve customers and drive top line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we achieved another milestone related to our Canada expansion with 2 successful store openings in Toronto at Eaton Centre and Yorkdale Center. With Toronto being the fourth largest market in North America, we believe these stores will be among our top volume stores. They are in outstanding locations, and we're excited about their potential. We now have 5 stores opened in Canada and look forward to opening our sixth, also in greater Toronto area at Shirley Gardens next fall.
In the U.S., we have successful opening of our second store in Austin, Texas at the domain. 
Our Rack business serves as a great way of attracting new customers to Nordstrom. We expanded our reach with 15 new stores this fall for a total of 215 Racks. These stores are complemented by our NordstromRack.com and HauteLook businesses, which are expected to reach over $700 million in sales this year. Offering a curated product assortment is an integral element of our customer strategy. 
In the third quarter, we launched new collaborations with J.Crew and denim brand with American. Also in collaboration with Nike, we rolled out a women's lifestyle concept shop at our downtown Seattle and Eaton Centre stores, followed by our Michigan Avenue store later this month. Through these partnerships, we are able to give our customers compelling product that has limited distribution.
We have an unwavering focus on serving customers. This approach guides us on how we set our priorities, allocate resources and accelerate the speed of our execution. As we head into the holiday season, we are planning the business consistent with the sales trends we've been seeing over the past year. 
On the inventory and expense side, we have strong momentum in place and remain committed to continuing our progress to ensure we're best positioned to manage our business.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike."

Our third quarter results demonstrated the progress we are making to improve our operating model. Over the last year, we have been addressing not only the challenges of top line trends, but the longer-term impacts of operating a fast-growin",699,"Thanks, Blake. Our third quarter results demonstrated the progress we are making to improve our operating model. Over the last year, we have been addressing not only the challenges of top line trends, but the longer-term impacts of operating a fast-growing e-commerce business. In this quarter's performance, we realized the operating leverage generated by these adjustments, in particular, from inventory and expense. We will continue to identify opportunities to improve our longer-term performance as our business continues to evolve.
Before providing more color on the quarter, I'd like to also address our plans related to Trunk Club. As Blake mentioned, because of our revised performance expectations, we recognized a noncash impairment in the Trunk Club goodwill of $197 million. While we have reached out our performance goals, we continue to believe that Trunk Club provides us with unique customer experience that we can build upon. To that end, we are making a number of improvements to better serve customers. The initial results have been favorable for our customers and improve our economics.
To help get Trunk Club customers a broader selection of brands, we are also integrating supply chain and fulfillment capabilities over the next year. We anticipate that these and other changes we're making will drive continued growth and improve Trunk Club's results going forward.
Moving to our third quarter performance. Our top line trends were generally consistent with what we've experienced over the past year. We've continued our progress in growing relevant brands that have limited distribution.
In our full price business, our top 20 fastest growing vendors, which includes many of the brands with limited distribution and our private label business, collectively grew 20% in the third quarter. In response to the changes in consumer demand, we aggressively aligned our inventory plans and made significant progress in stabilizing our operating margins over the past 2 quarters combined. We ended the third quarter with a positive spread between sales and inventory growth. Inventories are well positioned and current as we head into the important holiday season.
Stepping back, we've made strategic investments over the past 5 years to meet changing customer expectations. This enabled us to grow our top line by 50%. As we move forward, we will continue to adapt our operating model to provide an exemplary customer experience and deliver long-term profitable growth.
This year, we've made tremendous progress in rightsizing our expense trajectory to increased efficiencies across our enterprise capabilities. This includes our efforts to expand our digital experience, which is enabled through technology. For example, we've upgraded a vast majority of our website platform, which allows us to accelerate the continuous delivery of new customer-facing features.
From a productivity standpoint, we've prioritized our investments toward modernizing our infrastructure and implementing the highest value customer experiences.
In supply chain, we have implemented a number of initiatives focused on improving the customer experience and reducing per unit costs. Based on these efforts, we are on track to achieve savings of roughly $50 million in shipping and fulfillment costs this year. 
In marketing, our expanded Nordstrom awards loyalty program represents a meaningful opportunity to directly engage with customers, drive customer lifetime value and increase the efficiency of our marketing spend. Since the launch of our nontender offer in mid-May, we now have more than 7 million customers in our overall program, up over 40% from a year ago. In the third quarter, the spend from our loyalty customers made up 45% of our sales, which increased around 600 basis points from last year.
Finally, I'd like to provide additional color on our financial outlook for the year. Excluding impairment charge, we've raised our full year earnings per share outlook to $2.85 to $2.95 from our prior outlook of $2.60 to $2.75 to incorporate third quarter results. From a top line perspective, we anticipate a continuation of trends yielding flat comps for the year.
In closing, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we provide a relevant best-in-class experience for our customers while achieving profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we are confident that Nordstrom remain relevant to customers now and in the future.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

So while we do, accounting was a break things out, full-line stores and e-commerce, there's so much overlap between those businesses and that is increasing. And Jamie gave one example there. The store reserve, which is we're excited about because it's a very explicit seamless experience that connects shopping journey that starts online and ends up in a store. We know that have lots of our customers have been shopping, but they have to start -- they start online and when they go in the store, they want to actually see it, touch it, feel it, try it on and start over. This allows them not to start over. So a lot of our initiatives are around continuing to take out friction between the channels and really deliver experience that is consistent with how customers want to shop. But that being said, online the last quarter, some of our initiatives that got put into place. We have a redesigned homeplace experience that's performing well. We have a store mode in search and browse that is both on our full website and in our app, and that's again would be an example of really connecting online and off-line shopping experience. We've improved our navigation, had some personalization, small stuff that we're excited about. And our redesign of our order confirmation, order history. A lot of these are some subtle changes that don't pop up the page, but have -- had positive results as we then maybe testing on them. On the app, in addition to the store mode, we launched visual search. We also integrated -- we had a separate catalog app we've integrated into our main NordstromRack.com app, and we also launched search and messaging within I message.

So a couple of examples there are at the Rack business, the off-price business continues to grow faster than the other businesses. That has a lower gross margin element. It also has a lot of expense element so the operating margin tends to be pretty comparable, but it does affect that gross profit line. In addition, the growth of our loyalty business has put in some pressure on that over time. I think in terms of what have been the more shorter-term impacts and some of the good news we've seen recently that's been a function of the sales trends we've seen, the excess inventory last year. And as we start to come out of that and have better controls over our inventories based on the current environment we're in, we're seeing positive in the margin. But I think it's fair to say it's tough to see getting that line back to historical highs, because there are structural elements to it, both at the business level as well as the assortment level where we're seeing some changes in mix."

Our third quarter results reflected our team's substantial progress in making both adjustments to align the current business trends and longer-term changes to our business model. Before we get started, I'd like to first address",673,"Good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results reflected our team's substantial progress in making both adjustments to align the current business trends and longer-term changes to our business model. 
Before we get started, I'd like to first address the write-down related to Trunk Club. In August 2014, we acquired this start-up as a new channel to serve customers in a personalized and relevant way. Unfortunately, the business has not performed to the expectations we had when we acquired it, and as a result, we have reduced the value of that asset. Trunk Club continues to be well aligned with our customer service commitment and value proposition. We remain committed to this business and view it as a part of our customer strategy. Mike will later discuss the adjustments we are making to assure its future success.
Now I'd like to move on to our third quarter performance. From a top line perspective, our third quarter benefited from 1 week of our Anniversary Sale shifting into the quarter. This shift contributed to a comp increase of 2.4% over last year. To get a better sense of underlying trends, the combined second and third quarter comps were up 0.4%. This is consistent with the trends we've been seeing over the past year.
As the pace of customer expectations continues to accelerate, it's even more important for us to remain focused on the customer. We are in the midst of evolving our business model to better support shifts in how our customers are shopping with us. While this is a continuous journey, we've made considerable changes in the way we operate to improve the customer experience and increase our productivity. We're extremely proud of our team's efforts over the past year to align inventories and gain greater efficiencies. These outcomes have positively impacted our third quarter results and adds to our confidence as we continue to make improvements to our operating model. Our strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms with a high level of product and service they expect from us.
This quarter, we have executed on a number of initiatives to better serve customers and drive top line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we achieved another milestone related to our Canada expansion with 2 successful store openings in Toronto at Eaton Centre and Yorkdale Center. With Toronto being the fourth-largest market in North America, we believe these stores will be among our top volume stores. They are in outstanding locations, and we're excited about their potential. We now have 5 stores open in Canada and look forward to opening our sixth, also in greater Toronto area at Sherway Gardens next fall. In the U.S., we have successful opening of our second store in Austin, Texas, at the Domain. 
Our Rack business serves as a great way of attracting new customers to Nordstrom. We expanded our reach with 15 new stores this fall for a total of 215 Racks. These stores are complemented by our nordstromrack.com and HauteLook businesses, which are expected to reach over 700 million sales this year. Offering a curated product assortment is an integral element of our customer strategy. 
In the third quarter, we launched new collaborations with J.Crew and denim brand Good American. Also in collaboration with Nike, we rolled out a women's lifestyle concept shop at our downtown Seattle and Eaton Centre stores, followed by our Michigan Avenue store later this month. Through these partnerships, we were able to give our customers compelling product that has limited distribution.
We have an unwavering focus on serving customers. This approach guides us on how we set our priorities, allocate resources and accelerate the speed of our execution. As we head into the holiday season, we are planning the business consistent with the sales trends we've been seeing over the past year. 
On the inventory and expense side, we have strong momentum in place and remain committed to continuing our progress to ensure we're best positioned to manage our business.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike."

Our third quarter results demonstrated the progress we are making to improve our operating model. Over the last year, we've been addressing not only the challenges of top line trends but the longer-term impacts of operating a fast-growing e-commerce business. In this quarter's performance, we realized the operating leverage generated by these adjustments, in particular, from inventory and expense. We will continue to identify opportunities to improve our longer-term performance as our business continues to evolve.
Before providing more color on the quarter, I'd like to also address our plans related to Trunk Club. As Blake mentioned, because of our revised performance expectations, we recognized a noncash impairment in the Trunk Club goodwill of $197 million. While we've reset our performance goals, we continue to believe that Trunk Club provides us with unique customer experience that we can build upon. To that end, we are making a number of improvements to better serve customers. The initial results have been favorable for our customers and improved our economics.
To help get Trunk Club customers a broader selection of brands, we are also integrating supply chain and fulfillment capabilities over the next year. We anticipate that these and other changes we're making will drive continued growth and improve Trunk Club's results going forward.
Moving to our third quarter performance. Our top line trends were generally consistent with what we've experienced over the past year. We've continued our progress in growing relevant brands that have limited distribution.
In our full price business, our top 20 fastest growing vendors, which includes many of the brands with limited distribution and our private label business, collectively grew 20% in the third quarter. In response to the changes in consumer demand, we aggressively aligned our inventory plans and made significant progress in stabilizing our operating margins over the past 2 quarters combined. We ended the third quarter with a positive spread between sales and inventory growth. Inventories are well positioned and current as we head into the important holiday season.
Stepping back, we've made strategic investments over the past 5 years to meet changing customer expectations. This enabled us to grow our top line by 50%. As we move forward, we will continue to adapt our operating model to provide an exemplary customer experience and deliver long-term profitable growth.
This year, we've made tremendous progress in rightsizing our expense trajectory through increased efficiencies across our enterprise capabilities. This includes our efforts to expand our digital experience, which is enabled through technology. For example, we've upgraded a vast majority of our website platform, which allows us to accelerate the continuous delivery of new customer-facing features.
From a productivity standpoint, we've prioritized our investments toward modernizing our infrastructure and implementing the highest-value customer experiences.
In supply chain, we have implemented a number of initiatives focused on improving the customer experience and reducing per-unit costs. Based on these efforts, we are on track to achieve savings of roughly $50 million in shipping and fulfillment costs this year. 
In marketing, our expanded Nordstrom awards loyalty program represents a meaningful opportunity to directly engage with customers, drive customer lifetime value and increase the efficiency of our marketing spend. Since the launch of our nontender offer in mid-May, we now have more than 7 million customers in our overall program, up over 40% from a year ago. In the third quarter, the spend from our loyalty customers made up 45% of our sales, which increased around 600 basis points from last year.
Finally, I'd like to provide additional color on our financial outlook for the year. Excluding impairment charge, we've raised our full year earnings per share outlook to $2.85 to $2.95 from our prior outlook of $2.60 to $2.75 to incorporate third quarter results. From a top line perspective, we anticipate a continuation of trends yielding flat comps for the year.
In closing, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we provide a relevant best-in-class experience for our customers while achieving profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we are confident that Nordstrom will remain relevant to customers now and in the future.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

So while we do accounting-wise break things out, full-line stores and e-commerce, there's so much overlap between those businesses, and that is increasing. And Jamie gave one example there, the store reserve, which is we're excited about because it's a very explicit seamless experience that connects a shopping journey that starts online and ends up in a store. We know that's how lots of our customers have been shopping, but they have to start -- they start online, and when they go in the store, they want to actually see it, touch it, feel it, try it on. They have to start over. This allows them not to start over. So a lot of our initiatives are around continuing to take out friction between the channels and really deliver experience that is consistent with how customers want to shop. But that being said, online in the last quarter, some of our initiatives that got put into place, we have a redesigned homepage experience that is performing well. We have a store mode in search and browse that is both on our full website and in our app, and that's, again, would be an example of really connecting online and off-line shopping experience. We've improved our navigation, had some personalization, small stuff that we're excited about and our redesign of our order confirmation, order history. A lot of these are some subtle changes that don't pop up the page but have -- had positive results as we've done AB testing on them. On the app, in addition to the store mode, we launched visual search. We also integrated -- we had a separate catalog app we've integrated into our main Nordstrom app. We also launched search and messaging within I iMessage.

There's several components that have been affecting that line, and the ones that have had the most significant impact are really related to the evolving mix of our business in the way our business is changing. So a couple of examples there are at the Rack business, the off-price business continues to grow faster than the other businesses. That has a lower gross margin element. It also has a lower expense element, so the operating margin tends to be pretty comparable, but it does affect that gross profit line. In addition, the growth of our loyalty business has put in some pressure on that over time. I think in terms of what have been the more shorter-term impacts and some of the good news we've seen recently, that's been a function of the sales trends we've seen, the excess inventory last year. And as we start to come out of that and have better controls over our inventories based on the current environment we're in, we're seeing positive in the margin.

The nontender, we don't have that, and so we're attracting a much broader customer. It's allowing us to engage with a younger customer that is coming through their cycle with us and introduce them to some of our benefits and to the conveniences of shopping with Nordstrom.

Our third quarter results reflected our team's substantial progress in making both adjustments to align the current business trends and longer-term changes to our business model. Before we get started, I'd like to first address",674,"Good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results reflected our team's substantial progress in making both adjustments to align the current business trends and longer-term changes to our business model. 
Before we get started, I'd like to first address the write-down related to Trunk Club. In August 2014, we acquired this start-up as a new channel to serve customers in a personalized and relevant way. Unfortunately, the business has not performed to the expectations we had when we acquired it, and as a result, we have reduced the value of that asset. Trunk Club continues to be well aligned with our customer service commitment and value proposition. We remain committed to this business and view it as a part of our customer strategy. Mike will later discuss the adjustments we are making to assure its future success.
Now I'd like to move on to our third quarter performance. From a top line perspective, our third quarter benefited from 1 week of our Anniversary Sale shifting into the quarter. This shift contributed to a comp increase of 2.4% over last year. To get a better sense of underlying trends, the combined second and third quarter comps were up 0.4%. This is consistent with the trends we've been seeing over the past year.
As the pace of customer expectations continues to accelerate, it's even more important for us to remain focused on the customer. We are in the midst of evolving our business model to better support shifts in how our customers are shopping with us. While this is a continuous journey, we've made considerable changes in the way we operate to improve the customer experience and increase our productivity. We're extremely proud of our team's efforts over the past year to align inventories and gain greater efficiencies. These outcomes have positively impacted our third quarter results and add to our confidence as we continue to make improvements to our operating model. Our strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms with a high level of product and service they expect from us.
This quarter, we have executed on a number of initiatives to better serve customers and drive top line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we achieved another milestone related to our Canada expansion, with 2 successful store openings in Toronto at Eaton Centre and Yorkdale Center. With Toronto being the fourth-largest market in North America, we believe these stores will be among our top volume stores. They are in outstanding locations, and we're excited about their potential. We now have 5 stores open in Canada and look forward to opening our sixth, also in greater Toronto area, at Sherway Gardens next fall. In the U.S., we have the successful opening of our second store in Austin, Texas, at the Domain. 
Our Rack business serves as a great way of attracting new customers to Nordstrom. We expanded our reach with 15 new stores this fall, for a total of 215 Racks. These stores are complemented by our nordstromrack.com and HauteLook businesses, which are expected to reach over 700 million sales this year. Offering a curated product assortment is an integral element of our customer strategy. 
In the third quarter, we launched new collaborations with J.Crew and denim brand Good American. Also in collaboration with Nike, we rolled out a women's lifestyle concept shop at our downtown Seattle and Eaton Centre stores, followed by our Michigan Avenue store later this month. Through these partnerships, we were able to give our customers compelling product that had limited distribution.
We have an unwavering focus on serving customers. This approach guides us on how we set our priorities, allocate resources and accelerate the speed of our execution. As we head into the holiday season, we are planning the business consistent with the sales trends we've been seeing over the past year. 
On the inventory and expense side, we have strong momentum in place and remain committed to continuing our progress to ensure we're best positioned to manage our business.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike."
32215,407651486,1084116,"Nordstrom Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2016",2016-11-10,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake. Our third quarter results demonstrated the progress we are making to improve our operating model. Over the last year, we've been addressing not only the challenges of top line trends but the longer-term impacts of operating a fast-growing e",696,"Thanks, Blake. Our third quarter results demonstrated the progress we are making to improve our operating model. Over the last year, we've been addressing not only the challenges of top line trends but the longer-term impacts of operating a fast-growing e-commerce business. In this quarter's performance, we realized operating leverage generated by these adjustments, in particular, from inventory and expense. We will continue to identify opportunities to improve our longer-term performance as our business continues to evolve.
Before providing more color on the quarter, I'd like to also address our plans related to Trunk Club. As Blake mentioned, because of our revised performance expectations, we recognized a noncash impairment in the Trunk Club goodwill of $197 million. While we've reset our performance goals, we continue to believe that Trunk Club provides us with a unique customer experience that we can build upon. To that end, we are making a number of improvements to better serve customers. The initial results have been favorable for our customers and improved our economics.
To help get Trunk Club customers a broader selection of brands, we are also integrating supply chain and fulfillment capabilities over the next year. We anticipate that these and other changes we're making will drive continued growth and improve Trunk Club's results going forward.
Moving to our third quarter performance. Our top line trends were generally consistent with what we've experienced over the past year. We've continued our progress in growing relevant brands that have limited distribution.
In our full price business, our top 20 fastest growing vendors, which includes many of the brands with limited distribution, and our private label business, collectively grew 20% in the third quarter. In response to the changes in consumer demand, we aggressively aligned our inventory plans and made significant progress in stabilizing our operating margins over the past 2 quarters combined. We ended the third quarter with a positive spread between sales and inventory growth. Inventories are well positioned and current as we head into the important holiday season.
Stepping back, we've made strategic investments over the past 5 years to meet changing customer expectations. This enabled us to grow our top line by 50%. As we move forward, we will continue to adapt our operating model to provide an exemplary customer experience and deliver long-term profitable growth.
This year, we've made tremendous progress in rightsizing our expense trajectory through increased efficiencies across our enterprise capabilities. This includes our efforts to expand our digital experience, which is enabled through technology. For example, we've upgraded a vast majority of our website platform, which allows us to accelerate the continuous delivery of new customer-facing features.
From a productivity standpoint, we've prioritized our investments toward modernizing our infrastructure and implementing the highest-value customer experiences.
In supply chain, we have implemented a number of initiatives focused on improving the customer experience and reducing per-unit costs. Based on these efforts, we are on track to achieve savings of roughly $50 million in shipping and fulfillment costs this year. 
In marketing, our expanded Nordstrom Awards loyalty program represents a meaningful opportunity to directly engage with customers, drive customer lifetime value and increase the efficiency of our marketing spend. Since the launch of our nontender offer in mid-May, we now have more than 7 million customers in our overall program, up over 40% from a year ago. In the third quarter, the spend from our loyalty customers made up 45% of our sales, which increased around 600 basis points from last year.
Finally, I'd like to provide additional color on our financial outlook for the year. Excluding the impairment charge, we've raised our full year earnings per share outlook to $2.85 to $2.95 from our prior outlook of $2.60 to $2.75 to incorporate third quarter results. From a top line perspective, we anticipate a continuation of trends yielding flat comps for the year.
In closing, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we provide a relevant best-in-class experience for our customers while achieving profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we are confident that Nordstrom will remain relevant to customers now and in the future.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

Well, just like the full-line stores, the inventory levels in off-price Nordstrom Rack are as current as we've seen in a long time. And we're fluid. We have open to buy and the flow's improving and the customer's responding to that.

So while we do accounting-wise break things out, full-line stores and e-commerce, there's so much overlap between those businesses, and that is increasing. And Jamie gave one example there, the store reserve, which is we're excited about because it's a very explicit seamless experience that connects a shopping journey that starts online and ends up in a store. We know that's how lots of our customers have been shopping, but they have to start -- they start online, and when they go in the store, they want to actually see it, touch it, feel it, try it on. They have to start over. This allows them not to start over. So a lot of our initiatives are around continuing to take out friction between the channels and really deliver an experience that is consistent with how customers want to shop. But that being said, online in the last quarter, some of our initiatives that got put into place, we have a redesigned homepage experience that is performing well. We have a store mode in search and browse that is both on our full website and in our app, and that's, again, would be an example of really connecting the online and off-line shopping experience. We've improved our navigation, had some personalization, small stuff that we're excited about and a redesign of our order confirmation, order history. A lot of these are some subtle changes that don't pop up the page but have -- had positive results as we've done AB testing on them. On the app, in addition to the store mode, we launched visual search. We also integrated -- we had a separate catalog app we've integrated into our main Nordstrom app. We also launched search and messaging within iMessage.

There's several components that have been affecting that line, and the ones that have had the most significant impact are really related to the evolving mix of our business and the way our business is changing. So a couple of examples there are at the Rack business, the off-price business continues to grow faster than the other businesses. That has a lower gross margin element. It also has a lower expense element, so the operating margin tends to be pretty comparable, but it does affect that gross profit line. In addition, the growth of our loyalty business has put in some pressure on that over time. I think in terms of what have been the more shorter-term impacts and some of the good news we've seen recently, that's been a function of the sales trends we've seen, the excess inventory last year. And as we start to come out of that and have better controls over our inventories based on the current environment we're in, we're seeing positive in the margin. But I think it's fair to say it's tough to see getting that line back to historical highs because there's structural elements to it, both at the business level as well as the assortment level where we're seeing some changes in mix."

Our third quarter results reflected our team's substantial progress in making both adjustments to align the current business trends and longer-term changes to our business model. Before we get started, I'd like to first address",674,"Good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results reflected our team's substantial progress in making both adjustments to align the current business trends and longer-term changes to our business model. 
Before we get started, I'd like to first address the write-down related to Trunk Club. In August 2014, we acquired this start-up as a new channel to serve customers in a personalized and relevant way. Unfortunately, the business has not performed to the expectations we had when we acquired it, and as a result, we have reduced the value of that asset. Trunk Club continues to be well aligned with our customer service commitment and value proposition. We remain committed to this business and view it as a part of our customer strategy. Mike will later discuss the adjustments we are making to assure its future success.
Now I'd like to move on to our third quarter performance. From a top line perspective, our third quarter benefited from 1 week of our Anniversary Sale shifting into the quarter. This shift contributed to a comp increase of 2.4% over last year. To get a better sense of underlying trends, the combined second and third quarter comps were up 0.4%. This is consistent with the trends we've been seeing over the past year.
As the pace of customer expectations continues to accelerate, it's even more important for us to remain focused on the customer. We are in the midst of evolving our business model to better support shifts in how our customers are shopping with us. While this is a continuous journey, we've made considerable changes in the way we operate to improve the customer experience and increase our productivity. We're extremely proud of our team's efforts over the past year to align inventories and gain greater efficiencies. These outcomes have positively impacted our third quarter results and add to our confidence as we continue to make improvements to our operating model. Our strategy is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms with a high level of product and service they expect from us.
This quarter, we have executed on a number of initiatives to better serve customers and drive top line growth. In our Nordstrom brand, we achieved another milestone related to our Canada expansion, with 2 successful store openings in Toronto at Eaton Centre and Yorkdale Center. With Toronto being the fourth-largest market in North America, we believe these stores will be among our top volume stores. They are in outstanding locations, and we're excited about their potential. We now have 5 stores open in Canada and look forward to opening our sixth, also in greater Toronto area, at Sherway Gardens next fall. In the U.S., we have the successful opening of our second store in Austin, Texas, at the Domain. 
Our Rack business serves as a great way of attracting new customers to Nordstrom. We expanded our reach with 15 new stores this fall, for a total of 215 Racks. These stores are complemented by our nordstromrack.com and HauteLook businesses, which are expected to reach over 700 million sales this year. Offering a curated product assortment is an integral element of our customer strategy. 
In the third quarter, we launched new collaborations with J.Crew and denim brand Good American. Also in collaboration with Nike, we rolled out a women's lifestyle concept shop at our downtown Seattle and Eaton Centre stores, followed by our Michigan Avenue store later this month. Through these partnerships, we were able to give our customers compelling product that had limited distribution.
We have an unwavering focus on serving customers. This approach guides us on how we set our priorities, allocate resources and accelerate the speed of our execution. As we head into the holiday season, we are planning the business consistent with the sales trends we've been seeing over the past year. 
On the inventory and expense side, we have strong momentum in place and remain committed to continuing our progress to ensure we're best positioned to manage our business.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike."

Our third quarter results demonstrated the progress we are making to improve our operating model. Over the last year, we've been addressing not only the challenges of top line trends but the longer-term impacts of operating a fast-growing e-commerce business. In this quarter's performance, we realized operating leverage generated by these adjustments, in particular, from inventory and expense. We will continue to identify opportunities to improve our longer-term performance as our business continues to evolve.
Before providing more color on the quarter, I'd like to also address our plans related to Trunk Club. As Blake mentioned, because of our revised performance expectations, we recognized a noncash impairment in the Trunk Club goodwill of $197 million. While we've reset our performance goals, we continue to believe that Trunk Club provides us with a unique customer experience that we can build upon. To that end, we are making a number of improvements to better serve customers. The initial results have been favorable for our customers and improved our economics.
To help get Trunk Club customers a broader selection of brands, we are also integrating supply chain and fulfillment capabilities over the next year. We anticipate that these and other changes we're making will drive continued growth and improve Trunk Club's results going forward.
Moving to our third quarter performance. Our top line trends were generally consistent with what we've experienced over the past year. We've continued our progress in growing relevant brands that have limited distribution.
In our full price business, our top 20 fastest growing vendors, which includes many of the brands with limited distribution, and our private label business, collectively grew 20% in the third quarter. In response to the changes in consumer demand, we aggressively aligned our inventory plans and made significant progress in stabilizing our operating margins over the past 2 quarters combined. We ended the third quarter with a positive spread between sales and inventory growth. Inventories are well positioned and current as we head into the important holiday season.
Stepping back, we've made strategic investments over the past 5 years to meet changing customer expectations. This enabled us to grow our top line by 50%. As we move forward, we will continue to adapt our operating model to provide an exemplary customer experience and deliver long-term profitable growth.
This year, we've made tremendous progress in rightsizing our expense trajectory through increased efficiencies across our enterprise capabilities. This includes our efforts to expand our digital experience, which is enabled through technology. For example, we've upgraded a vast majority of our website platform, which allows us to accelerate the continuous delivery of new customer-facing features.
From a productivity standpoint, we've prioritized our investments toward modernizing our infrastructure and implementing the highest-value customer experiences.
In supply chain, we have implemented a number of initiatives focused on improving the customer experience and reducing per-unit costs. Based on these efforts, we are on track to achieve savings of roughly $50 million in shipping and fulfillment costs this year. 
In marketing, our expanded Nordstrom Awards loyalty program represents a meaningful opportunity to directly engage with customers, drive customer lifetime value and increase the efficiency of our marketing spend. Since the launch of our nontender offer in mid-May, we now have more than 7 million customers in our overall program, up over 40% from a year ago. In the third quarter, the spend from our loyalty customers made up 45% of our sales, which increased around 600 basis points from last year.
Finally, I'd like to provide additional color on our financial outlook for the year. Excluding the impairment charge, we've raised our full year earnings per share outlook to $2.85 to $2.95 from our prior outlook of $2.60 to $2.75 to incorporate third quarter results. From a top line perspective, we anticipate a continuation of trends yielding flat comps for the year.
In closing, we will continue to aggressively prioritize our resources to ensure that we provide a relevant best-in-class experience for our customers while achieving profitable growth. Through our ongoing efforts, we are confident that Nordstrom will remain relevant to customers now and in the future.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

I would reemphasize, as we brought up the last several quarters just the context of -- we really run the business agnostic to those channels, and that's because it's how our customers shop. So while we do accounting-wise break things out, full-line stores and e-commerce, there's so much overlap between those businesses, and that is increasing. And Jamie gave one example there, the store reserve, which is we're excited about because it's a very explicit seamless experience that connects a shopping journey that starts online and ends up in a store. We know that's how lots of our customers have been shopping, but they have to start -- they start online, and when they go in the store, they want to actually see it, touch it, feel it, try it on. They have to start over. This allows them not to start over. So a lot of our initiatives are around continuing to take out friction between the channels and really deliver an experience that is consistent with how customers want to shop. But that being said, online in the last quarter, some of our initiatives that got put into place, we have a redesigned homepage experience that is performing well. We have a store mode in search and browse that is both on our full website and in our app, and that's, again, would be an example of really connecting the online and off-line shopping experience. We've improved our navigation, had some personalization, small stuff that we're excited about and a redesign of our order confirmation, order history. A lot of these are some subtle changes that don't pop up the page but have -- had positive results as we've done AB testing on them. On the app, in addition to the store mode, we launched visual search. We also integrated -- we had a separate catalog app we've integrated into our main Nordstrom app. We also launched search and messaging within iMessage. And all these are looking to make the shopping experience more friction free and on the customer terms."

There's several components that have been affecting that line, and the ones that have had the most significant impact are really related to the evolving mix of our business and the way our business is changing. So a couple of examples there are at the Rack business, the off-price business continues to grow faster than the other businesses. That has a lower gross margin element. It also has a lower expense element, so the operating margin tends to be pretty comparable, but it does affect that gross profit line. In addition, the growth of our loyalty business has put in some pressure on that over time. I think in terms of what have been the more shorter-term impacts and some of the good news we've seen recently, that's been a function of the sales trends we've seen, the excess inventory last year. And as we start to come out of that and have better controls over our inventories based on the current environment we're in, we're seeing positive in the margin. But I think it's fair to say it's tough to see getting that line back to historical highs because there's structural elements to it, both at the business level as well as the assortment level where we're seeing some changes in mix."

What are some of the learnings from your store to the future that will -- you'll prioritize in terms of getting out to your other stores as soon as possible -- just because that store in Toronto had a lot of unique excitement around service and experiences, which seemed quite lively and helpful for store traffic."

We just opened 2 stores in Toronto over the last couple months, and we always say, whenever we open up a store, that it's our best store ever. And those stores, particularly, we're very proud of, and we're going for it. We've got a good team up there. Our store managers are -- of those 2 stores are 2 of our best and, in terms of service, we're really going for it. You mentioned some special things that we've been doing there, along with some of our other what we would call our bigger more kind of flagship stores in Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Vancouver, downtown Seattle where it's not just have about having a broader offering of designers, which we do, but having more specialized services to serve customers in lots of different ways, and that could mean anything from delivering merchandise to their house, picking them up, bringing them to the store. We've got food and beverage offerings in those stores that are pretty unique, and so far, our customers are giving us great feedback on. And ultimately, we want those stores to be really good places -- really compelling places that people want to go and see something new. And the better job we do in all of our stores but particularly our higher-traffic stores of showing the customers something new, giving them a reason to buy something new, the better our business is. So we're really, really encouraged by some of the early results from those stores and things that we can replicate across our entire fleet. And I think you'll see us doing that over the next year or 2."

The tender product qualifications for having that card, we had very, very high FICO standards; it tended to be somebody that had, had a longer history of spending that could justify getting that card. The nontender, we don't have that, and so we're attracting a much broader customer. It's allowing us to engage with a younger customer that is coming through their cycle with us and introduce them to some of our benefits and to the conveniences of shopping with Nordstrom. In terms of the economics, I would say just by its very nature, you're going to have higher spend with a credit card-oriented product versus a non-credit card oriented product. In terms of margin, I don't think I have any numbers in front of me that tells me the impact of that. But I think the most important thing, it's like we talked about opening the Rack stores. We're attracting a lot of new customers to our brand, and those customers will continue to grow with us."

We see the cost saving you guys have rolling through in the report today. But I think you lap some dead rent in Canada next year. You have less Trunk Club amortization now. Maybe on the gross margin line, some of the price matching can continue to next year. Can you just help us think about some of the puts and takes on the bigger buckets as we look into next year for a model?"

I would just reinforce the fact that the 3 main areas that we continue to focus on -- technology, supply chain and marketing -- they continue to be critical because those are the areas of investment that are driving the new platform for growth, and that's e-commerce and anything digital related. So we're going to have to continue to figure out how to use those resources more effectively and find ways to deliver the experience more efficiently because they're very, very -- highly variable in nature. And the more that, that business grows, the more those costs are going to go up. So I think that's going to be a multiyear effort on our part. I think the other things we talked about, you're right, tend to be a little bit more shorter term. The investments we've made, yes, we are starting to see the impact to the earnings line start to narrow. We saw some improvement in 2016. We should see additional improvement next year and the years to come."
