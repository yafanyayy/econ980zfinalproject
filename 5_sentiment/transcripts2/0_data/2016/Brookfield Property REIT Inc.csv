My prepared remarks will cover the following main topics: a recap of our fourth quarter activities, followed by our observations of retail environment during the holiday season",1517,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. My prepared remarks will cover the following main topics: a recap of our fourth quarter activities, followed by our observations of retail environment during the holiday season and update of our redevelopment activities in urban assets and finally, an outlook for 2016. 
When we first begin by addressing a topic that I believe is on top of everybody's mind, which is  a recent high volume of trading in our stock in certain days. As a matter of policy, we don't comment on rumors in the marketplace and don't intend to do this morning or in the future. But I will do remind our investors of our corporate governance guidelines that we put in place when GGP was recapitalized and recommend investors review this information, which is on file with the SEC and available on our websites. The management team and the members of the GGP board take fiduciary responsibilities seriously and recognize that it's public company we would always act in the best interest of our shareholders. This represents the extent of my comments and any questions during our Q&A session related to market rumors will not be answered as it would be irresponsible and inappropriate to do so. 
Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter. Same-store NOI increased 6.7% followed by 6.5% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 14% to $0.43, the top end of our guidance range. For the full year, same-store NOI increased 4.8% followed by a 5.4% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 9% to $1.44 which is near the top end of our guidance range. 
Please that 2015 commences were nearly 11% and spread for 2016 commencements continue to be healthy. The same portfolio was nearly 97% leased at year-end and over 92% permanently occupied. Looking into 2016. Our goal is to lease approximately 9 million square feet. To date, we have leased over 60% of our goals. We raised our guidance for 2016 by $0.01 at the midpoint primarily to account for the accelerated rent commencement base at 730 Fifth Avenue and other, representing nearly a 7% per share growth and also declared our first quarter dividend. Comparable rent sales were up 3% on a square-foot basis. A point to be noted is if you back out Apple sales, growth includes 4.5% for sales of retailers less than 10,000 square feet and almost 4% for all retailers, excluding department stores. portfolio by quality grade, we experienced sales increases throughout the country. Nearly every major retail category was up, with the exception of electronics, primarily due to Apple. Shopper classic in our centers has been strong. Looking back over the past several years from our estimates, we've experienced positive trends in each year. In 2012, traffic was up over 4%; in 2013, 3%; flat in 2014; and up 2% in 2015. 
During the holiday season, I had opportunity to visit several of our malls. During the Thanksgiving weekend, I was at several of our malls between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. and I noticed that the parking lots were full and the most interesting thing to me was the shoppers were generally Millennials. We are regularly comparing the productivity of our portfolio to the national average. We look at overall trends, category trends, not the specific retailers trends. The overriding premise and what we have set as our mission is that the high-quality retail should outperform over the long term. I'd like to share some of our observations with you this morning. 
To set the stage though, it is important to put retail sales in perspective. In 2015, retail and food service accounted for about 30% of the U.S. GDP and e-commerce accounted for about 2%. Since 2010, total retail sales in the U.S. have grown nearly 13%, and it should be noted that our portfolio has grown over the same period 23%. 
We see is that all sales productivity but also the lack of vacancy within the mall and the pent-up demand for space. The mall continues to evolve in step with consumer demand and interest, and we see it occurring throughout our portfolio. For example, e-commerce retailers like Parker, Franklin, Sonoma should know are scaling up operations by opening stores. Grocers like and Kroger's are coming into the malls. Personal services like and drive bar are important elements on the outside of our malls. And of course, entertainment venues and restaurants. 
Expansion to new store openings by existing brick-and-mortar retailers this past year include: H&M adding 220,000 square feet in 10 stores; house Furniture with 45,000 square feet in 3 stores; Pink with 40,000 square feet in 9 stores; Uniqlo with 40,000 square feet in 4 stores; House of and Footlucker concept now opening their own bricks-and-mortar stores with 39,000 square feet in 5 stores and the list goes on. It should be noted that at that one of the first e-commerce retailers to open the store opened 6 stores within our portfolio in the past year. 
As it is known, new retail square footage on the horizon, new concepts are going into the B plus malls. As mentioned in our release yesterday, we closed on and several property transactions recently as we continued to prove the lower-tier noncore assets in the portfolio. We sold our strip shopping in New York during the fourth quarter. In January, we closed on a number of construction, including the following: We sold our interest in Malls through our JV partner, [indiscernible]; we sold Mall in San Jose California; we sold our interest Town Center in Kroger, Utah; and finally, we sold our minority interest in 522 Fifth Avenue in New York City. 
In stark contrast to the other end of the party spectrum and evidenced by a number of transactions recently, the valuations prescribed to A malls continues to be very strong, diversions from current public market valuations. A malls are irreplaceable assets in high demand by tenant, highly desired by consumers and very attractive to institutional investors. Looking globally, it is clear that the U.S. overreaches compared to other developed countries. greenfield to rarity in the mall space and given the negligible new supply expected over the foreseeable future, and the likely reduction of overall retail GLA due to the imminent closure of lower-quality retail assets, including malls, the fortification of A malls within the 3 areas will continue. Our top 100 malls account for 94% of our NOI and boast sales over $600 per square foot. Our 70 for A malls account for 75% of our NOI and post nearly $700 per square-foot. On the redevelopment front, we were very pleased to open several major projects during the fourth quarter on time and on budget, including: the extension of Ala Moana, with the return of 11%; the expansion of a Mall with the return of 9%; the completion -- the complete renovation of Plaza with the return of 9%; the grand opening of Nordstrom and Ridgedale with the return of 8%; and the grand opening of Nordstrom and Mall, with the return of 8%. A number of other redevelopment products are across the portfolio. 
As we look to 2016, we will get started on stock and mall expansion and renovation, the relocation of Nordstrom and Ala Moana and the various redevelopment opportunities within our joint venture with [indiscernible], 2 of which have just begun at Coronado Center Mall, and we anticipate another 4 to commence at least by year-end. And lastly, later this year, we will start Connecticut, a new mall anchored by Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's, contingent upon final approvals by city and state officials. 
On the urban retail update, we have entered into a lease for 23,374 square feet with Coach Inc. to open a global flagship for the Coach brand and a steward Wiseman at 685 Fifth Avenue. At 730 Fifth Avenue, we renewed the lease of Bulgari and as I mentioned earlier, we sold our 10% interest in 522 Fifth Avenue, which we acquired in 2014. The IRR on this investment is almost 50%. Our improved outlook for 2016 continues to be based on our key growth drivers: Improved occupancy, positive leasing spreads and incremental income from our redevelopment activity. These organic sources of growth and GDP's irreplaceable portfolio are the basis of our outlook this year and beyond. 
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize our teams located at our Eastern properties I that hit the middle over week ago. Due to the severity of the storm, a number of our properties closed early so people could get home safely and remain closed until it was safe to reopen. Our teams worked together tirelessly over the weekend to measure the storm's impact and to determine when to reopen. You know we you are and I sincerely thank each of you for your dedication to GGP. What I'd like to do -- with that, I'd like to turn it over to Michael to review financial results in more detail and expand upon our expectations for 2016."

As you know FFO per share came in at $0.43, putting us at the high-end of our guidance range. The $10 million ahead was approximately $5 million from debt and expected same-store NOI, $4 million of which is related better-than-expected net real estate tax recoveries and we had about a $1 million higher-than-expected lease-term fees. The remaining $5 million came from a small land sale and somewhat better-than-expected interest expense. are developing projects contributed $9 million of growth in the first quarter, which was consistent with our prior quarter. 
Turning to our plan for 2016, please remember, my remarks are intended to point in range. We are increasing or FFO per share guidance range to $1.52 to $1.56 for midpoint of a $1.54 or about 7% growth. The increase, as Sandeep noted, some of which comes from leasing activity that occurred in late December an additional expense savings across various line items. These offset an additional $8.5 million and interest expense that we will have on our variable rate then. I think it's helpful to review our 2016 guidance model given that the 2015 numbers are now final. The numbers at our model reflect the recent sale at Eastridge Center, and 522 Fifth Avenue. The. 
We continue to expect same-store NOI growth of 4% to 5% on a base of approximately $2.24 billion. Development projects are expected to contribute approximately $40 million to same-store NOI growth in 2016, consistent with what we said in last quarter's prior -- previously stated guidance. We expect EBITDA growth of 8% to 9% on a base of approximately $2.1 billion. We previously said about 8% EBITDA growth and the incremental up in guidance adds to the EBITDA growth rate of about 50 basis points. Expected EBITDA growth would be about 4.5% to 5.5% without the condo development we mentioned last quarter, and we expect FFO to be around $1.475 billion with a share count expected of around $960 million. The previous guidance was about $10 million less. 
For the first quarter of 2016, our expectations are same-store NOI of around 4% growth for approximately $555 million. We expect development to contribute around $9 million of same-store NOI for the first quarter. We expect EBITDA of approximately $525 million or growth of 6.5% to 7%, and we expect FFO in the range of $325 million to $345 million or FFO per share of $0.34 to $0.36 representing growth of approximately 8.7% per share at the midpoint. And with that, let's open it up for questions."

The food hall at the retailer productivity has gone up dramatically. We see that mall, which is probably a 300 [indiscernible] mall with a 50% occupancy, 60% occupancy due fly into 90% by year-end and sales productivity to be well over $400 a square-foot. The traffic was very good during the holiday season so it seems that, that investment will pay out handsomely. The return on our investment was almost for 9% there. So we deployed whatever $70 million to $80 million and got a 9% return. So we would like to be so far successful period. And again, we were able to do that because the demographics justify the expenditure. We did do that with the in mall in the Norfolk market for we invested, I don't know, $40-ish million or so, and I think, that mall now almost $500-dollars-plus [ph] mall.

So we, obviously, seeing people come to the mall, we are seeing the same number of all, they are shopping a lot of fewer stores with a cover to the ball, but they definitely roaming the malls and shopping. So if you've got the product, the retailer -- the consumer is redoing their research on their mobile device and coming into the mall to shop, which is why still to date, from a softer perspective of as almost 95% of the mall bricks-and-mortar store. And I think, the other factor to the equation is that the return rate on the soft goes is incredibly high. I think, it's 38% of e-commerce purchases of stock goods that set of bot online origin of the brick-and-mortar stores. So to really get a true and proper understanding and until the retailer start to show you exactly what the return rate is and how its being impacted is really hard to evaluate in the omni-channel world why one growth is better than the other because he has to take the return residue know and does. And just casing point you got Amazon opening brick-and-mortar bookstores and the I understand 300 to 400 bookstores. And it should set this and say the last mile is unreported, which is why opening brick-and-mortar stores opening brick-and-mortar stores putting their overheads open brick-and-mortar stores. It's a very interesting evolution because of the last one is that apartment and again, the malls a pre-should we just more focus on fashion and very different in the stable business where you buy a commodity.

Thank you for joining our call. My prepared remarks will cover the following main topics: a recap of our fourth quarter activities; followed by our observations of retail environment during this past holiday season; an update of our redevelopment activities in urban assets; and finally, an outlook for 2016. 
And we first begin by addressing a topic that I believe is on top of everybody's mind, which is the recent high volume of trading in our stock on certain days. As a matter of policy, we don't comment on rumors in the marketplace and don't intend to do this morning or in the future. What I will do is remind our investors of our corporate governance guidelines that we put in place when GGP was recapitalized and recommend investors review this information, which is on file with the SEC and available on our websites. The management team and the members of the GGP board take our fiduciary responsibilities seriously and recognize that as stewards of this public company, we would always act in the best interest of our shareholders. This represents the extent of my comments and any questions during our Q&A session related to market rumors will not be answered as it would be irresponsible and inappropriate to do so. 
Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter. Same-store NOI increased 6.7% followed by 6.5% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 14% to $0.43, the top end of our guidance range. For the full year, same-store NOI increased 4.8% followed by a 5.4% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 9% to $1.44, which is near the top end of our guidance range. 
The lease spreads for 2015 commencements were nearly 11% and spreads for 2016 commencements continue to be healthy. The same-store portfolio was nearly 97% leased at year end and over 92% permanently occupied. 
Looking into 2016. Our goal is to lease approximately 9 million square feet. To date, we have leased over 60% of our goal. We raised our guidance for 2016 by $0.01 at the midpoint primarily to account for the accelerated rent commencement date at 730 Fifth Avenue and other mix and match, representing nearly a 7% per share growth and also declared our first quarter dividend. Comparable rent sales were up 3% on a square-foot basis. A point to be noted is if you back out Apple sales, growth includes 4.5% for sales of retailers less than 10,000 square feet and almost 4% for all retailers, excluding department stores. Passing the portfolio by quality grade, we experienced sales increases throughout the country. Nearly every major retail category was up, with the exception of electronics, primarily due to Apple. Shopper classic in our centers has been strong. Looking back over the past several years from our estimates, we've experienced positive trends in each year. In 2012, traffic was up over 4%; in 2013, 3%; flat in 2014; and up 2% in 2015. 
During the holiday season, I had opportunity to visit several of our malls. During the Thanksgiving weekend, I was at several of our malls between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. and I noticed that the parking lots were full, and the most interesting thing to me was the shoppers were generally Millennials. We are regularly comparing the productivity of our portfolio to the national average. We look at overall trends, category trends, down to specific retailer trends. The overriding premise and what we have set as our mission is that the high-quality retail should outperform over the long term. I'd like to share some of our observations with you this morning. 
To set the stage though, it is important to put retail sales in perspective. In 2015, retail and food service accounted for about 30% of the U.S. GDP, and e-commerce accounted for about 2%. Since 2010, total retail sales in the U.S. have grown nearly 13%. And it should be noted that our portfolio has grown over the same period 23%. 
We see this not only in sales productivity but also the lack of vacancy within the mall and the pent-up demand for space. The mall continues to evolve in step with consumer demand and interest, and we see it occurring throughout our portfolio. For example, e-commerce retailers like Warby Parker, Frank & Oak, Bonobos, Shinola, Birchbox and Athleta are scaling up operations by opening stores. Grocers like Wegmans and Kroger's are coming into the malls. Personal services like SoulCycle and Drybar are important elements on the outsides of our malls. And of course, entertainment venues and restaurants. 
Expansions in new store openings by existing brick-and-mortar retailers this past year include: H&M adding 220,000 square feet in 10 stores; Our House furniture with 45,000 square feet in 3 stores; Pink with 40,000 square feet in 9 stores; Uniqlo with 40,000 square feet in 4 stores; House of Hoops at Foot Locker concept now opening their own bricks-and-mortar stores with 39,000 square feet in 5 stores and the list goes on. It should be noted that Athleta, one of the first e-commerce retailers to open the store opened 6 stores within our portfolio in the past year. 
As there is no new retail square footage on the horizon, new concepts are going into the B+ or better malls. As mentioned in our release yesterday, we closed on several property transactions recently as we continued to prune the lower-tier noncore assets on the portfolio. We sold our remaining strip shopping center in Lockport, New York during the fourth quarter. In January, we closed on a number of transactions, including the following: We sold our interest in Owings Mills malls through our JV partner, Kimco; we sold Eastridge Mall in San Jose California; we sold our interest in Provo Towne Centre in Provo, Utah; and finally, we sold our minority interest in 522 Fifth Avenue in New York City. 
In stark contrast to the other end of the quality spectrum and evidenced by a number of transactions recently, the valuations prescribed to A malls continues to be very strong, a diversion from current public market valuations. A malls are irreplaceable assets in high demand by tenants, highly desired by consumers and very attractive to institutional investors. Looking globally, it is clear that the U.S. is over-retailed compared to other developed countries. New greenfield is a rarity in the mall space. And given the negligible new supply expected over the foreseeable future and the likely reduction of overall retail GLA due to the imminent closure of lower-quality retail assets, including malls, the fortification of A malls within the clear areas will continue. Our top 100 malls account for 94% of our NOI and boast sales over $600 per square foot. Our 70 for A malls account for 75% of our NOI and post nearly $700 per square foot. 
On the redevelopment front, we were very pleased to open several major projects during the fourth quarter on time and on budget, including: the extension of Ala Moana, with a return of 11%; the expansion of Baybrook Mall with the return of 9%; the completion -- the complete renovation of Southwest Plaza with the return of 9%; the grand opening of Nordstrom at Ridgedale with a return of 8%; and the grand opening of Nordstrom at Mayfair Mall with the return of 8%. A number of other redevelopment products are across the portfolio. 
As we look to 2016, we will get started on Staten Island Mall's expansion and renovation, the relocation of Nordstrom and Ala Moana and the various redevelopment opportunities within our joint venture with Seritage, 2 of which have just begun at Coronado Center and Staten Island Mall, and we anticipate another 4 to commence at least by year end. 
And lastly, later this year, we will start Norwalk, Connecticut, a new mall anchored by Nordstrom's and Bloomingdale's, contingent upon final approvals by city and state officials. 
On the urban retail update, we have entered into a lease for 23,374 square feet with Coach Inc. to open a global flagship for the Coach brand and at Stuart Weitzman at 685 Fifth Avenue. At 730 Fifth Avenue, we renewed the lease of Bulgari. And as I mentioned earlier, we sold our 10% interest in 522 Fifth Avenue, which we acquired in 2014. The IRR on this investment is almost 50%. Our improved outlook for 2016 continues to be based on our key growth drivers: improved occupancy, positive leasing spreads and incremental income from our redevelopment activity. These organic sources of growth and GDP's irreplaceable portfolio are the basis of our outlook this year and beyond. 
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize our teams located at our Eastern Seaboard properties for literal weathering the storm that hit a little over a week ago. Due to the severity of the storm, a number of our properties closed early so people could get home safely and remain closed until it was safe to reopen. Our teams worked together tirelessly over the weekend to measure the storm's impact and to determine when to reopen. You know who you are, and I sincerely thank each of you for your dedication to GGP. 
What I'd like to do -- with that, I'd like to turn over to Michael to review financial results in more detail and expand upon our expectations for 2016."

As you know FFO per share came in at $0.43, putting us at the high end of our guidance range. The $10 million ahead was approximately $5 million from debt and expected same-store NOI, $4 million of which is related better-than-expected net real estate tax recoveries. And we had about a $1 million higher-than-expected lease-term fees. The remaining $5 million came from a small land sale and somewhat better-than-expected interest expense. Our development projects contributed $9 million of growth in the fourth quarter, which was consistent with our prior forecast. 
Turning to our plan for 2016, please remember, my remarks are intended to be point on a range. We are increasing our FFO guidance range to $1.52 to $1.56 for midpoint of a $1.54 or about 7% growth. The increase, as Sandeep noted, some of which comes from leasing activity that occurred in late December an additional expense savings across various line items. These offset an additional $8.5 million in interest expense that we will have on our variable rate debt. 
I think it's helpful to review our 2016 guidance model given that the 2015 numbers are now final. The numbers in our model reflect the recent sale at Eastridge, Provo Towne Centre, Owings Mills and 522 Fifth Avenue.
We continue to expect same-store NOI growth of 4% to 5% on a base of approximately $2.24 billion. Development projects are expected to contribute approximately $40 million for same-store NOI growth in 2016, consistent with what we said in last quarter's prior -- previously stated guidance. We expect EBITDA growth of 8% to 9% on a base of approximately $2.1 billion. We previously said about 8% EBITDA growth and the incremental up in guidance adds to the EBITDA growth rate of about 50 basis points. Expected EBITDA growth would be about 4.5% to 5.5% without the condo development we mentioned last quarter. And we expect FFO to be around $1.475 billion with a share count expected of around $960 million. The previous guidance was about $10 million less. 
For the first quarter of 2016, our expectations are same-store NOI of around 4% growth or approximately $555 million. We expect development to contribute around $9 million of same-store NOI for the first quarter. We expect EBITDA of approximately $525 million or growth of 6.5% to 7%. And we expect FFO in the range of $325 million to $345 million or FFO per share of $0.34 to $0.36 representing growth of approximately 8.7% per share at the midpoint. And with that, let's open it up for questions."

The food hall and the retailer productivity has gone up dramatically. We see that mall, which is probably a 300 [indiscernible] mall with a 50% occupancy, 60% occupancy to fly into 90% by year end, and sales productivity to be well over $400 a square foot. The traffic was very good during the holiday season so it seems that, that investment will pay out handsomely. The return on our investment was almost full 9% there. So we deployed whatever $70 million to $80 million and got a 9% return. So we would like to be so far successful. And again, we were able to do that because the demographics justify the expenditure. We did do that at 1 more mall, we did that in Lynnhaven Mall in the Norfolk market. But we invested, I don't know, $40-ish million or so. And I think, that mall now almost $500 plus mall.

One of the biggest pain points during the holiday season was lack of parking. So we, obviously, seeing people come to the mall. We are seeing them stay longer at the mall. They're shopping a lot of fewer stores when they come into the mall, but they definitely roaming the malls and shopping. So if you've got the product, the retailer -- the consumer is redoing their research on their mobile device and coming into the mall to shop, which is why still to date, from a softer perspective, almost 95% of all stuff that we bought in the bricks-and-mortar store. And I think, the other factor that very few people really included in the equation is that the return rate on the soft goods is incredibly high. I think it's 38% of e-commerce purchases of soft goods that have bought online a return in the brick-and-mortar store. So to really get a true and proper understanding until the retailer start to show you exactly what the return rate is and how its being impacted is really hard to evaluate in this omni-channel world why one growth is bigger than the other because you have to take the return rate into account, which really no one does. And just case in point, you go to Amazon opening brick-and-mortar bookstores and their goal is to open, as I understand, 300 to 400 bookstores. And it should sort of sit back and say, the last mile is all important, which is why Bonobos is opening, brick-and-mortar stores and Warby Packer is opening brick-and-mortar stores. And Birchbox is cutting their overheads to open brick-and-mortar stores. It's a very interesting evolution because the cost of the last mile is that important. And again, the mall business, you have to appreciate, which is more focused on fashion, is very different than a stable business where you buying commodity. And so in the mall business, the impact of e-commerce is a lot less. It's actually your friend, not your enemy."

Thank you for joining our call. My prepared remarks will cover the following main topics: a recap of our fourth quarter activities; followed by our observations of retail environment during this past holiday season; an update of our redevelopment activities in urban assets; and finally, an outlook for 2016. 
And we first begin by addressing a topic that I believe is on top of everybody's mind, which is the recent high volume of trading in our stock on certain days. As a matter of policy, we don't comment on rumors in the marketplace and don't intend to do this morning or in the future. What I will do is remind our investors of our corporate governance guidelines that we put in place when GGP was recapitalized and recommend investors review this information, which is on file with the SEC and available on our websites. The management team and the members of the GGP board take our fiduciary responsibilities seriously and recognize that as stewards of this public company, we would always act in the best interest of our shareholders. This represents the extent of my comments and any questions during our Q&A session related to market rumors will not be answered as it would be irresponsible and inappropriate to do so. 
Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter. Same-store NOI increased 6.7% followed by 6.5% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 14% to $0.43, the top end of our guidance range. For the full year, same-store NOI increased 4.8% followed by a 5.4% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 9% to $1.44, which is near the top end of our guidance range. 
The lease spreads for 2015 commencements were nearly 11% and spreads for 2016 commencements continue to be healthy. The same-store portfolio was nearly 97% leased at year end and over 92% permanently occupied. 
Looking into 2016. Our goal is to lease approximately 9 million square feet. To date, we have leased over 60% of our goal. We raised our guidance for 2016 by $0.01 at the midpoint primarily to account for the accelerated rent commencement date at 730 Fifth Avenue and other mix and match, representing nearly a 7% per share growth and also declared our first quarter dividend. Comparable rent sales were up 3% on a square-foot basis. A point to be noted is if you back out Apple sales, growth includes 4.5% for sales of retailers less than 10,000 square feet and almost 4% for all retailers, excluding department stores. Passing the portfolio by quality grade, we experienced sales increases throughout the country. Nearly every major retail category was up, with the exception of electronics, primarily due to Apple. Shopper classic in our centers has been strong. Looking back over the past several years from our estimates, we've experienced positive trends in each year. In 2012, traffic was up over 4%; in 2013, 3%; flat in 2014; and up 2% in 2015. 
During the holiday season, I had opportunity to visit several of our malls. During the Thanksgiving weekend, I was at several of our malls between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. and I noticed that the parking lots were full, and the most interesting thing to me was the shoppers were generally Millennials. We are regularly comparing the productivity of our portfolio to the national average. We look at overall trends, category trends, down to specific retailer trends. The overriding premise and what we have set as our mission is that the high-quality retail should outperform over the long term. I'd like to share some of our observations with you this morning. 
To set the stage though, it is important to put retail sales in perspective. In 2015, retail and food service accounted for about 30% of the U.S. GDP, and e-commerce accounted for about 2%. Since 2010, total retail sales in the U.S. have grown nearly 13%. And it should be noted that our portfolio has grown over the same period 23%. 
We see this not only in sales productivity but also the lack of vacancy within the mall and the pent-up demand for space. The mall continues to evolve in step with consumer demand and interest, and we see it occurring throughout our portfolio. For example, e-commerce retailers like Warby Parker, Frank & Oak, Bonobos, Shinola, Birchbox and Athleta are scaling up operations by opening stores. Grocers like Wegmans and Kroger's are coming into the malls. Personal services like SoulCycle and Drybar are important elements on the outsides of our malls. And of course, entertainment venues and restaurants. 
Expansions in new store openings by existing brick-and-mortar retailers this past year include: H&M adding 220,000 square feet in 10 stores; Our House furniture with 45,000 square feet in 3 stores; Pink with 40,000 square feet in 9 stores; Uniqlo with 40,000 square feet in 4 stores; House of Hoops at Foot Locker concept now opening their own bricks-and-mortar stores with 39,000 square feet in 5 stores and the list goes on. It should be noted that Athleta, one of the first e-commerce retailers to open the store opened 6 stores within our portfolio in the past year. 
As there is no new retail square footage on the horizon, new concepts are going into the B+ or better malls. As mentioned in our release yesterday, we closed on several property transactions recently as we continued to prune the lower-tier noncore assets on the portfolio. We sold our remaining strip shopping center in Lockport, New York during the fourth quarter. In January, we closed on a number of transactions, including the following: We sold our interest in Owings Mills malls through our JV partner, Kimco; we sold Eastridge Mall in San Jose California; we sold our interest in Provo Towne Centre in Provo, Utah; and finally, we sold our minority interest in 522 Fifth Avenue in New York City. 
In stark contrast to the other end of the quality spectrum and evidenced by a number of transactions recently, the valuations prescribed to A malls continues to be very strong, a diversion from current public market valuations. A malls are irreplaceable assets in high demand by tenants, highly desired by consumers and very attractive to institutional investors. Looking globally, it is clear that the U.S. is over-retailed compared to other developed countries. New greenfield is a rarity in the mall space. And given the negligible new supply expected over the foreseeable future and the likely reduction of overall retail GLA due to the imminent closure of lower-quality retail assets, including malls, the fortification of A malls within the clear areas will continue. Our top 100 malls account for 94% of our NOI and boast sales over $600 per square foot. Our 70 for A malls account for 75% of our NOI and post nearly $700 per square foot. 
On the redevelopment front, we were very pleased to open several major projects during the fourth quarter on time and on budget, including: the extension of Ala Moana, with a return of 11%; the expansion of Baybrook Mall with the return of 9%; the completion -- the complete renovation of Southwest Plaza with the return of 9%; the grand opening of Nordstrom at Ridgedale with a return of 8%; and the grand opening of Nordstrom at Mayfair Mall with the return of 8%. A number of other redevelopment products are across the portfolio. 
As we look to 2016, we will get started on Staten Island Mall's expansion and renovation, the relocation of Nordstrom and Ala Moana and the various redevelopment opportunities within our joint venture with Seritage, 2 of which have just begun at Coronado Center and Staten Island Mall, and we anticipate another 4 to commence at least by year end. 
And lastly, later this year, we will start Norwalk, Connecticut, a new mall anchored by Nordstrom's and Bloomingdale's, contingent upon final approvals by city and state officials. 
On the urban retail update, we have entered into a lease for 23,374 square feet with Coach Inc. to open a global flagship for the Coach brand and at Stuart Weitzman at 685 Fifth Avenue. At 730 Fifth Avenue, we renewed the lease of Bulgari. And as I mentioned earlier, we sold our 10% interest in 522 Fifth Avenue, which we acquired in 2014. The IRR on this investment is almost 50%. Our improved outlook for 2016 continues to be based on our key growth drivers: improved occupancy, positive leasing spreads and incremental income from our redevelopment activity. These organic sources of growth and GDP's irreplaceable portfolio are the basis of our outlook this year and beyond. 
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize our teams located at our Eastern Seaboard properties for literal weathering the storm that hit a little over a week ago. Due to the severity of the storm, a number of our properties closed early so people could get home safely and remain closed until it was safe to reopen. Our teams worked together tirelessly over the weekend to measure the storm's impact and to determine when to reopen. You know who you are, and I sincerely thank each of you for your dedication to GGP. 
What I'd like to do -- with that, I'd like to turn over to Michael to review financial results in more detail and expand upon our expectations for 2016."

First, turning to the fourth quarter. As you know FFO per share came in at $0.43, putting us at the high end of our guidance range.

As you know FFO per share came in at $0.43, putting us at the high end of our guidance range. The $10 million ahead was approximately $5 million from debt and expected same-store NOI, $4 million of which is related better-than-expected net real estate tax recoveries. And we had about a $1 million higher-than-expected lease-term fees. The remaining $5 million came from a small land sale and somewhat better-than-expected interest expense. Our development projects contributed $9 million of growth in the fourth quarter, which was consistent with our prior forecast. 
Turning to our plan for 2016, please remember, my remarks are intended to be point on a range. We are increasing our FFO guidance range to $1.52 to $1.56 for midpoint of a $1.54 or about 7% growth. The increase, as Sandeep noted, some of which comes from leasing activity that occurred in late December an additional expense savings across various line items. These offset an additional $8.5 million in interest expense that we will have on our variable rate debt. 
I think it's helpful to review our 2016 guidance model given that the 2015 numbers are now final. The numbers in our model reflect the recent sale at Eastridge, Provo Towne Centre, Owings Mills and 522 Fifth Avenue.
We continue to expect same-store NOI growth of 4% to 5% on a base of approximately $2.24 billion. Development projects are expected to contribute approximately $40 million for same-store NOI growth in 2016, consistent with what we said in last quarter's prior -- previously stated guidance. We expect EBITDA growth of 8% to 9% on a base of approximately $2.1 billion. We previously said about 8% EBITDA growth and the incremental up in guidance adds to the EBITDA growth rate of about 50 basis points. Expected EBITDA growth would be about 4.5% to 5.5% without the condo development we mentioned last quarter. And we expect FFO to be around $1.475 billion with a share count expected of around $960 million. The previous guidance was about $10 million less. 
For the first quarter of 2016, our expectations are same-store NOI of around 4% growth or approximately $555 million. We expect development to contribute around $9 million of same-store NOI for the first quarter. We expect EBITDA of approximately $525 million or growth of 6.5% to 7%. And we expect FFO in the range of $325 million to $345 million or FFO per share of $0.34 to $0.36 representing growth of approximately 8.7% per share at the midpoint. And with that, let's open it up for questions."

The food hall and the retailer productivity has gone up dramatically. We see that mall, which is probably a 300 [indiscernible] mall with a 50% occupancy, 60% occupancy to fly into 90% by year end, and sales productivity to be well over $400 a square foot. The traffic was very good during the holiday season so it seems that, that investment will pay out handsomely. The return on our investment was almost full 9% there. So we deployed whatever $70 million to $80 million and got a 9% return. So we would like to be so far successful. And again, we were able to do that because the demographics justify the expenditure. We did do that at 1 more mall, we did that in Lynnhaven Mall in the Norfolk market. But we invested, I don't know, $40-ish million or so. And I think, that mall now almost $500 plus mall.

One of the biggest pain points during the holiday season was lack of parking. So we, obviously, seeing people come to the mall. We are seeing them stay longer at the mall. They're shopping a lot of fewer stores when they come into the mall, but they definitely roaming the malls and shopping. So if you've got the product, the retailer -- the consumer is redoing their research on their mobile device and coming into the mall to shop, which is why still to date, from a softer perspective, almost 95% of all stuff that we bought in the bricks-and-mortar store. And I think, the other factor that very few people really included in the equation is that the return rate on the soft goods is incredibly high. I think it's 38% of e-commerce purchases of soft goods that have bought online a return in the brick-and-mortar store. So to really get a true and proper understanding until the retailer start to show you exactly what the return rate is and how its being impacted is really hard to evaluate in this omni-channel world why one growth is bigger than the other because you have to take the return rate into account, which really no one does. And just case in point, you go to Amazon opening brick-and-mortar bookstores and their goal is to open, as I understand, 300 to 400 bookstores. And it should sort of sit back and say, the last mile is all important, which is why Bonobos is opening, brick-and-mortar stores and Warby Packer is opening brick-and-mortar stores. And Birchbox is cutting their overheads to open brick-and-mortar stores. It's a very interesting evolution because the cost of the last mile is that important. And again, the mall business, you have to appreciate, which is more focused on fashion, is very different than a stable business where you buying commodity. And so in the mall business, the impact of e-commerce is a lot less. It's actually your friend, not your enemy."

Thank you for joining our call. My prepared remarks will cover the following main topics: a recap of our fourth quarter activities; followed by our observations of retail environment during this past holiday season; an update of our redevelopment activities in urban assets; and finally, an outlook for 2016. 
And we first begin by addressing a topic that I believe is on top of everybody's mind, which is the recent high volume of trading in our stock on certain days. As a matter of policy, we don't comment on rumors in the marketplace and don't intend to do this morning or in the future. What I will do is remind our investors of our corporate governance guidelines that we put in place when GGP was recapitalized and recommend investors review this information, which is on file with the SEC and available on our websites. The management team and the members of the GGP board take our fiduciary responsibilities seriously and recognize that as stewards of this public company, we will always act in the best interest of our shareholders. This represents the extent of my comments and any questions during our Q&A session related to market rumors will not be answered as it would be irresponsible and inappropriate to do so. 
Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter. Same-store NOI increased 6.7% followed by 6.5% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 14% to $0.43, the top end of our guidance range. For the full year, same-store NOI increased 4.8% followed by a 5.4% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 9% to $1.44, which is near the top end of our guidance range. 
The lease spreads for 2015 commencements were nearly 11% and spreads for 2016 commencements continue to be healthy. The same-store portfolio was nearly 97% leased at year end and over 92% permanently occupied. 
Looking into 2016. Our goal is to lease approximately 9 million square feet. To date, we have leased over 60% of our goal. We raised our guidance for 2016 by $0.01 at the midpoint primarily to account for the accelerated rent commencement date at 730 Fifth Avenue and other mix and match, representing nearly a 7% per share growth and also declared our first quarter dividend. Comparable rent sales were up 3% on a square-foot basis. A point to be noted is if you back out Apple sales, growth includes 4.5% for sales of retailers less than 10,000 square feet and almost 4% for all retailers, excluding department stores. Parsing the portfolio by quality grade, we experienced sales increases throughout the country. Nearly every major retail category was up, with the exception of electronics, primarily due to Apple. Shopper traffic in our centers has been strong. Looking back over the past several years from our estimates, we've experienced positive trends in each year. In 2012, traffic was up over 4%; in 2013, 3%; flat in 2014; and up 2% in 2015. 
During the holiday season, I had the opportunity to visit several of our malls. During the Thanksgiving weekend, I was at several of our malls between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. and I noticed that the parking lots were full, and the most interesting thing to me was the shoppers were generally Millennials. We are regularly comparing the productivity of our portfolio to the national average. We look at overall trends, category trends, down to specific retailer trends. The overriding premise and what we have set as our mission is that the high-quality retail should outperform over the long term. I'd like to share some of our observations with you this morning. 
To set the stage though, it is important to put retail sales in perspective. In 2015, retail and food service accounted for about 30% of the U.S. GDP, and e-commerce accounted for about 2%. Since 2010, total retail sales in the U.S. have grown nearly 13%. And it should be noted that our portfolio has grown over the same period 23%. 
We see this not only in sales productivity but also the lack of vacancy within the mall and the pent-up demand for space. The mall continues to evolve in step with consumer demand and interest, and we see it occurring throughout our portfolio. For example, e-commerce retailers like Warby Parker, Frank & Oak, Bonobos, Shinola, Birchbox and Athleta are scaling up operations by opening stores. Grocers like Wegmans and Krogers are coming into the malls. Personal services like SoulCycle and Drybar are important elements on the outsides of our malls. And of course, entertainment venues and restaurants. 
Expansions in new store openings by existing brick-and-mortar retailers this past year include: H&M adding 220,000 square feet in 10 stores; Our House furniture with 45,000 square feet in 3 stores; Pink with 40,000 square feet in 9 stores; Uniqlo with 40,000 square feet in 4 stores; House of Hoops at Foot Locker concept now opening their own bricks-and-mortar stores with 39,000 square feet in 5 stores and the list goes on. It should be noted that Athleta, one of the first e-commerce retailers to open a store opened 6 stores within our portfolio in the past year. 
As there is no new retail square footage on the horizon, new concepts are going into the B+ or better malls. As mentioned in our release yesterday, we closed on several property transactions recently as we continued to prune the lower-tier noncore assets on the portfolio. We sold our remaining strip shopping center in Lockport, New York during the fourth quarter. In January, we closed on a number of transactions, including the following: We sold our interest in Owings Mills malls through our JV partner, Kimco; we sold Eastridge Mall in San Jose California; we sold our interest in Provo Towne Centre in Provo, Utah; and finally, we sold our minority interest in 522 Fifth Avenue in New York City. 
In stark contrast to the other end of the quality spectrum and evidenced by a number of transactions recently, the valuations prescribed to A malls continues to be very strong, a divergence from current public market valuations. A malls are irreplaceable assets in high demand by tenants, highly desired by consumers and very attractive to institutional investors. Looking globally, it is clear that the U.S. is over-retailed compared to other developed countries. New greenfield is a rarity in the mall space. And given the negligible new supply expected over the foreseeable future and the likely reduction of overall retail GLA due to the imminent closure of lower-quality retail assets, including malls, the fortification of A malls within the clear areas will continue. Our top 100 malls account for 94% of our NOI and boast sales over $600 per square foot. Our 74 A malls account for 75% of our NOI and post nearly $700 per square foot. 
On the redevelopment front, we were very pleased to open several major projects during the fourth quarter on time and on budget, including: the extension of Ala Moana, with a return of 11%; the expansion of Baybrook Mall with the return of 9%; the completion -- the complete renovation of Southwest Plaza with the return of 9%; the grand opening of Nordstrom at Ridgedale with a return of 8%; and the grand opening of Nordstrom at Mayfair Mall with the return of 8%. A number of other redevelopment products are across the portfolio. 
As we look to 2016, we will get started on Staten Island Mall's expansion and renovation, the relocation of Nordstrom and Ala Moana and the various redevelopment opportunities within our joint venture with Seritage, 2 of which have just begun at Coronado Center and Staten Island Mall, and we anticipate another 4 to commence at least by year end. 
And lastly, later this year, we will start Norwalk, Connecticut, a new mall anchored by Nordstrom's and Bloomingdale's, contingent upon final approvals by city and state officials. 
On the urban retail update, we have entered into a lease for 23,374 square feet with Coach Inc. to open a global flagship for the Coach brand and at Stuart Weitzman at 685 Fifth Avenue. At 730 Fifth Avenue, we renewed the lease of Bulgari. And as I mentioned earlier, we sold our 10% interest in 522 Fifth Avenue, which we acquired in 2014. The IRR on this investment is almost 50%. Our improved outlook for 2016 continues to be based on our key growth drivers: improved occupancy, positive leasing spreads and incremental income from our redevelopment activity. These organic sources of growth and GDP's irreplaceable portfolio are the basis of our outlook this year and beyond. 
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize our teams located at our Eastern Seaboard properties for literally weathering the storm that hit a little over a week ago. Due to the severity of the storm, a number of our properties closed early so people could get home safely and remained closed until it was safe to reopen. Our teams worked together tirelessly over that weekend to measure the storm's impact and to determine when to reopen. You know who you are, and I sincerely thank each of you for your dedication to GGP. 
What I'd like to do -- with that, I'd like to turn over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail and expand upon our expectations for 2016."

First, turning to the fourth quarter. As you know FFO per share came in at $0.43, putting us at the high end of our guidance range. The $10 million ahead was approximately $5 million from debt and expected s",440,"Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. First, turning to the fourth quarter. As you know FFO per share came in at $0.43, putting us at the high end of our guidance range. The $10 million ahead was approximately $5 million from debt and expected same-store NOI, $4 million of which related to better-than-expected net real estate tax recoveries. And we had about a $1 million higher-than-expected lease-term fees. The remaining $5 million came from a small land sale and somewhat better-than-expected interest expense. Our development projects contributed $9 million of growth in the fourth quarter, which was consistent with our prior forecast. 
Turning to our plan for 2016, please remember my remarks are intended to be points on a range. We are increasing our FFO per share guidance range to $1.52 to $1.56 for a midpoint of a $1.54 or about 7% growth. The increase, as Sandeep noted, some of which comes from leasing activity that occurred in late December and additional expense savings across various line items. These offset an additional $8.5 million in interest expense that we will have on our variable rate debt. 
I think it's helpful to review our 2016 guidance model given that the 2015 numbers are now final. The numbers in our model reflect the recent sale at Eastridge, Provo Towne Centre, Owings Mills and 522 Fifth Avenue.
We continue to expect same-store NOI growth of 4% to 5% on a base of approximately $2.24 billion. Development projects are expected to contribute approximately $40 million for same-store NOI growth in 2016, consistent with what we said in last quarter's prior -- previously stated guidance. We expect EBITDA growth of 8% to 9% on a base of approximately $2.1 billion. We previously said about 8% EBITDA growth and the incremental up in guidance adds to the EBITDA growth rate of about 50 basis points. Expected EBITDA growth would be about 4.5% to 5.5% without the condo development we mentioned last quarter. And we expect FFO to be around $1.475 billion with a share count expected of around $960 million. The previous guidance was about $10 million less. 
For the first quarter of 2016, our expectations are same-store NOI of around 4% growth or approximately $555 million. We expect development to contribute around $9 million of same-store NOI for the first quarter. We expect EBITDA of approximately $525 million or growth of 6.5% to 7%. And we expect FFO in the range of $325 million to $345 million or FFO per share of $0.34 to $0.36 representing growth of approximately 8.7% per share at the midpoint. And with that, let's open it up for questions."

Mike, just in some of the recent CMBS trade publications, articles on volatility based on dealer inventory levels being low and issues with B retention pieces and all that, dealing with new regulations. So as you guys look at your financing platform and strategy, is there any view to potentially shift away or broaden away from the mortgage, whether it's life or CMBS? Or do you guys view that the issues that the mortgage markets you're dealing with right now will eventually be worked through before you guys get to the more meaningful maturities in '17, '18, '19?"

It's going to make it the better properties. And the better sponsors are going to benefit in an environment where there is more of a focus on quality of earnings and quality of assets.

And we haven't done much beyond, as you know, densification for retail purposes at the A malls to date. We did take a couple of B, B+ assets and invest capital in them. Two that come to mind, one is Southwest Plaza, as you mentioned. We were very pleased with the opening of Southwest Plaza. The food hall and the retailer productivity has gone up dramatically. We see that mall, which is probably a $300 mall with a 50% occupancy, 60% occupancy to climb to 90% by year-end, and sales productivity to be well over $400 a square foot. The traffic was very good during the holiday season so it seems that, that investment will pay out handsomely. The return on our investment was almost full 9% there. So we deployed whatever it was, $70 million to $80 million and got a 9% return. So we would like to be so far successful. And again, we were able to do that there because the demographics justify the expenditure. We did do that at one more mall, we did that in Lynnhaven Mall in the Norfolk market. But we invested, I don't know, $40-ish million or so. And I think that mall is now almost a $500 plus mall. And so again, when the demographics are prevalent investing in the B, B plus assets, you do get an opportunity to upgrade the asset to a high-quality asset. So 70% to 80% of our capital gets deployed into what we would call A malls."

We've dedicated a team of professionals and leasing people to focus on the bottom, call it, 15, 18 malls to give them more focus so that we can make sure that the leasing activities stay strong. Because as I've always maintained the B malls sector is an occupancy play, not an occupancy in rate play. But the demand seems to be there. You've got tenants like Dress Barn, maurices, rue21, The Children's Place, Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, who have continued to take space in those malls.

One of the biggest pain points during the holiday season was lack of parking. So we, obviously, seeing people come to the mall. We are seeing them stay longer at the mall. They're shopping a lot of fewer stores when they come into the mall, but they definitely roaming the malls and shopping. So if you've got the product, the retailer -- the consumer is redoing their research on their mobile device and coming into the mall to shop, which is why still to date, from a soft goods perspective, almost 95% of all soft goods is bought in the bricks-and-mortar store. And I think the other factor that very few people really include into the equation is that the return rate on the soft goods is incredibly high. I think it's 38% of e-commerce purchases of soft goods that have bought online are returned in the bricks-and-mortar store. So to really get a true and proper understanding until the retailers start to show you exactly what the return rate is and how it's being impacted is really hard to evaluate in this omni-channel world why one growth is bigger than the other because you have to take the return rate into account, which really no one does. And just case in point, you go to Amazon opening brick-and-mortar bookstores and their goal is to open, as I understand, 300 to 400 bookstores. And it should sort of sit back and say that the last mile is all important, which is why Bonobos is opening brick-and-mortar stores and Warby Parker is opening brick-and-mortar stores. And Birchbox is cutting their overhead to open bricks-and-mortar stores. It's a very interesting evolution because the cost of the last mile is that important. And again, the mall business, you have to appreciate, which is more focused on fashion, is very different than a stable business where you're buying commodity. And so in the mall business, the impact of e-commerce is a lot less. It's actually your friend, not your enemy."

Thank you for joining our call. My prepared remarks will cover the following main topics: a recap of our fourth quarter activities; followed by our observations of retail environment during this past holiday season; an update of our redevelopment activities in urban assets; and finally, an outlook for 2016. 
And we first begin by addressing a topic that I believe is on top of everybody's mind, which is the recent high volume of trading in our stock on certain days. As a matter of policy, we don't comment on rumors in the marketplace and don't intend to do this morning or in the future. What I will do is remind our investors of our corporate governance guidelines that we put in place when GGP was recapitalized and recommend investors review this information, which is on file with the SEC and available on our websites. The management team and the members of the GGP board take our fiduciary responsibilities seriously and recognize that as stewards of this public company, we will always act in the best interest of our shareholders. This represents the extent of my comments and any questions during our Q&A session related to market rumors will not be answered as it would be irresponsible and inappropriate to do so. 
Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter. Same-store NOI increased 6.7% followed by 6.5% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 14% to $0.43, the top end of our guidance range. For the full year, same-store NOI increased 4.8% followed by a 5.4% increase in EBITDA. FFO per share increased nearly 9% to $1.44, which is near the top end of our guidance range. 
The lease spreads for 2015 commencements were nearly 11% and spreads for 2016 commencements continue to be healthy. The same-store portfolio was nearly 97% leased at year end and over 92% permanently occupied. 
Looking into 2016. Our goal is to lease approximately 9 million square feet. To date, we have leased over 60% of our goal. We raised our guidance for 2016 by $0.01 at the midpoint primarily to account for the accelerated rent commencement date at 730 Fifth Avenue and other mix and match, representing nearly a 7% per share growth and also declared our first quarter dividend. Comparable rent sales were up 3% on a square-foot basis. A point to be noted is if you back out Apple sales, growth includes 4.5% for sales of retailers less than 10,000 square feet and almost 4% for all retailers, excluding department stores. Parsing the portfolio by quality grade, we experienced sales increases throughout the country. Nearly every major retail category was up, with the exception of electronics, primarily due to Apple. Shopper traffic in our centers has been strong. Looking back over the past several years from our estimates, we've experienced positive trends in each year. In 2012, traffic was up over 4%; in 2013, 3%; flat in 2014; and up 2% in 2015. 
During the holiday season, I had the opportunity to visit several of our malls. During the Thanksgiving weekend, I was at several of our malls between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. and I noticed that the parking lots were full, and the most interesting thing to me was the shoppers were generally Millennials. We are regularly comparing the productivity of our portfolio to the national average. We look at overall trends, category trends, down to specific retailer trends. The overriding premise and what we have set as our mission is that the high-quality retail should outperform over the long term. I'd like to share some of our observations with you this morning. 
To set the stage though, it is important to put retail sales in perspective. In 2015, retail and food service accounted for about 30% of the U.S. GDP, and e-commerce accounted for about 2%. Since 2010, total retail sales in the U.S. have grown nearly 13%. And it should be noted that our portfolio has grown over the same period 23%. 
We see this not only in sales productivity but also the lack of vacancy within the mall and the pent-up demand for space. The mall continues to evolve in step with consumer demand and interest, and we see it occurring throughout our portfolio. For example, e-commerce retailers like Warby Parker, Frank & Oak, Bonobos, Shinola, Birchbox and Athleta are scaling up operations by opening stores. Grocers like Wegmans and Krogers are coming into the malls. Personal services like SoulCycle and Drybar are important elements on the outsides of our malls. And of course, entertainment venues and restaurants. 
Expansions in new store openings by existing brick-and-mortar retailers this past year include: H&M adding 220,000 square feet in 10 stores; Our House furniture with 45,000 square feet in 3 stores; Pink with 40,000 square feet in 9 stores; Uniqlo with 40,000 square feet in 4 stores; House of Hoops at Foot Locker concept now opening their own bricks-and-mortar stores with 39,000 square feet in 5 stores and the list goes on. It should be noted that Athleta, one of the first e-commerce retailers to open a store opened 6 stores within our portfolio in the past year. 
As there is no new retail square footage on the horizon, new concepts are going into the B+ or better malls. As mentioned in our release yesterday, we closed on several property transactions recently as we continued to prune the lower-tier noncore assets on the portfolio. We sold our remaining strip shopping center in Lockport, New York during the fourth quarter. In January, we closed on a number of transactions, including the following: We sold our interest in Owings Mills malls through our JV partner, Kimco; we sold Eastridge Mall in San Jose California; we sold our interest in Provo Towne Centre in Provo, Utah; and finally, we sold our minority interest in 522 Fifth Avenue in New York City. 
In stark contrast to the other end of the quality spectrum and evidenced by a number of transactions recently, the valuations prescribed to A malls continues to be very strong, a divergence from current public market valuations. A malls are irreplaceable assets in high demand by tenants, highly desired by consumers and very attractive to institutional investors. Looking globally, it is clear that the U.S. is over-retailed compared to other developed countries. New greenfield is a rarity in the mall space. And given the negligible new supply expected over the foreseeable future and the likely reduction of overall retail GLA due to the imminent closure of lower-quality retail assets, including malls, the fortification of A malls within the clear areas will continue. Our top 100 malls account for 94% of our NOI and boast sales over $600 per square foot. Our 74 A malls account for 75% of our NOI and post nearly $700 per square foot. 
On the redevelopment front, we were very pleased to open several major projects during the fourth quarter on time and on budget, including: the extension of Ala Moana, with a return of 11%; the expansion of Baybrook Mall with the return of 9%; the completion -- the complete renovation of Southwest Plaza with the return of 9%; the grand opening of Nordstrom at Ridgedale with a return of 8%; and the grand opening of Nordstrom at Mayfair Mall with the return of 8%. A number of other redevelopment products are across the portfolio. 
As we look to 2016, we will get started on Staten Island Mall's expansion and renovation, the relocation of Nordstrom and Ala Moana and the various redevelopment opportunities within our joint venture with Seritage, 2 of which have just begun at Coronado Center and Staten Island Mall, and we anticipate another 4 to commence at least by year end. 
And lastly, later this year, we will start Norwalk, Connecticut, a new mall anchored by Nordstrom's and Bloomingdale's, contingent upon final approvals by city and state officials. 
On the urban retail update, we have entered into a lease for 23,374 square feet with Coach Inc. to open a global flagship for the Coach brand and at Stuart Weitzman at 685 Fifth Avenue. At 730 Fifth Avenue, we renewed the lease of Bulgari. And as I mentioned earlier, we sold our 10% interest in 522 Fifth Avenue, which we acquired in 2014. The IRR on this investment is almost 50%. Our improved outlook for 2016 continues to be based on our key growth drivers: improved occupancy, positive leasing spreads and incremental income from our redevelopment activity. These organic sources of growth and GDP's irreplaceable portfolio are the basis of our outlook this year and beyond. 
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize our teams located at our Eastern Seaboard properties for literally weathering the storm that hit a little over a week ago. Due to the severity of the storm, a number of our properties closed early so people could get home safely and remained closed until it was safe to reopen. Our teams worked together tirelessly over that weekend to measure the storm's impact and to determine when to reopen. You know who you are, and I sincerely thank each of you for your dedication to GGP. 
What I'd like to do -- with that, I'd like to turn over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail and expand upon our expectations for 2016."

First, turning to the fourth quarter. As you know FFO per share came in at $0.43, putting us at the high end of our guidance range. The $10 million ahead was approximately $5 million from debt and expected s",440,"Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. First, turning to the fourth quarter. As you know FFO per share came in at $0.43, putting us at the high end of our guidance range. The $10 million ahead was approximately $5 million from debt and expected same-store NOI, $4 million of which related to better-than-expected net real estate tax recoveries. And we had about a $1 million higher-than-expected lease-term fees. The remaining $5 million came from a small land sale and somewhat better-than-expected interest expense. Our development projects contributed $9 million of growth in the fourth quarter, which was consistent with our prior forecast. 
Turning to our plan for 2016, please remember my remarks are intended to be points on a range. We are increasing our FFO per share guidance range to $1.52 to $1.56 for a midpoint of a $1.54 or about 7% growth. The increase, as Sandeep noted, some of which comes from leasing activity that occurred in late December and additional expense savings across various line items. These offset an additional $8.5 million in interest expense that we will have on our variable rate debt. 
I think it's helpful to review our 2016 guidance model given that the 2015 numbers are now final. The numbers in our model reflect the recent sale at Eastridge, Provo Towne Centre, Owings Mills and 522 Fifth Avenue.
We continue to expect same-store NOI growth of 4% to 5% on a base of approximately $2.24 billion. Development projects are expected to contribute approximately $40 million for same-store NOI growth in 2016, consistent with what we said in last quarter's prior -- previously stated guidance. We expect EBITDA growth of 8% to 9% on a base of approximately $2.1 billion. We previously said about 8% EBITDA growth and the incremental up in guidance adds to the EBITDA growth rate of about 50 basis points. Expected EBITDA growth would be about 4.5% to 5.5% without the condo development we mentioned last quarter. And we expect FFO to be around $1.475 billion with a share count expected of around $960 million. The previous guidance was about $10 million less. 
For the first quarter of 2016, our expectations are same-store NOI of around 4% growth or approximately $555 million. We expect development to contribute around $9 million of same-store NOI for the first quarter. We expect EBITDA of approximately $525 million or growth of 6.5% to 7%. And we expect FFO in the range of $325 million to $345 million or FFO per share of $0.34 to $0.36 representing growth of approximately 8.7% per share at the midpoint. And with that, let's open it up for questions."

So as you guys look at your financing platform and strategy, is there any view to potentially shift away or broaden away from the mortgage, whether it's life or CMBS? Or do you guys view that the issues that the mortgage markets you're dealing with right now will eventually be worked through before you guys get to the more meaningful maturities in '17, '18, '19?"

Keep in mind that one of the big changes in the CMBS market is the requirement for issuers of paper to retain more of the, I believe, of the riskier pieces. And that is forcing the market to kind of deal with that element. From a long-term perspective, I actually think that's a very beneficial element. It's going to make the underwriting cleaner. It's going to make it the better properties. And the better sponsors are going to benefit in an environment where there is more of a focus on quality of earnings and quality of assets. So I don't necessarily -- I'm not making a comment of the CMBS market overall, I just think that GGP, given its asset base and its history, will continue to thrive in the mortgage market."

And it's -- even though we have a 12.5% interest, we felt that there was the ability to incrementally increase our ownership interest in the property. We had an option to increase it by 2.5%, and it came half from Dacra and half from L Capital.

And we haven't done much beyond, as you know, densification for retail purposes at the A malls to date. We did take a couple of B, B+ assets and invest capital in them. Two that come to mind, one is Southwest Plaza, as you mentioned. We were very pleased with the opening of Southwest Plaza. The food hall and the retailer productivity has gone up dramatically. We see that mall, which is probably a $300 mall with a 50% occupancy, 60% occupancy to climb to 90% by year-end, and sales productivity to be well over $400 a square foot. The traffic was very good during the holiday season so it seems that, that investment will pay out handsomely. The return on our investment was almost full 9% there. So we deployed whatever it was, $70 million to $80 million and got a 9% return. So we would like to be so far successful. And again, we were able to do that there because the demographics justify the expenditure. We did do that at one more mall, we did that in Lynnhaven Mall in the Norfolk market. But we invested, I don't know, $40-ish million or so. And I think that mall is now almost a $500 plus mall. And so again, when the demographics are prevalent investing in the B, B plus assets, you do get an opportunity to upgrade the asset to a high-quality asset. So 70% to 80% of our capital gets deployed into what we would call A malls."

One of the biggest pain points during the holiday season was lack of parking. So we, obviously, seeing people come to the mall. We are seeing them stay longer at the mall. They're shopping a lot of fewer stores when they come into the mall, but they definitely roaming the malls and shopping. So if you've got the product, the retailer -- the consumer is redoing their research on their mobile device and coming into the mall to shop, which is why still to date, from a soft goods perspective, almost 95% of all soft goods is bought in the bricks-and-mortar store. And I think the other factor that very few people really include into the equation is that the return rate on the soft goods is incredibly high. I think it's 38% of e-commerce purchases of soft goods that have bought online are returned in the bricks-and-mortar store. So to really get a true and proper understanding until the retailers start to show you exactly what the return rate is and how it's being impacted is really hard to evaluate in this omni-channel world why one growth is bigger than the other because you have to take the return rate into account, which really no one does. And just case in point, you go to Amazon opening brick-and-mortar bookstores and their goal is to open, as I understand, 300 to 400 bookstores. And it should sort of sit back and say that the last mile is all important, which is why Bonobos is opening brick-and-mortar stores and Warby Parker is opening brick-and-mortar stores. And Birchbox is cutting their overhead to open bricks-and-mortar stores. It's a very interesting evolution because the cost of the last mile is that important. And again, the mall business, you have to appreciate, which is more focused on fashion, is very different than a stable business where you're buying commodity. And so in the mall business, the impact of e-commerce is a lot less. It's actually your friend, not your enemy."

My prepared remarks will recap the highlights in the quarter, sales trends and some perspectives on our business environment. During the first quarter, our same-store NOI growth came in at 5.2%, company NOI increased nearly 13.9% and EBITDA and FFO growth were each up over 20%. Michael will review our financial results in more detail during his remarks.
The mall portfolio is nearly 96% leased and approximately 85% of our leasing for 2016 is complete. Suite-to-suite spreads were 13% for leases that commenced occupancy during the past 12 months. Total tenant sales, excluding anchors, representing over 80% of the portfolio grew over 2%. Leading categories were home furnishings, followed by [ph]. Sales for tenants occupying space of less than 10,000 square feet declined 1.7%. The decline was almost entirely driven by unusual changes in sales productivity at Christiana mall. 
As a consequence of getaway sales backlog, fluctuations can have meaningful impact at Christiana mall. Excluding this property, tenant sales per square foot for those on the 10,000 square feet increased by 1% and total sales, excluding anchors, increased by 4%. 
JCP mall portfolio given its national scale and high quality posted this growth in light of negative sales comps at our malls located in tourist markets and energy-dependent markets. 
It's good to see that Hawaii is starting to rebound. [indiscernible] sales have increased double-digit year-to-date. We closed on a number of assets transactions during the quarter, including the sale of 4 properties, reach, East Ridge, Provo and 522 Fifth Avenue and acquire the remaining interest in Spokane Valley. 
We're under contract subject to normal closing conditions for the sale of One Stockton in San Francisco for over $100 million and the office components of 685 Fifth Avenue for $150 million. 
We're progressing on a number of redevelopment projects, notably the new Dick's Sporting Goods stores at each of our 5 Houston malls, a new theater and food district in Chicago, the expansion of the Dillard's Fashion Place in Salt Lake City, the expansion of Staten Island Mall and several of the location we owned with [indiscernible]
GGP is a firm believer that higher quality retail assets will not only to continue to be in demand by tenants but also continue to grow in value. We own 100 of the top 400 malls in the United States of America that accounts for 95% of our NOI. The department store closure is an opportunity. We have proven that thesis. 
GGP has nearly 430 anchor stores with only 1 vacancy, which happens to be relocated Nordstrom at Ala Moana. We are currently in lease negotiation for that space.
Our investor deck contains information regarding how we have repented over 80 boxes and the use of our [ph]. Our balance sheet is strong. Debt maturities are lathered over a long period of time. We are working to meet our make our balance sheet even stronger. The pursuit of JV interest in a couple of our malls is in process, and the primary proceeds will be used to pay down debt. 
We focus on the long-term cash flow growth potential of the business, which we believe can generate 4% to 5% EBITDA growth, high single-digit FFO per share growth and a growing dividend.
To be successful in retail real estate, you must know your customer and listen to them. We recently surveyed 88,000 mall shoppers and learn from valuable insights. First, the customer wants a mall to to appropriately curated. What does this mean? It means that we have lease the mall to a variety of retailers, restaurants and entertainment vendors at that the trade area. Over the past 5 years, we had turned the tenant mix by approximately 50%. 
In addition, we're incorporating technology to make consumers aware of what is at the mall. An interesting factor, we have 739 restaurants in our portfolio, 564 service and 179 fast casual. As I mentioned, technology has 2 uses. First, awareness and the second, way finding. Consumers use their smartphones to locate stores and branded products. We want to ensure the tenants at our malls are at the top of the search list. We can never be good enough in awareness. 
The second point from our survey is customer said the biggest pain point in the mall is to find parking. Ironic that most weekends, it is hard to find parking in our malls. We're investing to solve this problem by implementing a number of initiatives, having mall employees park in designated areas or allowing customers to park closer to the entrance, ticketless services, cashless is ready when you leave the mall and information of parking space availability as we called the red light, green light open-space counters and incorporating this info into new digital model maps. Our goal is to have a customer stop search on Google and map that guides a customer to a parking spot and told us for virtually to the store.
Let me give you a little flavor of various industries as I see them over the past few years. The health care industry. We've seen that people are more fit, fitness is big business, whether it's in food, health clubs, appareled. It has grown multifold. The leaders in previous years were named Bally fitness, Jack Wayne and New York Sports Club. The leaders today includes SoulCycle, Equinox, Flywheel and Orange Dairy Fitness. And innovations like the bicycle. The fitness segment is bigger than ever. 
Let's go to Internet search, which has experienced explosive growth. At the beginning, it was AOL. Today, it's led by Google. Smartphones. Our staple of power generation. BlackBerry and Motorola was the leaders, today, it is iPhone and Galaxy. Apparel, the recent demand of dealers in the bankruptcies by [ph], which I believe have viable turnaround plan mask the explosive growth of H&M, Zara, Trimark and L Brent, just to name a few. I was recently with the H&M team in Stockholm. They're focused on expansion where they will be in 50 years making the operations sustainable. In the, the owner of Zara and other lines, may be one of the best logistics company in the world, getting the newest items to the customer when they want and L Brand, forever young and innovative.
You might ask where all this is heading? My point is bring these examples up is that they are winners and losers in every category. The highest quality malls today has evolved and provide the consumer what they want, where the want it and when they want it. Center in Chicago generated $500 per square foot 5 years ago. Today, it's over $900. It is a home of Tesla, Warby Parker, Apple, H&M, Zara, Nordstrom's and Microsoft, just to name a few. There are over 20 restaurants and a new theater opening soon. GGP is well positioned for the long-term success in the retail business. 
As CEO, my primary to reduce to allocate capital in order to generate 4% to 5% EBITDA growth annually. I believe that EBITDA is an important metric to measure our performance. The sales per square foot metric needs to be viewed in light of other measures. Just as an example, we reported sales per square foot of $584 on a rolling 12-month basis. This metric doesn't take into account varying ownership interests we have in the mall, doesn't take into account a variety of NOI levels generated by the malls and certainly doesn't include all the rent in the malls. If we were to wait this metric for NOI contribution to GGP, the $584 will become $691, down slightly from $704. 
The mall industry has been here since the early 1960s. The long history of this industry also contains some insights. Looking back to GGP's shareholder letter from 1995, a couple of messages caught my eye that were highlighted by the team. The retail and shopping center industry has been overbuilt. The ratio of square feet of retail space per capita has doubled in the past 20 years. Only the fittest retailers will survive and the survivors will come out stronger and smarter. 
Department stores, many may fail but such failure will provide opportunities to replace poorly performing stores with new and exciting retailers. I want to repeat, this was the box found in 1995. My personal view of the retail real estate industry in the U.S. is that it is over retailed. This is especially evident when comparing retail square feet per capita in the U.S. to other developed countries. The primary reason retail properties have closed and will close is obsolescence. Once again, it's obsolescences, competition from other bricks and mortar retail. As a footprint of lower quality shopping center shrink, the winners will continue to be the A malls that become larger and more productive. A malls have experienced double-digit sales growth since 2012. Within the 10 most populated markets across the U.S., sales of A malls have grown 20%, while [indiscernible] 4%. This dynamic is evident in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and Dallas, Houston, L.A., New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Miami. Over the decade, over the next decade, we may, again, we may see 300 malls approximately 60 million square feet of in-line GLA accounting for about $18 billion of sales disappear. However, the densification of the top 500 malls to the tune of 50 million square feet with sales of $600 per square foot is equivalent to $25 billion of sales. The share of retail sales at high quality malls will increase. This is where we have positioned GGP. The GGP team is focused on execution. 
Michael will now review our results and outlook for the year."

Let's start with the first quarter.

Let's start with the first quarter. After adjusting for the stock sale gains and the start of revenue recognition for our condo development at Ala Moana, both of which occurred early in the year than we expected, we came in approximately $5 million ahead of our guidance. 
Moving down the income statement, starting with same-store NOI. We came in at $561 million or growth of 5.2% and this was approximately $6 million higher than our guidance. The main driver of the variance was termination income that came in early.
EBITDA was $590 million as reported, less $40 million pretax related to the condos [indiscernible] $550 million versus our guidance number of $525 million for a positive variance of $25 million. 
Approximately $13 million of that came from the stock sale gain. We expected to sell the stock this year and took advantage of 1Q market condition. We did not have the stock sale gain in our first quarter guidance, but it was in our full year number.
Of the remaining $12 million, $6 million came from this same-store NOI I noted and the remaining $6 million is from a variety of small items. The low EBITDA we wrote off approximately $75 million of an accrued interest receivable related to our Aliansce no. And as part of the condo, we have $10 million of tax related to those.
To bring it altogether, FFO came in at $383 million or $48 million better than guidance, the $40 million of condo EBITDA is offset by $10 million in tax plus $13 million from the stock sale gain plus the $6 million  in other positive EBITDA, which is basically offset by the Aliansce write-off. Doing all the math, leaves about $5 million, which is basically attributable to the termination income.
Moving on to the second quarter. Guidance for  second quarter, company FFO $325 million to $345 million or $0.34 to $0.36 per share. Our guidance includes $13 million to $14 million of after-tax FFO related to the condos, which is the same run rate we expect for the third quarter and fourth quarter, assuming sales and cost trends remain the same. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect same-store NOI of approximately $560 million, around 3.5% growth. We expect EBITDA of approximately $540 million or growth of around 7.5%.
Moving onto our balance sheet -- I’m sorry, first let's go to full year 2016. Our expectations remain the same. Same-store NOI of 4% to 5% or a little over $2.3 billion. EBITDA of 8% to 9%, almost $2.3 billion. And FFO per share of $1.52 to $1.56, approximately $1.475 billion. 
Now let's move on to the balance sheet. We extended the $1.4 billion term loan that we have out 3 years to 2019 plus 2 1-year extensions. We reduced recourse on the loan from 100% to 50% and maintain pricing. As we've previously indicated, we're in the process of looking at asset sales and sales of joint venture interest. We would expect to use a significant portion of the proceeds to pay down debt. If our plan succeeds, we would take our net debt-to-EBITDA from a range of 8 to 8.5, down to 7.5 to 8x by year-end. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So as a group, we're actually seeing positive spreads, positive sales growth. The other aspect, I think, we recently keep talking about sales as much as sales per square foot of 10,000 feet is because the total tilt to lead us capture what we're seeing in the market where you got the larger apparel guys like H&M, Zara, Pramod coming in with very health sales for the to the end actually lifting the sales productivity within the mall. And so gatherings advantage of doing it that we speak go only really after is to increase our penetration rate in a specific market. Okay. That relief from an operator perspective, it's the most important. If I can increase the total mall sales by 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, I'm increasing the penetration rate and increase my traffic. And I'm going to continue to see that evolve. I mean, the next generation retailers, the will be partners, the Tesla, coming from Apple, Microsoft are going to continue to evolve the larger farmout L Brands committee Pink stores, the do well will them and the list is quite extensive. So my entire reason of so to speak in different industries in my opening remarks was to sort of capture the fact that there are winners and losers in every business. Let's not focus only in the retail business the relative business it would be the commerce business, including the Internet search business, you could be in the phone business and you're going to have winners and losers. And the beauty is if you have great real estate, as well as [indiscernible] 20 years ago and box [ph] 20 years ago, okay, it's an opportunity to replace and you continue to see an evolution of retail with mall productive.

My prepared remarks will recap highlights in the quarter, sales trends and some perspectives on our business environment. 
During the first quarter, our same-store NOI growth came in at 5.2%, company NOI increased nearly 13.9% and EBITDA and FFO growth were each up over 20%. Michael will review our financial results in more detail during his remarks.
The mall portfolio is nearly 96% leased, and approximately 85% of our leasing for 2016 is complete. Suite-to-suite spreads were 13% for leases that commenced occupancy during the past 12 months. Total tenant sales excluding anchors, representing over 80% of the portfolio, grew over 2%. Leading categories were home furnishings, followed by food and apparel. 
Sales for tenants occupying space less than 10,000 square feet declined 1.7%. The decline was almost entirely driven by unusual changes in sales productivity at Christiana Mall. As a consequence of Delaware sales tax floors, fluctuations can have meaningful impact at Christiana Mall. Excluding this property, tenant sales per square foot for those on the 10,000 square feet increased by 1% and total sales excluding anchors increased by 4%. JCP mall portfolio, given its national scale and high quality, posted this growth in light of negative sales comps at our malls located in tourist markets and energy-dependent markets. 
It's good to see that Hawaii is starting to rebound. LVMH sales have increased double digits year-to-date. We closed on a number of asset transactions during the quarter, including the sale of 4 properties, Owings Mills Eastridge, Provo and 522 Fifth Avenue, and acquired the remaining interest in Spokane Valley. We're under contract, subject to normal closing conditions, for the sale of 1 Stockton in San Francisco for over $100 million and the office component of 685 Fifth Avenue for $150 million. 
We are progressing on a number of redevelopment projects, notably the new Dick's Sporting Goods stores at each of our 5 Houston malls, a new theater and food district at Oakbrook Center in Chicago, the expansion of Dillard's at Fashion Place in Salt Lake City, the expansion of Staten Island Mall and several of the Sears locations we own with Seritage. GGP is a firm believer that higher-quality retail assets will not only continue to be in demand by tenants but also continue to grow in value. We own 100 of the top 400 malls in the United States of America that accounts for 95% of our NOI. 
A department store closure is an opportunity. We have proven that thesis. GGP has nearly 430 anchor stores with only 1 vacancy, which happens to be a relocated Nordstrom at Ala Moana. We are currently in lease negotiation for that space. Our investor deck contains information regarding how we have re-tenanted over 80 boxes, and the new uses are numerous. 
Our balance sheet is strong. Debt maturities are laddered  over a long period of time. We're working to make our balance sheet even stronger. The pursuit of selling JV interests in a couple of our malls is in process, and the primary proceeds will be used to pay down debt. We focus on the long-term cash flow growth potential of the business, which we believe can generate 4% to 5% EBITDA growth, high single-digit FFO per share growth and a growing dividend.
To be successful in retail real estate, you must know your customer and listen to them. We recently surveyed 88,000 mall shoppers and learned from valuable insights. First, the customer wants a mall to be appropriately curated. What does this mean? It means that we have leased a mall to a variety of retailers, restaurants and entertainment vendors at best of the trade area. Over the past 5 years, we have turned the tenant mix by approximately 50%. 
In addition, we're incorporating technology to make consumers aware of what is at the mall. An interesting factoid, we have 739 restaurants in our portfolio, 564 service and 179 fast casual. As I mentioned, technology has 2 uses: first, awareness; and the second, way finding. Consumers use their smartphones to locate stores and branded products. We want to ensure the tenants at our malls are at the top of the search list. We can never be good enough on awareness. 
The second point from our survey is that customers said the biggest pain point in the mall is to find parking. Ironic that, most weekends, it is hard to find parking in our malls. We're investing to solve this problem by implementing a number of initiatives: having mall employees park in designated areas; allowing customers to park closer to the entrance; ticketless valet services, cashless, car is ready when you leave the mall; and information of parking space availability, as we call it, the red light, green light, open-space counters and incorporating this information into new digital mall maps. Our goal is to have a customer start their search on Google. That map guides the customer to a parking spot and blue dots [ph] her virtually to the store.
Let me give you a little flavor of various industries as I see them over the past few years. The health care industry. We've seen that people are more fit. Fitness is big business, whether it's in food, health clubs, apparel. It has grown multifold. The leaders in previous years were names like Bally Fitness, Jack LaLanne and New York Sports Club. The leaders today include SoulCycle, Equinox, CorePower Yoga, Flywheel and Orangetheory Fitness and innovations like the Peloton bicycle. The fitness segment is bigger than ever. 
Let's go to Internet search, which has experienced explosive growth. At the beginning, it was AOL. Today, it is led by Google. Smartphones, our staple of our generation. BlackBerry and Motorola were the leaders. Today, it is iPhone and Galaxy. 
In apparel, the recent demise of Deb Shops and Delia's and the bankruptcies by Wet Seal and PacSun, which I believe have viable turnaround plans, mask the explosive growth of H&M, Zara, Trimark and L Brands, just to name a few. I was recently with the H&M team in Stockholm. They are focused on expansion, where they will be in 50 years and making their operations sustainable. Inditex, the owner of Zara and other lines, may be one of the best logistics company in the world, getting the newest items to the customer when they want. And L Brands, forever young and innovative.
You might ask where all this is heading. My point is bringing these examples up is that there are winners and losers in every category. The highest-quality malls today has evolved and provide the consumer with what they want, where the want it and when they want it. 
Oakbrook Center in Chicago generated $500 per square foot 5 years ago. Today, it's over $900. It is the home of Tesla, Warby Parker, Apple, H&M, Zara, Nordstrom and Microsoft, just to name a few. There are over 20 restaurants and a new theater opening soon. GGP is positioned for the long-term success of the retail business. 
As CEO, my primary job is to allocate capital in order to generate 4% to 5% EBITDA growth annually. I believe that EBITDA is an important metric to measure our performance. The sales per square foot metric needs to be viewed in light of other measures. Just as an example, we reported sales per square foot of $584 on a rolling 12-month basis. This metric doesn't take into account varying ownership interests we have in the mall, it doesn't take into account the variety of NOI levels generated by the malls and certainly doesn't include all the rent-paying tenants in the malls. If we were to weigh this metric for NOI contribution to GGP, the $584 will become $691, down slightly from $704. 
The mall industry has been here since the early 1960s. The long history of this industry also contains some insights. Looking back to GGP's shareholder letter from 1995, a couple of messages caught my eye that were highlighted by the team. The retail and shopping center industry has been overbuilt. The ratio of square feet of retail space per capita has doubled in the past 20 years. Only the fittest retailers will survive and the survivors will come out stronger and smarter. Department stores. Many may fail, but such failure will provide opportunities to replace poorly performing stores with new and exciting retailers. I want to repeat, this was Bucksbaums in 1995. 
My personal view of the retail real estate industry in the U.S. is that it is over-retailed. This is especially evident when comparing retail square feet per capita in the U.S. to other developed countries. The primary reason retail properties have closed and will close is obsolescence. Once again, it's obsolescence, competition from other bricks-and-mortar retail. 
As the footprint of lower-quality shopping centers shrink, then the winners will continue to be the A malls that become larger and more productive. A malls have experienced double-digit sales growth since 2012. Within the 10 most populated markets across the U.S., sales of A malls have grown 20%, while population [ph], 4%. This dynamic is evident in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, L.A., New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Miami. 
Over the decade -- over the next decade, we may, again, we may see 300 malls, approximately 60 million square feet of in-line GLA accounting for about $18 billion of sales disappear. However, the densification of the top 500 malls to the tune of 50 million square feet with sales of $600 per square foot is equivalent to $25 billion of sales. The share of retail sales at high-quality malls will increase. This is where we have positioned GGP. The GGP team is focused on execution. 
Michael will now review our results and outlook for the year."
328377,328669268,971476,"General Growth Properties, Inc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Brookfield Property REIT Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the first quarter. After adjusting for the stock sale gains and the start of revenue recognition for our condo development at Ala Moana, both of which occurred earlier in the year than we ex",554,"Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the first quarter. After adjusting for the stock sale gains and the start of revenue recognition for our condo development at Ala Moana, both of which occurred earlier in the year than we expected, we came in approximately $5 million ahead of our guidance. 
Moving down the income statement, starting with same-store NOI. We came in at $561 million or growth of 5.2%, and this was approximately $6 million higher than our guidance. The main driver of the variance was termination income that came in early.
EBITDA was $590 million as reported. Less $40 million pretax related to the condos leaves $550 million versus our guidance number of $525 million, for a positive variance of $25 million. Approximately $13 million of that came from the stock sale gain. We expected to sell the stock this year and took advantage of 1Q market conditions. We did not have the stock sale gain in our first quarter guidance, but it was in our full year number. Of the remaining $12 million, $6 million came from the same-store NOI beat I noted, and the remaining $6 million is from a variety of small items. 
Below EBITDA, we wrote off approximately $7.5 million of an accrued interest receivable related to our Aliansce notes. And as part of the condos, we had about $10 million of tax related to those.
To bring it all together, FFO came in at $383 million or $48 million better than guidance. The $40 million of condo EBITDA is offset by $10 million in tax plus $13 million from the stock sale gains plus the $6 million  in other positive EBITDA, which is basically offset by the Aliansce write-off. Doing all that math leaves about $5 million, which is basically attributable to the termination income.
Moving on to the second quarter. Guidance for second quarter, company FFO $325 million to $345 million or $0.34 to $0.36 per share. Our guidance includes $13 million to $14 million of after-tax FFO related to the condos, which is the same run rate we expect for third quarter and fourth quarter, assuming sales and cost trends remain the same. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect same-store NOI of approximately $560 million, around 3.5% growth. We expect EBITDA of approximately $540 million or growth of around 7.5%.
Moving on to our balance sheet -- I’m sorry, first let's go through full year 2016. Our expectations remain the same: same-store NOI of 4% to 5% or a little over $2.3 billion; EBITDA of 8% to 9%, almost $2.3 billion; and FFO per share of $1.52 to $1.56, approximately $1.475 billion. 
Now let's move on to the balance sheet. We extended the $1.4 billion term loan that we have, out 3 years to 2019 plus 2 1-year extensions. We reduced recourse on the loan from 100% to 50% and maintained pricing. As we have previously indicated, we are in the process of looking at asset sales and sales of joint venture interest.

Home furnishings, food, apparel, electronics, they were all up. So as a group, we're actually seeing positive spreads -- I mean positive sales growth. The other aspect, I think, we speak -- and the reason we keep talking about total sales as much as sales per square foot of 10,000 -- less than 10,000 feet is because the total sales truly best capture what we're seeing in the market, where you got the larger apparel guys, like H&M, Zara, Primark, coming in with very high sales productivity and actually lifting the sales productivity of apparel within the mall. And so -- and the other advantage of doing it that way is that what we're really after is to increase our penetration rate in a specific market, okay? That really, from an operator perspective, is the most important. If I can increase the total mall sales by 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, I'm increasing my penetration rate, I'm increasing my traffic. And we're going to continue to see that evolve. I mean the next-generation retailers, the Warby Parkers, the Bonoboses, the Teslas, I mean Apple, Microsoft, are going to continue to evolve. The larger format -- L Brands, the PINK stores, the lululemons, the Fabletics, the list is quite extensive. So you -- my entire reason of sort to speaking different industries in my opening remarks was to sort of capture the fact that there are winners and losers in every business. Let's not focus only on the retail business or the relative business. You could be in the e-commerce business, you could be in the Internet search business, you could be in the phone business, and you're going to have winners and losers. And the beauty is if you have great real estate, as Milton Cooper said 20 years ago and Matthew and -- Bucksbaum said 20 years ago, okay, it's an opportunity to replace. And you continue to see an evolution of retail with more productive tenants. So it's a constant evolution, and we've seen this pattern for 50 years."

On the contrary, they all wanted to come to the mall. They all like to come to the mall. That's where they socially interact, and they just want the mall to be curated correctly for them to be able to have a parking space. Now the technology part is where we are very focused because we do know that customers -- 2/3 of the customers start their process of buying on their mobile phones. And it all starts up with a Google search. So the whole aspect here is to take you painlessly from a Google search to a parking spot to the store.

My prepared remarks will recap highlights in the quarter, sales trends and some perspectives on our business environment. 
During the first quarter, our same-store NOI growth came in at 5.2%, company NOI increased nearly 13.9% and EBITDA and FFO growth were each up over 20%. Michael will review our financial results in more detail during his remarks.
The mall portfolio is nearly 96% leased, and approximately 85% of our leasing for 2016 is complete. Suite-to-suite spreads were 13% for leases that commenced occupancy during the past 12 months. Total tenant sales excluding anchors, representing over 80% of the portfolio, grew over 2%. Leading categories were home furnishings, followed by food and apparel. 
Sales for tenants occupying space less than 10,000 square feet declined 1.7%. The decline was almost entirely driven by unusual changes in sales productivity at Christiana Mall. As a consequence of Delaware sales tax floors, fluctuations can have meaningful impact at Christiana Mall. Excluding this property, tenant sales per square foot for those on the 10,000 square feet increased by 1% and total sales excluding anchors increased by 4%. JCP mall portfolio, given its national scale and high quality, posted this growth in light of negative sales comps at our malls located in tourist markets and energy-dependent markets. 
It's good to see that Hawaii is starting to rebound. LVMH sales have increased double digits year to date. We closed on a number of asset transactions during the quarter, including the sale of 4 properties: Owings Mills, Eastridge, Provo and 522 Fifth Avenue, and acquired the remaining interest in Spokane Valley. We are under contract, subject to normal closing conditions, for the sale of 1 Stockton in San Francisco for over $100 million and the office component of 685 Fifth Avenue for $150 million. 
We are progressing on a number of redevelopment projects, notably the new Dick's Sporting Goods stores at each of our 5 Houston malls, a new theater and food district at Oakbrook Center in Chicago, the expansion of the Dillard's at Fashion Place in Salt Lake City, the expansion of Staten Island Mall and several of the Sears locations we own with Seritage. GGP is a firm believer that higher-quality retail assets will not only continue to be in demand by tenants but also continue to grow in value. We own 100 of the top 400 malls in the United States of America. That accounts for 95% of our NOI. 
A department store closure is an opportunity. We have proven that thesis. GGP has nearly 430 anchor stores with only 1 vacancy, which happens to be a relocated Nordstrom's at Ala Moana. We are currently in lease negotiation for that space. Our investor deck contains inside [ph] information regarding how we have re-tenanted over 80 boxes, and the new uses are numerous. 
Our balance sheet is strong. Debt maturities are laddered over a long period of time. We're working to make our balance sheet even stronger. The pursuit of selling JV interests in a couple of our malls is in process, and the primary proceeds will be used to pay down debt. We focus on the long-term cash flow growth potential of the business, which we believe can generate 4% to 5% EBITDA growth, high single-digit FFO per share growth and a growing dividend.
To be successful in retail real estate, you must know your customer and listen to them. We recently surveyed 88,000 mall shoppers and learned from valuable insights. First, the customer wants a mall to be appropriately curated. What does this mean? It means that we have leased a mall to a variety of retailers, restaurants and entertainment vendors at best of the trade area. Over the past 5 years, we have turned the tenant mix by approximately 50%. 
In addition, we're incorporating technology to make consumers aware of what is at the mall. An interesting factoid: we have 739 restaurants in our portfolio, 564 service and 179 fast casual. As I mentioned, technology has 2 uses: first, awareness; and the second, way finding. Consumers use their smartphones to locate stores and branded products. We want to ensure the tenants at our malls are at the top of the search list. We can never be good enough on awareness. 
The second point from our survey is that a customer said the biggest pain point in a mall is to find parking. Ironic that most weekends, it is hard to find parking in our malls. We're investing to solve this problem by implementing a number of initiatives: having mall employees park in designated areas; allowing customers to park closer to the entrance; ticketless valet services, cashless, car is ready when you leave the mall; and information of parking space availability, as we call it, the red light/green light, open-space counters and incorporating this information into new digital mall maps. Our goal is to have a customer start their search on Google. That map guides the customer to a parking spot and blue-dots her virtually to the store.
Let me give you a little flavor of various industries as I see them over the past few years. The health care industry. We've seen that people are more fit. Fitness is big business, whether it's in food, health clubs, apparel. It has grown multifold. The leaders in previous years were names like Bally Fitness, Jack LaLanne and New York Sports Club. The leaders today include SoulCycle, Equinox, CorePower Yoga, Flywheel and Orangetheory Fitness and innovations like the Peloton bicycle. The fitness segment is bigger than ever. 
Let's go to Internet search, which has experienced explosive growth. At the beginning, it was AOL. Today, it is led by Google. Smartphones, our staple of our generation. BlackBerry and Motorola were the leaders. Today, it's iPhone and Galaxy. 
In apparel, the recent demise of Deb Shops and Delia's and the bankruptcies by Wet Seal and PacSun, which I believe have viable turnaround plans, mask the explosive growth of H&M, Zara, Trimark and L Brands, just to name a few. I was recently with the H&M team in Stockholm. They are focused on expansion, where they will be in 50 years and making their operations sustainable. Inditex, the owner of Zara and other lines, may be one of the best logistics company in the world, getting the newest items to the customer when they want. And L Brands, forever young and innovative.
You might ask where all this is heading. My point is bringing these examples up is that there are winners and losers in every category. The highest-quality malls today has evolved and provide the consumer with what they want, where the want it and when they want it. 
Oakbrook Center in Chicago generated $500 per square foot 5 years ago. Today, it's over $900. It is the home of Tesla, Warby Parker, Apple, H&M, Zara, Nordstrom and Microsoft, just to name a few. There are over 20 restaurants and a new theater opening soon. GGP is positioned for the long-term success of the retail business. 
As CEO, my primary job is to allocate capital in order to generate 4% to 5% EBITDA growth annually. I believe that EBITDA is an important metric to measure our performance. The sales per square foot metric needs to be viewed in light of other measures. Just as an example, we reported sales per square foot of $584 on a rolling 12-month basis. This metric doesn't take into account varying ownership interests we have in the mall, it doesn't take into account the variety of NOI levels generated by the malls and certainly doesn't include all the rent-paying tenants in the malls. If we were to weigh this metric for NOI contribution to GGP, the $584 will become $691, down slightly from $704. 
The mall industry has been here since the early 1960s. The long history of this industry also contains some insights. Looking back to GGP's shareholder letter from 1995, a couple of messages caught my eye that were highlighted by the team. The retail and shopping center industry has been overbuilt. The ratio of square feet of retail space per capita has doubled in the past 20 years. Only the fittest retailers will survive and the survivors will come out stronger and smarter. Department stores. Many may fail, but such failure will provide opportunities to replace poorly performing stores with new and exciting retailers. I want to repeat, this was the Bucksbaum in 1995. 
My personal view of the retail real estate industry in the U.S. is that it is over-retailed. This is especially evident when comparing retail square feet per capita in the U.S. to other developed countries. The primary reason retail properties have closed and will close is obsolescence. Once again, it's obsolescence: competition from other bricks-and-mortar retail. 
As the footprint of lower-quality shopping centers shrink, then the winners will continue to be the A malls that become larger and more productive. A malls have experienced double-digit sales growth since 2012. Within the 10 most populated markets across the U.S., sales of A malls have grown 20%, while [indiscernible] 4%. This dynamic is evident in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, L.A., New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Miami. 
Over the decade -- over the next decade, we may, again, we may see 300 malls, approximately 60 million square feet of in-line GLA accounting for about $18 billion of sales disappear. However, the densification of the top 500 malls to the tune of 50 million square feet with sales of $600 per square foot is equivalent to $25 billion of sales. The share of retail sales at high-quality malls will increase. This is where we have positioned GGP. The GGP team is focused on execution. 
Michael will now review our results and outlook for the year."
328377,328669268,971678,"General Growth Properties, Inc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Brookfield Property REIT Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the first quarter.

Let's start with the first quarter. After adjusting for the stock sale gains and the start of revenue recognition for our condo development at Ala Moana, both of which occurred earlier in the year than we expected, we came in at approximately $5 million ahead of our guidance. 
Moving down the income statement, starting with same-store NOI, we came in at $561 million or growth of 5.2%, and this was approximately $6 million higher than our guidance. The main driver of the variance was termination income that came in early.
EBITDA was $590 million as reported less $40 million pretax related to the condos leaves $550 million versus our guidance number of $525 million, for a positive variance of $25 million. Approximately $13 million of that came from the stock sale gain. We expected to sell the stock this year and took advantage of 1Q market conditions. We did not have the stock sale gain in our first quarter guidance, but it was in our full year number. Of the remaining $12 million, $6 million came from the same-store NOI beat I noted, and the remaining $6 million is from a variety of small items. 
Below EBITDA, we wrote off approximately $7.5 million of an accrued interest receivable related to our Aliansce notes. And as part of the condos, we had about $10 million of tax related to those.
To bring it all together, FFO came in at $383 million or $48 million better than guidance. The $40 million of condo EBITDA is offset by $10 million in tax plus $13 million from the stock sale gains plus the $6 million in other positive EBITDA, which is basically offset by the Aliansce write-off. Doing all that math leaves about $5 million, which is basically attributable to the termination income.
Moving on to the second quarter. Guidance for second quarter, company FFO $325 million to $345 million or $0.34 to $0.36 per share. Our guidance includes $13 million to $14 million of after-tax FFO related to the condos, which is the same run rate we expect for the third quarter and fourth quarter, assuming sales and cost trends remain the same. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect same-store NOI of approximately $560 million, around 3.5% growth. We expect EBITDA of approximately $540 million or growth of around 7.5%.
Moving on to our balance sheet -- I’m sorry, first let's go through full year 2016. Our expectations remain the same: same-store NOI of 4% to 5% or a little over $2.3 billion; EBITDA of 8% to 9%, almost $2.3 billion; and FFO per share of $1.52 to $1.56, approximately $1.475 billion. 
Now let's move on to the balance sheet. We extended the $1.4 billion term loan that we have, out 3 years to 2019 plus 2 1-year extensions. We reduced recourse on the loan from 100% to 50% and maintained pricing. As we have previously indicated, we are in the process of looking at asset sales and sales of joint venture interests. We would expect to use a significant portion of the proceeds to pay down debt. If our plan succeeds, we would take our net debt-to-EBITDA from a range of 8 to 8.5, down to 7.5 to 8x by year end. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

It kind of depends on timing of cash inputs, which loans you want to take down, which not. None of the transactions, other than the ones that are closed, are in our guidance, so 685, Stockton not yet in our guidance."

And as we have said, the assets we're looking to bring in joint venture partners are those that are substantial value within our portfolio, so there's a tilt to diversification, and they're in tourist markets. When we sold 37.5% of Ala Moana, it was because we felt an asset of $5.5 billion, $6 billion would be in a, call it, 12%, 13%, 14% of the total market cap of the company, and it was prudent to start to derisk from a specific market and having so much concentration. So we are balancing a few things: the concentration in certain tourist markets as well as the arbitrage between public and private markets. And then we think that you can use the proceeds prudently to pay down -- substantially used to pay down debt and still maintain the advantage of having an A-quality mall portfolio."

The other aspect, I think, we speak -- and the reason we keep talking about total sales as much as sales per square foot of 10,000 [ph] -- less [ph] than 10,000 feet is because the total sales truly does capture what we're seeing in the market, where you got the larger apparel guys, like H&M, Zara, Primark, coming in with very high sales productivity and actually lifting the sales productivity of apparel within the mall. And so -- and the other advantage of doing it that way is that what we're really after is to increase our penetration rate in a specific market, okay? That really, from an operator perspective, is the most important. If I can increase the total mall sales by 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, I'm increasing my penetration rate. I'm increasing my traffic. And we're going to continue to see that evolve. I mean the next-generation retailers: the Warby Parkers, the Bonoboses, the Teslas, I mean Apple and Microsoft, are going to continue to evolve. The larger format -- L Brands, the PINK stores, the lululemons, the Fabletics, the list is quite extensive. So you -- my entire reason of sort of speaking different industries in my opening remarks was to sort of capture the fact that there are winners and losers in every business. Let's not focus only on the retail business or the real estate business. You could be in the e-commerce business. You could be in the Internet search business. You could be in the phone business and you're going to have winners and losers.

On the contrary, they all wanted to come to the mall. They all like to come to the mall. That's where they socially interact, and they just want the mall to be curated correctly for them to be able to have a parking space. Now the technology part is where we are very focused because we do know that customers -- 2/3 of the customers start their process of buying on their mobile phones. And it all starts up with a Google search. So the whole aspect here is to take you painlessly from a Google search to a parking spot to the store. That, again, just facilitates and time-saves the customer. The customer wants to actually go to the mall to shop. We've seen no dropoff in traffic from the end of the last year.

There are spaces that we think they're going to give. And we've got 5 guys lined up to take them so..."

And it would really come back more to be what financial assistance are we prepared to provide PacSun and Aeropostale to keep them afloat, to give them the chance to effectuate their turnaround, so -- which is why you're not taking into account the total exposure. As Michael said, if you take into account the total exposure, you've got 100-odd stores at 5,000 square feet, and you can do the math. It's an astronomical math. But since you don't anticipate a liquidation, I think our conservative reserve of $20 million should be sufficient, we hope."

So 3 years from now, maybe it will be different, maybe not. But right now, the way we're running the company, given the use of proceeds, given what we could do, we think reducing the leverage will be the best use of proceeds. We may save some for other things, but for the most part, it will be to pay down debt."

We felt that it was time to impair the note. That note  -- the collateral for that note are the shares of Aliansce. On the day we impaired the note, we took it down to the value of the shares on that particular day. That resulted in the $29 million impairment loss that you see in the financials. The remaining $7.5 million that we took through income is a write-off of the accrued interest receivable that we had been receiving on that note.

Good morning, everyone. Our latest sustainability report is available on our website. For the past several years, we have been identifying and executing on ways to improve our impact on the environment. I want to mention a few highlights from the report. 
We have diverted 54,000 tons of waste from landfills, which is enough to fill all 4,500 garbage trucks. Water consumption has been reduced by 64 million gallons, which is enough wanted to fill almost 100 Olympic sized swimming pools. We have completed lighting and upgrades which will save the equivalent energy of taking 4,600 ohms of the electric grid. And we expect to be one of the largest generators of solar energy in the U.S. this year. We continue to explore new opportunities to implement sustainable operating factors throughout our portfolio. 
Now let's return to our recent results. FFO per share was $0.35, up almost 7% from the same quarter last year. Year-to-date FFO per share was $0.75, up over 15% from last year. EBITDA was up 6.5% from the same quarter last year and over 13% year-to-date from last year. Same-store NOI growth was up 4% for the quarter and 4.6% year-to-date. Results were driven primarily by continued strength from our portfolio and occupancy gains and expense management. The increased according to dividend to $0.20, 11% increase over last year. 
The portfolio was over 96% leased at quarter end and occupancy stood at about 91.5% as we expected -- which is what we expected at this time of the year. Total sales excluding department stores and Christiana Mall were up about 3% and sales for tenants under 10,000 feet were flat excluding Christiana Mall. Categories that performed fast were restaurants, home furnishings and health and personal care. We even had a positive comp in apparel. This is for total sales x department stores. Lease spreads for leases commencing in the trailing 12 months are about 13% or a little over $8 per square foot. To counter our lease spread, we include based [indiscernible] and compared them to the ending rent on the expiring lease at the beginning rent of the new lease on a street-to-street basis, regardless of size. 
Turning to property content. In June, we sold our [indiscernible] in San Francisco for approximately $50 million, which values the asset at a subsea cat on the trailing 12-month basis. This is the highest price paid for an asset per square foot in Union Square, almost $5,800 per square foot. You may recall, we acquired this asset in 2014, one of our initial investments in urban retail with a plan to release space since the existing tenants was relocating to the square. We successfully released the space to T-Mobile, stabilizing the assets and then sold our interest. On an IR basis, we realized about 40%. 
In June, we sold Pioneer Place office buildings, a class A asset, for approximately $122 million which values the asset [indiscernible]. In July, we sold New Gate Mall, located in Austin Utah for approximately $17 million, which values the asset at a high single-digit cap rate. The estimated reclose [indiscernible] Valley Mall located in Medford, Oregon for over $60 million, which value the asset at the high single-digit cut-rate. 
We're pleased to announce a new joint venture with TIAA Global Asset Management at Fashion Show in Las Vegas. GGP and TIAA are partners at other properties and we look forward to our new partnership with them. As you know, Fashion Show is a one-of-a-kind asset. Over the past several years, the GGP team has successfully re-tenanted several anchor boxes bringing in Macy's, Urban Outfitters and Dick's Sporting Goods to the mall. We brought to life The Boulevard entrance bringing a number of known dining and leisure options. TIAA would now own approximately 50% of Fashion Show. The transaction values asset at approximately $2.5 billion at cap rates. 
We closed on the previously announced acquisition of 218 West 57th Street in New York City. You may recall, we entered into a commitment to acquire this property located across the street from the new Nordstrom back in 2014. The asset was owner-occupied and offers us unique and rare opportunity for our retailer to have a prominent presence on West 57th Street across from the future Nordstrom, which will be the first full-line Nordstrom in Manhattan. 
Finally, I like to talk about our investment Aliansce, a Brazilian mall owner. As you may recall from our first quarter earnings call, we wrote down a note receivable to approximately $70 million, which represented the market value of the underlying common shares which were collateral for the note. We also wrote off about $7.5 million of accrued interest income. During the second quarter, we've agreed to take ownership of the shares, about $18.3 million in exchange for canceling the note. As you know, GGP's focus is owning retail real estate in the United States. 
We recently entered into an agreement to sell the shares to an institutional buyer for approximately $85 million. Upon close later this quarter, we would have no remaining interest in Aliansce. In terms of how this transaction is slated for earnings, we are excluding the writedown and markup from company FFO, but including both FFO in accordance of the definition. 
Let me talk a little bit about our industry. GGP is in the retail real estate business. Historically, retail real estate has been segmented. They are more like centers, lifestyle centers, power centers and so on. Together, they equate to 24 square feet of retail per capita. Based on our research, we believe that only about 4 square feet per capita of retail GLA is high-quality. Approximately 8% of the higher-quality retail real estate in the United States is in the GGP portfolio, from which 95% of our NOI is derived. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the retail real estate business. Let me talk a little bit about our leasing. We are pleased to report, we have no [indiscernible] in our portfolio. So let's start with the new inventory that's upon us. As you all know, has started as an operator. We had 9 locations, 6 large-format stores and 3 elite stores. The  3 elite stores will go back into in-line GLA until we are focused on leasing the large-format stores. 3 of them have already been released 1 to Target and the other 2 in [indiscernible]. We are progressing with the remaining operations. There is strong demand. 
I'd like to provide an update on our redevelopment plans for the the anchor boxes, which we own with Seritage. We plan to commence redevelopment of 4 locations later this year. At Pembrook's Lake, we are being in a movie theater, AMC. At Mall, we are bringing in container store. And in no time, our at Coronado Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, we have several in-line retailers, restaurants and a container store. And in Valley Park Plaza, we have in-line tenants that are signed and restaurants. When active negotiations in additional 5, so we are making very good progress on 9 of the 12 locations. Our properties are in demand by users like grocery, big box sporting-goods, theaters, restaurants and other entertainment venues. These types of tenants further create them all. We are located in the mall with an opportunity for them to reach a large big area and generate new customers and traffic already at the shopping center. 
We have 460 full-service restaurants comprised of 3.6 million square feet in our portfolio. It's a 7% of our deal GLA and 13% of our sales. Just in the last 5 years, we have done 292 full-service restaurant deals for 2.1 million square feet. Further, 13% of our total GLA is big box, comprised of 195 big box tenants, 55 of those deals were made in the last 5 years. Those 55 deals are comprised of 12 Dave & Buster's, 4 Nordstrom racks, 9 theaters, 9 altars, 14 big sporting-goods and 7 supermarkets including the [indiscernible] opened in the former JCPenney Boston. 
At 200 Lafayette in SoHo, New York City, held its grand opening in May. Burrs offers a unique when looking for kitchen and bath fixtures and I encourage you to visit their flagship store. We acquired the asset in 2014 for about $115 million. We leased office space and the office portion for approximately $125 million last year. With the retail portion now stabilized, we are generating yield in the mid- to high-teens. 
At 730 Fifth Avenue, the Crown Building, we're pleased to welcome the venue. We continue to see inputs of retailers coming to the mall and demand from other retail concepts. For example, [indiscernible] recently opened its pioneer place in Portland and new concepts like Country Club Prep, [indiscernible] ELF Cosmetics and just to name a few either the open stores are will be opening stores soon in our portfolio. 
I like to update you on PacSun and Aeropostale. We have 71 PacSun locations in our portfolio. Off those 71, 6 will be vacating at the end of the year, 65 stores will be we expect PacSun to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of September. Regarding Aeropostale, it is our expectation that the sales process will happen in the month of August. We believe Aeropostale will remain a viable entity going forward, although its footprint may be smaller than it is today. 
As a final note, we have been talking a lot about improving the customer experience at the mall. Parking lots at our malls are at capacity. Our customers tell us that parking is a common [indiscernible] within the shopping experience. We are very excited that the recent introduction of our new parking app at Oakwood Center, Alderwood Mall Galleria is up and operating. For those of you who live near those centers, we encourage you to try the new app and send us your feedback. We plan a broader rollout across the portfolio later this year. Michael will now take you through our results for the quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year."
328377,345257983,1021196,"General Growth Properties, Inc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Brookfield Property REIT Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone.

I will start out with some brief comments on second quarter results, followed by details in the asset transactions, the impact on our full-year guidance. Finally, I will provide an update on our balance sheet activities before we open it up to questions. 
Before I begin, I want point an error on Page 16 of the supplement. The occupancy cost ratios for the same-store retail properties should be 13.9% for the June 2016 quarter and 13.2% for the June 2015 quarter. We apologize for the error. 
Moving on to the second quarter. Same-store permanent revenues were up 4.3% compared to the prior year and as we noted, same-store NOI came in at $555 million, up 4% from last year. SG&A for the quarter was a minus $43 million compared to minus $40 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change was due to some one-time financing fees that we received last year. The current quarter net G&A came in consistent with our expectation. 
EBITDA came in at $534 million and overall, company FFO came in at a strong $0.35 per share, in line with our guidance. As noted in the press release, we closed on 2 asset sales during the quarter, 3 more asset sales subsequent to quarter end. These transactions total net proceeds of approximately $1 billion. While we're using approximately $300 million of the proceeds to pay down mortgage debt, we noted both of those transactions in the press release, these 3 loans represent over half of our 2017 maturities and we're also paying off $90 million debt outstanding. 
At this point, we are retaining the remaining proceeds of approximately $600 million. Keep in mind, there are taxable gains associated with the asset sales and depending on where our taxable income comes in at year-end, we currently expect to use approximately $250 million of the proceeds to pay out a special dividend of approximately $0.25 per share subject to board approval. The timing, as we think of it now, will be around the same as our regular fourth quarter dividend. 
I want to go through the FFO dilution, the impact on '16 and then the impact on an annualized basis. For 2016, we lose about $20 million in FFO through the asset sales. Based on paying down the debt, we get back $7 million in interest saving and we generate about a $1 million joint venture fee for the remainder of the year on the Fashion Show transaction. 
There's also one-time expense for cost to prepay assumed mortgages of $5.5 million that will impact the third quarter. The total impact for the year is $0.02 per share for 2016. On an annualized basis, looking forward, we lose approximately $52 million of FFO in asset sales. We get back around $14 million in NOI interest expense savings from the debt paydown and we will generate around full year $3 million fee on newly formed Fashion Show joint venture, the full impact is approximately 3.5 per share. 
Our full-year guidance is now $1.51 to $1.55. The previous midpoint was $1.54. We're adjusting our guidance up $0.01 due to a positive operations. We then adjust for the $0.02 of dilution from the asset sales and our midpoint becomes $1.53. I do want to make note that the Fashion Show transaction will impact the full-year 2016 same-store NOI growth by about 20 to 25 basis points, taking on midpoint to around 4.25. 
Our Outlook for the second of our operations with the use of the strong. We have some tougher comps due to some one-time items in termination income and recovery in the prior year that may not repeat. Our same-store NOI growth outlook for the second half is therefore midpoint of 4%. 
Moving down to EBITDA. Our full-year outlook continues to be 8% to 9%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we now expect company FFO of around $1.465 billion and  a share count of about $960 million. I thought idd lay out a little bit of the third quarter and the fourth you tell folks out in terms of what we're thinking. Guidance for third quarter is $325 million to $345 million of FFO or $0.34 to $0.36 per share. There was are on $6 million of net dilution from the asset sales in the one-time prepayment penalty I noted in the third quarter for over $11 million impacting the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect FFO per share of $0.42 to $0.44, which includes $8 million of net dilution from the transactions noted in the press release. 
Moving on to the balance sheet for some perspective. Our total debt at the beginning of the year was almost $20 billion and our net debt to EBITDA in 2015 was around 9x. Given the transactions that have occurred this year and the planned debt paydown, we expect to be around $18.5 billion in total debt at the end of the year, a reduction of almost $1.5 billion. Based on our current plan, we expect in the year with about $700 million to $800 million of cash, excluding the $250 million special dividend cash. That will get us to 2016 end of year net debt to EBITDA just shy of 8x and we expect to be in the mid-7s by the end of 2017, assuming no other transactions. 
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

We feel pretty comfortable to do, as I've mentioned in the past, $300 million to $500 million a year. Again, that piece is actually going to accelerate depending on the department store acquisitions that we can put it to make. And a few -- just rewind back to my comment and I made an empathic point about being in the retail real estate business and expand on that a little bit. And what I was trying to say was effectively previously we used to give away these department stores at $1.5 to [indiscernible] portfolio to do have the ability to add on retailers that traditionally don't go into the malls but have gone into power centers. And today, we're able to attract those retailers into the department store boxes in an accretive fashion and are truly becoming very competitive to our power center brethren. And we're able to do deals in a highly competitive with all the in a very low basis in your end and the retailers are finding it attractive to come to the larger malls because the exact consumers from an 8 to 10-mile radius in the shopping center business were attracting people from 1.5 to 2 mile radius. So my point being that all of a sudden, we've gotten this new canvas in this canvas allows us to sort of layout our painting in an accretive fashion. And so I think that the pipeline could enhance itself through as low as we continue to be able to have the opportunity to buy back department store box. If it arises, if it doesn't arise, we still feel that we can retrieve $500 million with the pipeline we have from now until 2019. And so we are happy either way. We're happy if the department stores start to perform incredibly well and do not sell their assets of pipeline for the next few year and should they decide to lower their footprint selectively in the quality of assets we have, we think it's accretive for us."

And so in a funny way to you, look, I'm not big into segmentation because it's an unfair way to look at the real estate because you've got 40 yard space, 30 yard and 10 yard space and so it's inappropriate to look at the space in my opinion based upon just the top and the bottom third because you could have the same bottom and the top third in the same mall depending if you're in the 10 yard line or the 50-yard line. So more so, really look at it almost 40 assets that are visually about $800 a foot that accounts for 46% of our NOI. So when you look at our portfolio, we have a lot of breadth and scale. And so -- and I'm always maintained that spreads would be 8% to 10% and one day I'll be right, it will be up to 10%.  So far I've been wrong, wrong and wrong. But one day I'll be right. And when retail sales go up 3% to 4% a year or a 5-year period, they're going up 15% to 20%, then you've got 2% to 3% annual growth rate, which we will have in our leases and at some stage your spreads are going to be 8% to 10%. And that business will give you a 3% growth rate of a business and redevelopments will give you 100 basis points and so you're at 4% to 5% EBITDA growth company.

Good morning, everyone. Our latest sustainability report is available on our website. For the past several years, we have been identifying and executing on ways to improve our impact on the environment. I want to mention a few highlights",1735,"Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Our latest sustainability report is available on our website. For the past several years, we have been identifying and executing on ways to improve our impact on the environment. I want to mention a few highlights from the report. We have diverted 54,000 tons of waste from landfills, which is enough to fill all 4,500 garbage trucks. Water consumption has been reduced by 64 million gallons, which is enough water to fill almost 100 Olympic-sized swimming pools. We have completed lighting and HVAC upgrades, which will save the equivalent energy of taking 4,600 homes of the electric grid, and we expect to be one of the largest generators of solar energy in the U.S. this year. We continue to explore new opportunities to implement sustainable operating factors throughout our portfolio. 
Now let's return to our recent results. FFO per share was $0.35, up almost 7% from the same quarter last year. Year-to-date FFO per share was $0.75, up over 15% from last year. EBITDA was up 6.5% from the same quarter last year, and over 13% year-to-date from last year. Same-store NOI growth was up 4% for the quarter and 4.6% year-to-date. Results were driven primarily by continued strength from our high-quality portfolio in terms of occupancy gains and expense management. We increased the quarterly dividend to $0.20, 11% increase over last year. 
The portfolio was over 96% leased at quarter end, and permanent occupancy stood at about 91.5% as we expected -- which is what we expected at this time of the year. Total sales, excluding department stores and Christiana Mall, were up about 3%, and sales for tenants under 10,000 feet were flat, excluding Christiana Mall. Categories that performed best were restaurants, home furnishings and health and personal care. We even had a positive comp in apparel. This is for total sales x department stores. Lease spreads for leases commencing in the trailing 12 months are about 13% or a little over $8 per square foot. To calculate our lease spreads, we include base tenant count and compare them to the ending rent on the expiring lease to the beginning rent on the new lease on a suite-to-suite basis, regardless of size. 
Turning to property contract. In June, we sold our interest in 1 Stockton in San Francisco for approximately $50 million, which values the asset at a subsea cat on a trailing 12-month basis. This is the highest price paid for an asset per square foot in Union Square, almost $5,800 per square foot. You may recall, we acquired this asset in 2014, one of our initial investments in urban retail with a plan to re-lease this space since the existing tenant was relocating to the Square. We successfully released the space to T-Mobile, stabilizing the asset, and then sold our interest. On an IR basis, we realized about 40%. 
In June, we sold Pioneer Place office buildings, a class A asset, for approximately $122 million, which values the asset at a 5% cap. In July, we sold Newgate Mall, located in Ogden, Utah, for approximately $17 million, which values the asset at a high single-digit cap rate. Yesterday, we closed on the sale of Road Valley Mall located in Medford, Oregon, for over $60 million, which values the asset at a high-single-digit cap rate.
We're pleased to announce a new joint venture with TIAA Global Asset Management at Fashion Show in Las Vegas. GGP and TIAA are partners at other properties and we look forward to our new partnership with them. As you know, Fashion Show is a one-of-a-kind asset. Over the past several years, the GGP team has successfully re-tenanted several anchor boxes, bringing in Macy's Men, Urban Outfitters, and Dick's Sporting Goods to the mall. We brought to life the Boulevard entrance, bringing a number of new dining and leisure options. TIAA will now own approximately 50% of Fashion Show. The transaction values the asset at approximately $2.5 billion, a sub-4% cap rate.
We closed on the previously announced acquisition of 218 West 57th Street in New York City. You may recall, we entered into a commitment to acquire this property located across the street from the new Nordstrom back in 2014. The asset was owner-occupied, and offers us unique and rare opportunity for a retailer to have a prominent presence on West 57th Street across from the future Nordstrom, which will be the first full-line Nordstrom in Manhattan. 
Finally, I like to talk about our investment, Aliansce, the Brazilian mall owner. As you may recall from our first quarter earnings call, we wrote down the note receivable to approximately $70 million, which represented the market value of the underlying common shares, which were collateral for the note. We also wrote off about $7.5 million of accrued interest income. During the second quarter, we agreed to take ownership of the shares, about $18.3 million in exchange for canceling the note. As you know, GGP's focus is owning retail real estate in the United States.  We recently entered into an agreement to sell the shares to an institutional buyer for approximately $85 million. Upon close later this quarter, we will have no remaining interest in Aliansce. In terms of how this transaction is treated for earnings, we are excluding the write-down and markup from company FFO, but including both in NAREIT FFO in accordance with the definition. 
Let me talk a little bit about our industry. GGP is in the retail real estate business. Historically, retail real estate has been segmented. They are malls, strip centers, lifestyle centers, power centers, and so on. Together, they equate to 24 square feet of retail GLA per capita. Based on our research, we believe that only about 4 square feet per capita of retail GLA was high-quality. Approximately 8% of the high-quality retail real estate in the United States is in the GGP portfolio, from which 95% of our NOI is derived. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the retail real estate business. Let me talk a little bit about our leasing. We are pleased to report, we have no vacant anchor departments stores left, no vacant anchor boxes in our portfolio. So let's start with the new inventory that's upon us. As you all know, Sports Authority has started as an operator. We had 9 locations, 6 large-format stores and 3 elite stores. The 3 elite stores will go back into in-line GLA until we are focused on leasing the large-format stores. 3 of them have already been leased, one to Target and the other 2 in Northridge and White Marsh, Dave & Buster's. We are progressing with the remaining locations. There is strong demand. 
I'd like to provide an update on our redevelopment plans for this year's anchor boxes, which we own with Seritage. We plan to commence redevelopment of 4 locations later this year. At Pembroke's Lake, we are being in a movie theater, AMC. At Staten Island Mall, we are bringing in Container Store and a new Trimark. At Coronado Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, we have several in-line retailers, restaurants and a Container Store, and in Valley Plaza, we have in-line tenants that are signed and restaurants. We're in active tenant negotiations on an additional 5, so we are making very good progress on 9 of the 12 locations. Our properties are in demand by users like grocery, big box sporting-goods, theaters, restaurants and other entertainment venues. These types of tenants further curate the mall, being located in the mall with an opportunity for them to reach a large trade area and generate new customers from traffic already at the shopping center. 
We have 460 full-service restaurants comprised of 3.6 million square feet in our portfolio. This is 7% of our total GLA and 13% of our sales. Just in the last 5 years, we have done 292 full-service restaurant deals for 2.1 million square feet. Further, 13% of our total GLA is big box, comprised of 195 big box tenants. Fifty five of those deals were made in the last 5 years. Those 55 deals are comprised of 12 Dave & Buster's, 4 Nordstrom Racks, 9 theaters, 9 ultras, 14 big sporting-goods and 7 supermarkets, including the Wegmans that will open in the former JCPenney space at Natick in Boston. 
At 200 Lafayette in SoHo, New York City, PIRCH held its grand opening in May. PIRCH offers a unique experience when looking for kitchen and bath fixtures and I encourage you to visit their flagship store. We acquired the asset in 2014 for about $150 million. We leased the office space and sold the office portion for approximately $125 million last year. With the retail portion now stabilized, we are generating yield in the mid- to high-teens. At 730 Fifth Avenue, the Crown Building, we're pleased to welcome Zegna. We continue to see influx of retailers coming to the mall and demand from other retail concepts. For example, ModCloth recently opened its Pioneer Place in Portland, and new concepts like Country Club Prep, Peloton, Aesop, e.l.f. Cosmetics and Essentia, just to name a few, either have opened stores or will be opening stores soon in our portfolio. 
I'd like to update you on PacSun and Aéropostale. We have 71 PacSun locations in our portfolio. Off those 71, 6 will be vacating at the end of the year, 65 stores would be retained. We expect PacSun to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of September. Regarding Aéropostale, it is our expectation that the sales process will happen in the month of August. We believe Aéropostale will remain a viable entity going forward, although its footprint may be smaller than it is today. 
As a final note, we have been talking a lot about improving the customer experience at the mall. Parking lots at our malls are at capacity. Our customers tell us that parking is a common paying point within the shopping experience. We are very excited that the recent introduction of our new parking app at Oakbrook Center, Ridgedale Center, Alderwood Mall and Stonestown Galleria is up and operating. For those of you who live near those centers, we encourage you to try the new app and send us your feedback. We plan a broader rollout across the portfolio later this year. Michael will now take you through our results for the quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year."
328377,345257983,1021659,"General Growth Properties, Inc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Brookfield Property REIT Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. I will start out with some brief comments on second quarter results, followed by details in the asset transactions, the impact on our full-year guidance. Finally, I will provide an update on our balance shee",908,"Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. I will start out with some brief comments on second quarter results, followed by details in the asset transactions, the impact on our full-year guidance. Finally, I will provide an update on our balance sheet activities before we open it up to questions. Before I begin, I want point an error on Page 16 of the supplement. The occupancy cost ratios for the same-store retail properties should be 13.9% for the June 2016 quarter, and 13.2% for the June 2015 quarter. We apologize for the error. 
Moving on to the second quarter. Same-store permanent revenues were up 4.3% compared to the prior year, and as we noted, same-store NOI came in at $555 million, up 4% from last year. Net G&A for the quarter was a minus $43 million compared to minus $40 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change was due to some one-time financing fees that we received last year. The current quarter net G&A came in consistent with our expectation. 
EBITDA came in at $534 million, and overall, company FFO came in at a strong $0.35 per share, in line with our guidance. As noted in the press release, we closed on 2 asset sales during the quarter, 3 more asset sales subsequent to quarter end, these transactions total net proceeds of approximately $1 billion. We're using approximately $300 million of the proceeds to pay down mortgage debt. We noted both of those transactions in the press release. These 2 loans represent over half of our 2017 maturities, and we're also paying off $90 million outstanding [indiscernible].
At this point, we are retaining the remaining proceeds of approximately $600 million. Keep in mind, there are taxable gains associated with the asset sales, and depending on where our taxable income comes in at year-end, we currently expect to use approximately $250 million of the proceeds to pay out a special dividend of approximately $0.25 per share, subject to board approval. The timing, as we think of it now, would be around the same as our regular fourth quarter dividend. I want to go through the FFO dilution, the impact on '16, and then the impact on an annualized basis. For 2016, we lose about $20 million in FFO from the asset sales. Based on paying down the debt, we get back $7 million in interest savings, and we generate about a $1 million joint venture fee for the remainder of the year on the Fashion Show transaction. 
There's also one-time expense for cost to prepay its assumed mortgages of $5.5 million that will impact the third quarter. The total impact for the year is $0.02 per share for 2016. On an annualized basis, looking forward, we lose approximately $52 million of FFO from the asset sales. We get back around $14 million in NOI interest expense savings from the debt paydown, and we will generate around full year $3 million fee on the newly formed Fashion Show joint venture. The full impact is approximately 3.5 per share. Our full-year guidance is now $1.51 to $1.55. The previous midpoint was $1.54. We're adjusting our guidance up $0.01 due to a positive view on operations. We then adjust for the $0.02 of dilution from the asset sales and our midpoint becomes $1.53. I do want to make note that the Fashion Show transaction will impact the full-year 2016 same-store NOI growth by about 20 to 25 basis points, taking our midpoint to around 4.25. Our outlook for second half floor operations continues to be strong. We have some tougher comps due to some one-time items in termination income and recovery in the prior year that may not repeat. Our same-store NOI growth outlook for the second half is therefore midpoint of 4%. 
Moving down to EBITDA. Our full-year outlook continues to be 8% to 9%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we now expect company FFO of around $1.465 billion and a share count of about $960 million. I thought I'd lay out a little bit for the third quarter and the fourth to help folks out in terms of what we're thinking. Guidance for the third quarter is $325 million to $345 million of FFO or $0.34 to $0.36 per share. There was around $6 million of net dilution from the asset sales, and the one-time prepayment penalty I noted in the third quarter for over $11 million impacting the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect FFO per share of $0.42 to $0.44, which includes $8 million of net dilution from the transactions noted in the press release. 
Moving on to the balance sheet for some perspective. Our total debt at the beginning of the year was almost $20 billion and our net debt to EBITDA in 2015 was around 9x. Given the transactions that have occurred this year and the planned debt paydown, we expect to be around $18.5 billion in total debt at the end of the year, a reduction of almost $1.5 billion. Based on our current plan, we expect to end the year with about $700 million to $800 million of cash, excluding the $250 million special dividend cash. That would get us to a 2016 end of year net debt to EBITDA just shy of 8x, and we expect to be in the mid-7s by the end of 2017, assuming no other transactions. 
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

We feel pretty comfortable to do, as I've mentioned in the past, $300 million to $500 million a year. Again, that pace could actually get accelerated, depending on the department store acquisitions that we can continue to make. And a few -- just rewind back to my comment, and I made an empathic point about being in the retail real estate business, and let me expand on that a little bit. And what I was trying to say in the call was, effectively, previously, we used to give away these department stores at say $1.5 to $2 a foot in our portfolio, and we didn't have the ability to add on retailers that traditionally don't go into the malls but have gone into the strip centers and power centers. And today, we are able to attract those retailers into the department store boxes in an accretive fashion, and are truly becoming very competitive to our strip center and power center brethren. And we're able to do deals in a highly competitive with -- so we are starting with all the introduction place and a very low basis in your end, and the retailers are finding it attractive to come to the larger malls because we attract consumers from an 8- to 10-mile radius whereby if you're in the strip shopping center business, we are attracting people from 1.5- to 2-mile radius. So my point being that all of a sudden, we've gotten this new canvas in this canvas allows us to sort of layout our painting in an accretive fashion. And so I think that the pipeline could enhance itself with the quality of real estate we have as long as we continue to be able to have the opportunity to buy back department store box, if it arises. If it doesn't arise, we still feel that we can retrieve $500 million with the pipeline we have from now until 2019. And so we are happy either way. We're happy if the department stores starts to perform incredibly well and do not sell their assets, it still gives us enough pipeline for the next few years, and should they decide to lower their footprint selectively in the quality of assets we have, we think that's accretive for us."

And so -- and I'm always maintaining that spreads will be 8% to 10%, and one day I'll be right, it will be 8% to 10%.  So far I've been wrong, wrong and wrong. But one day I'll be right. And when retail sales go up 3% to 4% a year, you know, over a 5-year period, they're going up 15% to 20%, and you've got 2% to 3% annual growth rate, which is what we have in our leases, at some stage your spreads are going to be 8% to 10%.

I mean please appreciate that square footage is multiple -- [indiscernible] multiple. I think if you appreciate, when you look at a supermarket retailer going into on $800 mall, they're building these massive food halls, which would be a modern-day foodcourt, which could do $15 million to $20 million in sales for eating within the mall and, of course, over and above, for take-home. That business is not available in the traditional shopping center. And I think as these supermarkets find that they need to attract more millennials, which are people who would either come and eat in this food hall environment, or are big into take-home, and that business is a higher-margin business for the supermarket businesses selling toilet paper and bounty, they're going to -- their demand for space is going to increase. More so, if you appreciate, they also want to modernize their desk facilities and it'll be easier if they modernize their facilities and increase, the tail area is moving to a new location. So I actually believe that demand's going to be quite astronomical."

Good morning, everyone. Our latest sustainability report is available on our website. For the past several years, we have been identifying and executing on ways to improve our impact on the environment. I want to mention a few highlights",1736,"Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Our latest sustainability report is available on our website. For the past several years, we have been identifying and executing on ways to improve our impact on the environment. I want to mention a few highlights from the report. We have diverted 54,000 tons of waste from landfills, which is enough to fill all 4,500 garbage trucks. Water consumption has been reduced by 64 million gallons, which is enough water to fill almost 100 Olympic-sized swimming pools. We have completed lighting and HVAC upgrades, which will save the equivalent energy of taking 4,600 homes off the electric grid, and we expect to be one of the largest generators of solar energy in the U.S. this year. We continue to explore new opportunities to implement sustainable operating practices throughout our portfolio. 
Now let's return to our recent results. FFO per share was $0.35, up almost 7% from the same quarter last year. Year-to-date FFO per share was $0.75, up over 15% from last year. EBITDA was up 6.5% from the same quarter last year, and over 13% year-to-date from last year. Same-store NOI growth was up 4% for the quarter and 4.6% year-to-date. Results were driven primarily by continued strength from our high-quality portfolio in terms of occupancy gains and expense management. We increased the quarterly dividend to $0.20, 11% increase over last year. 
The portfolio was over 96% leased at quarter end, and permanent occupancy stood at about 91.5% as we expected -- which is what we expected at this time of the year. Total sales, excluding department stores and Christiana Mall, were up about 3%, and sales for tenants under 10,000 feet were flat, excluding Christiana Mall. Categories that performed best were restaurants, home furnishings and health and personal care. We even had a positive comp in apparel. This is for total sales x department stores. Lease spreads for leases commencing in the trailing 12 months are about 13% or a little over $8 per square foot. To calculate our lease spreads, we include base tenant count and compare them to the ending rent on the expiring lease to the beginning rent on the new lease on a suite-to-suite basis, regardless of size. 
Turning to property transactions. In June, we sold our interest in 1 Stockton in San Francisco for approximately $50 million, which values the asset at a subsea cat on a trailing 12-month basis. This is the highest price paid for an asset per square foot in Union Square, almost $5,800 per square foot. You may recall, we acquired this asset in 2014, one of our initial investments in urban retail with a plan to re-lease this space since the existing tenant was relocating to the Square. We successfully released the space to T-Mobile, stabilizing the asset, and then sold our interest. On an IR basis, we realized about 40%. 
In June, we sold Pioneer Place office buildings, a class A asset, for approximately $122 million, which values the asset at a 5% cap. In July, we sold Newgate Mall, located in Ogden, Utah, for approximately $70 million, which values the asset at a high single-digit cap rate. Yesterday, we closed on the sale of Rogue Valley Mall located in Medford, Oregon, for over $60 million, which values the asset at a high-single-digit cap rate.
We're pleased to announce a new joint venture with TIAA Global Asset Management at Fashion Show in Las Vegas. GGP and TIAA are partners at other properties and we look forward to our new partnership with them. As you know, Fashion Show is a one-of-a-kind asset. Over the past several years, the GGP team has successfully re-tenanted several anchor boxes, bringing in Macy's Men, Urban Outfitters, and Dick's Sporting Goods to the mall. We brought to life the Boulevard entrance, bringing a number of new dining and leisure options. TIAA will now own approximately 50% of Fashion Show. The transaction values the asset at approximately $2.5 billion, a sub-4% cap rate.
We closed on the previously announced acquisition of 218 West 57th Street in New York City. You may recall, we entered into a commitment to acquire this property located across the street from the new Nordstrom back in 2014. The asset was owner-occupied, and offers us unique and rare opportunity for a retailer to have a prominent presence on West 57th Street across from the future Nordstrom, which will be the first full-line Nordstrom in Manhattan. 
Finally, I like to talk about our investment, Aliansce, the Brazilian mall owner. As you may recall from our first quarter earnings call, we wrote down the note receivable to approximately $70 million, which represented the market value of the underlying common shares, which were collateral for the note. We also wrote off about $7.5 million of accrued interest income. During the second quarter, we agreed to take ownership of the shares, about $18.3 million in exchange for canceling the note. As you know, GGP's focus is owning retail real estate in the United States.  We recently entered into an agreement to sell the shares to an institutional buyer for approximately $85 million. Upon close later this quarter, we will have no remaining interest in Aliansce. In terms of how this transaction is treated for earnings, we are excluding the write-down and markup from company FFO, but including both in NAREIT FFO in accordance with the definition. 
Let me talk a little bit about our industry. GGP is in the retail real estate business. Historically, retail real estate has been segmented. They are malls, strip centers, lifestyle centers, power centers, and so on. Together, they equate to 24 square feet of retail GLA per capita. Based on our research, we believe that only about 4 square feet per capita of retail GLA is high-quality. Approximately 8% of the high-quality retail real estate in the United States is in the GGP portfolio, from which 95% of our NOI is derived. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the retail real estate business. Let me talk a little bit about our leasing. We are pleased to report, we have no vacant anchor departments stores left, no vacant anchor boxes in our portfolio. So let's start with the new inventory that's upon us. As you all know, Sports Authority has shuttered as an operator. We had 9 locations, 6 large-format stores and 3 elite stores. The 3 elite stores will go back into in-line GLA until we are focused on leasing the large-format stores. 3 of them have already been leased, one to Target and the other 2 in Northridge and White Marsh to Dave & Buster's. We are progressing with the remaining locations. There is strong demand. 
I'd like to provide an update on our redevelopment plans for the Sears anchor boxes, which we own with Seritage. We plan to commence redevelopment of 4 locations later this year. At Pembroke's Lake, we are being in a movie theater, AMC. At Staten Island Mall, we are bringing in Container Store and a new Trimark. At Coronado Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, we have several in-line retailers, restaurants and a Container Store, and in Valley Plaza, we have in-line tenants that are signed and restaurants. We're in active tenant negotiations on an additional 5, so we are making very good progress on 9 of the 12 locations. Our properties are in demand by users like grocery, big box sporting-goods, theaters, restaurants and other entertainment venues. These types of tenants further curate the mall. Being located in the mall is an opportunity for them to reach a large trade area and generate new customers from traffic already at the shopping center. 
We have 460 full-service restaurants comprised of 3.6 million square feet in our portfolio. This is 7% of our total GLA and 13% of our sales. Just in the last 5 years, we have done 292 full-service restaurant deals for 2.1 million square feet. Further, 13% of our total GLA is big box, comprised of 195 big box tenants. Fifty five of those deals were made in the last 5 years. Those 55 deals are comprised of 12 Dave & Buster's, 4 Nordstrom Racks, 9 theaters, 9 Ultas, 14 big sporting-goods and 7 supermarkets, including the Wegmans that will open in the former JCPenney space at Natick in Boston. 
At 200 Lafayette in SoHo, New York City, PIRCH held its grand opening in May. PIRCH offers a unique experience when looking for kitchen and bath fixtures and I encourage you to visit their flagship store. We acquired the asset in 2014 for about $150 million. We leased the office space and sold the office portion for approximately $125 million last year. With the retail portion now stabilized, we are generating yield in the mid- to high-teens. At 730 Fifth Avenue, the Crown Building, we're pleased to welcome Zegna. We continue to see influx of retailers coming to the mall and demand from other retail concepts. For example, ModCloth recently opened in Pioneer Place in Portland, and new concepts like Country Club Prep, Peloton, Aesop, e.l.f. Cosmetics and Essentia, just to name a few, either have opened stores or will be opening stores soon in our portfolio. 
I'd like to update you on PacSun and Aéropostale. We have 71 PacSun locations in our portfolio. Off those 71, 6 will be vacating at the end of the year, 65 stores would be retained. We expect PacSun to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of September. Regarding Aéropostale, it is our expectation that the sales process will happen in the month of August. We believe Aéropostale will remain a viable entity going forward, although its footprint may be smaller than it is today. 
As a final note, we have been talking a lot about improving the customer experience at the mall. Parking lots at our malls are at capacity. Our customers tell us that parking is a common pain point within the shopping experience. We are very excited that the recent introduction of our new parking app at Oakbrook Center, Ridgedale Center, Alderwood Mall and Stonestown Galleria is up and operating. For those of you who live near those centers, we encourage you to try the new app and send us your feedback. We plan a broader rollout across the portfolio later this year. Michael will now take you through our results for the quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year."
328377,345257983,1022126,"General Growth Properties, Inc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Brookfield Property REIT Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. I will start out with some brief comments on second quarter results, followed by details in the asset transactions, the impact on our full-year guidance. Finally, I will provide an update on our balance shee",908,"Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. I will start out with some brief comments on second quarter results, followed by details in the asset transactions, the impact on our full-year guidance. Finally, I will provide an update on our balance sheet activities before we open it up to questions. Before I begin, I want point out an error on Page 16 of the supplement. The occupancy cost ratios for the same-store retail properties should be 13.9% for the June 2016 quarter, and 13.2% for the June 2015 quarter. We apologize for the error. 
Moving on to the second quarter. Same-store permanent revenues were up 4.3% compared to the prior year, and as we noted, same-store NOI came in at $555 million, up 4% from last year. Net G&A for the quarter was a minus $43 million compared to minus $40 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change was due to some one-time financing fees that we received last year. The current quarter net G&A came in consistent with our expectation. 
EBITDA came in at $534 million, and overall, company FFO came in at a strong $0.35 per share, in line with our guidance. As noted in the press release, we closed on 2 asset sales during the quarter, 3 more asset sales subsequent to quarter end, these transactions total net proceeds of approximately $1 billion. We're using approximately $300 million of the proceeds to pay down mortgage debt. We noted both of those transactions in the press release. These 2 loans represent over half of our 2017 maturities, and we're also paying off $90 million outstanding [indiscernible].
At this point, we are retaining the remaining proceeds of approximately $600 million. Keep in mind, there are taxable gains associated with the asset sales, and depending on where our taxable income comes in at year-end, we currently expect to use approximately $250 million of the proceeds to pay out a special dividend of approximately $0.25 per share, subject to board approval. The timing, as we think of it now, would be around the same as our regular fourth quarter dividend. I want to go through the FFO dilution, the impact on '16, and then the impact on an annualized basis. For 2016, we lose about $20 million in FFO from the asset sales. Based on paying down the debt, we get back $7 million in interest savings, and we generate about a $1 million joint venture fee for the remainder of the year on the Fashion Show transaction. 
There's also one-time expense for costs to prepay assumed mortgages of $5.5 million that will impact the third quarter. The total impact for the year is $0.02 per share for 2016. On an annualized basis, looking forward, we lose approximately $52 million of FFO from the asset sales. We get back around $14 million in NOI interest expense savings from the debt paydown, and we will generate around full year $3 million fee on the newly formed Fashion Show joint venture. The full impact is approximately 3.5 per share. Our full-year guidance is now $1.51 to $1.55. The previous midpoint was $1.54. We're adjusting our guidance up $0.01 due to a positive view on operations. We then adjust for the $0.02 of dilution from the asset sales and our midpoint becomes $1.53. I do want to make note that the Fashion Show transaction will impact the full-year 2016 same-store NOI growth by about 20 to 25 basis points, taking our midpoint to around 4.25. Our outlook for second half floor operations continues to be strong. We have some tougher comps due to some one-time items in termination income and recovery in the prior year that may not repeat. Our same-store NOI growth outlook for the second half is therefore midpoint of 4%. 
Moving down to EBITDA. Our full-year outlook continues to be 8% to 9%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we now expect company FFO of around $1.465 billion and a share count of about $960 million. I thought I'd lay out a little bit for the third quarter and the fourth to help folks out in terms of what we're thinking. Guidance for the third quarter is $325 million to $345 million of FFO or $0.34 to $0.36 per share. There was around $6 million of net dilution from the asset sales, and the one-time prepayment penalty I noted in the third quarter for over $11 million impacting the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect FFO per share of $0.42 to $0.44, which includes $8 million of net dilution from the transactions noted in the press release. 
Moving on to the balance sheet for some perspective. Our total debt at the beginning of the year was almost $20 billion and our net debt to EBITDA in 2015 was around 9x. Given the transactions that have occurred this year and the planned debt paydown, we expect to be around $18.5 billion in total debt at the end of the year, a reduction of almost $1.5 billion. Based on our current plan, we expect to end the year with about $700 million to $800 million of cash, excluding the $250 million special dividend cash. That would get us to a 2016 end of year net debt to EBITDA just shy of 8x, and we expect to be in the mid-7s by the end of 2017, assuming no other transactions. 
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

We feel pretty comfortable to do, as I've mentioned in the past, $300 million to $500 million a year. Again, that pace could actually get accelerated, depending on the department store acquisitions that we can continue to make. And if you just rewind back to my comment, and I made an empathic point about being in the retail real estate business, and let me expand on that a little bit. And what I was trying to say before was, effectively, previously, we used to give away these department stores at say $1.5 to $2 a foot in our portfolio, and we didn't have the ability to add on retailers that traditionally don't go into the malls but have gone into the strip centers and power centers. And today, we are able to attract those retailers into the department store boxes in an accretive fashion, and are truly becoming very competitive to our strip center and power center brethren. And we're able to do deals in a highly competitive with -- so we are starting with all the infrastructure in place and a very low basis in your end, and the retailers are finding it attractive to come to the larger malls because we attract consumers from an 8- to 10-mile radius whereby if you're in the strip shopping center business, we are attracting people from 1.5- to 2-mile radius. So my point being that all of a sudden, we've gotten this new canvas and this canvas allows us to sort of layout our painting in an accretive fashion. And so I think that the pipeline could enhance itself with the quality of real estate we have as long as we continue to be able to have the opportunity to buy back department store boxes, if it arises. If it doesn't arise, we still feel that we can to $300 million to $500 million with the pipeline we have from now until 2019. And so we are happy either way. We're happy if the department stores start to perform incredibly well and do not sell their assets, it still gives us enough pipeline for the next few years, and should they decide to lower their footprint selectively in the quality of assets we have, we think that's accretive for us."

We just felt it was a $2.5 billion asset. It was a large percentage of GGP, and it was appropriate to be able to derisk from it by selling half of the asset. We think our partners will do very well and the asset will continue to perform because good things happen to the good assets. I might point out that, from a sales productivity basis, Hawaii has completely stabilized. It's actually gone a little bit to the positive, and so has Vegas. So both those markets, being tourist markets, which were down substantially, almost 10%, have actually flattened and started to pick back up.

And so you know, in a funny way to you, look at, I'm not big into segmentation because it's an unfair way to look at the real estate because you've got 40 yard space, 50 yard space and 10 yard space, and so it's inappropriate to look at space in my opinion based upon just the top and the bottom third because you could have the same bottom and the top third in the same mall depending on whether you're on the 10-yard line or in the 50-yard line. So more so, the way we look at it is, is we have almost 40 assets that average over $800 a foot. That accounts for 46% of our NOI. So when you look at our portfolio, we have a lot of breadth and scale. And so -- and I've always maintaining that spreads will be 8% to 10%, and one day I'll be right, it will be 8% to 10%.  So far I've been wrong, wrong and wrong. But one day I'll be right. And when retail sales go up 3% to 4% a year, you know, over a 5-year period, they're going up 15% to 20%, and you've got 2% to 3% annual growth rate, which is what we have in our leases, at some stage your spreads are going to be 8% to 10%. And that business will give you a 3% growth rate of a business, and redevelopments give you 100 basis points and so you're a 4% to 5% EBITDA growth company.

That business is not available in the traditional shopping center. And I think as these supermarkets find that they need to attract more millennials, which are people who would either come and eat in this food hall environment, or are big into take-home, and that business is a higher-margin business for the supermarket businesses selling toilet paper and bounty, they're going to -- their demand for space is going to increase.

Good morning, everyone. Our latest sustainability report is available on our website. For the past several years, we have been identifying and executing on ways to improve our impact on the environment. I want to mention a few highlights",1736,"Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Our latest sustainability report is available on our website. For the past several years, we have been identifying and executing on ways to improve our impact on the environment. I want to mention a few highlights from the report. We have diverted 54,000 tons of waste from landfills, which is enough to fill all 4,500 garbage trucks. Water consumption has been reduced by 64 million gallons, which is enough water to fill almost 100 Olympic-sized swimming pools. We have completed lighting and HVAC upgrades, which will save the equivalent energy of taking 4,600 homes off the electric grid, and we expect to be one of the largest generators of solar energy in the U.S. this year. We continue to explore new opportunities to implement sustainable operating practices throughout our portfolio. 
Now let's return to our recent results. FFO per share was $0.35, up almost 7% from the same quarter last year. Year-to-date FFO per share was $0.75, up over 15% from last year. EBITDA was up 6.5% from the same quarter last year, and over 13% year-to-date from last year. Same-store NOI growth was up 4% for the quarter and 4.6% year-to-date. Results were driven primarily by continued strength from our high-quality portfolio in terms of occupancy gains and expense management. We increased the quarterly dividend to $0.20, 11% increase over last year. 
The portfolio was over 96% leased at quarter end, and permanent occupancy stood at about 91.5% as we expected -- which is what we expected at this time of the year. Total sales, excluding department stores and Christiana Mall, were up about 3%, and sales for tenants under 10,000 feet were flat, excluding Christiana Mall. Categories that performed best were restaurants, home furnishings and health and personal care. We even had a positive comp in apparel. This is for total sales x department stores. Lease spreads for leases commencing in the trailing 12 months are about 13% or a little over $8 per square foot. To calculate our lease spreads, we include base tenant count and compare them to the ending rent on the expiring lease to the beginning rent on the new lease on a suite-to-suite basis, regardless of size. 
Turning to property transactions. In June, we sold our interest in 1 Stockton in San Francisco for approximately $50 million, which values the asset at a subsea cat on a trailing 12-month basis. This is the highest price paid for an asset per square foot in Union Square, almost $5,800 per square foot. You may recall, we acquired this asset in 2014, one of our initial investments in urban retail with a plan to re-lease this space since the existing tenant was relocating to the Square. We successfully released the space to T-Mobile, stabilizing the asset, and then sold our interest. On an IR basis, we realized about 40%. 
In June, we sold Pioneer Place office buildings, a class A asset, for approximately $122 million, which values the asset at a 5% cap. In July, we sold Newgate Mall, located in Ogden, Utah, for approximately $70 million, which values the asset at a high single-digit cap rate. Yesterday, we closed on the sale of Rogue Valley Mall located in Medford, Oregon, for over $60 million, which values the asset at a high-single-digit cap rate.
We're pleased to announce a new joint venture with TIAA Global Asset Management at Fashion Show in Las Vegas. GGP and TIAA are partners at other properties and we look forward to our new partnership with them. As you know, Fashion Show is a one-of-a-kind asset. Over the past several years, the GGP team has successfully re-tenanted several anchor boxes, bringing in Macy's Men, Urban Outfitters, and Dick's Sporting Goods to the mall. We brought to life the Boulevard entrance, bringing a number of new dining and leisure options. TIAA will now own approximately 50% of Fashion Show. The transaction values the asset at approximately $2.5 billion, a sub-4% cap rate.
We closed on the previously announced acquisition of 218 West 57th Street in New York City. You may recall, we entered into a commitment to acquire this property located across the street from the new Nordstrom back in 2014. The asset was owner-occupied, and offers us unique and rare opportunity for a retailer to have a prominent presence on West 57th Street across from the future Nordstrom, which will be the first full-line Nordstrom in Manhattan. 
Finally, I like to talk about our investment, Aliansce, the Brazilian mall owner. As you may recall from our first quarter earnings call, we wrote down the note receivable to approximately $70 million, which represented the market value of the underlying common shares, which were collateral for the note. We also wrote off about $7.5 million of accrued interest income. During the second quarter, we agreed to take ownership of the shares, about $18.3 million in exchange for canceling the note. As you know, GGP's focus is owning retail real estate in the United States.  We recently entered into an agreement to sell the shares to an institutional buyer for approximately $85 million. Upon close later this quarter, we will have no remaining interest in Aliansce. In terms of how this transaction is treated for earnings, we are excluding the write-down and markup from company FFO, but including both in NAREIT FFO in accordance with the definition. 
Let me talk a little bit about our industry. GGP is in the retail real estate business. Historically, retail real estate has been segmented. They are malls, strip centers, lifestyle centers, power centers, and so on. Together, they equate to 24 square feet of retail GLA per capita. Based on our research, we believe that only about 4 square feet per capita of retail GLA is high-quality. Approximately 8% of the high-quality retail real estate in the United States is in the GGP portfolio, from which 95% of our NOI is derived. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the retail real estate business. Let me talk a little bit about our leasing. We are pleased to report, we have no vacant anchor departments stores left, no vacant anchor boxes in our portfolio. So let's start with the new inventory that's upon us. As you all know, Sports Authority has shuttered as an operator. We had 9 locations, 6 large-format stores and 3 elite stores. The 3 elite stores will go back into in-line GLA until we are focused on leasing the large-format stores. 3 of them have already been leased, one to Target and the other 2 in Northridge and White Marsh to Dave & Buster's. We are progressing with the remaining locations. There is strong demand. 
I'd like to provide an update on our redevelopment plans for the Sears anchor boxes, which we own with Seritage. We plan to commence redevelopment of 4 locations later this year. At Pembroke's Lake, we are being in a movie theater, AMC. At Staten Island Mall, we are bringing in Container Store and a new Trimark. At Coronado Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, we have several in-line retailers, restaurants and a Container Store, and in Valley Plaza, we have in-line tenants that are signed and restaurants. We're in active tenant negotiations on an additional 5, so we are making very good progress on 9 of the 12 locations. Our properties are in demand by users like grocery, big box sporting-goods, theaters, restaurants and other entertainment venues. These types of tenants further curate the mall. Being located in the mall is an opportunity for them to reach a large trade area and generate new customers from traffic already at the shopping center. 
We have 460 full-service restaurants comprised of 3.6 million square feet in our portfolio. This is 7% of our total GLA and 13% of our sales. Just in the last 5 years, we have done 292 full-service restaurant deals for 2.1 million square feet. Further, 13% of our total GLA is big box, comprised of 195 big box tenants. Fifty five of those deals were made in the last 5 years. Those 55 deals are comprised of 12 Dave & Buster's, 4 Nordstrom Racks, 9 theaters, 9 Ultas, 14 big sporting-goods and 7 supermarkets, including the Wegmans that will open in the former JCPenney space at Natick in Boston. 
At 200 Lafayette in SoHo, New York City, PIRCH held its grand opening in May. PIRCH offers a unique experience when looking for kitchen and bath fixtures and I encourage you to visit their flagship store. We acquired the asset in 2014 for about $150 million. We leased the office space and sold the office portion for approximately $125 million last year. With the retail portion now stabilized, we are generating yield in the mid- to high-teens. At 730 Fifth Avenue, the Crown Building, we're pleased to welcome Zegna. We continue to see influx of retailers coming to the mall and demand from other retail concepts. For example, ModCloth recently opened in Pioneer Place in Portland, and new concepts like Country Club Prep, Peloton, Aesop, e.l.f. Cosmetics and Essentia, just to name a few, either have opened stores or will be opening stores soon in our portfolio. 
I'd like to update you on PacSun and Aéropostale. We have 71 PacSun locations in our portfolio. Off those 71, 6 will be vacating at the end of the year, 65 stores would be retained. We expect PacSun to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of September. Regarding Aéropostale, it is our expectation that the sales process will happen in the month of August. We believe Aéropostale will remain a viable entity going forward, although its footprint may be smaller than it is today. 
As a final note, we have been talking a lot about improving the customer experience at the mall. Parking lots at our malls are at capacity. Our customers tell us that parking is a common pain point within the shopping experience. We are very excited that the recent introduction of our new parking app at Oakbrook Center, Ridgedale Center, Alderwood Mall and Stonestown Galleria is up and operating. For those of you who live near those centers, we encourage you to try the new app and send us your feedback. We plan a broader rollout across the portfolio later this year. Michael will now take you through our results for the quarter and outlook for the remainder of the year."
328377,345257983,1022474,"General Growth Properties, Inc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Brookfield Property REIT Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. I will start out with some brief comments on second quarter results, followed by details in the asset transactions, the impact on our full-year guidance. Finally, I will provide an update on our balance shee",908,"Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. I will start out with some brief comments on second quarter results, followed by details in the asset transactions, the impact on our full-year guidance. Finally, I will provide an update on our balance sheet activities before we open it up to questions. Before I begin, I want point out an error on Page 16 of the supplement. The occupancy cost ratios for the same-store retail properties should be 13.9% for the June 2016 quarter, and 13.2% for the June 2015 quarter. We apologize for the error. 
Moving on to the second quarter. Same-store permanent revenues were up 4.3% compared to the prior year, and as we noted, same-store NOI came in at $555 million, up 4% from last year. Net G&A for the quarter was a minus $43 million compared to minus $40 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change was due to some one-time financing fees that we received last year. The current quarter net G&A came in consistent with our expectation. 
EBITDA came in at $534 million, and overall, company FFO came in at a strong $0.35 per share, in line with our guidance. As noted in the press release, we closed on 2 asset sales during the quarter, 3 more asset sales subsequent to quarter end, these transactions total net proceeds of approximately $1 billion. We're using approximately $300 million of the proceeds to pay down mortgage debt. We noted both of those transactions in the press release. These 2 loans represent over half of our 2017 maturities, and we're also paying off $90 million outstanding [indiscernible].
At this point, we are retaining the remaining proceeds of approximately $600 million. Keep in mind, there are taxable gains associated with the asset sales, and depending on where our taxable income comes in at year-end, we currently expect to use approximately $250 million of the proceeds to pay out a special dividend of approximately $0.25 per share, subject to board approval. The timing, as we think of it now, would be around the same as our regular fourth quarter dividend. I want to go through the FFO dilution, the impact on '16, and then the impact on an annualized basis. For 2016, we lose about $20 million in FFO from the asset sales. Based on paying down the debt, we get back $7 million in interest savings, and we generate about a $1 million joint venture fee for the remainder of the year on the Fashion Show transaction. 
There's also one-time expense for costs to prepay assumed mortgages of $5.5 million that will impact the third quarter. The total impact for the year is $0.02 per share for 2016. On an annualized basis, looking forward, we lose approximately $52 million of FFO from the asset sales. We get back around $14 million in NOI interest expense savings from the debt paydown, and we will generate around full year $3 million fee on the newly formed Fashion Show joint venture. The full impact is approximately 3.5 per share. Our full-year guidance is now $1.51 to $1.55. The previous midpoint was $1.54. We're adjusting our guidance up $0.01 due to a positive view on operations. We then adjust for the $0.02 of dilution from the asset sales and our midpoint becomes $1.53. I do want to make note that the Fashion Show transaction will impact the full-year 2016 same-store NOI growth by about 20 to 25 basis points, taking our midpoint to around 4.25. Our outlook for second half floor operations continues to be strong. We have some tougher comps due to some one-time items in termination income and recovery in the prior year that may not repeat. Our same-store NOI growth outlook for the second half is therefore midpoint of 4%. 
Moving down to EBITDA. Our full-year outlook continues to be 8% to 9%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we now expect company FFO of around $1.465 billion and a share count of about $960 million. I thought I'd lay out a little bit for the third quarter and the fourth to help folks out in terms of what we're thinking. Guidance for the third quarter is $325 million to $345 million of FFO or $0.34 to $0.36 per share. There was around $6 million of net dilution from the asset sales, and the one-time prepayment penalty I noted in the third quarter for over $11 million impacting the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect FFO per share of $0.42 to $0.44, which includes $8 million of net dilution from the transactions noted in the press release. 
Moving on to the balance sheet for some perspective. Our total debt at the beginning of the year was almost $20 billion and our net debt to EBITDA in 2015 was around 9x. Given the transactions that have occurred this year and the planned debt paydown, we expect to be around $18.5 billion in total debt at the end of the year, a reduction of almost $1.5 billion. Based on our current plan, we expect to end the year with about $700 million to $800 million of cash, excluding the $250 million special dividend cash. That would get us to a 2016 end of year net debt to EBITDA just shy of 8x, and we expect to be in the mid-7s by the end of 2017, assuming no other transactions. 
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

We feel pretty comfortable to do, as I've mentioned in the past, $300 million to $500 million a year. Again, that pace could actually get accelerated, depending on the department store acquisitions that we can continue to make. And if you just rewind back to my comment, and I made an empathic point about being in the retail real estate business, and let me expand on that a little bit. And what I was trying to say before was, effectively, previously, we used to give away these department stores at say $1.5 to $2 a foot in our portfolio, and we didn't have the ability to add on retailers that traditionally don't go into the malls but have gone into the strip centers and power centers. And today, we are able to attract those retailers into the department store boxes in an accretive fashion, and are truly becoming very competitive to our strip center and power center brethren. And we're able to do deals in a highly competitive with -- so we are starting with all the infrastructure in place and a very low basis in your end, and the retailers are finding it attractive to come to the larger malls because we attract consumers from an 8- to 10-mile radius whereby if you're in the strip shopping center business, we are attracting people from 1.5- to 2-mile radius. So my point being that all of a sudden, we've gotten this new canvas and this canvas allows us to sort of layout our painting in an accretive fashion. And so I think that the pipeline could enhance itself with the quality of real estate we have as long as we continue to be able to have the opportunity to buy back department store boxes, if it arises. If it doesn't arise, we still feel that we can to $300 million to $500 million with the pipeline we have from now until 2019. And so we are happy either way. We're happy if the department stores start to perform incredibly well and do not sell their assets, it still gives us enough pipeline for the next few years, and should they decide to lower their footprint selectively in the quality of assets we have, we think that's accretive for us."

And so you know, in a funny way to you, look at, I'm not big into segmentation because it's an unfair way to look at the real estate because you've got 40 yard space, 50 yard space and 10 yard space, and so it's inappropriate to look at space in my opinion based upon just the top and the bottom third because you could have the same bottom and the top third in the same mall depending on whether you're on the 10-yard line or in the 50-yard line. So more so, the way we look at it is, is we have almost 40 assets that average over $800 a foot. That accounts for 46% of our NOI. So when you look at our portfolio, we have a lot of breadth and scale. And so -- and I've always maintaining that spreads will be 8% to 10%, and one day I'll be right, it will be 8% to 10%.  So far I've been wrong, wrong and wrong. But one day I'll be right. And when retail sales go up 3% to 4% a year, you know, over a 5-year period, they're going up 15% to 20%, and you've got 2% to 3% annual growth rate, which is what we have in our leases, at some stage your spreads are going to be 8% to 10%. And that business will give you a 3% growth rate of a business, and redevelopments give you 100 basis points and so you're a 4% to 5% EBITDA growth company.

That business is not available in the traditional shopping center. And I think as these supermarkets find that they need to attract more millennials, which are people who would either come and eat in this food hall environment, or are big into take-home, and that business is a higher-margin business for the supermarket businesses selling toilet paper and bounty, they're going to -- their demand for space is going to increase.

Let me begin by highlighting the quarter. FFO per share came in at $0.35 and within our guidance range. For the year, we're at [ph] $1.10 per share, about 9% higher than last year. Same-store NOI was up approx",1574,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by highlighting the quarter. FFO per share came in at $0.35 and within our guidance range. For the year, we're at [ph] $1.10 per share, about 9% higher than last year. Same-store NOI was up approximately 4% for the quarter and the year. EBITDA was up, slightly better than 4.5% for the quarter and [indiscernible] 10% for the year. 
We are pleased with our earnings growth this year, especially in light of our strong growth last year. Based on our financial performance to date, we are pleased to announce a $0.02 increase to our quarterly dividend. Our cash dividend this year will be $0.80, double that from where we began in 2011 albeit a much smaller portfolio base.
Our leverage on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis is under 8x. From the very beginning, we've communicated a path to lower leverage. We have no unsecured debt and are sitting on more than -- more cash than we had in the last 5 years. 
Lower leverage today has been from a meticulous efforts to sell lower quality assets that also high leverage, paying down debt and growing EBITDA. Our portfolio of high-quality retail properties throughout the country continues to deliver results above the national average. Total sales performed well across the portfolio, up 1.4%, as consumers visit our centers for their shopping, dining and entertainment needs. 
As we look at the top retailers in our portfolio, L Brand sales increased 8.7% in their stores that are less than 10,000 square feet and increased 5.5% for all their stores, which includes stores larger than 10,000 square feet. Within our portfolio, 3 of the 4 largest tenants posted similar strong sales increases.
Not all retail square feet is equal, the high-quality asset of higher sales productivity when [indiscernible] for NOI, sales per square foot in our portfolio is actually 687,000 square foot and 6 75, excluding Christiana Mall.
Quickly on the urban leasing front. At 530 Fifth Avenue, we entered into a lease with Duane Reade, a Walgreens company. At 685 Fifth, Coach will be opening its new Coach House on November 18. Our entire real estate portfolio is 97% leased at quarter end.
Turning to activity on the anchor box front. Let me begin by starting that is in the retail property business focusing on on high-quality assets. Let's take a look at total retail space in the U.S. Today, there's approximately 24 square feet of retail square footage per person. Of this, only 4 square feet is considered high-quality or about a 1.2 million [ph] square feet. GGP's portfolio today comprises of approximately 100 million square feet of high-quality retail in the U.S., or almost 8% of the total high-quality real estate in this country. There is a blurring of retail property types as retailers don't differentiate between type. They just want to be in highest quality assets.
One of the ways GGP has responded to the continued demand for space is to anchor box acquisition and redevelopment. For some perspective, the department store's square footage as a percentage of total center space in the U.S. is 46%, significantly higher than other parts of the world with only 27% in the U.K., 23% in Australia, 17% in Asia and 15% in the Middle East. 
Since 2011, we have redeveloped 9-0, 90 department store boxes investing $1.5 billion of capital at very attractive returns. The new uses have included department stores, entertainment venues, sporting-goods stores, fast-action retailers, restaurants, grocery stores, fitness centers, almost 200,000 square feet of new in-line space, which we've been leased to Apple, Nike, Lulu Lemon, Tommy Bahama, Aritzia and many others. The 91st box to be redeveloped is the original Nordstrom's box Ala Moana Center, the lowest level will go to Saks Fifth Avenue and the mall level -- and the third level will go to Target in 2-level store. As you may recall, Nordstrom relocated to the expansion of Ala Moana earlier this year, allowing us to redevelop their old anchor box, bringing in new users and offerings to the center. High-quality retail properties will continue to thrive, and we will continue to capitalize upon the opportunity to redevelop anchor boxes for alternative uses.
Let me talk a little bit about Sears. The strong demand for space leads to our anchor box acquisitions, including the 12 we have acquired with Seritage. Of the 12 Seritage locations, we've broken ground on 4, including Pembroke Lakes in Florida, where we're adding an AMC movie theater and several restaurants; Staten Island Mall in New York, where we're adding a container store into restaurants; Coronado Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where we're adding container store, restaurant and in-line space; and Valley Plaza in California, where we're adding a few restaurant and  fast-action retailer.
Given our leasing momentum, we have set specific dates to recapture space at the following 5 Seritage locations: Older Wood in the Seattle market; Paramus Park in Northern New Jersey; Mall of Columbia in Columba, Maryland; Natick Mall outside of Boston; and Oakwood Center in the Chicago metro area. Our journey with Seritage permits recapture of up to 50% of the space and leaving Sears to operate in the remaining space. 
I want to highlight that we are recapturing 100% of the Sears space for 2 of these 5 locations. Those are Older Wood in the Seattle market, a Class-A mall; Pamarus Park, a [indiscernible] mall in Northern New Jersey. 
Over and above these [indiscernible], late last night, we negotiated the terms for the purchase of 100% of the Sears location at the streets of [indiscernible] in the -- in North Carolina, the Research Triangle Park; and A+ center with sales north of $650 per square foot.
Let's turn a little bit to Macy's. As reported yesterday in our earnings release, we announced the acquisition of 5 stores from Macy's. When Macy's publicly announced store closures earlier this year, we proactively approached them to take advantage of the potential opportunity to buy back certain boxes where we felt there were strong tenant demand. Of the 5 locations, 1 was on the closure list. The locations are as follows: [indiscernible] Galleria, where we plan a major repositioning of the property, similar to what we did at Ala Moana; Carolina Place, where we are going to put a new Dick's Sporting Goods; Quail Springs Mall where we have main deals will lifetime fitness; greenwood mall, where we're welcoming a new health department store with a signed lease [indiscernible]; and the one on the closure list with Oakwood Mall in Wisconsin.
The new uses are subject to satisfaction of certain delivery conditions to the tenants. Macy's will continue to operate the Titan Galleria store on a short-term lease with us. The Macy's at Quail Springs closed earlier this year, and the other 3 will close in spring 2017. The attractive returns from our development pipeline will continue to enhance our earnings growth.
Let's turn to Aéropostale. Let me talk briefly about Aéropostale. The demand from other retailers for the Aéropostale space was very strong. Authentic Brands Group, one of the best bands company in the U.S., approached us as they saw significant been equity in Aéropostale. We are capitalizing on the brand value, reducing the store footprint, renegotiating leases and reducing overhead in order to stabilize the company. We have rightsized the business, taking it from 800 stores to about 500, whereby a viable retailer has been resurrected.
In terms of economics. Total investment by the 3 partners was about $55 million or about 1.5x current EBITDA on sales north of $1 billion. We view the investment as a one-off opportunity that can lead to many positive outcomes. For example, ABG is an owner of some of the most recognizable brands today like Marilyn Munro, Mohammed Aly, Elvis, [indiscernible], Spider, Prince, the record company, [indiscernible] and many others represent the potential demand for in-line space as we seek to continue to curate the brands within our centers. The ABG brands, beside Aéropostale, have no stores today in the U.S., only internationally.
In closing, a few weeks ago, I had the honor of participating in the Wall Street Journal's Consumer 250 Conference in New York City. This was an event that brought representatives from leading retail companies together for an evening to talk about trends and developments in the industry. [indiscernible], Co-Founder, Robbie Parker, said he could envision a future with 800 to 1,000 physical stores. Andy Dunn, founder of [indiscernible], said he plans to have 100 stores by 2020. And he then added that he expect the wave of e-commerce companies to make similar leap. These are 2 good examples of companies starting on the Internet, finding success and realizing true scale and profitability via physical stores.
Beyond these 2 well-known retailers, there are many other incubating online, starting with a pop-up shop like Mac Plop, L's cosmetics, Monica and Andy and [indiscernible]. Find greater success and then opening more stores. 
We are optimistic with respect to our leasing activity. We have locked down approximately 50% of our overall anticipated 27 leasing activity. We are anticipating occupancy increases as our merchandising and curation ration efforts continue to take hold. We're targeting a modest occupancy scale on the overall portfolio. We are currently expect our long-term target of 4% to 5% operation growth from our assets to be achievable in 2017.
Michael, will now review our financial results."

Same-store NOI was at $544 million on the focus on increase. Growth would have been 4.4%, excluding termination income. Our same-store NOI margin continues to be in the 74% to 75% range. EBITDA came in at $528 million, an increase of 4.6% over the prior year. Growth would have been 4.5% without the [indiscernible] of the LX. Our FFO included a one-time prepayment of $5.4 million related to the $300 million debt payoffs at Mall of Louisiana and Apache Mall. Overall, as Sandeep noted, company FFO came in at $0.35 per share, in line with our guidance.
A quick note on our reported lease spreads, as there's been a lot of discussions around this metric. Our spread was suite to suite and compare opening rents to closing rents. It includes base rent for recoveries and excludes tax recoveries. Lease modifications and amendments are included in the calculation. For example, PacSun and Aéropostale modifications that occurred during the quarter are included in the metric.
Spreads on 2017 commencements of $5 per square foot with initial rents of around $55 per square foot. There are several big box deals that impact the initial rent per square foot. If you take these out, the initial rent is around $72 to $73 per square foot and spreads are around $5 to $6.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect same-store NOI growth of around 4%. We expect company FFO per share of $0.42 to $0.44. For the full year, we expect same-store NOI growth of around 4.25 [ph], and we expect company FFO per share of $1.52 to $1.54, which is really just $1.10 for the first 3 quarters plus the fourth quarter guidance numbers.
Moving on to the balance sheet. As a reminder, our total debt at the beginning of the year was around $20 billion. Through dispositions and debt reductions, that balance will be on the $18.5 billion at the and of the year. We expect enterprise debt to EBITDA at year-end to be less than 8x, and we are trending toward the mid-7. I want to remind you that we have no unsecured debt, and we plan on continuing to be a secured borrower.
We are done with our 2016 debt maturities and have already dealt with most of our 2017 maturities. We have around $2.6 billion of total liquidity from the line cash on the balance sheet and borrowing capacity. This provides substantial resources to take advantage of any dislocations in the market.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

But $200 million was allocated to the Ala Moana. I could have allocated all $250 million to Ala Moana, because the return turned out to be 10-plus percent. So again, not trying to give away the math here, but you should not look at all real estate to be the same and obviously the value for the [indiscernible] box is substantially higher than the other boxes. And as I mentioned, we expect the returns to be in line with what we have done previously."

Let me begin by highlighting the quarter. FFO per share came in at $0.35 and within our guidance range. For the year, we're at $1.10 per share, about 9% higher than last year. Same-store NOI was up approximate",1585,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by highlighting the quarter. FFO per share came in at $0.35 and within our guidance range. For the year, we're at $1.10 per share, about 9% higher than last year. Same-store NOI was up approximately 4% for the quarter and the year. EBITDA was up, slightly better than 4.5% for the quarter and over 10% for the year. 
We are pleased with our earnings growth this year, especially in light of our strong growth last year. Based on our financial performance to date, we are pleased to announce a $0.02 increase to our quarterly dividend. Our cash dividend this year will be $0.80, double that from where we began in 2011 albeit a much smaller portfolio base.
Our leverage on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis is under 8x. From the very beginning, we've communicated a path to lower leverage. We have no unsecured debt and are sitting on more than -- more cash than we have in the last 5 years. Lower leverage today has been from a meticulous effort to sell lower-quality assets that also have high leverage, paying down debt and growing EBITDA. 
Our portfolio of high-quality retail properties throughout the country continues to deliver results above the national average. Total sales performed well across the portfolio, up 1.4%, as consumers visit our centers for their shopping, dining and entertainment needs. 
As we look at the top retailers in our portfolio, L Brand sales increased 8.7% in their stores that are less than 10,000 square feet and increased 5.5% for all their stores, which include stores larger than 10,000 square feet. Within our portfolio, 3 of the 4 largest tenants posted similar strong sales increases.
Not all retail square feet is equal. The high-quality asset sees higher sales productivity. When weighted for NOI, sales per square foot in our portfolio is actually $687 a square foot and $675 excluding Christiana Mall.
Quickly, on the urban leasing front. At 530 Fifth Avenue, we entered into a lease with Duane Reade, a Walgreens company. 
At 685 Fifth, Coach will be opening its new Coach House on November 18. 
Our entire real estate portfolio is 97% leased at the quarter end.
Turning to activity on the anchor box front. Let me begin by starting that GGP is in the retail property business focusing only on high-quality assets. Let's take a look at total retail space in the U.S. Today, there is approximately 24 square feet of retail square footage per person. Of this, only 4 square feet is considered high quality or about 1.2 billion square feet. GGP's portfolio today comprises of approximately 100 million square feet of high-quality retail in the U.S., almost 8% of the total high-quality retail real estate in this country. There is a blurring of retail property types as retailers don't differentiate between type, they just want to be in highest-quality assets.
One of the ways GGP has responded to the continued demand for space is to anchor box acquisition and redevelopment. For some perspective, the department store's square footage as a percentage of total center space in the U.S. is 46%, significantly higher than other parts of the world where it's only 27% in the U.K., 23% in Australia, 17% in Asia and 15% in the Middle East. 
Since 2011, we have redeveloped 9-0, 90 department store boxes investing $1.5 billion of capital at very attractive returns. The new uses have included department stores, entertainment venues, sporting goods stores, fast-fashion retailers, restaurants, grocery stores, fitness centers, almost 200,000 square feet of new inline space, which we've leased to Apple, Nike, lululemon, Tommy Bahama, Aritzia and many others. The 91st box to be redeveloped is the original Nordstrom's box Ala Moana Center. The lowest level will go to Saks Off 5th Avenue and the mall level -- and the third level will go to Target in 2-level store. As you may recall, Nordstrom relocated to the expansion of Ala Moana earlier this year, allowing us to redevelop their old anchor box, bringing in new users and offerings to the center. 
High-quality retail properties will continue to thrive and we will continue to capitalize upon this opportunity to redevelop anchor boxes for alternative uses.
Let me talk a little bit about Sears. The strong demand for space leads to our anchor box acquisitions including the 12 we have acquired with Seritage. Of the 12 Seritage locations, we've broken ground on 4 including Pembroke Lakes in Florida where we're adding AMC movie theater and several restaurants; Staten Island Mall in New York where we're adding a Container Store and some restaurants; Coronado Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico where we're adding Container Store, restaurant and inline space; and Valley Plaza in California where we're adding a few restaurant and a fast-fashion retailer.
Given our leasing momentum, we have set specific dates to recapture space at the following 5 Seritage locations: Alderwood in the Seattle market; Paramus Park in Northern New Jersey; Mall of Columbia in Columbia, Maryland; Natick Mall outside of Boston; and Oakbrook Center in the Chicago metro area. Our JV with Seritage permits recapture of up to 50% of the space and leaving Sears to operate in the remaining space. I want to highlight that we are recapturing 100% of the Sears space for 2 of these 5 locations. Those are Alderwood in the Seattle market, a Class A mall, and Paramus Park, a B+ mall in Northern New Jersey. 
Over and above these 12, late last night, we negotiated the terms for the purchase of 100% of the Sears location at The Streets at Southpoint in the -- in North Carolina, the Research Triangle Park, an A+ center with sales north of $650 per square foot.
Let's turn a little bit to Macy's. As reported yesterday in our earnings release, we announced the acquisition of 5 stores from Macy's. When Macy's publicly announced store closures earlier this year, we proactively approached them to take advantage of the potential opportunity to buy back certain boxes where we felt there was strong tenant demand. Of the 5 locations, 1 was on the closure list. The locations are as follows: Tysons Galleria where we plan a major repositioning of the property similar to what we did at Ala Moana; Carolina Place where we are going to put a new Dick's Sporting Goods; Quail Springs Mall where we have mail deals with Life Time Fitness; Greenwood Mall where we're welcoming a new Belk department store with a signed lease with Belk; and the one on the closure list was Oakwood Mall in Wisconsin.
The new uses are subject to satisfaction of certain delivery conditions to the tenants. Macy's will continue to operate the Tysons Galleria store on a short-term lease with us. The Macy's at Quail Springs closed earlier this year and the other 3 will close in spring 2017. The attractive returns from our development pipeline will continue to enhance our earnings growth.
Let's turn to Aéropostale. Let me talk briefly about Aéropostale. The demand from other retailers for the Aéropostale space was very strong. Authentic Brands Group, one of the best brand companies in the U.S., approached us as they saw a significant brand equity in Aéropostale. We are capitalizing on the brand value, reducing the store footprint, renegotiating leases and reducing overhead in order to stabilize the company. We have rightsized the business, taking it from 800 stores to about 500 whereby a viable retailer has been resurrected.
In terms of economics. Total investment by the 3 partners is about $55 million or about 1.5x current EBITDA on sales north of $1 billion. We view the investment as a one-off opportunity that can lead to many positive outcomes. For example, ABG is an owner of some of the most recognizable brands today like Marilyn Monroe; Muhammad Ali; Elvis; Juicy Couture; Spyder; Prince, the racket company; Hickey Freeman; and many others represent the potential demand for inline space as we seek to continue to curate the brands within our centers. The ABG brands, beside Aéropostale, have no stores today in the U.S., only internationally.
In closing. A few weeks ago, I had the honor of participating in The Wall Street Journal's consumer 2016 conference in New York City. This was an event that brought representatives from leading retail companies together for an evening to talk about trends and developments in the industry. Neil Blumenthal, Co-Founder of Warby Parker, said he could envision a future with 800 to 1,000 physical stores. Andy Dunn, Founder of Bonobos, said he plans to have 100 stores by 2020. Andy Dunn added that he expects a tidal wave of e-commerce companies to make similar leap. These are 2 good examples of companies started on the Internet, finding success and realizing true scale and profitability via physical stores. Beyond these 2 well-known e-tailers, there are many others incubating online and starting with a pop-up shop like Mark Klopp [ph], L. Cosmetics, Monica + Andy and Fabletics, finding greater success and then opening more stores. 
We are optimistic with respect to our leasing activity. We have locked down approximately 50% of our overall anticipated 27 leasing activity. We are anticipating occupancy increases as our merchandising and curation efforts continue to take hold. We are targeting a modest occupancy scale [ph] on the overall portfolio. We currently expect our long-term target of 4% to 5% operational growth from our assets to be achievable in 2017.
Michael, will now review our financial results."

Our same-store NOI margin continues to be in",432,"Thank you, Sandeep, and good morning, everyone. Overall, the third quarter came in as expected. Same-store NOI was at $544 million, almost 4% increase. Growth would have been 4.4% excluding termination income. Our same-store NOI margin continues to be in the 74% to 75% range. EBITDA came in at $528 million, an increase of 4.6% over the prior year. Growth would have been 4.5% without the condos and the airways [ph]. Our FFO included a one-time prepayment of $5.4 million related to the $300 million debt payoffs at Mall of Louisiana and Apache Mall. Overall, as Sandeep noted, company FFO came in at $0.35 per share, in line with our guidance.
A quick note on our reported lease spreads as there has been a lot of discussions around this metric. Our spread was suite-to-suite and compare opening rents to closing rents. It includes base rent plus CAM recoveries and excludes tax recoveries. Lease modifications and amendments are included in the calculation, for example, PacSun and Aéropostale modifications that occurred during the quarter are included in the metric. Spreads on 2017 commencements of $5 per square foot with initial rents of around $55 per square foot. There are several big-box deals that impact the initial rent per square foot. If you take these out, the initial rent is around $72 to $73 per square foot and spreads are around $5 to $6.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect same-store NOI growth of around 4%. We expect company FFO per share of $0.42 to $0.44. For the full year, we expect same-store NOI growth of around 4.25% and we expect company FFO per share of $1.52 to $1.54, which is really just $1.10 for the first 3 quarters plus the fourth quarter guidance numbers.
Moving on to the balance sheet. As a reminder, our total debt at the beginning of the year was around $20 billion. Through dispositions and debt reductions, that balance will be under $18.5 billion at the end of the year. We expect net debt-to-EBITDA at year-end to be less than 8x and we are trending toward the mid-7. I want to remind you that we have no unsecured debt, and we plan on continuing to be a secured borrower.
We are done with our 2016 debt maturities and have already dealt with most of our 2017 maturities. 
We have around $2.6 billion of total liquidity from the line, cash on the balance sheet and borrowing capacity. This provides substantial resources to take advantage of any dislocations in the market.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

Let me begin by highlighting the quarter. FFO per share came in at $0.35 and within our guidance range. For the year, we're at $1.10 per share, about 9% higher than last year. Same-store NOI was up approximate",1586,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by highlighting the quarter. FFO per share came in at $0.35 and within our guidance range. For the year, we're at $1.10 per share, about 9% higher than last year. Same-store NOI was up approximately 4% for the quarter and the year. EBITDA was up, slightly better than 4.5% for the quarter and over 10% for the year. 
We are pleased with our earnings growth this year, especially in light of our strong growth last year. Based on our financial performance to date, we are pleased to announce a $0.02 increase to our quarterly dividend. Our cash dividend this year will be $0.80, double that from where we began in 2011 albeit a much smaller portfolio base.
Our leverage on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis is under 8x. From the very beginning, we've communicated a path to lower leverage. We have no unsecured debt and are sitting on more than -- more cash than we have in the last 5 years. Lower leverage today has been from a meticulous effort to sell lower-quality assets that also have high leverage, paying down debt and growing EBITDA. 
Our portfolio of high-quality retail properties throughout the country continues to deliver results above the national average. Total sales performed well across the portfolio, up 1.4%, as consumers visit our centers for their shopping, dining and entertainment needs. 
As we look at the top retailers in our portfolio, L Brand sales increased 8.7% in their stores that are less than 10,000 square feet and increased 5.5% for all their stores, which include stores larger than 10,000 square feet. Within our portfolio, 3 of the 4 largest tenants posted similar strong sales increases.
Not all retail square feet is equal. The high-quality asset sees higher sales productivity. When weighted for NOI, sales per square foot in our portfolio is actually $687 a square foot and $675 excluding Christiana Mall.
Quickly, on the urban leasing front. At 530 Fifth Avenue, we entered into a lease with Duane Reade, a Walgreens company. 
At 685 Fifth, Coach will be opening its new Coach House on November 18. 
Our entire real estate portfolio is 97% leased at the quarter end.
Turning to activity on the anchor box front. Let me begin by starting that GGP is in the retail property business focusing only on high-quality assets. Let's take a look at total retail space in the U.S. Today, there is approximately 24 square feet of retail square footage per person. Of this, only 4 square feet is considered high quality or about 1.2 billion square feet. GGP's portfolio today comprises of approximately 100 million square feet of high-quality retail in the U.S., almost 8% of the total high-quality retail real estate in this country. There is a blurring of retail property types as retailers don't differentiate between type, they just want to be in highest-quality assets.
One of the ways GGP has responded to the continued demand for space is to anchor box acquisition and redevelopment. For some perspective, the department store's square footage as a percentage of total center space in the U.S. is 46%, significantly higher than other parts of the world where it's only 27% in the U.K., 23% in Australia, 17% in Asia and 15% in the Middle East. 
Since 2011, we have redeveloped 9-0, 90 department store boxes investing $1.5 billion of capital at very attractive returns. The new uses have included department stores, entertainment venues, sporting goods stores, fast-fashion retailers, restaurants, grocery stores, fitness centers, almost 200,000 square feet of new inline space, which we've leased to Apple, Nike, lululemon, Tommy Bahama, Aritzia and many others. The 91st box to be redeveloped is the original Nordstrom's box Ala Moana Center. The lowest level will go to Saks Off 5th Avenue and the mall level -- and the third level will go to Target in a 2-level store. As you may recall, Nordstrom relocated to the expansion of Ala Moana earlier this year, allowing us to redevelop their old anchor box, bringing in new users and offerings to the center. 
High-quality retail properties will continue to thrive and we will continue to capitalize upon this opportunity to redevelop anchor boxes for alternative uses.
Let me talk a little bit about Sears. The strong demand for space leads to our anchor box acquisitions including the 12 we have acquired with Seritage. Of the 12 Seritage locations, we've broken ground on 4 including Pembroke Lakes in Florida where we're adding AMC movie theater and several restaurants; Staten Island Mall in New York where we're adding a Container Store and some restaurants; Coronado Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico where we're adding Container Store, restaurant and inline space; and Valley Plaza in California where we're adding a few restaurant and a fast-fashion retailer.
Given our leasing momentum, we have set specific dates to recapture space at the following 5 Seritage locations: Alderwood in the Seattle market; Paramus Park in Northern New Jersey; Mall of Columbia in Columbia, Maryland; Natick Mall outside of Boston; and Oakbrook Center in the Chicago metro area. Our JV with Seritage permits recapture of up to 50% of the space and leaving Sears to operate in the remaining space. I want to highlight that we are recapturing 100% of the Sears space for 2 of these 5 locations. Those are Alderwood in the Seattle market, a Class A mall, and Paramus Park, a B+ mall in Northern New Jersey. 
Over and above these 12, late last night, we negotiated the terms for the purchase of 100% of the Sears location at The Streets at Southpoint in the -- in North Carolina, the Research Triangle Park, an A+ center with sales north of $650 per square foot.
Let's turn a little bit to Macy's. As reported yesterday in our earnings release, we announced the acquisition of 5 stores from Macy's. When Macy's publicly announced store closures earlier this year, we proactively approached them to take advantage of the potential opportunity to buy back certain boxes where we felt there was strong tenant demand. Of the 5 locations, 1 was on the closure list. The locations are as follows: Tysons Galleria where we plan a major repositioning of the property similar to what we did at Ala Moana; Carolina Place where we are going to put a new Dick's Sporting Goods; Quail Springs Mall where we have made a deal with Life Time Fitness; Greenwood Mall where we're welcoming a new Belk department store with a signed lease with Belk; and the one on the closure list was Oakwood Mall in Wisconsin.
The new uses are subject to satisfaction of certain delivery conditions to the tenants. Macy's will continue to operate the Tysons Galleria store on a short-term lease with us. The Macy's at Quail Springs closed earlier this year and the other 3 will close in spring 2017. The attractive returns from our development pipeline will continue to enhance our earnings growth.
Let's turn to Aéropostale. Let me talk briefly about Aéropostale. The demand from other retailers for the Aéropostale space was very strong. Authentic Brands Group, one of the best brand companies in the U.S., approached us as they saw a significant brand equity in Aéropostale. We are capitalizing on the brand value, reducing the store footprint, renegotiating leases and reducing overhead in order to stabilize the company. We have rightsized the business, taking it from 800 stores to about 500 whereby a viable retailer has been resurrected.
In terms of economics. Total investment by the 3 partners is about $55 million or about 1.5x current EBITDA on sales north of $1 billion. We view the investment as a one-off opportunity that can lead to many positive outcomes. For example, ABG is an owner of some of the most recognizable brands today like Marilyn Monroe; Muhammad Ali; Elvis; Juicy Couture; Spyder; Prince, the racket company; Hickey Freeman; and many others, represent the potential demand for inline space as we seek to continue to curate the brands within our centers. The ABG brands, beside Aéropostale, have no stores today in the U.S., only internationally.
In closing. A few weeks ago, I had the honor of participating in The Wall Street Journal's consumer 2016 conference in New York City. This was an event that brought representatives from leading retail companies together for an evening to talk about trends and developments in the industry. Neil Blumenthal, Co-Founder of Warby Parker, said he could envision a future with 800 to 1,000 physical stores. Andy Dunn, Founder of Bonobos, said he plans to have 100 stores by 2020. Andy Dunn added that he expects a tidal wave of e-commerce companies to make similar leap. These are 2 good examples of companies started on the Internet, finding success and realizing true scale and profitability via physical stores. Beyond these 2 well-known e-tailers, there are many others incubating online and starting with a pop-up shop like Mark Klopp [ph], L. Cosmetics, Monica + Andy and Fabletics, finding greater success and then opening more stores. 
We are optimistic with respect to our leasing activity. We have locked down approximately 50% of our overall anticipated 27 leasing activity. We are anticipating occupancy increases as our merchandising and curation efforts continue to take hold. We are targeting a modest occupancy gain on the overall portfolio. We currently expect our long-term target of 4% to 5% operational growth from our assets to be achievable in 2017.
Michael, will now review our financial results."

Overall, the third quarter came in as expected. Same-store NOI was at $544 million, almost 4% increase. Growth would have been 4.4% excluding termination income.

Same-store NOI was at $544 million, almost 4% increase. Growth would have been 4.4% excluding termination income. Our same-store NOI margin continues to be in the 74% to 75% range. EBITDA came in at $528 million, an increase of 4.6% over the prior year. Growth would have been 4.5% without the condos and the airways [ph]. Our FFO included a one-time prepayment of $5.4 million related to the $300 million debt payoffs at Mall of Louisiana and Apache Mall. Overall, as Sandeep noted, company FFO came in at $0.35 per share, in line with our guidance.
A quick note on our reported lease spreads as there has been a lot of discussions around this metric. Our spread was suite-to-suite and compare opening rents to closing rents. It includes base rent plus CAM recoveries and excludes tax recoveries. Lease modifications and amendments are included in the calculation, for example, PacSun and Aéropostale modifications that occurred during the quarter are included in the metric. Spreads on 2017 commencements of $5 per square foot with initial rents of around $55 per square foot. There are several big-box deals that impact the initial rent per square foot. If you take these out, the initial rent is around $72 to $73 per square foot and spreads are around $5 to $6.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect same-store NOI growth of around 4%. We expect company FFO per share of $0.42 to $0.44. For the full year, we expect same-store NOI growth of around 4.25% and we expect company FFO per share of $1.52 to $1.54, which is really just $1.10 for the first 3 quarters plus the fourth quarter guidance numbers.
Moving on to the balance sheet. As a reminder, our total debt at the beginning of the year was around $20 billion. Through dispositions and debt reductions, that balance will be under $18.5 billion at the end of the year. We expect net debt-to-EBITDA at year-end to be less than 8x and we are trending toward the mid-7. I want to remind you that we have no unsecured debt, and we plan on continuing to be a secured borrower.
We are done with our 2016 debt maturities and have already dealt with most of our 2017 maturities. 
We have around $2.6 billion of total liquidity from the line, cash on the balance sheet and borrowing capacity. This provides substantial resources to take advantage of any dislocations in the market.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

Let me begin by highlighting the quarter. FFO per share came in at $0.35 and within our guidance range. For the year, we're at $1.10 per share, about 9% higher than last year. Same-store NOI was up approximate",1586,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by highlighting the quarter. FFO per share came in at $0.35 and within our guidance range. For the year, we're at $1.10 per share, about 9% higher than last year. Same-store NOI was up approximately 4% for the quarter and the year. EBITDA was up, slightly better than 4.5% for the quarter and over 10% for the year. 
We are pleased with our earnings growth this year, especially in light of our strong growth last year. Based on our financial performance to date, we are pleased to announce a $0.02 increase to our quarterly dividend. Our cash dividend this year will be $0.80, double that from where we began in 2011 albeit a much smaller portfolio base.
Our leverage on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis is under 8x. From the very beginning, we've communicated a path to lower leverage. We have no unsecured debt and are sitting on more than -- more cash than we have in the last 5 years. Lower leverage today has been from a meticulous effort to sell lower-quality assets that also have high leverage, paying down debt and growing EBITDA. 
Our portfolio of high-quality retail properties throughout the country continues to deliver results above the national average. Total sales performed well across the portfolio, up 1.4%, as consumers visit our centers for their shopping, dining and entertainment needs. 
As we look at the top retailers in our portfolio, L Brand sales increased 8.7% in their stores that are less than 10,000 square feet and increased 5.5% for all their stores, which include stores larger than 10,000 square feet. Within our portfolio, 3 of the 4 largest tenants posted similar strong sales increases.
Not all retail square feet is equal. The high-quality asset sees higher sales productivity. When weighted for NOI, sales per square foot in our portfolio is actually $687 a square foot and $675 excluding Christiana Mall.
Quickly, on the urban leasing front. At 530 Fifth Avenue, we entered into a lease with Duane Reade, a Walgreens company. 
At 685 Fifth, Coach will be opening its new Coach House on November 18. 
Our entire real estate portfolio is 97% leased at the quarter end.
Turning to activity on the anchor box front. Let me begin by starting that GGP is in the retail property business focusing only on high-quality assets. Let's take a look at total retail space in the U.S. Today, there is approximately 24 square feet of retail square footage per person. Of this, only 4 square feet is considered high quality or about 1.2 billion square feet. GGP's portfolio today comprises of approximately 100 million square feet of high-quality retail in the U.S., almost 8% of the total high-quality retail real estate in this country. There is a blurring of retail property types as retailers don't differentiate between type, they just want to be in highest-quality assets.
One of the ways GGP has responded to the continued demand for space is to anchor box acquisition and redevelopment. For some perspective, the department store's square footage as a percentage of total center space in the U.S. is 46%, significantly higher than other parts of the world where it's only 27% in the U.K., 23% in Australia, 17% in Asia and 15% in the Middle East. 
Since 2011, we have redeveloped 9-0, 90 department store boxes investing $1.5 billion of capital at very attractive returns. The new uses have included department stores, entertainment venues, sporting goods stores, fast-fashion retailers, restaurants, grocery stores, fitness centers, almost 200,000 square feet of new inline space, which we've leased to Apple, Nike, lululemon, Tommy Bahama, Aritzia and many others. The 91st box to be redeveloped is the original Nordstrom's box Ala Moana Center. The lowest level will go to Saks Off 5th Avenue and the mall level -- and the third level will go to Target in a 2-level store. As you may recall, Nordstrom relocated to the expansion of Ala Moana earlier this year, allowing us to redevelop their old anchor box, bringing in new users and offerings to the center. 
High-quality retail properties will continue to thrive and we will continue to capitalize upon this opportunity to redevelop anchor boxes for alternative uses.
Let me talk a little bit about Sears. The strong demand for space leads to our anchor box acquisitions including the 12 we have acquired with Seritage. Of the 12 Seritage locations, we've broken ground on 4 including Pembroke Lakes in Florida where we're adding AMC movie theater and several restaurants; Staten Island Mall in New York where we're adding a Container Store and some restaurants; Coronado Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico where we're adding Container Store, restaurant and inline space; and Valley Plaza in California where we're adding a few restaurant and a fast-fashion retailer.
Given our leasing momentum, we have set specific dates to recapture space at the following 5 Seritage locations: Alderwood in the Seattle market; Paramus Park in Northern New Jersey; Mall of Columbia in Columbia, Maryland; Natick Mall outside of Boston; and Oakbrook Center in the Chicago metro area. Our JV with Seritage permits recapture of up to 50% of the space and leaving Sears to operate in the remaining space. I want to highlight that we are recapturing 100% of the Sears space for 2 of these 5 locations. Those are Alderwood in the Seattle market, a Class A mall, and Paramus Park, a B+ mall in Northern New Jersey. 
Over and above these 12, late last night, we negotiated the terms for the purchase of 100% of the Sears location at The Streets at Southpoint in the -- in North Carolina, the Research Triangle Park, an A+ center with sales north of $650 per square foot.
Let's turn a little bit to Macy's. As reported yesterday in our earnings release, we announced the acquisition of 5 stores from Macy's. When Macy's publicly announced store closures earlier this year, we proactively approached them to take advantage of the potential opportunity to buy back certain boxes where we felt there was strong tenant demand. Of the 5 locations, 1 was on the closure list. The locations are as follows: Tysons Galleria where we plan a major repositioning of the property similar to what we did at Ala Moana; Carolina Place where we are going to put a new Dick's Sporting Goods; Quail Springs Mall where we have made a deal with Life Time Fitness; Greenwood Mall where we're welcoming a new Belk department store with a signed lease with Belk; and the one on the closure list was Oakwood Mall in Wisconsin.
The new uses are subject to satisfaction of certain delivery conditions to the tenants. Macy's will continue to operate the Tysons Galleria store on a short-term lease with us. The Macy's at Quail Springs closed earlier this year and the other 3 will close in spring 2017. The attractive returns from our development pipeline will continue to enhance our earnings growth.
Let's turn to Aéropostale. Let me talk briefly about Aéropostale. The demand from other retailers for the Aéropostale space was very strong. Authentic Brands Group, one of the best brand companies in the U.S., approached us as they saw a significant brand equity in Aéropostale. We are capitalizing on the brand value, reducing the store footprint, renegotiating leases and reducing overhead in order to stabilize the company. We have rightsized the business, taking it from 800 stores to about 500 whereby a viable retailer has been resurrected.
In terms of economics. Total investment by the 3 partners is about $55 million or about 1.5x current EBITDA on sales north of $1 billion. We view the investment as a one-off opportunity that can lead to many positive outcomes. For example, ABG is an owner of some of the most recognizable brands today like Marilyn Monroe; Muhammad Ali; Elvis; Juicy Couture; Spyder; Prince, the racket company; Hickey Freeman; and many others, represent the potential demand for inline space as we seek to continue to curate the brands within our centers. The ABG brands, beside Aéropostale, have no stores today in the U.S., only internationally.
In closing. A few weeks ago, I had the honor of participating in The Wall Street Journal's consumer 2016 conference in New York City. This was an event that brought representatives from leading retail companies together for an evening to talk about trends and developments in the industry. Neil Blumenthal, Co-Founder of Warby Parker, said he could envision a future with 800 to 1,000 physical stores. Andy Dunn, Founder of Bonobos, said he plans to have 100 stores by 2020. Andy Dunn added that he expects a tidal wave of e-commerce companies to make similar leap. These are 2 good examples of companies started on the Internet, finding success and realizing true scale and profitability via physical stores. Beyond these 2 well-known e-tailers, there are many others incubating online and starting with a pop-up shop like Mark Klopp [ph], L. Cosmetics, Monica + Andy and Fabletics, finding greater success and then opening more stores. 
We are optimistic with respect to our leasing activity. We have locked down approximately 50% of our overall anticipated 27 leasing activity. We are anticipating occupancy increases as our merchandising and curation efforts continue to take hold. We are targeting a modest occupancy gain on the overall portfolio. We currently expect our long-term target of 4% to 5% operational growth from our assets to be achievable in 2017.
Michael, will now review our financial results."

Same-store NOI was at $544 million, almost 4% increase. Growth would have been 4.4% excluding termination income. Our same-store NOI margin continues to be in the 74% to 75% range. EBITDA came in at $528 million, an increase of 4.6% over the prior year. Growth would have been 4.5% without the condos and the airways [ph]. Our FFO included a one-time prepayment of $5.4 million related to the $300 million debt payoffs at Mall of Louisiana and Apache Mall. Overall, as Sandeep noted, company FFO came in at $0.35 per share, in line with our guidance.
A quick note on our reported lease spreads as there has been a lot of discussions around this metric. Our spread was suite-to-suite and compare opening rents to closing rents. It includes base rent plus CAM recoveries and excludes tax recoveries. Lease modifications and amendments are included in the calculation, for example, PacSun and Aéropostale modifications that occurred during the quarter are included in the metric. Spreads on 2017 commencements of $5 per square foot with initial rents of around $55 per square foot. There are several big-box deals that impact the initial rent per square foot. If you take these out, the initial rent is around $72 to $73 per square foot and spreads are around $5 to $6.
With respect to the fourth quarter, we expect same-store NOI growth of around 4%. We expect company FFO per share of $0.42 to $0.44. For the full year, we expect same-store NOI growth of around 4.25% and we expect company FFO per share of $1.52 to $1.54, which is really just $1.10 for the first 3 quarters plus the fourth quarter guidance numbers.
Moving on to the balance sheet. As a reminder, our total debt at the beginning of the year was around $20 billion. Through dispositions and debt reductions, that balance will be under $18.5 billion at the end of the year. We expect net debt-to-EBITDA at year-end to be less than 8x and we are trending toward the mid-7. I want to remind you that we have no unsecured debt, and we plan on continuing to be a secured borrower.
We are done with our 2016 debt maturities and have already dealt with most of our 2017 maturities. 
We have around $2.6 billion of total liquidity from the line, cash on the balance sheet and borrowing capacity. This provides substantial resources to take advantage of any dislocations in the market.
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

Good morning, everyone. Our latest sustainability report is available on our website. For the past several years, we have been identifying and executing on ways to improve our impact on the environment. I want to mention a few highlights",1736,"Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Our latest sustainability report is available on our website. For the past several years, we have been identifying and executing on ways to improve our impact on the environment. I want to mention a few highlights from the report. We have diverted 54,000 tons of waste from landfills, which is enough to fill all 4,500 garbage trucks. Water consumption has been reduced by 64 million gallons, which is enough water to fill almost 100 Olympic-sized swimming pools. We have completed lighting and HVAC upgrades, which will save the equivalent energy of taking 4,600 homes off the electric grid, and we expect to be one of the largest generators of solar energy in the U.S. this year. We continue to explore new opportunities to implement sustainable operating practices throughout our portfolio. 
Now let's return to our recent results. FFO per share was $0.35, up almost 7% from the same quarter last year. Year-to-date FFO per share was $0.75, up over 15% from last year. EBITDA was up 6.5% from the same quarter last year, and over 13% year-to-date from last year. Same-store NOI growth was up 4% for the quarter and 4.6% year-to-date. Results were driven primarily by continued strength from our high-quality portfolio in terms of occupancy gains and expense management. We increased the quarterly dividend to $0.20, 11% increase over last year. 
The portfolio was over 96% leased at quarter end, and permanent occupancy stood at about 91.5% as we expected -- which is what we expected at this time of the year. Total sales, excluding department stores and Christiana Mall, were up about 3%, and sales for tenants under 10,000 feet were flat, excluding Christiana Mall. Categories that performed best were restaurants, home furnishings and health and personal care. We even had a positive comp in apparel. This is for total sales x department stores. Lease spreads for leases commencing in the trailing 12 months are about 13% or a little over $8 per square foot. To calculate our lease spreads, we include base tenant count and compare them to the ending rent on the expiring lease to the beginning rent on the new lease on a suite-to-suite basis, regardless of size. 
Turning to property transactions. In June, we sold our interest in 1 Stockton in San Francisco for approximately $50 million, which values the asset at a subsea cat on a trailing 12-month basis. This is the highest price paid for an asset per square foot in Union Square, almost $5,800 per square foot. You may recall, we acquired this asset in 2014, one of our initial investments in urban retail with a plan to re-lease this space since the existing tenant was relocating to the Square. We successfully released the space to T-Mobile, stabilizing the asset, and then sold our interest. On an IR basis, we realized about 40%. 
In June, we sold Pioneer Place office buildings, a class A asset, for approximately $122 million, which values the asset at a 5% cap. In July, we sold Newgate Mall, located in Ogden, Utah, for approximately $70 million, which values the asset at a high single-digit cap rate. Yesterday, we closed on the sale of Rogue Valley Mall located in Medford, Oregon, for over $60 million, which values the asset at a high-single-digit cap rate.
We're pleased to announce a new joint venture with TIAA Global Asset Management at Fashion Show in Las Vegas. GGP and TIAA are partners at other properties and we look forward to our new partnership with them. As you know, Fashion Show is a one-of-a-kind asset. Over the past several years, the GGP team has successfully re-tenanted several anchor boxes, bringing in Macy's Men, Urban Outfitters, and Dick's Sporting Goods to the mall. We brought to life the Boulevard entrance, bringing a number of new dining and leisure options. TIAA will now own approximately 50% of Fashion Show. The transaction values the asset at approximately $2.5 billion, a sub-4% cap rate.
We closed on the previously announced acquisition of 218 West 57th Street in New York City. You may recall, we entered into a commitment to acquire this property located across the street from the new Nordstrom back in 2014. The asset was owner-occupied, and offers us unique and rare opportunity for a retailer to have a prominent presence on West 57th Street across from the future Nordstrom, which will be the first full-line Nordstrom in Manhattan. 
Finally, I like to talk about our investment, Aliansce, the Brazilian mall owner. As you may recall from our first quarter earnings call, we wrote down the note receivable to approximately $70 million, which represented the market value of the underlying common shares, which were collateral for the note. We also wrote off about $7.5 million of accrued interest income. During the second quarter, we agreed to take ownership of the shares, about $18.3 million in exchange for canceling the note. As you know, GGP's focus is owning retail real estate in the United States.  We recently entered into an agreement to sell the shares to an institutional buyer for approximately $85 million. Upon close later this quarter, we will have no remaining interest in Aliansce. In terms of how this transaction is treated for earnings, we are excluding the write-down and markup from company FFO, but including both in NAREIT FFO in accordance with the definition. 
Let me talk a little bit about our industry. GGP is in the retail real estate business. Historically, retail real estate has been segmented. They are malls, strip centers, lifestyle centers, power centers, and so on. Together, they equate to 24 square feet of retail GLA per capita. Based on our research, we believe that only about 4 square feet per capita of retail GLA is high-quality. Approximately 8% of the high-quality retail real estate in the United States is in the GGP portfolio, from which 95% of our NOI is derived. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the retail real estate business. Let me talk a little bit about our leasing. We are pleased to report, we have no vacant anchor departments stores left, no vacant anchor boxes in our portfolio. So let's start with the new inventory that's upon us. As you all know, Sports Authority has shuttered as an operator. We had 9 locations, 6 large-format stores and 3 elite stores. The 3 elite stores will go back into in-line GLA until we are focused on leasing the large-format stores. 3 of them have already been leased, one to Target and the other 2 in Northridge and White Marsh to Dave & Buster's. We are progressing with the remaining locations. There is strong demand. 
I'd like to provide an update on our redevelopment plans for the Sears anchor boxes, which we own with Seritage. We plan to commence redevelopment of 4 locations later this year. At Pembroke's Lake, we are being in a movie theater, AMC. At Staten Island Mall, we are bringing in Container Store and a new Trimark. At Coronado Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, we have several in-line retailers, restaurants and a Container Store, and in Valley Plaza, we have in-line tenants that are signed and restaurants. We're in active tenant negotiations on an additional 5, so we are making very good progress on 9 of the 12 locations. Our properties are in demand by users like grocery, big box sporting-goods, theaters, restaurants and other entertainment venues. These types of tenants further curate the mall. Being located in the mall is an opportunity for them to reach a large trade area and generate new customers from traffic already at the shopping center. 
We have 460 full-service restaurants comprised of 3.6 million square feet in our portfolio. This is 7% of our total GLA and 13% of our sales. Just in the last 5 years, we have done 292 full-service restaurant deals for 2.1 million square feet. Further, 13% of our total GLA is big box, comprised of 195 big box tenants. Fifty five of those deals were made in the last 5 years. Those 55 deals are comprised of 12 Dave & Buster's, 4 Nordstrom Racks, 9 theaters, 9 Ultas, 14 big sporting-goods and 7 supermarkets, including the Wegmans that will open in the former JCPenney space at Natick in Boston. 
At 200 Lafayette in SoHo, New York City, PIRCH held its grand opening in May. PIRCH offers a unique experience when looking for kitchen and bath fixtures and I encourage you to visit their flagship store. We acquired the asset in 2014 for about $150 million. We leased the office space and sold the office portion for approximately $125 million last year. With the retail portion now stabilized, we are generating yield in the mid- to high-teens. At 730 Fifth Avenue, the Crown Building, we're pleased to welcome Zegna. We continue to see influx of retailers coming to the mall and demand from other retail concepts. For example, ModCloth recently opened in Pioneer Place in Portland, and new concepts like Country Club Prep, Peloton, Aesop, e.l.f. Cosmetics and Essentia, just to name a few, either have opened stores or will be opening stores soon in our portfolio. 
I'd like to update you on PacSun and Aéropostale. We have 71 PacSun locations in our portfolio. Off those 71, 6 will be vacating at the end of the year, 65 stores would be retained. We expect PacSun to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of September. Regarding Aéropostale, it is our expectation that the sales process will happen in the month of August. We believe Aéropostale will remain a viable entity going forward, although its footprint may be smaller than it is today. 
As a final note, we have been talking a lot about improving the customer experience at the mall. Parking lots at our malls are at capacity. Our customers tell us that parking is a common pain point within the shopping experience. We are very excited that the recent introduction of our new parking app at Oakbrook Center, Ridgedale Center, Alderwood Mall and Stonestown Galleria is up and operating.

I will start out with some brief comments on second quarter results, followed by details in the asset transactions, the impact on our full-year guidance.

I will start out with some brief comments on second quarter results, followed by details in the asset transactions, the impact on our full-year guidance. Finally, I will provide an update on our balance sheet activities before we open it up to questions. Before I begin, I want point out an error on Page 16 of the supplement. The occupancy cost ratios for the same-store retail properties should be 13.9% for the June 2016 quarter, and 13.2% for the June 2015 quarter. We apologize for the error. 
Moving on to the second quarter. Same-store permanent revenues were up 4.3% compared to the prior year, and as we noted, same-store NOI came in at $555 million, up 4% from last year. Net G&A for the quarter was a minus $43 million compared to minus $40 million in the prior year. The year-over-year change was due to some one-time financing fees that we received last year. The current quarter net G&A came in consistent with our expectation. 
EBITDA came in at $534 million, and overall, company FFO came in at a strong $0.35 per share, in line with our guidance. As noted in the press release, we closed on 2 asset sales during the quarter, 3 more asset sales subsequent to quarter end, these transactions total net proceeds of approximately $1 billion. We're using approximately $300 million of the proceeds to pay down mortgage debt. We noted both of those transactions in the press release. These 2 loans represent over half of our 2017 maturities, and we're also paying off $90 million outstanding [indiscernible].
At this point, we are retaining the remaining proceeds of approximately $600 million. Keep in mind, there are taxable gains associated with the asset sales, and depending on where our taxable income comes in at year-end, we currently expect to use approximately $250 million of the proceeds to pay out a special dividend of approximately $0.25 per share, subject to board approval. The timing, as we think of it now, would be around the same as our regular fourth quarter dividend. I want to go through the FFO dilution, the impact on '16, and then the impact on an annualized basis. For 2016, we lose about $20 million in FFO from the asset sales. Based on paying down the debt, we get back $7 million in interest savings, and we generate about a $1 million joint venture fee for the remainder of the year on the Fashion Show transaction. 
There's also one-time expense for costs to prepay assumed mortgages of $5.5 million that will impact the third quarter. The total impact for the year is $0.02 per share for 2016. On an annualized basis, looking forward, we lose approximately $52 million of FFO from the asset sales. We get back around $14 million in NOI interest expense savings from the debt paydown, and we will generate around full year $3 million fee on the newly formed Fashion Show joint venture. The full impact is approximately 3.5 per share. Our full-year guidance is now $1.51 to $1.55. The previous midpoint was $1.54. We're adjusting our guidance up $0.01 due to a positive view on operations. We then adjust for the $0.02 of dilution from the asset sales and our midpoint becomes $1.53. I do want to make note that the Fashion Show transaction will impact the full-year 2016 same-store NOI growth by about 20 to 25 basis points, taking our midpoint to around 4.25. Our outlook for second half floor operations continues to be strong. We have some tougher comps due to some one-time items in termination income and recovery in the prior year that may not repeat. Our same-store NOI growth outlook for the second half is therefore midpoint of 4%. 
Moving down to EBITDA. Our full-year outlook continues to be 8% to 9%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we now expect company FFO of around $1.465 billion and a share count of about $960 million. I thought I'd lay out a little bit for the third quarter and the fourth to help folks out in terms of what we're thinking. Guidance for the third quarter is $325 million to $345 million of FFO or $0.34 to $0.36 per share. There was around $6 million of net dilution from the asset sales, and the one-time prepayment penalty I noted in the third quarter for over $11 million impacting the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect FFO per share of $0.42 to $0.44, which includes $8 million of net dilution from the transactions noted in the press release. 
Moving on to the balance sheet for some perspective. Our total debt at the beginning of the year was almost $20 billion and our net debt to EBITDA in 2015 was around 9x. Given the transactions that have occurred this year and the planned debt paydown, we expect to be around $18.5 billion in total debt at the end of the year, a reduction of almost $1.5 billion. Based on our current plan, we expect to end the year with about $700 million to $800 million of cash, excluding the $250 million special dividend cash. That would get us to a 2016 end of year net debt to EBITDA just shy of 8x, and we expect to be in the mid-7s by the end of 2017, assuming no other transactions. 
And with that, let's open it up for questions."

We feel pretty comfortable to do, as I've mentioned in the past, $300 million to $500 million a year. Again, that pace could actually get accelerated, depending on the department store acquisitions that we can continue to make. And if you just rewind back to my comment, and I made an empathic point about being in the retail real estate business, and let me expand on that a little bit. And what I was trying to say before was, effectively, previously, we used to give away these department stores at say $1.5 to $2 a foot in our portfolio, and we didn't have the ability to add on retailers that traditionally don't go into the malls but have gone into the strip centers and power centers. And today, we are able to attract those retailers into the department store boxes in an accretive fashion, and are truly becoming very competitive to our strip center and power center brethren. And we're able to do deals in a highly competitive with -- so we are starting with all the infrastructure in place and a very low basis in your end, and the retailers are finding it attractive to come to the larger malls because we attract consumers from an 8- to 10-mile radius whereby if you're in the strip shopping center business, we are attracting people from 1.5- to 2-mile radius. So my point being that all of a sudden, we've gotten this new canvas and this canvas allows us to sort of layout our painting in an accretive fashion. And so I think that the pipeline could enhance itself with the quality of real estate we have as long as we continue to be able to have the opportunity to buy back department store boxes, if it arises. If it doesn't arise, we still feel that we can to $300 million to $500 million with the pipeline we have from now until 2019. And so we are happy either way. We're happy if the department stores start to perform incredibly well and do not sell their assets, it still gives us enough pipeline for the next few years, and should they decide to lower their footprint selectively in the quality of assets we have, we think that's accretive for us."

And when retail sales go up 3% to 4% a year, you know, over a 5-year period, they're going up 15% to 20%, and you've got 2% to 3% annual growth rate, which is what we have in our leases, at some stage your spreads are going to be 8% to 10%. And that business will give you a 3% growth rate of a business, and redevelopments give you 100 basis points and so you're a 4% to 5% EBITDA growth company. And that's what we've said we are and that's the business. And I think we feel pretty comfortable between our redevelopment, development, spreads, annual increases. We're going to be a 4% to 5% EBITDA growth company."

I mean please appreciate that square footage is multiple -- [indiscernible] multiple. I think if you appreciate, when you look at a supermarket retailer going into on $800 mall, they're building these massive food halls, which would be a modern-day foodcourt, which could do $15 million to $20 million in sales for eating within the mall and, of course, over and above, for take-home. That business is not available in the traditional shopping center. And I think as these supermarkets find that they need to attract more millennials, which are people who would either come and eat in this food hall environment, or are big into take-home, and that business is a higher-margin business for the supermarket businesses selling toilet paper and bounty, they're going to -- their demand for space is going to increase. More so, if you appreciate, they also want to modernize their desk facilities and it'll be easiest way to modernize their facilities and increase the sale area is move into a new location.
