This morning, Sysco reported a strong second quarter and a solid first half of the year. These results reflect the continuously improving execution of our portfolio of strategic initiatives by all of our associates. Further, our favorable performance over the past several quarters validates that our ongoing focus on improving our customer's experience with Sysco and increasing productivity in all aspects of our business are key to our future success. 
From an overall economic and industry perspective, calendar year fourth quarter U.S. fee and consumer confidence data was mixed as favorable unemployment trends and lower gas prices somewhat offset increased concern about near-term business conditions and global uncertainty. Most recently, the precipitous drop in multiple stock market indices bears watching as it relates to potential adverse ramifications for consumers and our customers. 
As far as the restaurant industry data is concerned, the overall trend remained reasonably positive amid sluggish consumer spending. According to the National Restaurant Association, December marked the 11th consecutive month of food service sales growth. This closes out a strong year for the industry where food service sales exceeded grocery store sales throughout the year. That said, both MPD and Knapp-Track have shown some resent modest declines in traffic trends that we are closely monitoring. 
With respect to product cost deflation, we saw an acceleration during the second quarter, driven by key center-of-the-plate categories such as meat, poultry and pork as well as dairy. This trend has continued into the third quarter. And we currently believe that deflation headwinds will persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year.
Now moving to our second quarter results. Total Broadline cases grew 3.4% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 0.6% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange headwinds of 1.7%. Gross profit dollars grew 3.4% and gross margin increased 50 basis points. Adjusted operating income for the quarter grew $41 million or 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 17%. And importantly, we had solid execution across the business, including U.S. Broadline. 
Reflecting on the first half of our fiscal 2016 performance, overall, our team executed well, and we are making good progress towards the achievement of our key financial objectives by focusing on the following 4 key levers: accelerating local case growth, improving gross margin, leveraging supply chain cost and reducing administrative cost. 
Specifically, we achieved the following during the first half of the year. Total Broadline local cases grew 2.8%. We grew gross profit by $121 million, expanded gross margin by 36 basis points and grew gross profit modestly faster than expenses. We grew adjusted operating income 4% or $38 million, and we grew adjusted earnings per share 7.5%.
As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we have strong momentum in the business. We do, however, need to continue effectively manage the persistent deflationary headwinds that likely will challenge our performance going forward. Further, we are aggressively reviewing all aspects of our business for incremental cost savings opportunities to improve our financial performance. 
At our Investor Day presentation last September, we laid out 3 key results that our 3-year strategic plan is targeting through 2018: improve our customer's experience at Sysco, enhance associated engagement and achieve our financial objectives of increasing operating income by at least $400 million, growing earnings per share faster than operating income and achieving a 15% return on invested capital. I remain confident that we are well positioned to achieve those goals and now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'm glad to be joining the call this morning with all of you.

I'm glad to be joining the call this morning with all of you. In my new role, I'm excited to bring our business operations, commercial functions and supply chain organizations together to drive improved execution and a seamless approach to serving our customers. This approach will better position Sysco to provide exceptional service and support to our customers and ultimately, improve our returns to our shareholders. 
I'd like to begin my remarks regarding the second quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've already begun to have an impact on our business results. As we have mentioned before, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts. Our improved processes and tools in this area are allowing us to leverage our very robust base of information to design a variety of initiative to improve the retention and penetration of our current customers as well as to accelerate the addition of new customers.
And while we have much work still to do, we're beginning to see positive results. For example, during the second quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.9%, including local case growth of 3%; gross profit dollar growth of 5.5%, including an improvement margin of 57 basis points; and operating income growth of about 9%, supported by solid operating expense performance.
From a geographic perspective, we saw solid year-over-year improvement in both cases and gross margin across the U.S., with specific strength in the Mideast, Southeast and the Pacific markets. This was somewhat offset by signs of growth slowing in our traditionally strong southwest market due to the impact of the downturn in the energy sector. 
One example how we are driving increased case growth is in the area of fresh and local products, where we're helping to educate our customers that we have significant capability to our Broadline operations and our specialty companies to bring fresh and local produce to the market. As an example of how we differentiate ourselves in this segment in order to grow cases, our Sysco quality assurance team has partnered with the Produce Marketing Association to deliver good agricultural practices workshops to more than 800 small farmers since 2011, helping prepare our small local growers to meet our food safety standards.
As you know, improving gross margin is one of the key drivers of Sysco achieving our 3-year target, and our strong performance this quarter indicates we are making progress toward achieving our long-term objectives. To that point, I am pleased with how well we have managed the current deflationary environment, which has certainly slowed sales dollar growth. 
Our ability to manage this environment well is due in part to an increased focus on Sysco Brand and our category management efforts where we are able to use our purchasing scale, along with a more transparent process with our supplier partners to achieve our goals. We continue to see a variety of benefits for our customers, suppliers and Sysco as category management has become a standard part of how we now operate our business.
There are other areas that we know are improving our overall customers' experience of doing business with Sysco as well, including the way we're improving the service and support they're experiencing through our technology solutions. 
Our mobile order entry platforms, which has been piloted with customers for the past few quarters, has shown strong adoption rate with both customers and our marketing associates. Now that the pilots have been completed, we are in the process of fully deploying this ordering solution across the enterprise. Additionally, we soon expect to begin pilots for the next phase of our digital e-commerce platform, which will bring additional capability, tools and information critical to our customers to help them better run their business.
Finally, from a supply chain perspective, we have made solid progress toward our goal to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. As mentioned earlier, while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are targeting continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year.
There are just a few -- these are just a few of the key priorities that are starting to impact our operational and financial results. And while we have much work to do, I'm confident we're on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives. 
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarters teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."
189096,309043589,924067,"Sysco Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, especially in light of the increased deflation and continued currency headwinds. We also continued to make some solid early progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year go",1112,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, especially in light of the increased deflation and continued currency headwinds. We also continued to make some solid early progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year goals.
We grew sales in the second quarter by approximately 1% year-over-year, despite going from inflation of 6% in the second quarter of last year to deflation of 1% this year, including deflation of nearly 2% in U.S. Broadline. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories as supply recovers from various events in 2015. However, as Tom mentioned, we are managing this environment well, including improved processes and programs such as category management that have helped to lessen the impact of deflation.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.7%, with the U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar responsible for the vast majority of the impact. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 2.2%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the second quarter was 3.4% and local was 2.9%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins. We grew our gross profit at a solid 3.4% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 50 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement includes category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher [indiscernible] brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.
Adjusted operating expenses grew 1.8% during the quarter and by 3.5% [ph] on a constant currency basis. The increase is mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and planned investments in business technology. This increase in expense is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spend, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our cost per case in U.S. Broadline, which is down $0.01 from the prior year.
Also note, while we experienced a relatively minor amount of certain items related to restructuring during the second quarter, we do expect to experience additional restructuring charges related to our 3-year plan over the next few quarters. 
As you know, a key part of our plan is to effectively manage the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. We achieved that objective during the second quarter, and as a result, grew adjusted operating income by 10.2% compared to the prior year and 11.6% on a constant currency basis. 
As it relates to taxes, at mid-January at an investor conference, we disclosed a $21 million benefit to income tax expense as a result of the favorable resolution of some international tax contingencies. This had the same impact on both our GAAP and adjusted tax rates, reducing both to around 31%. As a result and as mentioned during that webcast, we recorded a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share during the second quarter.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 12.6% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.1% and 19.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher operating income and reduced tax rates. A previously mentioned tax benefit increased earnings per share by $0.03. The share count decrease of 24.5 million shares related to the accelerated share repurchase program positively impacted earnings per share in the second quarter by approximately $0.02 versus the prior year. 
At the beginning of the second quarter, we executed the accelerated share repurchase program and therefore received the benefit from that repurchase for the entire quarter. Also note that we resumed our ongoing practice of buying back shares to offset dilution during the last few weeks of December. 
Cash flow from operations was $469 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016, up roughly 4% from last year. Working capital was a use of cash during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016 as it was during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2015. The first half of the fiscal year typically requires a seasonal net investment in working capital that has been reduced during the second half of the fiscal year. Year-over-year, the comparison is favorable as we invested $143 million less cash in working capital during the first half of fiscal 2016 than we did in the first half of fiscal 2015. Net CapEx for the first 26 weeks was $237 million and free cash flow was $231 million.
Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $264 million in fiscal 2016 and $102 million in fiscal 2015. The certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods and from 2015 include items related to the proposed merger itself. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew by $179 million and free cash flow grew $237 million.
Now I would like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2016 plan. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparison this year more challenging. Fourth, we now expect CapEx to be near the lower end of the previously stated $550 million to $600 million range. Finally, we expect a normalized tax rate of 36% to 37% over the remaining 26 weeks. 
In summary, we had a strong quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve our fiscal 2016 financial objectives and our 3-year plan, including effectively managing deflation over the near term and increasing our focus on expenses. 
We continue to aggressively review every part of the company, looking for ways to reduce costs. Additionally, we have put in place a more rigorous process for managing expenses, including how we prioritize spending and focus investment on areas of projects that improve our ability to serve the customer better. And finally, we took advantage of continued lower fuel prices to increase the amount of fuel we locked in over the next 12 months.
I feel good about our ability to achieve the first year target of our 3-year plan, and we're working hard to be as aggressive as possible in identify incremental opportunities to exceed our Investor Day targets. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

We've historically been able to take share year in and year out, and we do that both on the local side of the business as well as the corporate side of the business. So yes, I would expect we will continue to take share. Obviously, what Joel referred to in his comments is we're trying to do that in a more disciplined way as we go forward here so that we give more of flow-through to the bottom line. The way I look at the local case growth is I talked about the lever of accelerating local case growth. The context there is we've had, I think, 7 quarters in a row now of local case growth, and the last few have been around 2% or more. So that lever is relative to where we were the last 2 or 3, 4 years as we were going through a lot of our change and some pretty tough macroeconomics. So that 2% to 3% range, I think, is what we're targeting. I think there's going to be some quarters where we're at the lower end of that range, somewhere at the higher end of the range. I think 2% or 3% is very solid growth if you look at what the forecasts are for the industry. But I'll let Tom speak to generally where it's coming from."

So we see good performance coming out of them from a variety of areas and believe we'll continue to see that kind of growth."

So a couple of comments on that. Number one, the way I think about those types of costs, and I think we've talked about this at other places, we think about it from the standpoint of processes, from people, from technologies, from the types of investments that we put into our company again in terms of how we think about prioritizing items. So in other words, one of the key things I called out in here is the ability to really prioritize and then focus on those spends that are going to drive the again, ultimately what's better for our customers. And so I think the -- some of the things that we've put in place, for example, are different committees to review and focus on technology spend, for example, in ways to have again a very tight process and making sure that we're focused in those projects that drive the best results primarily and focused on the customers. So I would say -- I mean, again, there's a lot of rigor around that. And in terms of your second part of your question, all I could really say to that, I think, is that we certainly will continue to focus on driving that, certainly with the deflation we're experiencing and the fact that our gross profit dollars are harder to come by. That increased focus on expenses is important. And so I can as I mentioned in, I think, in my script, that's certainly an area we're going to continue to focus on and certainly look to drive incremental improvements over and above our targets."

So while those investments have been made over the last several years to create this path to transformation that we feel the company needs to go through, in which we're pretty far down the road on. What you're seeing today and what you've seen the last few quarters is we're beginning to get the benefits of a lot of those investments. So I would expect that the trajectory in that expense as a happens will flatten out. To Joel's point, we'll continue to get better and better at sequencing and prioritizing spend relative to customer needs and relative to what we need to deliver for our shareholders. And I'd say the one last opportunity we have particularly in the field is to be just more consistent in our execution, and we still see plenty of opportunity there. So again, historically, we've done a good job. What we're really telling here is we think there's opportunity both operationally as well as on the corporate side."

But what we're saying is we saw a pickup from the first quarter to the second quarter. We're seeing some similar trends here in January, and we kind of felt mathematically that will begin -- we began to see this, if you'll recall, back in March and in the fourth quarter of last year's when the inflation fell. So we thought just from a perspective that we would see a little more -- a little less deflation as we got into the second half of the fiscal year. And I would say what we're telling you today is it's still there. And we probably will expect to see it at least through the end of the quarter. It affects you different ways obviously. On the positive side, generally when our costs go down, we're able to pass that along to our customers and that's good for them, especially as they're dealing with some of their labor challenges. Your percentages look better so certainly, it contributed to the gross margin expansion. But the reality is it's not a great environment because you end up with fewer dollars to pay your expenses with. So to Joel's other point, when you have this level of deflation, it just reinforces the importance of managing our expenses very tightly."

So just sequentially, they grew better even as sales got worse because of accelerated deflation. So I've heard the explanations around mix and so forth, but at least from my view, it looks like the deflation is at least kind of benign or I mean, I know it becomes a headwind. But is there some element of sticky pricing where inflation was increasing in the last 3 years, it's tough for distributors to pass that through all at once? And is there some element where, to some degree, it doesn't have to come down quite as fast or is -- do you think everybody's just chasing the business and passing it through right away?"

Look, I think as I said, I believe the deflation, as you look at gross margin, i.e. the percent of sales, is clearly helping. However, as we've said very consistently over the years, it's not an ideal environment to be in. If you look at this business historically, our customers generally are able to pass along a couple of points of inflation to their consumers year in and year out and they generally do. So to one of your points, what you're seeing here a little bit is some of the recovery what we gave up when we were dealing with 5 to 6 points of inflation, you can only pass along so much of that so quickly, and it's only appropriate to pass along so much so quickly. So when you have some deflationary trends, mathematically, it helps you a little bit. Perhaps there are situations where you can bring your prices down a little slower, but ultimately, it's an incredibly competitive environment, so we are out to compete in that business everyday and we want to do right by our customers, so I wouldn't put a lot of weight on that. I just think we're doing a very good job managing it. I've seen different cycles of deflation here over the last -- I don't know how many years but a lot of years, and this is, by far and away, the best we've ever managed it. And I think it goes back to what Tom covered and I'll let him speak again. We are actively -- we've been working on several commercial initiatives here for the last 2, 3, 4 years, whether it's segmentation, back to basics, revenue management, category management. These are all things that are allowing us to be more laserlike in terms of how we work with our customers and bring more consistency to our pricing. There's more to do there but -- so I would just say I think we're actually managing it quite well."

I think when I talked about that first quarter, that's when we really talked more about U.S. Broadline than we had in the past. I wanted you and the other investors to understand the quality of the underlying quarter. I think part of what we're seeing, and we've done some work on this, is the trajectory of the corporate spend coming out of last year and coming out of the proposed merger that ultimately was terminated, we still had some -- and we still do. We still have some trajectory of our corporate in particular on the technology side, in particular some of the areas that Tom's speaking to the -- with the digital and mobile platform. So those comparisons were not quite as tough in the second quarter as they were in the first so our corporate expense increase was a little bit less acute. We've got a little more margin improvement as you can see on the gross margin side. Even though we did see more deflation. Perhaps that helped us a little bit in the short term, but we also managed, I think, a little bit better. And you saw better cost management, I think, operationally as well. We are right around that flat cost per piece. Fuel helped us a little bit there but -- so I just think every little bit better and I just think this quarter is somewhat more reflective of really the quality of the earnings that we've seen. Now look, what I would to -- encourage you to do is look at the first half I spoke to, and what I see there is I see 4% operating income with improving trends. And that's kind of how we're looking at it. So we think we're in a good place for the first year piece of our 3-year goal. Joel can speak to that, but I think we talked about hitting 20% to 30% of our goal here in the first year. And we've got more work to do to hit or exceed the rest of that goal, both as it relates to continuing to address the deflation, in particular, grow those cases locally the way we are and have been. But we've got some more work to do on the expense side as well and you've heard us allude to that here. So I wouldn't quite call it an inflection point, but I would call it a validation of what I talked about in the first quarter."

We've announced our intention to -- we've done the $1.5 billion that needs to be sold as Joel said, and today, it would still be our intention to do the remainder of the program next year. So if things were to change, we'll let you know but right now, that's still our intention. I would just reiterate though, going back to the first part of your question, we're always looking to invest in our business and will continue to do that in a way that supports of the disciplined growth that we talked about. Must a growing dividend continuously to be very important and will continue to look for good solid strategic acquisitions. So we're looking at all 4 of those opportunities but sitting here today, 2 hours into this thing, I think we haven't changed any plans."

Was it broad based or maybe there's a retail, more national players that you're taking that share from?"

And so if I were to conjecture here, which is a dangerous thing and calls like this, my sense is that some of the better operator larger folks are taking share and may be coming from some of the smaller players. But the bottom line think in this business is that operators are going to take share. Large, small, good restaurant operators are going to continue to grow and do well corporate owned. And so I think our overall point of view would be the competitive environment remains very acute, remains very similar to what we've seen the last 2 or 3 years and the best operators both in terms of the customer base as well as on the distribution side are going to do the best."

This morning, Sysco reported a strong second quarter and a solid first half of the year. These results reflect the continuously improving execution of our portfolio of strategic initiatives by all of our associates. Further, our favorable performance over the past several quarters validates that our ongoing focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco and increasing productivity in all aspects of our business are key to our future success. 
From an overall economic and industry perspective, calendar year fourth quarter U.S. GDP and consumer confidence data was mixed as favorable unemployment trends and lower gas prices somewhat offset increased concern about near-term business conditions and global uncertainty. Most recently, the precipitous drop in multiple stock market indices bears watching as it relates to potential adverse ramifications for consumers and our customers. 
As far as the restaurant industry data is concerned, the overall trend remained reasonably positive amid sluggish consumer spending. According to the National Restaurant Association, December marked the 11th consecutive month of food service sales growth. This closes out a strong year for the industry where food service sales exceeded grocery store sales throughout the year. That said, both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK have shown some recent modest declines in traffic trends that we are closely monitoring. 
With respect to product cost deflation, we saw an acceleration during the second quarter, driven by key center-of-the-plate categories such as meat, poultry and pork as well as dairy. This trend has continued into the third quarter. And we currently believe that deflation headwinds will persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year.
Now moving to our second quarter results. Total Broadline cases grew 3.4% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 0.6% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange headwinds of 1.7%. Gross profit dollars grew 3.4% and gross margin increased 50 basis points. Adjusted operating income for the quarter grew $41 million or 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 17%. And importantly, we had solid execution across the business, including U.S. Broadline. 
Reflecting on the first half of our fiscal 2016 performance, overall, our team executed well, and we are making good progress towards the achievement of our key financial objectives by focusing on the following 4 key levers: accelerating local case growth, improving gross margin, leveraging supply chain cost and reducing administrative costs. 
Specifically, we achieved the following during the first half of the year. Total Broadline local cases grew 2.8%. We grew gross profit by $121 million, expanded gross margin by 36 basis points and grew gross profit modestly faster than expenses. We grew adjusted operating income 4% or $38 million, and we grew adjusted earnings per share of 7.5%.
As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we have strong momentum in the business. We do, however, need to continue to effectively manage the persistent deflationary headwinds that likely will challenge our performance going forward. Further, we are aggressively reviewing all aspects of our business for incremental cost savings opportunities to improve our financial performance. 
At our Investor Day presentation last September, we laid out 3 key results that our 3-year strategic plan is targeting through 2018: improve our customers' experience with Sysco, enhance associated engagement and achieve our financial objectives of increasing operating income by at least $400 million, growing earnings per share faster than operating income and achieving a 15% return on invested capital. I remain confident that we are well positioned to achieve those goals, and now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'm glad to be joining the call this morning with all of you. In my new role, I'm excited to bring our business operations, commercial functions and supply chain organizations together to drive improved execution and a seamless approach to serving our customers. This approach will better position Sysco to provide exceptional service and support to our customers and ultimately, improve our returns to our shareholders. 
I'd like to begin my remarks regarding the second quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've already begun to have an impact on our business results. As we have mentioned before, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts. Our improved processes and tools in this area are allowing us to leverage our very robust base of information to design a variety of initiatives to improve the retention and penetration of our current customers as well as to accelerate the addition of new customers.
And while we have much work still to do, we're beginning to see positive results. For example, during the second quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.9%, including local case growth of 3%; gross profit dollar growth of 5.5%, including an improvement margin of 57 basis points; and operating income growth of about 9%, supported by solid operating expense performance.
From a geographic perspective, we saw solid year-over-year improvement in both cases and gross margin across the U.S., with specific strength in the Mideast, Southeast and the Pacific markets. This was somewhat offset by signs of growth slowing in our traditionally strong southwest market due to the impact of the downturn in the energy sector. 
One example how we are driving increased case growth is in the area of fresh and local products, where we're helping to educate our customers that we have significant capability to our Broadline operations and our specialty companies to bring fresh and local produce to the market. As an example of how we differentiate ourselves in this segment in order to grow cases, our Sysco quality assurance team has partnered with the Produce Marketing Association to deliver good agricultural practices workshops to more than 800 small farmers since 2011, helping prepare our small local growers to meet our food safety standards.
As you know, improving gross margin is one of the key drivers of Sysco achieving our 3-year targets, and our strong performance this quarter indicates we are making progress toward achieving our long-term objectives. To that point, I am pleased with how well we have managed the current deflationary environment, which has certainly slowed sales dollar growth. 
Our ability to manage this environment well is due in part to an increased focus on Sysco Brand and our category management efforts where we are able to use our purchasing scale, along with a more transparent process with our supplier partners to achieve our goals. We continue to see a variety of benefits for our customers, suppliers and Sysco as category management has become a standard part of how we now operate our business.
There are other areas that we know are improving our overall customers' experience of doing business with Sysco as well, including the way we're improving the service and support they're experiencing through our technology solutions. 
Our mobile order entry platform, which has been in pilot with customers for the past few quarters, has shown strong adoption rate with both customers and our marketing associates. Now that the pilots have been completed, we are in the process of fully deploying this ordering solution across the enterprise. Additionally, we soon expect to begin pilots for the next phase of our digital e-commerce platform, which will bring additional capability, tools and information critical to our customers to help them better run their business.
Finally, from a supply chain perspective, we have made solid progress toward our goal to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. As mentioned earlier, while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are targeting continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year.
There are just a few -- these are just a few of the key priorities that are starting to impact our operational and financial results. And while we have much work to do, I'm confident we're on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives. 
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarter's teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."
189096,309043589,924155,"Sysco Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, especially in light of the increased deflation and continued currency headwinds. We also continued to make some solid early progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year go",1111,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, especially in light of the increased deflation and continued currency headwinds. We also continued to make some solid early progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year goals.
We grew sales in the second quarter by approximately 1% year-over-year, despite going from inflation of 6% in the second quarter of last year to deflation of 1% this year, including deflation of nearly 2% in U.S. Broadline. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories as supply recovers from various events in 2015. However, as Tom mentioned, we are managing this environment well, including improved processes and programs such as category management that have helped to lessen the impacts of deflation.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.7%, with the U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar responsible for the vast majority of the impact. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 2.2%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the second quarter was 3.4% and local was 2.9%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins. We grew our gross profit at a solid 3.4% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 50 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement includes category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.
Adjusted operating expenses grew 1.8% during the quarter and by 3.5% on a constant currency basis. The increase is mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and planned investments in business technology. This increase in expense is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spend, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our cost per case in U.S. Broadline, which is down $0.01 from the prior year.
Also note, while we experienced a relatively minor amount of certain items related to restructuring during the second quarter, we do expect to experience additional restructuring charges related to our 3-year plan over the next few quarters. 
As you know, a key part of our plan is to effectively manage the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. We achieved that objective during the second quarter, and as a result, grew adjusted operating income by 10.2% compared to the prior year and 11.6% on a constant currency basis. 
As it relates to taxes, at mid-January at an investor conference, we disclosed a $21 million benefit to income tax expense as a result of the favorable resolution of some international tax contingencies. This had the same impact on both our GAAP and adjusted tax rates, reducing both to around 31%. As a result and as mentioned during that webcast, we recorded a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share during the second quarter.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 12.6% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.1% and 19.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher operating income and reduced tax rates. The previously mentioned tax benefit increased earnings per share by $0.03. The share count decrease of 24.5 million shares related to the accelerated share repurchase program positively impacted earnings per share in the second quarter by approximately $0.02 versus the prior year. 
At the beginning of the second quarter, we executed the accelerated share repurchase program and therefore received the benefit from that repurchase for the entire quarter. Also note that we resumed our ongoing practice of buying back shares to offset dilution during the last few weeks of December. 
Cash flow from operations was $469 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016, up roughly 4% from last year. Working capital was a use of cash during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016 as it was during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2015. The first half of the fiscal year typically requires a seasonal net investment in working capital that has been reduced during the second half of the fiscal year. Year-over-year, the comparison is favorable as we invested $143 million less cash in working capital during the first half of fiscal 2016 than we did in the first half of fiscal 2015. Net CapEx for the first 26 weeks was $237 million and free cash flow was $231 million.
Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $264 million in fiscal 2016 and $102 million in fiscal 2015. The certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods and from 2015 include items related to the proposed merger itself. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew by $179 million and free cash flow grew $237 million.
Now I would like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2016 plan. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparison this year more challenging. Fourth, we now expect CapEx to be near the lower end of the previously stated $550 million to $600 million range. Finally, we expect a normalized tax rate of 36% to 37% over the remaining 26 weeks. 
In summary, we had a strong quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve our fiscal 2016 financial objectives and our 3-year plan, including effectively managing deflation over the near term and increasing our focus on expenses. 
We continue to aggressively review every part of the company, looking for ways to reduce costs. Additionally, we have put in place a more rigorous process for managing expenses, including how we prioritize spending and focus investment on areas of projects that improve our ability to serve the customer better. And finally, we took advantage of continued lower fuel prices to increase the amount of fuel we locked in over the next 12 months.
I feel good about our ability to achieve the first year target of our 3-year plan, and we're working hard to be as aggressive as possible in identifying incremental opportunities to exceed our Investor Day targets. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

So yes, I would expect that we would continue to take share. Obviously, what Joel referred to in his comments is we're trying to do that in a more disciplined way as we go forward here so that we give more of flow-through to the bottom line. The way I look at the local case growth is -- I talked about the lever of accelerating local case growth. The context there is we've had, I think, 7 quarters in a row now of local case growth, and the last few have been right around 2% or more. So that lever is relative to where we were the last 2 or 3, 4 years as we were going through a lot of our change and some pretty tough macroeconomics. So that 2% to 3% range, I think, is what we're targeting. I think there's going to be some quarters where we're at the lower end of that range, it will be somewhere at the higher end of the range. I think 2% or 3% is very solid growth if you look at what the forecasts are for the industry. But I'll let Tom speak to generally where it's coming from."

So a couple of comments on that. Number one, the way I think about those types of costs, and I think we've talked about this at other places, we think about it from the standpoint of processes, of -- from people, from technologies, from the types of investments that we put into our company again in terms of how we think about prioritizing items. So in other words, one of the key things I called out in here is the ability to really prioritize and then focus on those spends that are going to drive the -- again, ultimately what's better for our customers. And so I think the -- some of the things that we've put in place, for example, are different committees to review and focus on technology spend, for example, in ways to have again a very tight process for making sure that we're focused in those projects that drive the best results primarily and focused on the customers. So I would say -- I mean, again, there's a lot of rigor around that. And in terms of your second part of your question, all I could really say to that, I think, is that we certainly will continue to focus on driving that, certainly with the deflation we're experiencing and the fact that our gross profit dollars are harder to come by. That increased focus on expenses is important. And so again as I mentioned in, I think, in my script, that's certainly an area we're going to continue to focus on and certainly look to drive incremental improvements over and above our targets."

Now over the last 3, 4, 5 years, we've invested a lot in particular on the corporate side, technology, processes, as Joel mentioned, commercial activities beginning-to-end supply chain. So while those investments have been made over the last several years to create this path of transformation that we feel the company needs to go through, in which we're pretty far down the road on. What you're seeing today and what you've seen the last few quarters is we're beginning to get the benefits of a lot of those investments. So I would expect that the trajectory of that expense as it's already happened will flatten out. To Joel's point, we'll continue to get better and better at sequencing and prioritizing spend relative to customer needs and relative to what we need to deliver for our shareholders. And I'd say the one last opportunity we have particularly in the field is to be just more consistent in our execution, and we still see plenty of opportunity there. So again, historically, we've done a good job, but what we're really telling you here is we think there's opportunity both operationally as well as on the corporate side."

I don't know that there was a big sequential impact and a lot of variability around the sequential impact as the quarter progressed. But what we're saying is we saw a pickup from the first quarter to the second quarter. We're seeing some similar trends here in January, and we kind of felt mathematically that will begin to wrap. We began to see this, if you'll recall, back in March and then the fourth quarter of last year's when the inflation fell. So we thought just from a wrapping perspective that we would see a little more -- a little less deflation as we got into the second half of the fiscal year. And I would say what we're telling you today is it's still there. And we probably will expect to see it at least through the end of the quarter. It affects you in different ways obviously. On the positive side, generally when our costs go down, we're able to pass that along to our customers and that's good for them, especially as they're dealing with some of their labor challenges. It -- your percentages look better, so certainly it contributed to the gross margin expansion. But the reality is it's not a great environment because you end up with fewer dollars to pay your expenses with. So to Joel's other point, when you have this level of deflation, it just reinforces the importance of managing our expenses very tightly."

And so we're going to be expanding it now the rest of the country and more of a full deployment. We continue to see improved usage of the tool, but I'd say today, we're still in the low probably 9%, 8%, 9% of the orders going through that process. But we're seeing it basically double-digit improvement of each quarter as we roll this. So the feedback's been very positive both from our own associates who also use the tool and from our customers.

Look, I think as I said, I believe the deflation, as you look at gross margin, i.e., the percent of sales, is clearly helping. However, as we've said very consistently over the years, it's not an ideal environment to be in. If you look at this business historically, our customers generally are able to pass along a couple of points of inflation to their consumers year in and year out and they generally do. So to one of your points, what you're seeing here a little bit is some of the recovery what we gave up when we were dealing with 5 to 6 points of inflation, you can only pass along so much of that so quickly, and it's only appropriate to pass along so much of that so quickly. So when you have some deflationary trends, mathematically, it helps you a little bit. Perhaps there are situations where you can bring your prices down a little slower, but ultimately, it's an incredibly competitive environment, so we are out to compete for that business every day and we want to do right by our customers, so I wouldn't put a lot of weight on that. I just think we're doing a very good job managing it. I've seen different cycles of deflation here over the last -- I don't know how many years but a lot of years, and this is, by far and away, the best we've ever managed it. And I think it goes back to what Tom covered, but I'll let him speak again. We are actively -- we've been working on several commercial initiatives here for the last 2, 3, 4 years, whether it's segmentation, back to basics, revenue management, category management. These are all things that are allowing us to be more laser-like in terms of how we work with our customers and bring more consistency to our pricing. There's more to do there but -- so I would just say I think we're actually managing it quite well."

We got a little bit more out of it this quarter than we did in the first quarter. I think when I talked about that first quarter and we -- that's when we really talked more about U.S. Broadline than we had in the past. I wanted you and the other investors to understand the quality of the underlying quarter. I think part of what we're seeing, and we've done some work on this, is the trajectory of the corporate spend coming out of last year, coming out of the proposed merger that ultimately was terminated, we still had some -- and we still do. We still have some trajectory of our spend here, corporate in particular, on the technology side, in particular in some of the areas that Tom's speaking to over the -- with the digital and mobile platform. So those comparisons were not quite as tough in the second quarter as they were in the first, so our corporate expense increase was a little bit less acute. We've got a little more margin improvement, as you can see on the gross margin side, even though we did see more deflation and that -- perhaps that helped us a little bit in the short term, but we also managed that, I think, a little bit better. And you saw better cost management, I think, operationally as well. We're right around that flat cost per piece. So fuel helped us a little bit there but -- so I just think everything got a little bit better, and I just think this quarter is somewhat more reflective of really the quality of the earnings that we've seen. Now look, what I would encourage you to do is look at the first half I spoke to, and what I see there is I see 4% operating income with improving trends. And that's kind of how we're looking at it. So we think we're in a good place for the first year piece of our 3-year goal. Joel can speak to that, but I think we talked about hitting 20% to 30% of our goal here in the first year. And we've got more work to do to hit or exceed the rest of that goal, both as it relates to continuing to address the deflation, in particular, grow those cases locally the way we are and have been. But we've got some more work to do on the expense side as well, and you've heard us allude to that here. So I wouldn't quite call it an inflection point, but I would call it a validation of what I talked about in the first quarter."

I think on the gross profit, look, deflation's a very challenging environment to manage in terms of growing your gross profit dollars, and I just think we're doing a better job there for the reasons that Tom's taking you through. But the reality is we grew it 3.4%, which is not 4%. Tom -- Joel's point, it was better than that when you adjust for currency.

The first part on the CapEx, I don't know that I'd really think about it as something we're cutting back on. I think the way I would just say it is, we target our CapEx spend as not based on some fixed number that we need to achieve or not achieve. But it's really truly driven by the needs of the business. And so I think the way I would just think about is that, as we've kind of talked about it before, we have a pretty rigorous process in terms of identifying and prioritizing our capital spending needs. And I would just say it is the way that the way we look at this required spend this year for what our business is needing just happens to fall near the lower end of that range. So again, I don't necessarily look at our target as something that we sort of we have to achieve or some number we have to get to. It's just based on the needs of our business and the ability to flex as it relates to that. And then the second -- Bill, if you want to add anything to that?"

So I'd say, are we getting everything we can? I think we feel pretty good about where we're at today. We feel like certainly, we're not out of runway, but I think the more we can continue to focus on quality products, bringing innovation to those items and making sure that we keep them in front of our customers, and we use -- I think we talked about at the Investor Day the business review process that we use. It's a great way for us to actually do cuttings of our products, allowing them to see Sysco Brand and compare to something else they might be using, and it's how we spend -- a lot of that time is to help those customers see the value that's there and the opportunity that they have to improve their overall profitability by using their brand."

But I think if you look at it secularly and go back 2 or 3 years, we're in a better place, so that's a positive. It's still an incredibly and acutely competitive world out there, so we need to be very responsive to that. And I would just echo what I've been trying to articulate here over the last 2 or 3 years, but in particular, the last several months post the merger termination: we're extremely well-positioned today because of all the work that we've done over the last 2, 3, 4 years on the commercial side to compete effectively, do the right thing by our customers but also grow in a disciplined way, as Joel talks about, and manage our margins.

But my question was, your suppliers that deliver food to you, how much fuel savings may be -- was embedded over the past couple of quarters and what you anticipate over the next couple of quarters, just that their delivery costs are less to you, and therefore, you are price of -- your price of product could be lower and that could actually be helping your cost of goods sold if you thought about it in that way."

It's a little harder, and we really don't get into that level of detail in terms of our components of our cost of goods. But let me say it this way. Lower fuel is good, okay? It's generally good for multiple reasons. One, is it gets -- on the margin generally, people. It gives them more discretionary income and they'll spend it -- historically, spend it more going out to eat. Now, I will say this. We really hadn't seen a lot of that until perhaps lately, and we don't have a lot of hard data on that, so the most powerful thing on the field is, if you extend it, it translates to greater discretionary income, and the consumer uses it to go out to eat. That's a good thing for us. Haven't seen quite as much of that, but we're hopeful that we'll see more. But then, you're absolutely right, it helps us on the cost of goods and to Joel's point, it helps us on the outbound. We kind of weight average the outbound. So it's definitely a modest tailwind, and we're taking advantage of it, and hopefully it will stay that way."

This morning, Sysco reported a strong second quarter and a solid first half of the year. These results reflect the continuously improving execution of our portfolio of strategic initiatives by all of our associates. Further, our favorable performance over the past several quarters validates that our ongoing focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco and increasing productivity in all aspects of our business are key to our future success. 
From an overall economic and industry perspective, calendar year fourth quarter U.S. GDP and consumer confidence data was mixed as favorable unemployment trends and lower gas prices somewhat offset increased concern about near-term business conditions and global uncertainty. Most recently, the precipitous drop in multiple stock market indices bears watching as it relates to potential adverse ramifications for consumers and our customers. 
As far as the restaurant industry data is concerned, the overall trend remained reasonably positive amid sluggish consumer spending. According to the National Restaurant Association, December marked the 11th consecutive month of food service sales growth. This closes out a strong year for the industry where food service sales exceeded grocery store sales throughout the year. That said, both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK have shown some recent modest declines in traffic trends that we are closely monitoring. 
With respect to product cost deflation, we saw an acceleration during the second quarter, driven by key center-of-the-plate categories such as meat, poultry and pork as well as dairy. This trend has continued into the third quarter. And we currently believe that deflation headwinds will persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year.
Now moving to our second quarter results. Total Broadline cases grew 3.4% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 0.6% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange headwinds of 1.7%. Gross profit dollars grew 3.4% and gross margin increased 50 basis points. Adjusted operating income for the quarter grew $41 million or 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 17%. And importantly, we had solid execution across the business, including U.S. Broadline. 
Reflecting on the first half of our fiscal 2016 performance, overall, our team executed well, and we are making good progress towards the achievement of our key financial objectives by focusing on the following 4 key levers: accelerating local case growth; improving gross margin; leveraging supply chain cost and reducing administrative costs. 
Specifically, we achieved the following during the first half of the year. Total Broadline local cases grew 2.8%. We grew gross profit by $121 million, expanded gross margin by 36 basis points and grew gross profit modestly faster than expenses. We grew adjusted operating income 4% or $38 million, and we grew adjusted earnings per share of 7.5%.
As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we have strong momentum in the business. We do, however, need to continue to effectively manage the persistent deflationary headwinds that likely will challenge our performance going forward. Further, we are aggressively reviewing all aspects of our business for incremental cost savings opportunities to improve our financial performance. 
At our Investor Day presentation last September, we laid out 3 key results that our 3-year strategic plan is targeting through 2018: improve our customers' experience with Sysco, enhance associated engagement and achieve our financial objectives of increasing operating income by at least $400 million, growing earnings per share faster than operating income and achieving a 15% return on invested capital. I remain confident that we are well positioned to achieve those goals, and now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'm glad to be joining the call this morning with all of you. In my new role, I'm excited to bring our business operations, commercial functions and supply chain organizations together to drive improved execution and a seamless approach to serving our customers. This approach will better position Sysco to provide exceptional service and support to our customers and ultimately, improve our returns to our shareholders. 
I'd like to begin my remarks regarding the second quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've already begun to have an impact on our business results. As we have mentioned before, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts. Our improved processes and tools in this area are allowing us to leverage our very robust base of information to design a variety of initiatives to improve the retention and penetration of our current customers as well as to accelerate the addition of new customers.
And while we have much work still to do, we're beginning to see positive results. For example, during the second quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.9%, including local case growth of 3%; gross profit dollar growth of 5.5%, including an improvement margin of 57 basis points and operating income growth of about 9%, supported by solid operating expense performance.
From a geographic perspective, we saw solid year-over-year improvement in both cases and gross margin across the U.S., with specific strength in the Mideast, Southeast and the Pacific markets. This was somewhat offset by signs of growth slowing in our traditionally strong Southwest market due to the impact of the downturn in the energy sector. 
One of example how we are driving increased case growth is in the area of fresh and local products, where we're helping to educate our customers that we have significant capability through our Broadline operations and our specialty companies to bring fresh and local produce to the market. As an example of how we differentiate ourselves in this segment in order to grow cases, our Sysco quality assurance team has partnered with the Produce Marketing Association to deliver good agricultural practices workshops to more than 800 small farmers since 2011, helping prepare our small local growers to meet our food safety standards.
As you know, improving gross margin is one of the key drivers of Sysco achieving our 3-year targets, and our strong performance this quarter indicates we are making progress toward achieving our long-term objectives. To that point, I am pleased with how well we have managed the current deflationary environment, which has certainly slowed sales dollar growth. 
Our ability to manage this environment well is due in part to an increased focus on Sysco Brand and our category management efforts where we are able to use our purchasing scale, along with a more transparent process with our supplier partners to achieve our goals. We continue to see a variety of benefits for our customers, suppliers and Sysco as category management has become a standard part of how we now operate our business.
There are other areas that we know are improving our overall customers' experience of doing business with Sysco as well, including the way we're improving the service and support they're experiencing through our technology solutions. 
Our mobile order entry platform, which has been in pilot with customers for the past few quarters, has shown strong adoption rate with both customers and our marketing associates. Now that the pilots have been completed, we are in the process of fully deploying this ordering solution across the enterprise. Additionally, we soon expect to begin pilots for the next phase of our digital e-commerce platform, which will bring additional capability, tools and information critical to our customers to help them better run their business.
Finally, from a supply chain perspective, we have made solid progress toward our goal to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. As mentioned earlier, while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are targeting continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year.
There are just a few -- these are just a few of the key priorities that are starting to impact our operational and financial results. And while we have much work to do, I'm confident we're on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives. 
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarter's teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."
189096,309043589,924268,"Sysco Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, especially in light of the increased deflation and continued currency headwinds. We also continued to make some solid early progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year go",1111,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, especially in light of the increased deflation and continued currency headwinds. We also continued to make some solid early progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year goals.
We grew sales in the second quarter by approximately 1% year-over-year, despite going from inflation of 6% in the second quarter of last year to deflation of 1% this year, including deflation of nearly 2% in U.S. Broadline. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories as supply recovers from various events in 2015. However, as Tom mentioned, we are managing this environment well, including improved processes and programs such as category management that have helped to lessen the impacts of deflation.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.7%, with the U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar responsible for the vast majority of the impact. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 2.2%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the second quarter was 3.4% and local was 2.9%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins. We grew our gross profit at a solid 3.4% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 50 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement includes category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.
Adjusted operating expenses grew 1.8% during the quarter and by 3.5% on a constant currency basis. The increase was mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and planned investments in business technology. This increase in expense is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spend, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our cost per case in U.S. Broadline, which is down $0.01 from the prior year.
Also note, while we experienced a relatively minor amount of certain items related to restructuring during the second quarter, we do expect to experience additional restructuring charges related to our 3-year plan over the next few quarters. 
As you know, a key part of our plan is to effectively manage the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. We achieved that objective during the second quarter, and as a result, grew adjusted operating income by 10.2% compared to the prior year and 11.6% on a constant currency basis. 
As it relates to taxes, at mid-January at an investor conference, we disclosed a $21 million benefit to income tax expense as a result of the favorable resolution of some international tax contingencies. This had the same impact on both our GAAP and adjusted tax rates, reducing both to around 31%. As a result and as mentioned during that webcast, we recorded a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share during the second quarter.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 12.6% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.1% and 19.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher operating income and reduced tax rates. The previously mentioned tax benefit increased earnings per share by $0.03. The share count decrease of 24.5 million shares related to the accelerated share repurchase program positively impacted earnings per share in the second quarter by approximately $0.02 versus the prior year. 
At the beginning of the second quarter, we executed the accelerated share repurchase program and therefore received the benefit from that repurchase for the entire quarter. Also note that we resumed our ongoing practice of buying back shares to offset dilution during the last few weeks of December. 
Cash flow from operations was $469 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016, up roughly 4% from last year. Working capital was a use of cash during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016 as it was during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2015. The first half of the fiscal year typically requires a seasonal net investment in working capital that has been reduced during the second half of the fiscal year. Year-over-year, the comparison is favorable as we invested $143 million less cash in working capital during the first half of fiscal 2016 than we did in the first half of fiscal 2015. Net CapEx for the first 26 weeks was $237 million and free cash flow was $231 million.
Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $264 million in fiscal 2016 and $102 million in fiscal 2015. The certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods and from 2015 include items related to the proposed merger itself. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew by $179 million and free cash flow grew $237 million.
Now I would like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2016 plan. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparison this year more challenging. Fourth, we now expect CapEx to be near the lower end of the previously stated $550 million to $600 million range. Finally, we expect a normalized tax rate of 36% to 37% over the remaining 26 weeks. 
In summary, we had a strong quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve our fiscal 2016 financial objectives and our 3-year plan, including effectively managing deflation over the near term and increasing our focus on expenses. 
We continue to aggressively review every part of the company, looking for ways to reduce costs. Additionally, we have put in place a more rigorous process for managing expenses, including how we prioritize spending and focus investment on areas of projects that improve our ability to serve the customer better. And finally, we took advantage of continued lower fuel prices to increase the amount of fuel we locked in over the next 12 months.
I feel good about our ability to achieve the first year target of our 3-year plan, and we're working hard to be as aggressive as possible in identifying incremental opportunities to exceed our Investor Day targets. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

So yes, I would expect that we would continue to take share. Obviously, what Joel referred to in his comments is we're trying to do that in a more disciplined way as we go forward here so that we give more of flow-through to the bottom line. The way I look at the local case growth is -- I talked about the lever of accelerating local case growth. The context there is we've had, I think, 7 quarters in a row now of local case growth, and the last few have been right around 2% or more. So that lever is relative to where we were the last 2 or 3, 4 years as we were going through a lot of our change and some pretty tough macroeconomics. So that 2% to 3% range, I think, is what we're targeting. I think there's going to be some quarters where we're at the lower end of that range and there will be some where we're at the higher end of the range. I think 2% or 3% is very solid growth if you look at what the forecasts are for the industry. But I'll let Tom speak to generally where it's coming from."

So a couple of comments on that. Number one, the way I think about those types of costs, and I think we've talked about this at other places, we think about it from the standpoint of processes, of -- from people, from technologies, from the types of investments that we put into our company again in terms of how we think about prioritizing items. So in other words, one of the key things I called out in here is the ability to really prioritize and then focus on those spends that are going to drive the -- again, ultimately what's better for our customers. And so I think the -- some of the things that we've put in place, for example, are different committees to review and focus on technology spend, for example, in ways to have again a very tight process for making sure that we're focusing on those projects that drive the best results primarily and focused on the customers. So I would say -- I mean, again, there's a lot of rigor around that. And in terms of your second part of your question, all I could really say to that, I think, is that we certainly will continue to focus on driving that, certainly with the deflation we're experiencing and the fact that our gross profit dollars are harder to come by. That increased focus on expenses is important. And so again as I mentioned in, I think, in my script, that's certainly an area we're going to continue to focus on and certainly look to drive incremental improvements over and above our targets."

Now over the last 3, 4, 5 years, we've invested a lot in particular on the corporate side, technology, processes, as Joel mentioned, commercial activities beginning-to-end supply chain. So while those investments have been made over the last several years to create this path of transformation that we feel the company needs to go through, in which we're pretty far down the road on, what you're seeing today and what you've seen the last few quarters is we're beginning to get the benefits of a lot of those investments. So I would expect that the trajectory of that expense as it's already happened will flatten out. To Joel's point, we'll continue to get better and better at sequencing and prioritizing spend relative to customer needs and relative to what we need to deliver for our shareholders. And I'd say the one last opportunity we have particularly in the field is to be just more consistent in our execution, and we still see plenty of opportunity there. So again, historically, we've done a good job, but what we're really telling you here is we think there's opportunity both operationally as well as on the corporate side."

I don't know that there was a big sequential impact and a lot of variability around the sequential impact as the quarter progressed. But what we're saying is we saw a pickup from the first quarter to the second quarter. We're seeing some similar trends here in January, and we kind of felt mathematically that will begin to wrap. We began to see this, if you'll recall, back in March and then the fourth quarter of last year's when the inflation fell. So we thought just from a wrapping perspective that we would see a little more -- a little less deflation as we got into the second half of the fiscal year. And I would say what we're telling you today is it's still there. And we probably will expect to see it at least through the end of the quarter. It affects you in different ways obviously. On the positive side, generally when our costs go down, we're able to pass that along to our customers and that's good for them, especially as they're dealing with some of their labor challenges. It -- your percentages look better, so certainly it contributed to the gross margin expansion. But the reality is it's not a great environment because you end up with fewer dollars to pay your expenses with. So to Joel's other point, when you have this level of deflation, it just reinforces the importance of managing our expenses very tightly."

Look, I think as I said, I believe the deflation, as you look at gross margin, i.e., the percent of sales, is clearly helping. However, as we've said very consistently over the years, it's not an ideal environment to be in. If you look at this business historically, our customers generally are able to pass along a couple of points of inflation to their consumers year in and year out and they generally do. So to one of your points, what you're seeing here a little bit is some of the recovery what we gave up. When we were dealing with 5 to 6 points of inflation, you can only pass along so much of that so quickly, and it's only appropriate to pass along so much of that so quickly. So when you have some deflationary trends, mathematically, it helps you a little bit. Perhaps there are situations where you can bring your prices down a little slower, but ultimately, it's an incredibly competitive environment, so we are out to compete for that business every day and we want to do right by our customers, so I wouldn't put a lot of weight on that. I just think we're doing a very good job managing it. I've seen different cycles of deflation here over the last -- I don't know how many years but a lot of years, and this is, by far and away, the best we've ever managed it. And I think it goes back to what Tom covered, but I'll let him speak again. We are actively -- we've been working on several commercial initiatives here for the last 2, 3, 4 years, whether it's segmentation, back to basics, revenue management, category management. These are all things that are allowing us to be more laser-like in terms of how we work with our customers and bring more consistency to our pricing. There's more to do there but -- so I would just say I think we're actually managing it quite well."

We got a little bit more out of it this quarter than we did in the first quarter. I think when I talked about that first quarter and we -- that's when we really talked more about U.S. Broadline than we had in the past. I wanted you and the other investors to understand the quality of the underlying quarter. I think part of what we're seeing, and we've done some work on this, is the trajectory of the corporate spend coming out of last year, coming out of the proposed merger that ultimately was terminated, we still had some -- and we still do. We still have some trajectory of our spend here, corporate in particular, on the technology side, in particular in some of the areas that Tom's speaking to over the -- with the digital and mobile platform. So those comparisons were not quite as tough in the second quarter as they were in the first, so our corporate expense increase was a little bit less acute. We've got a little more margin improvement, as you can see on the gross margin side, even though we did see more deflation and that -- perhaps that helped us a little bit in the short term, but we also managed that, I think, a little bit better. And you saw better cost management, I think, operationally as well. We're right around that flat cost per piece. So fuel helped us a little bit there but -- so I just think everything got a little bit better, and I just think this quarter is somewhat more reflective of really the quality of the earnings that we've seen. Now look, what I would encourage you to do is look at the first half I spoke to, and what I see there is I see 4% operating income with improving trends. And that's kind of how we're looking at it. So we think we're in a good place for the first year piece of our 3-year goal. Joel can speak to that, but I think we talked about hitting 20% to 30% of our goal here in the first year. And we've got more work to do to hit or exceed the rest of that goal, both as it relates to continuing to address the deflation, in particular, grow those cases locally the way we are and have been. But we've got some more work to do on the expense side as well, and you've heard us allude to that here. So I wouldn't quite call it an inflection point, but I would call it a validation of what I talked about in the first quarter."

I think on the gross profit, look, deflation's a very challenging environment to manage in terms of growing your gross profit dollars, and I just think we're doing a better job there for the reasons that Tom's taking you through.

The overall industry I would say, the overall environment and the outlook for our customers is better today than it was 2 or 3 years ago. Now it goes up and down by quarter, and you can actually see and some of the stuff when the stock market goes down, some of the NRA numbers fall off the next month or the next quarter so. But I think if you look at it secularly and go back 2 or 3 years, we're in a better place, so that's a positive. It's still an incredibly and acutely competitive world out there, so we need to be very responsive to that. And I would just echo what I've been trying to articulate here over the last 2 or 3 years, but in particular, the last several months post the merger termination: we're extremely well-positioned today because of all the work that we've done over the last 2, 3, 4 years on the commercial side to compete effectively, do the right thing by our customers but also grow in a disciplined way, as Joel talks about, and manage our margins. So if you look at those 4 levers, we're talking about improving how we manage it ideally, we'll at least hold margin over the next 2 or 3 years. Right now, we're up. Hopefully, we will grow it, but I certainly feel we're much better positioned to manage it well than where we were 2, 3, 4 years ago."

It's a little harder, and we really don't get into that level of detail in terms of our components of our cost of goods. But let me say it this way. Lower fuel is good, okay? It's generally good for multiple reasons. One, is it gets -- on the margin generally, people. It gives them more discretionary income and they'll spend it -- historically, spend it more going out to eat. Now, I will say this. We really hadn't seen a lot of that until perhaps lately, and we don't have a lot of hard data on that, so the most powerful thing on the field is, if you extend it, it translates to greater discretionary income, and the consumer uses it to go out to eat. That's a good thing for us. Haven't seen quite as much of that, but we're hopeful that we'll see more. But then, you're absolutely right, it helps us on the cost of goods and to Joel's point, it helps us on the outbound. We kind of weight average the outbound. So it's definitely a modest tailwind, and we're taking advantage of it, and hopefully it will stay that way."

This morning, Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results. Our performance reflects both the commitment of our 52,000 associates to supporting the success of our customers and the improving execution",726,"Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results. Our performance reflects both the commitment of our 52,000 associates to supporting the success of our customers and the improving execution of our strategy and 3-year plan initiatives. 
During the quarter, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 4% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to 1.5%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of $60 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 15% to $0.46 per share. 
These results were achieved with the benefit of favorable weather conditions and an earlier Easter holiday compared to the prior year third quarter. Consumer confidence data points, while still favorable compared to a few years ago, were somewhat uneven and track the volatile financial market activity quite closely. Lower fuel prices were likely a net positive as the impact to consumer spending benefits and reduced delivery costs offset, to some degree, the economic slowdown we are experiencing in energy-driven economies in certain parts of Texas and in Montana, North Dakota and Alberta, Canada.
Turning to specific restaurant industry data. The overall sales trends remained mixed. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant sales have been uneven during the first 3 months of 2016 after steadily rising throughout 2015. Both NPD and Knapp-Track have also shown recent traffic and sales declines. However, even with this recent shopping industry performance, the overall trend remains generally favorable for our customers as illustrated by the U.S. Census Bureau sales data for the quarter, rising 1% above the prior quarter, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of restaurant sales growth.
Moving to our results for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2016. I'm very pleased with the increasing momentum in our business. For the 9-month period ending in March, we delivered the following results: total Broadline cases grew 3.3% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 1.2% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. 
Gross profit dollars grew 3.3% and gross margin increased 35 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased $100 million or about 8% compared to the prior year and adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10%. These results are in line with our 3-year plan financial objectives: to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million and to grow our earnings per share faster than operating income. 
Our progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is being driven by focusing on the following 4 key levers: accelerating local case growth; improving gross margin; leveraging supply chain costs; and reducing administrative costs. 
Regarding the reduction of administrative costs, we recently began to implement a workforce reduction of approximately 1,200 positions. We've taken a very thoughtful approach to this difficult process by focusing on prioritizing all existing work more effectively, reducing layers of management and expanding of control. 
We believe our approach will allow us to continue supporting our customers with a high level of service, as evidenced by the fact that we are not reducing the number of marketing associates or warehouse and delivery associates who directly support our customers. 
During the quarter, we also announced our proposed acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European food service distributor with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. We are very excited about this opportunity as we will inherit an excellent leadership team of business whose customer-centric strategy and culture is very similar to Sysco's and 15,000 highly capable associates. 
We expect this acquisition will provide a solid trajectory of EBITDA growth over time and excellent platform for further acquisitions in Europe. Equally important, this transaction will not distract us from driving out our 3-year plan in our existing business. We continue to target a June or July closing.
As we end the final quarter of our fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level. We have delivered consistent local case growth for the past 2 years, expanded gross margins for 4 consecutive quarters, reduced adjusted cost per case in the field and put plans in the place that will reduce administrative expenses. These actions and related results reinforce our confidence and our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives as we move forward. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
189096,309043623,969352,"Sysco Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results. As we have mentioned a",789,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results. 
As we have mentioned a few times before, our insights-based approach to understanding, meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts and is clearly driving improved performance. For example, during the third quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.6%, including local case growth of 3.4%. Gross profit dollar growth of 4.8%, including an improvement in margin of 39 basis points. 
And for operating expense, we reduced our adjusted cost per case by $0.08 or $0.03 on a neutral fuel price basis, and we had operating income growth of 11.5%. We are driving increased case growth through a variety of sales and marketing initiatives that are designed to deliver value to our customers while providing a more consistent experience of doing business with Sysco. I'm pleased to report that the third quarter represents the eighth straight quarter of local case growth.
As you know, improving gross margin is another key driver of Sysco achieving our 3-year targets, and our strong performance this quarter indicates that we are making progress towards delivering our long-term objectives. During the quarter, we delivered solid growth in key center plate categories such as beef, pork and poultry, and we continued our growth in produce, reinforcing the benefits driven from a focus on fresh. 
We also saw a solid increase of more than 50 basis points in Sysco Brand sales with our local customers. These efforts, combined with other initiatives such as our ongoing work in category and revenue management as well as the effect of deflation, contributed to an increase in U.S. Broadline gross margin of approximately 40 basis points, the fourth quarter in a row with gross margin expansion. 
These improvements are especially noteworthy as we've been able to manage through the current deflationary environment fairly well, due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve local case growth as a percentage of our mix as well as our continued focus on our category management process. 
Separately, the operating expense performance during the quarter was particularly strong. We limited total adjusted expense growth to only 1.5% despite case growth of more than 3%. And as mentioned, we reduced our overall cost per case in the U.S. Broadline by $0.03, excluding the impact of fuel prices. 
From a supply chain perspective, we continue to make good progress towards our goals to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. 
We have also seen good progress through a series of indirect spend initiatives. And while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year. 
In conjunction with the series of initiatives to support our long-term strategy, we are implementing a new market structure that reduces the number of U.S. Broadline geographic markets from 8 to 6 effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2017 year. Each market team will continue to be led by a market president and include key functional leaders across finance, merchandising, supply chain and human resources to provide support for our operating companies and help to drive solid execution of the various corporate initiatives. 
We believe that the work we've done in building the capability of the organization through the functional structure over the past 2 years makes this the right time for us to evolve our structure. This change will reduce overall administrative costs in the field, drive efficiency through a more standardized approach and improve execution to our customers.
In conjunction with this restructuring, I'm pleased to announce the promotion of 3 strong Sysco leaders:  has been appointed Senior Vice President, U.S. Foodservice operations, with responsibility for all U.S. Broadline operating companies. We also announced that Scott Sonnemaker has been named Senior Vice President, International Foodservice Operations Americas; and Bill Goetz has been named Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing. 
These are just a few of the key priorities and changes that are positively impacting our operational and financial results. While we need to continue to execute at a high level, I'm confident we're on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives. 
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarters' teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."

We had a strong quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, particularly solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management achieved in an environment with continued deflation and currency headwinds. 
We continue to make solid progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year goals. We grew sales in the third quarter by approximately 2% year-over-year despite deflation of 0.4%. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories such as meats, seafood and poultry and supply recovers from various events in 2015. This deflationary trend has been persistent over the past few quarters. 
Acquisitions increased sales by 0.9% while foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1% in the third quarter. U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar was responsible for the vast majority of the foreign exchange impact. The negative impacts we've been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we begin to wrap the initial decline and relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 3.1%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the third quarter was 3.3% and local was also 3.3%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins. We grew our gross profit at a solid 4.1% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 34 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.
During the third quarter, we had a few certain items that impacted our results. These include restructuring costs such as charges to related technology changes, severance and professional fees of $60 million and about $10 million of acquisition financing costs. 
On a GAAP basis, without excluding these certain items and the comparable certain items from the prior year, our operating income grew 15% and our diluted earnings per share grew about 27%. 
The rest of my discussion will focus on the non-GAAP or adjusted for certain items results. Adjusted operating expense grew 1.5% during the quarter and by 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This increase was mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals and was partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case.
As a result, adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $438 million, up 16% compared to the prior year and 17% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.6% compared to 33.9% in the prior year period. Both quarters' tax rates were positively impacted by the favorable resolution of state tax matters.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 10% and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2016, up approximately 15% from last year. Net working capital improved by about 0.5 day during the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely driven by improvements in both receivables and inventory. 
Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $348 million and free cash flow was $641 million. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $272 million in fiscal 2016 and $128 million in fiscal 2015. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger of US Foods, and for 2015, include items related to the planning of the merger integration. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew $273 million and free cash flow grew $346 million.
Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are currently on track to hit our fiscal 2016 financial objectives. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least some other quarter. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparisons this year more challenging. And finally, we now expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be approximately $500 million or approximately 1% of sales.
During the quarter, we also completed a successful debt offering, the proceeds of which are to be used for the acquisition of Brakes that Bill mentioned earlier. The very attractive coupon associated with this financing, approximately 3% on a weighted average basis, represents both the strength of our balance sheet as well as impressive work by our teams throughout the process. In addition, Sysco put in place hedges during the quarter that protect approximately half of the purchase price of the Brakes transaction against unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term.
I feel confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives of our 3-year plan, and we'll aggressively continue to look for incremental opportunities to exceed our goals. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

It's coming from a lot of good work over the last few years on the commercial side of the business that Tom can give you a little more color on and really good alignment with our leadership teams throughout Sysco. And I would say this particular quarter, we acknowledged it, there were some tailwinds. And I don't like to talk about weather a lot. I think the last few third quarters we talked about weather. Last 2 years ago, we had a brutal winter at the beginning of the winter, and last year, I think it was at the end of the winter. And this year was a pretty mild winter so I think that helped a little bit. With that said, I think I was also trying to get out there that the data out there right now is little bit mixed in terms of overall industry growth. So I think we had some tailwinds that we took advantage of, but more than anything, I think it's more and more good execution of key initiatives [indiscernible] commercial side over the last 3, 4 years. On the brand, I'll keep it time real quick, these things tend to go together. When you're growing your business and you're creating differentiation at the customer level, and that's what the brand allows us to do. And so we've brought renewed focus on the brand over the last few years in conjunction with our category management work. And I think we're doing it the right way, and I don't know -- we're not really chasing a number here, Kelly. I think what we're saying is the key to all this is really growing those local cases.

And I would tell you that all of those metrics are -- continue to head in the right direction as it relates to our local customers, meaning our new sales continue to be very strong, our sales have declined a little bit over the past couple of quarters.

And then lastly on the Sysco brand, the only thing I'd add to what Bill said is our focus -- a lot of the category management focus is, in fact, driven towards that local customer. And based on that, the more we bring them differentiated solutions, we've talked about innovation in the last couple of quarters, is when we're bringing them new news and innovation, that actually helps us grow our Sysco Brand because generally, those products are in the Sysco Brand lineup. So it's just, I think, as Bill said, they go hand-in-hand and I think this continued focus by us in bringing new and differentiated products to our customers is helping us grow that. And I would agree with Bill, we don't have a number per se that we're targeting. We know that it's important and we continue to focus on it quarter in and quarter out."

But I think if you go back and look at some of the things that we said over the last several months and putting the 3-year plan together, our whole period will be -- when we can return to a more moderate inflation environment, that we would grow the cases and at least hold margin flat, maybe grow it a little bit. And that's the plan, and that's going to take a lot of cohesive execution, which we're quite confident in right now between CatMan. Tom spoke about RevMan here a little bit ago and continue to grow those local cases. So the key is the local cases and the mix.

The key, I really think is what Tom spoke to earlier and the earlier question. In terms of sustainability, it has to come from the book of business that we have today in terms of our ability to do that. So certainly, our ability to continue to fill a pipeline with quality new account business, and that may come from different segments, to your point. We are doing some things on the retail side. We have talked a fair amount about some good work we've done over the last couple of years on the ethnic side, in particular, Hispanic. We have some more opportunity there beyond Hispanic and within Hispanic. The whole area of fresh and organic is an area that provides a lot of opportunity. So whether it's customer segments, product segments, trends in the industry, those are all opportunities for us that we are exploring and beginning to get some traction. With that said, for us to sustain what we put up here over the last several quarters, and in particular, this quarter, we need to continue to penetrate with our existing accounts that's the most profitable business for us, bring in some new accounts from that quality pipeline and do a little bit better, and we're starting to in terms of our customer retention. So we need to do all of those things, and the good news is we are doing those things right now.

We -- one of the things we were very careful about and meticulous about in terms of the 3-year plan was to lock in on 2 or 3 key objectives that we have financially that we thought would resonate with our investors and potential investors based upon feedback that we've got. So we locked in on operating income growth, and we also acknowledged that we would expect to grow our EPS somewhat faster over that 3-year period than the operating income growth. And we locked in on return on invested capital. And we set a goal out there for 15%. Now obviously that was before the Brakes deal, but we're on track today within the business as it sits today, Ed, to hit or slightly surpass the 15%. Once we close on the Brakes deal, we're going to bring that in and give you some color on the impact of that. But we are very, very focused on return of invested capital. And obviously, they come together, to your point, in terms of free cash flow and EBITDA growth. So we don't have a particular delta target, if you will, for EBITDA growth or free cash flow right now, but it's been strong here for some time. And I would expect it to continue to be strong. And in terms of how we're going to invest it, I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business. You're right. We're a little under where we thought we will be our CapEx this year. I think Joel commented that we expect to be around $500 million for the year. It's about 1%. In any given year, that could go up or down a little bit based on timing. But I think that 1%, maybe slightly more every now and then is what you should expect there. And we're going to continue to -- obviously, we're going to be very focused on Brakes in the right way and even more focused on continuing to run the business here as we've laid out. So bottom line is I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business at about 1% CapEx, increase the dividend modestly, probably not quite as fast as the earnings go up, continue to look for good acquisitions and opportunistically look at buying back shares.

I think it's follow-up to one of the questions that was asked earlier on the transition from deflation to inflation. So assuming that there was some inflation that appears next year in fiscal '17, so I understand the gross margin percentage increases when you have deflation. But would you say there's also some underlying benefit when you're seeing your cost of goods going down as it's been going down over the past 2 or 3 quarters both from fuel and deflation? So would you say it's possible that your input costs are going down at a faster rate than you're passing along to some of your Broadline customers? And does any of that benefit start to get offset as you start to deal with inflation again whenever that happens?"

I mean, there's the math aspect of it, and then there's an element of that obviously, in our business where you turn your inventory every 20 days, you can't hold the prices for too long given, the competitive environment that we're in. So to TOm's earlier point, we're always trying to strike the right balance when customers' needs are. So that's certainly part of it, but I would also say to you that I'm not a big fan of deflation. So I think the longer it goes, the more challenging it becomes. People start to expect prices to continue to go down. So it's not a good place to be but it's explainable. I mean, a lot of it -- the way we kind of got here is the center-of-the-plate, these protein categories are flat to now down, whereas a year, 18 months ago, they were up double digit. And the rest of the categories are roughly flat, maybe up a little bit or down a little bit. So it's primarily being driven in the protein area, and that's what -- the area that you will have to watch closely in terms of when we come out of it. But I would just echo what I said for years and I think with Sysco even longer for that. The best environment for us is and for our customers is when you have a moderate level of inflation ideally across multiple categories, 2%, 3%, whatever. And I would say it gets more challenging if you go toward a 5%, 6% inflation. We've seen that and certainly challenging over the medium term when you have deflation. So bottom line, I feel really good about how we're managing it. I think a lot of these commercial adjectives that I spoke to earlier and Tom has spoken to have come just the right time in terms of managing through this process. And yes, there's some short-term benefits are deflation to your point, but medium to long term, not where we want to be."

This morning, Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results.

This morning, Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results. Our performance reflects both the commitment of our 52,000 associates to supporting the success of our customers and the improving execution of our strategy and 3-year plan initiatives. 
During the quarter, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 4%, while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to 1.5%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of $60 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 15% to $0.46 per share. 
These results were achieved with the benefit of favorable weather conditions and an earlier Easter holiday compared to the prior year third quarter. Consumer confidence data points, while still favorable compared to a few years ago, were somewhat uneven and track the volatile financial market activity quite closely. Lower fuel prices were likely a net positive as the impact of consumer spending benefits and reduced delivery costs offset, to some degree, the economic slowdown we are experiencing in energy-driven economies in certain parts of Texas and in Montana, North Dakota and Alberta, Canada.
Turning to specific restaurant industry data. The overall sales trends remained mixed. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant sales have been uneven during the first 3 months of 2016 after steadily rising throughout 2015. Both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK have also shown recent traffic and sales declines. However, even with this recent shopping industry performance, the overall trend remains generally favorable for our customers, as illustrated by the U.S. Census Bureau sales data for the quarter, rising 1% above the prior quarter, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of restaurant sales growth.
Moving to our results for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2016. I'm very pleased with the increasing momentum in our business. For the 9-month period ending in March, we delivered the following results: total Broadline cases grew 3.3% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 1.2% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. 
Gross profit dollars grew 3.3% and gross margin increased 35 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased $100 million or about 8% compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10%. These results are in line with our 3-year plan financial objectives: to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million and to grow earnings per share faster than operating income. 
Our progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is being driven by focusing on the following 4 key levers: accelerating local case growth; improving gross margin; leveraging supply chain costs; and reducing administrative costs. 
Regarding the reduction of administrative costs, we recently began to implement a workforce reduction of approximately 1,200 positions. We've taken a very thoughtful approach to this difficult process by focusing on prioritizing all existing work more effectively, reducing layers of management and expanding expenses control. 
We believe our approach will allow us to continue supporting our customers with a high level of service, as evidenced by the fact that we are not reducing the number of marketing associates or warehouse and delivery associates who directly support our customers. 
During the quarter, we also announced our proposed acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European food service distributor with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. We're very excited about this opportunity, as we will inherit an excellent leadership team of business whose customer-centric strategy and culture is very similar to Sysco's and 15,000 highly capable associates. We expect this acquisition will provide a solid trajectory of EBITDA growth over time and excellent platform for further acquisitions in Europe. Equally important, this transaction will not distract us from driving out our 3-year plan in our existing business. We continue to target a June or July closing.
As we end the final quarter of our fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level. We have delivered consistent local case growth for the past 2 years, expanded gross margins for 4 consecutive quarters, reduced adjusted cost per case in the field and put plans in the place that will reduce administrative expenses. These actions and related results reinforce our confidence and our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives as we move forward. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results. As we have mentioned a",792,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results. 
As we have mentioned a few times before, our insights-based approach to understanding, meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts and is clearly driving improved performance. For example, during the third quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.6%, including local case growth of 3.4%; gross profit dollar growth of 4.8%, including an improvement in margin of 39 basis points. 
And for operating expense, we reduced our adjusted cost per case by $0.08 or $0.03 on a neutral fuel price basis, and we had operating income growth of 11.5%. We are driving increased case growth through a variety of sales and marketing initiatives that are designed to deliver value to our customers while providing a more consistent experience of doing business with Sysco. I'm pleased to report that the third quarter represents the eighth straight quarter of local case growth.
As you know, improving gross margin is another key driver of Sysco achieving our 3-year targets. And our strong performance this quarter indicates that we are making progress towards delivering our long-term objectives. During the quarter, we delivered solid growth in key center of plate categories such as beef, pork and poultry, and we continued our growth in produce, reinforcing the benefits driven from a focus on fresh. 
We also saw a solid increase of more than 50 basis points in Sysco Brand sales with our local customers. These efforts, combined with other initiatives such as our ongoing work in category and revenue management as well as the effect of deflation, contributed to an increase in U.S. Broadline gross margin of approximately 40 basis points, the fourth quarter in a row with gross margin expansion. 
These improvements are especially noteworthy, as we've been able to manage through the current deflationary environment fairly well, due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve local case growth as a percentage of our mix as well as our continued focus on our category management process. 
Separately, the operating expense performance during the quarter was particularly strong. We limited total adjusted expense growth to only 1.5% despite case growth of more than 3%. And as mentioned, we reduced our overall cost per case in the U.S. Broadline by $0.03, excluding the impact of fuel prices. 
From a supply chain perspective, we continue to make good progress towards our goals to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. 
We have also seen good progress through a series of indirect spend initiatives. And while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year. 
In conjunction with the series of initiatives to support our long-term strategy, we are implementing a new market structure that reduces the number of U.S. Broadline geographic markets from 8 to 6 effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2017 year. Each market team will continue to be led by a market president and include key functional leaders across finance, merchandising, supply chain and human resources to provide support for our operating companies and help to drive solid execution of the various corporate initiatives. 
We believe that the work we've done in building the capability of the organization through the functional structure over the past 2 years makes this the right time for us to evolve our structure. This change will reduce overall administrative costs in the field, drive efficiency through a more standardized approach and improve execution to our customers.
In conjunction with this restructuring, I'm pleased to announce the promotion of 3 strong Sysco leaders. Greg Bertrand has been appointed Senior Vice President, U.S. Foodservice Operations with responsibility for all U.S. Broadline operating companies. We also announced that Scott Sonnemaker has been named Senior Vice President, International Foodservice Operations, Americas; and Bill Goetz has been named Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing. 
These are just a few of the key priorities and changes that are positively impacting our operational and financial results. While we need to continue to execute at a high level, I'm confident we're on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives. 
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarters' teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."

We had a strong quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, particularly solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, achieved in an environment with continued deflation and currency headwinds. 
We continue to make solid progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year goals. 
We grew sales in the third quarter by approximately 2% year-over-year despite deflation of 0.4%. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories such as meats, seafood and poultry as supply recovers from various events in 2015. This deflationary trend has been persistent over the past few quarters. 
Acquisitions increased sales by 0.9% while foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1% in the third quarter. U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar was responsible for the vast majority of the foreign exchange impact. The negative impacts we've been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we began to wrap the initial decline and relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 3.1%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the third quarter was 3.3% and local was also 3.3%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins. We grew our gross profit at a solid 4.1% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 34 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.
During the third quarter, we had a few certain items that impacted our results. These include restructuring costs such as charges related to technology changes, severance and professional fees of $60 million and about $10 million of acquisition financing costs. On a GAAP basis, without excluding these certain items and the comparable certain items from the prior year, our operating income grew 15% and our diluted earnings per share grew about 27%. 
The rest of my discussion will focus on the non-GAAP or adjusted for certain items results. Adjusted operating expense grew 1.5% during the quarter and by 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This increase was mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals, and was partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case. As a result, adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $438 million, up 16% compared to the prior year and 17% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.6% compared to 33.9% in the prior year period. Both quarters' tax rates were positively impacted by the favorable resolution of state tax matters.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 10% and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2016, up approximately 15% from last year. Net working capital improved by about 0.5 day during the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely driven by improvements in both receivables and inventory. 
Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $348 million and free cash flow was $641 million. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $272 million in fiscal 2016 and $128 million in fiscal 2015. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger of US Foods, and for 2015, include items related to the planning of the merger integration. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew $273 million and free cash flow grew $346 million.
Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are currently on track to hit our fiscal 2016 financial objectives. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least another quarter. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparison this year more challenging. And finally, we now expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be approximately $500 million or approximately 1% of sales.
During the quarter, we also completed a successful debt offering, the proceeds of which are to be used for the acquisition of Brakes that Bill mentioned earlier. The very attractive coupon associated with this financing, approximately 3% on a weighted average basis, represents both the strength of our balance sheet as well as impressive work by our team throughout the process. In addition, Sysco put in place hedges during the quarter that protect approximately half of the purchase price of the Brakes transaction against unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives of our 3-year plan, and we will aggressively continue to look for incremental opportunities to exceed our goals.

So in terms of where it's coming from, I think it's the same answers I would give you if you'd asked about margin or even expenses at this point. It's coming from a lot of good work over the last few years on the commercial side of the business that Tom can give you a little more color on, and really good alignment, I think, with our leadership team throughout Sysco. And I would say this particular quarter, we acknowledged it, there were some tailwinds. And I don't like to talk about weather a lot. I think that the last few third quarters, we've talked about weather. Last -- 2 years ago, we had a brutal winter at the beginning of the winter, and last year, I think it was at the end of the winter. And this year was a pretty mild winter, so I think that helped a little bit. With that said, I think I was also trying to get out there that the data out there right now is little bit mixed in terms of overall industry growth. So I think we had some tailwinds that we took advantage of. But more than anything, I think it's more of a good execution of key initiatives that [indiscernible] commercial side over the last 3, 4 years. On the brand, and I'll kick it to Tom real quick, these things tend to go together. When you're growing your business and you're creating differentiation at the customer level, and that's what the brand allows us to do. And so we've brought renewed focus on the brand over the last few years in conjunction with our category management work. And I think we're doing it the right way, and I don't know -- we're not really chasing a number here, Kelly. I think what we're saying is the key to all this is really growing those local cases. And as we do that, we should be able to grow the brand. I don't know that there's a particular percentage that we're trying to get to other than to utilize the brand as a way to differentiate ourselves more effectively. And let me kick it to Tom here and give you a little more color on that."

Let me just add on the local case growth. You'd asked about kind of current customers, new customers. We spend a fair amount of time looking at what we call new sales, lost sales and then penetration, and think about that as new customers, any customers that we may have lost some business at or where we've done a better job of selling more to those customers. And I would tell you that all of those metrics are -- continue to head in the right direction as it relates to our local customers, meaning our new sales continue to be very strong, our lost sales have declined a little bit over the past couple of quarters and our penetration sales, which is what is delivering more to those current customers, has also been increasing. And that's a key metric for us because that tells us if we're improving in all those areas with our customers, our current customers and making sure that we're continuing to satisfy their needs. So we feel good about all those metrics and where the business is heading. And then lastly on the Sysco Brand, the only thing I'd add to what Bill said is our focus -- a lot of the category management focus is, in fact, driven towards that local customer. And based on that, the more we bring them differentiated solutions, we've talked about innovation in the last couple of quarters, is when we're bringing them new news and innovation, that actually helps us grow our Sysco Brand because generally, those products are in the Sysco Brand lineup. So it's just, I think, as Bill said, they go hand in hand. And I think this continued focus by us in bringing new and differentiated products to our customers is helping us grow that. And I would agree with Bill, we don't have a number per se that we're targeting. We know that it's important and we continue to focus on it quarter in and quarter out."

It's hard to answer even when I'm looking back or looking forward. But I think if you go back and look at some of the things that we've said over the last several months and putting the 3-year plan together, our whole period would be -- it would -- when we can return to a more moderate inflation environment, that we would grow the cases and at least hold margin flat, maybe grow it a little bit. And that's the plan and that's going to take a lot of cohesive execution, which we're quite confident in right now between CatMan. Tom has spoken of RevMan here a little bit ago and continue to grow those local cases. So the key is the local cases and the mix. We need to both grow both our local and corporate manage cases and kind of have that in the right ratio that will help us on the brand penetration.

I think, again, on the momentum part of it, it was a really, really nice quarter, and we did a lot of good things and benefited from that. I think from an external standpoint, there were some tailwinds that I don't think you can plan on every quarter in terms of some of the favorable weather comparisons and that kind of thing. And we may be seeing a little bit of a softening out there right now in terms of what we're seeing in our business and the industry. So I think there's the external aspect of that. We can't do much to manage that, but I think, obviously, we're managing within that environment very well right now, and we expect to continue to do that. I'll get to your question here in a second. The key, I really think is what Tom spoke to earlier and the earlier question, in terms of sustainability, it has to come from the book of business that we have today in terms of our ability to do that. So certainly, our ability to continue to fill a pipeline with quality new account business, and that may come from different segments, to your point. We are doing some things on the retail side. We have talked a fair amount about some good work we've done over the last couple of years on the ethnic side, in particular, Hispanic. We have some more opportunity there beyond Hispanic and within Hispanic. The whole area of fresh and organic is an area that provides a lot of opportunity. So whether it's customer segments, product segments, trends in the industry, those are all opportunities for us that we are exploring and beginning to get some traction. With that said, for us to sustain what we put up here over the last several quarters, and in particular, this quarter, we need to continue to penetrate with our existing accounts, that's the most profitable business for us, bring in some new accounts from that quality pipeline and do a little bit better, and we're starting to in terms of our customer retention. So we need to do all of those things, and the good news is we are doing those things right now. So I wouldn't overreact to one quarter or another, but when you look at the year-to-date numbers, those are well within the range of what we've targeted for the 3 years, and we remain quite confident that we can deliver that."

We -- one of the things we were very careful about and meticulous about in terms of the 3-year plan was to lock in on 2 or 3 key objectives that we have financially that we thought would resonate with our investors and potential investors based upon feedback that we've got. So we locked in on operating income growth. And we also acknowledged that we would expect to grow our EPS somewhat faster over that 3-year period than the operating income growth. And we locked in on return on invested capital. And we set a goal out there for 15%. Now obviously, that was before the Brakes deal, but we're on track today within the business as it sits today, Ed, to hit or slightly surpass the 15%. Once we close on the Brakes deal, we're going to bring that in and give you some color on the impact of that. But we are very, very focused on the return of invested capital. And obviously, they come together, to your point, in terms of free cash flow and EBITDA growth. So we don't have a particular delta target, if you will, for EBITDA growth or free cash flow right now, but it's been strong here for some time. And I would expect it to continue to be strong. And in terms of how we're going to invest it, I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business. You're right. We're a little under where we thought we will be on CapEx this year. I think Joel commented that we expect to be around $500 million for the year. It's about 1%. In any given year, that could go up or down a little bit based on timing. But I think that 1%, maybe slightly more every now and then is what you should expect there. And we're going to continue to -- obviously, we're going to be very focused on assimilating Brakes in the right way and even more focused on continuing to run the business here as we've laid out. So bottom line is I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business at about 1% CapEx, increase the dividend modestly, probably not quite as fast as the earnings go up, continue to look for good acquisitions and opportunistically look at buying back shares.

And so we've had a focus on quality and making sure that we've always got the right products out there. We've got a great program in place through our Sysco Brand around traceability, which is also very important. So we definitely believe that even as large as we are, we're able to compete in this space, and we're continuing to focus on how we can be better every day for our customers. And so I think we feel good about our performance today and feel like we can continue to grow in this area. But it's an ongoing kind of day-to-day management of that business to be successful."

I think it's follow-up to one of the questions that was asked earlier on the transition from deflation to inflation. So assuming that there was some inflation that reappears next year in fiscal '17, so I understand the gross margin percentage increases when you have deflation. But would you say there's also some underlying benefit when you're seeing your cost of goods going down as it's been going down over the past 2 or 3 quarters both from fuel and deflation? So would you say it's possible that your input costs are going down at a faster rate than you're passing along to some of your Broadline customers? And does any of that benefit start to get offset as you start to deal with inflation again whenever that happens?"

I mean, there's the math aspect of it, and then there's an element of that. Obviously, in our business where you turn your inventory every 20 days, it's -- you can't hold the prices for too long given the competitive environment that we're in. So to Tom's earlier point, we're always trying to strike the right balance there with what the customers' needs are. So that's certainly part of it, but I would also say to you that I'm not a big fan of deflation. So I think the longer it goes, the more challenging it becomes. People start to expect prices to continue to go down. So it's not a good place to be, but it's explainable. I mean, a lot of it -- the way we kind of got here is the center-of-the-plate, these protein categories are flat to now down, whereas a year, 18 months ago, they were up double digit. And the rest of the categories are roughly flat, maybe up a little bit or down a little bit. So it's primarily being driven in the protein area, and that's what -- that's the area that you will have to watch closely in terms of when we come out of it. But I would just echo what I've said for years and I think with Sysco set for even longer than that, that the best environment for us, and for our customers, is when you have a moderate level of inflation ideally across multiple categories, in 2%, 3%, whatever. And I would say it gets more challenging if you go toward a 5% or 6% inflation. We've seen that and it's certainly challenging over the medium term when you have deflation. So bottom line, I feel really good about how we're managing it. I think a lot of these commercial adjectives that I spoke to earlier, and as Tom has spoken to, have come at just the right time in terms of managing through this process. And yes, there's some short-term benefits with deflation to your point, but medium to long term, not where we want to be."

It has certainly helped us on our cost structure, although we've managed cost extremely well outside of that impact.

This morning, Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results. Our performance reflects both the commitment of our 52,000 associates to supporting the success of our customers and the improving execution of our strategy and 3-year plan initiatives. 
During the quarter, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 4%, while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to 1.5%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of $60 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 15% to $0.46 per share. 
These results were achieved with the benefit of favorable weather conditions and an earlier Easter holiday compared to the prior year third quarter. Consumer confidence data points, while still favorable compared to a few years ago, were somewhat uneven and track the volatile financial market activity quite closely. Lower fuel prices were likely a net positive as the impact of consumer spending benefits and reduced delivery costs offset, to some degree, the economic slowdown we are experiencing in energy-driven economies in certain parts of Texas and in Montana, North Dakota and Alberta, Canada.
Turning to specific restaurant industry data. The overall sales trends remained mixed. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant sales have been uneven during the first 3 months of 2016 after steadily rising throughout 2015. Both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK have also shown recent traffic and sales declines. However, even with this recent shopping industry performance, the overall trend remains generally favorable for our customers, as illustrated by the U.S. Census Bureau sales data for the quarter, rising 1% above the prior quarter, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of restaurant sales growth.
Moving to our results for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2016. I'm very pleased with the increasing momentum in our business. For the 9-month period ending in March, we delivered the following results: total Broadline cases grew 3.3% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 1.2% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. 
Gross profit dollars grew 3.3% and gross margin increased 35 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased $100 million or about 8% compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10%. These results are in line with our 3-year plan financial objectives: to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million and to grow earnings per share faster than operating income. 
Our progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is being driven by focusing on the following 4 key levers: accelerating local case growth; improving gross margin; leveraging supply chain costs; and reducing administrative costs. 
Regarding the reduction of administrative costs, we recently began to implement a workforce reduction of approximately 1,200 positions. We've taken a very thoughtful approach to this difficult process by focusing on prioritizing all existing work more effectively, reducing layers of management and expanding spans of control. 
We believe our approach will allow us to continue supporting our customers with a high level of service, as evidenced by the fact that we are not reducing the number of marketing associates or warehouse and delivery associates who directly support our customers. 
During the quarter, we also announced our proposed acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European food service distributor with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. We're very excited about this opportunity, as we will inherit an excellent leadership team of business whose customer-centric strategy and culture is very similar to Sysco's and 15,000 highly capable associates. We expect this acquisition will provide a solid trajectory of EBITDA growth over time and excellent platform for further acquisitions in Europe. Equally important, this transaction will not distract us from driving out our 3-year plan in our existing business. We continue to target a June or July closing.
As we end the final quarter of our fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level. We have delivered consistent local case growth for the past 2 years, expanded gross margins for 4 consecutive quarters, reduced adjusted cost per case in the field and put plans into place that will reduce administrative expenses. These actions and related results reinforce our confidence and our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives as we move forward. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results. As we have mentioned a",792,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results. 
As we have mentioned a few times before, our insights-based approach to understanding, meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts and is clearly driving improved performance. For example, during the third quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.6%, including local case growth of 3.4%; gross profit dollar growth of 4.8%, including an improvement in margin of 39 basis points. 
And for operating expense, we reduced our adjusted cost per case by $0.08 or $0.03 on a neutral fuel price basis, and we had operating income growth of 11.5%. We are driving increased case growth through a variety of sales and marketing initiatives that are designed to deliver value to our customers while providing a more consistent experience of doing business with Sysco. I'm pleased to report that the third quarter represents the eighth straight quarter of local case growth.
As you know, improving gross margin is another key driver of Sysco achieving our 3-year targets. And our strong performance this quarter indicates that we are making progress towards delivering our long-term objectives. During the quarter, we delivered solid growth in key center of plate categories such as beef, pork and poultry, and we continued our growth in produce, reinforcing the benefits driven from a focus on fresh. 
We also saw a solid increase of more than 50 basis points in Sysco Brand sales with our local customers. These efforts, combined with other initiatives such as our ongoing work in category and revenue management as well as the effect of deflation, contributed to an increase in U.S. Broadline gross margin of approximately 40 basis points, the fourth quarter in a row with gross margin expansion. 
These improvements are especially noteworthy, as we've been able to manage through the current deflationary environment fairly well, due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve local case growth as a percentage of our mix as well as our continued focus on our category management process. 
Separately, the operating expense performance during the quarter was particularly strong. We limited total adjusted expense growth to only 1.5% despite case growth of more than 3%. And as mentioned, we reduced our overall cost per case in the U.S. Broadline by $0.03, excluding the impact of fuel prices. 
From a supply chain perspective, we continue to make good progress towards our goals to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. 
We have also seen good progress through a series of indirect spend initiatives. And while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year. 
In conjunction with the series of initiatives to support our long-term strategy, we are implementing a new market structure that reduces the number of U.S. Broadline geographic markets from 8 to 6 effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2017 year. Each market team will continue to be led by a market president and include key functional leaders across finance, merchandising, supply chain and human resources to provide support for our operating companies and help to drive solid execution of the various corporate initiatives. 
We believe that the work we've done in building the capability of the organization through the functional structure over the past 2 years makes this the right time for us to evolve our structure. This change will reduce overall administrative costs in the field, drive efficiency through a more standardized approach and improve execution to our customers.
In conjunction with this restructuring, I'm pleased to announce the promotion of 3 strong Sysco leaders. Greg Bertrand has been appointed Senior Vice President, U.S. Foodservice Operations with responsibility for all U.S. Broadline operating companies. We also announced that Scott Sonnemaker has been named Senior Vice President, International Foodservice Operations, Americas; and Bill Goetz has been named Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing. 
These are just a few of the key priorities and changes that are positively impacting our operational and financial results. While we need to continue to execute at a high level, I'm confident we're on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives. 
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarters' teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."
189096,309043623,969693,"Sysco Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, particularly solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, achieved in an",969,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, particularly solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, achieved in an environment with continued deflation and currency headwinds. 
We continue to make solid progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year goals. 
We grew sales in the third quarter by approximately 2% year-over-year despite deflation of 0.4%. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories such as meats, seafood and poultry as supply recovers from various events in 2015. This deflationary trend has been persistent over the past few quarters. 
Acquisitions increased sales by 0.9% while foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1% in the third quarter. U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar was responsible for the vast majority of the foreign exchange impact. The negative impacts we've been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we began to wrap the initial decline and relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 3.1%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the third quarter was 3.3% and local was also 3.3%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins. We grew our gross profit at a solid 4.1% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 34 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.
During the third quarter, we had a few certain items that impacted our results. These include restructuring costs such as charges related to technology changes, severance and professional fees of $60 million and about $10 million of acquisition financing costs. On a GAAP basis, without excluding these certain items and the comparable certain items from the prior year, our operating income grew 15% and our diluted earnings per share grew about 27%. 
The rest of my discussion will focus on the non-GAAP or adjusted for certain items results. Adjusted operating expense grew 1.5% during the quarter and by 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This increase was mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals, and is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case. As a result, adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $438 million, up 16% compared to the prior year and 17% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.6% compared to 33.9% in the prior year period. Both quarters' tax rates were positively impacted by the favorable resolution of state tax matters.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 10% and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2016, up approximately 15% from last year. Net working capital improved by about 0.5 day during the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely driven by improvements in both receivables and inventory. 
Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $348 million and free cash flow was $641 million. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $272 million in fiscal 2016 and $128 million in fiscal 2015. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger of US Foods, and for 2015, include items related to the planning of the merger integration. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew $273 million and free cash flow grew $346 million.
Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are currently on track to hit our fiscal 2016 financial objectives. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least another quarter. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparison this year more challenging. And finally, we now expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be approximately $500 million or approximately 1% of sales.
During the quarter, we also completed a successful debt offering, the proceeds of which are to be used for the acquisition of Brakes that Bill mentioned earlier. The very attractive coupons associated with this financing, approximately 3% on a weighted average basis, represents both the strength of our balance sheet as well as impressive work by our team throughout the process. In addition, Sysco put in place hedges during the quarter that protect approximately half of the purchase price of the Brakes transaction against unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives of our 3-year plan, and we will aggressively continue to look for incremental opportunities to exceed our goals.

I think, in terms of historical context, this is by far the strongest quarter we've had over the last 4 or 5 years. And that's very encouraging and certainly something that is bringing the momentum of the business that both Tom and Joel talked about. So in terms of where it's coming from, I think it's the same answers I would give you if you'd asked about margin or even expenses at this point. It's coming from a lot of good work over the last few years on the commercial side of the business that Tom can give you a little more color on, and really good alignment, I think, with our leadership team throughout Sysco. And I would say this particular quarter, and we acknowledged it, there were some tailwinds. And I don't like to talk about weather a lot. I think that the last few third quarters, we've talked about weather. Last -- 2 years ago, we had a brutal winter at the beginning of the winter, and last year, I think it was at the end of the winter. And this year was a pretty mild winter, so I think that helped a little bit. With that said, I think I was also trying to get out there that the data out there right now is little bit mixed in terms of overall industry growth. So I think we had some tailwinds that we took advantage of. But more than anything, I think it's more of a good execution of key initiatives that [indiscernible] the commercial side over the last 3, 4 years. On the brand, and I'll kick it to Tom real quick, these things tend to go together. When you're growing your business and you're creating differentiation at the customer level, and that's what the brand allows us to do. And so we've brought renewed focus on the brand over the last few years in conjunction with our category management work. And I think we're doing it the right way, and I don't know -- we're not really chasing a number here, Kelly. I think what we're saying is the key to all this is really growing those local cases. And as we do that, we should be able to grow the brand. I don't know that there's a particular percentage that we're trying to get to other than to utilize the brand as a way to differentiate ourselves more effectively. And let me kick it to Tom here and give you a little more color on that."

Let me just add on the local case growth. You'd asked about kind of current customers, new customers. We spend a fair amount of time looking at what we call new sales, lost sales and then penetration, and think about that as new customers, any customers that we may have lost some business at or where we've done a better job of selling more to those customers. And I would tell you that all of those metrics are -- continue to head in the right direction as it relates to our local customers, meaning our new sales continue to be very strong, our lost sales have declined a little bit over the past couple of quarters and our penetration sales, which is what is delivering more to those current customers, has also been increasing. And that's a key metric for us because that tells us if we're improving in all those areas with our customers, our current customers and making sure that we're continuing to satisfy their needs. So we feel good about all those metrics and where the business is heading. And then lastly on the Sysco Brand, the only thing I'd add to what Bill said is our focus -- a lot of the category management focus is, in fact, driven towards that local customer. And based on that, the more we bring them differentiated solutions, we've talked about innovation in the last couple of quarters, is when we're bringing them new news and innovation, that actually helps us grow our Sysco Brand because generally, those products are in the Sysco Brand lineup. So it's just, I think, as Bill said, they go hand in hand. And I think this continued focus by us in bringing new and differentiated products to our customers is helping us grow that. And I would agree with Bill, we don't have a number per se that we're targeting. We know that it's important and we continue to focus on it quarter in and quarter out."

It's hard to answer even whether I'm looking back or looking forward. But I think if you go back and look at some of the things that we've said over the last several months and putting the 3-year plan together, our whole period would be -- it would -- when we can return to a more moderate inflation environment, that we would grow the cases and at least hold margin flat, maybe grow it a little bit. And that's the plan and that's going to take a lot of cohesive execution, which we're quite confident in right now between CatMan. Tom has spoken of RevMan here a little bit ago and continue to grow those local cases. So the key is the local cases and the mix. We need to both grow both our local and corporate manage cases and kind of have that in the right ratio that will help us on the brand penetration.

I think, again, on the momentum part of it, it was a really, really nice quarter, and we did a lot of good things and benefited from that. I think from an external standpoint, there were some tailwinds that I don't think you can plan on every quarter in terms of some of the favorable weather comparisons and that kind of thing. And we may be seeing a little bit of a softening out there right now in terms of what we're seeing in our business and the industry. So I think there's the external aspect of that. We can't do much to manage that, but I think, obviously, we're managing within that environment very well right now, and we expect to continue to do that. I'll get to your question here in a second. The key, I really think is what Tom spoke to earlier in the earlier question, in terms of sustainability, it has to come from the book of business that we have today in terms of our ability to do that. So certainly, our ability to continue to fill a pipeline with quality new account business, and that may come from different segments, to your point. We are doing some things on the retail side. We have talked a fair amount about some good work we've done over the last couple of years on the ethnic side, in particular, Hispanic. We have some more opportunity there beyond Hispanic and within Hispanic. The whole area of fresh and organic is an area that provides a lot of opportunity. So whether it's customer segments, product segments, trends in the industry, those are all opportunities for us that we are exploring and beginning to get some traction. With that said, for us to sustain what we put up here over the last several quarters, and in particular, this quarter, we need to continue to penetrate with our existing accounts, that's the most profitable business for us, bring in some new accounts from that quality pipeline and do a little bit better, and we're starting to in terms of our customer retention. So we need to do all of those things, and the good news is we are doing those things right now. So I wouldn't overreact to one quarter or another, but when you look at the year-to-date numbers, those are well within the range of what we've targeted for the 3 years, and we remain quite confident that we can deliver that."

We -- one of the things we were very careful about and meticulous about in terms of the 3-year plan was to lock in on 2 or 3 key objectives that we have financially that we thought would resonate with our investors and potential investors based upon feedback that we've got. So we locked in on operating income growth. And we also acknowledged that we would expect to grow our EPS somewhat faster over that 3-year period than the operating income growth. And we locked in on return on invested capital. And we set a goal out there for 15%. Now obviously, that was before the Brakes deal, but we're on track today within the business as it sits today, Ed, to hit or slightly surpass the 15%. Once we close on the Brakes deal, we're going to bring that in and give you some color on the impact of that. But we are very, very focused on the return of invested capital. And obviously, they come together, to your point, in terms of free cash flow and EBITDA growth. So we don't have a particular delta target, if you will, for EBITDA growth or free cash flow right now, but it's been strong here for some time. And I would expect it to continue to be strong. And in terms of how we're going to invest it, I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business. You're right. We're a little under where we thought we will be on CapEx this year. I think Joel commented that we expect to be around $500 million for the year. It's about 1%. In any given year, that could go up or down a little bit based on timing. But I think that 1%, maybe slightly more every now and then is what you should expect there. And we're going to continue to -- obviously, we're going to be very focused on assimilating Brakes in the right way and even more focused on continuing to run the business here as we've laid out. So bottom line is I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business at about 1% CapEx, increase the dividend modestly, probably not quite as fast as the earnings go up, continue to look for good acquisitions and opportunistically look at buying back shares.

It was this onetime write-off this year in this quarter, which we talked about in terms of the construction and progress write-off. It's accelerated depreciation. It's severance and what we call conversion costs, things that essentially are due to moving from the SAP system to our enhanced version of SUS. So I would think about that really as grouped in kind of those 4 different areas. And so severance again, we have a severance estimate that was actually part of that number for those 2 years."

I think it's follow-up to one of the questions that was asked earlier on the transition from deflation to inflation. So assuming that there is some inflation that reappears next year in fiscal '17, so I understand the gross margin percentage increases when you have deflation. But would you say there's also some underlying benefit when you're seeing your cost of goods going down as they've been going down over the past 2 or 3 quarters both from fuel and deflation? So would you say it's possible that your input costs are going down at a faster rate than you're passing along to some of your Broadline customers? And does any of that benefit start to get offset as you start to deal with inflation again whenever that happens?"

I mean, there's the math aspect of it, and then there's an element of that. Obviously, in our business where you turn your inventory every 20 days, it's -- you can't hold the prices for too long given the competitive environment that we're in. So to Tom's earlier point, we're always trying to strike the right balance there with what the customers' needs are. So that's certainly part of it, but I would also say to you that I'm not a big fan of deflation. So I think the longer it goes, the more challenging it becomes. People start to expect prices to continue to go down. So it's not a good place to be, but it's explainable. I mean, a lot of it -- the way we kind of got here is the center-of-the-plate, these protein categories are flat to now down, whereas a year, 18 months ago, they were up double digit. And the rest of the categories are roughly flat, maybe up a little bit or down a little bit. So it's primarily being driven in the protein area, and that's what -- that's the area that you will have to watch closely in terms of when we come out of it. But I would just echo what I've said for years and I think with Sysco set for even longer than that, that the best environment for us, and for our customers, is when you have a moderate level of inflation ideally across multiple categories, in 2%, 3%, whatever. And I would say it gets more challenging if you go to where you have 5% or 6% inflation. We've seen that and it's certainly challenging over the medium term when you have deflation. So bottom line, I feel really good about how we're managing it. I think a lot of these commercial initiatives that I'd spoke to earlier, and that Tom has spoken to, have come at just the right time in terms of managing through this process. And yes, there's some short-term benefits with deflation to your point, but medium to long term, not where we want to be."

It has certainly helped us on our cost structure, although we've managed cost extremely well outside of that impact.

This morning, Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results. Our performance reflects both the commitment of our 52,000 associates to supporting the success of our customers and the improving execution",724,"Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results. Our performance reflects both the commitment of our 52,000 associates to supporting the success of our customers and the improving execution of our strategy and 3-year plan initiatives. 
During the quarter, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 4%, while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to 1.5%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of $60 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 15% to $0.46 per share. 
These results were achieved with the benefit of favorable weather conditions and an earlier Easter holiday compared to the prior year third quarter. Consumer confidence data points, while still favorable compared to a few years ago, were somewhat uneven and track the volatile financial market activity quite closely. Lower fuel prices were likely a net positive as the impact of consumer spending benefits and reduced delivery costs offset, to some degree, the economic slowdown we are experiencing in energy-driven economies in certain parts of Texas and in Montana, North Dakota and Alberta, Canada.
Turning to specific restaurant industry data. The overall sales trends remained mixed. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant sales have been uneven during the first 3 months of 2016 after steadily rising throughout 2015. Both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK have also shown recent traffic and sales declines. However, even with this recent shopping industry performance, the overall trend remains generally favorable for our customers, as illustrated by the U.S. Census Bureau sales data for the quarter, rising 1% above the prior quarter, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of restaurant sales growth.
Moving to our results for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2016. I'm very pleased with the increasing momentum in our business. For the 9-month period ending in March, we delivered the following results: total Broadline cases grew 3.3% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 1.2% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. 
Gross profit dollars grew 3.3% and gross margin increased 35 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased $100 million or about 8% compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10%. These results are in line with our 3-year plan financial objectives: to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million and to grow earnings per share faster than operating income. 
Our progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is being driven by focusing on the following 4 key levers: accelerating local case growth; improving gross margin; leveraging supply chain costs; and reducing administrative costs. 
Regarding the reduction of administrative costs, we recently began to implement a workforce reduction of approximately 1,200 positions. We've taken a very thoughtful approach to this difficult process by focusing on prioritizing all existing work more effectively, reducing layers of management and expanding spans of control. 
We believe our approach will allow us to continue supporting our customers with a high level of service, as evidenced by the fact that we are not reducing the number of marketing associates or warehouse and delivery associates who directly support our customers. 
During the quarter, we also announced our proposed acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European food service distributor with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. We're very excited about this opportunity, as we will inherit an excellent leadership team of business whose customer-centric strategy and culture is very similar to Sysco's and 15,000 highly capable associates. We expect this acquisition will provide a solid trajectory of EBITDA growth over time and excellent platform for further acquisitions in Europe. Equally important, this transaction will not distract us from driving out our 3-year plan in our existing business. We continue to target a June or July closing.
As we end the final quarter of our fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level. We have delivered consistent local case growth for the past 2 years, expanded gross margins for 4 consecutive quarters, reduced adjusted cost per case in the field and put plans into place that will reduce administrative expenses. These actions and related results reinforce our confidence and our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives as we move forward. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."
189096,309043623,970230,"Sysco Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results. As we have mentioned a",792,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results. 
As we have mentioned a few times before, our insights-based approach to understanding, meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts and is clearly driving improved performance. For example, during the third quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.6%, including local case growth of 3.4%; gross profit dollar growth of 4.8%, including an improvement in margin of 39 basis points. 
And for operating expense, we reduced our adjusted cost per case by $0.08 or $0.03 on a neutral fuel price basis, and we had operating income growth of 11.5%. We are driving increased case growth through a variety of sales and marketing initiatives that are designed to deliver value to our customers while providing a more consistent experience of doing business with Sysco. I'm pleased to report that the third quarter represents the eighth straight quarter of local case growth.
As you know, improving gross margin is another key driver of Sysco achieving our 3-year targets. And our strong performance this quarter indicates that we are making progress towards delivering our long-term objectives. During the quarter, we delivered solid growth in key center of plate categories such as beef, pork and poultry, and we continued our growth in produce, reinforcing the benefits driven from a focus on fresh. 
We also saw a solid increase of more than 50 basis points in Sysco Brand sales with our local customers. These efforts, combined with other initiatives such as our ongoing work in category and revenue management as well as the effect of deflation, contributed to an increase in U.S. Broadline gross margin of approximately 40 basis points, the fourth quarter in a row with gross margin expansion. 
These improvements are especially noteworthy, as we've been able to manage through the current deflationary environment fairly well, due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve local case growth as a percentage of our mix as well as our continued focus on our category management process. 
Separately, the operating expense performance during the quarter was particularly strong. We limited total adjusted expense growth to only 1.5% despite case growth of more than 3%. And as mentioned, we reduced our overall cost per case in the U.S. Broadline by $0.03, excluding the impact of fuel prices. 
From a supply chain perspective, we continue to make good progress towards our goals to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. 
We have also seen good progress through a series of indirect spend initiatives. And while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year. 
In conjunction with the series of initiatives to support our long-term strategy, we are implementing a new market structure that reduces the number of U.S. Broadline geographic markets from 8 to 6 effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2017 year. Each market team will continue to be led by a market president and include key functional leaders across finance, merchandising, supply chain and human resources to provide support for our operating companies and help to drive solid execution of the various corporate initiatives. 
We believe that the work we've done in building the capability of the organization through the functional structure over the past 2 years makes this the right time for us to evolve our structure. This change will reduce overall administrative costs in the field, drive efficiency through a more standardized approach and improve execution to our customers.
In conjunction with this restructuring, I'm pleased to announce the promotion of 3 strong Sysco leaders. Greg Bertrand has been appointed Senior Vice President, U.S. Foodservice Operations with responsibility for all U.S. Broadline operating companies. We also announced that Scott Sonnemaker has been named Senior Vice President, International Foodservice Operations, Americas; and Bill Goetz has been named Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing. 
These are just a few of the key priorities and changes that are positively impacting our operational and financial results. While we need to continue to execute at a high level, I'm confident we're on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives. 
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarters' teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."
189096,309043623,970230,"Sysco Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, May 02, 2016",2016-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, particularly solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, achieved in an",969,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, particularly solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, achieved in an environment with continued deflation and currency headwinds. 
We continue to make solid progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our 3-year goals. 
We grew sales in the third quarter by approximately 2% year-over-year despite deflation of 0.4%. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories such as meats, seafood and poultry as supply recovers from various events in 2015. This deflationary trend has been persistent over the past few quarters. 
Acquisitions increased sales by 0.9% while foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1% in the third quarter. U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar was responsible for the vast majority of the foreign exchange impact. The negative impacts we've been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we began to wrap the initial decline and relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 3.1%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the third quarter was 3.3% and local was also 3.3%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins. We grew our gross profit at a solid 4.1% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 34 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.
During the third quarter, we had a few certain items that impacted our results. These include restructuring costs such as charges related to technology changes, severance and professional fees of $60 million and about $10 million of acquisition financing costs. On a GAAP basis, without excluding these certain items and the comparable certain items from the prior year, our operating income grew 15% and our diluted earnings per share grew about 27%. 
The rest of my discussion will focus on the non-GAAP or adjusted for certain items results. Adjusted operating expense grew 1.5% during the quarter and by 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This increase was mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals, and is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case. As a result, adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $438 million, up 16% compared to the prior year and 17% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.6% compared to 33.9% in the prior year period. Both quarters' tax rates were positively impacted by the favorable resolution of state tax matters.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 10% and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2016, up approximately 15% from last year. Net working capital improved by about 0.5 day during the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely driven by improvements in both receivables and inventory. 
Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $348 million and free cash flow was $641 million. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $272 million in fiscal 2016 and $128 million in fiscal 2015. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger of US Foods, and for 2015, include items related to the planning of the merger integration. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew $273 million and free cash flow grew $346 million.
Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are currently on track to hit our fiscal 2016 financial objectives. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least another quarter. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparison this year more challenging. And finally, we now expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be approximately $500 million or approximately 1% of sales.
During the quarter, we also completed a successful debt offering, the proceeds of which are to be used for the acquisition of Brakes that Bill mentioned earlier. The very attractive coupons associated with this financing, approximately 3% on a weighted average basis, represents both the strength of our balance sheet as well as impressive work by our team throughout the process. In addition, Sysco put in place hedges during the quarter that protect approximately half of the purchase price of the Brakes transaction against unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives of our 3-year plan, and we will aggressively continue to look for incremental opportunities to exceed our goals.

I think, in terms of historical context, this is by far the strongest quarter we've had over the last 4 or 5 years. And that's very encouraging and certainly something that is bringing the momentum of the business that both Tom and Joel talked about. So in terms of where it's coming from, I think it's the same answers I would give you if you'd asked about margin or even expenses at this point. It's coming from a lot of good work over the last few years on the commercial side of the business that Tom can give you a little more color on, and really good alignment, I think, with our leadership team throughout Sysco. And I would say this particular quarter, and we acknowledged it, there were some tailwinds. And I don't like to talk about weather a lot. I think that the last few third quarters, we've talked about weather. Last -- 2 years ago, we had a brutal winter at the beginning of the winter, and last year, I think it was at the end of the winter. And this year was a pretty mild winter, so I think that helped a little bit. With that said, I think I was also trying to get out there that the data out there right now is little bit mixed in terms of overall industry growth. So I think we had some tailwinds that we took advantage of. But more than anything, I think it's more of a good execution of key initiatives that [indiscernible] the commercial side over the last 3, 4 years. On the brand, and I'll kick it to Tom real quick, these things tend to go together. When you're growing your business and you're creating differentiation at the customer level, and that's what the brand allows us to do. And so we've brought renewed focus on the brand over the last few years in conjunction with our category management work. And I think we're doing it the right way, and I don't know -- we're not really chasing a number here, Kelly. I think what we're saying is the key to all this is really growing those local cases. And as we do that, we should be able to grow the brand. I don't know that there's a particular percentage that we're trying to get to other than to utilize the brand as a way to differentiate ourselves more effectively. And let me kick it to Tom here and give you a little more color on that."

Let me just add on the local case growth. You'd asked about kind of current customers, new customers. We spend a fair amount of time looking at what we call new sales, lost sales and then penetration, and think about that as new customers, any customers that we may have lost some business at or where we've done a better job of selling more to those customers. And I would tell you that all of those metrics are -- continue to head in the right direction as it relates to our local customers, meaning our new sales continue to be very strong, our lost sales have declined a little bit over the past couple of quarters and our penetration sales, which is what is delivering more to those current customers, has also been increasing. And that's a key metric for us because that tells us if we're improving in all those areas with our customers, our current customers and making sure that we're continuing to satisfy their needs. So we feel good about all those metrics and where the business is heading. And then lastly on the Sysco Brand, the only thing I'd add to what Bill said is our focus -- a lot of the category management focus is, in fact, driven towards that local customer. And based on that, the more we bring them differentiated solutions, we've talked about innovation in the last couple of quarters, is when we're bringing them new news and innovation, that actually helps us grow our Sysco Brand because generally, those products are in the Sysco Brand lineup. So it's just, I think, as Bill said, they go hand in hand. And I think this continued focus by us in bringing new and differentiated products to our customers is helping us grow that. And I would agree with Bill, we don't have a number per se that we're targeting. We know that it's important and we continue to focus on it quarter in and quarter out."

And we believe that by leveraging those routines in some of those tools out there that we're going to continue to see some benefit on the margin side.

It's hard to answer even whether I'm looking back or looking forward. But I think if you go back and look at some of the things that we've said over the last several months and putting the 3-year plan together, our whole period would be -- it would -- when we can return to a more moderate inflation environment, that we would grow the cases and at least hold margin flat, maybe grow it a little bit. And that's the plan and that's going to take a lot of cohesive execution, which we're quite confident in right now between CatMan. Tom has spoken of RevMan here a little bit ago and continue to grow those local cases. So the key is the local cases and the mix. We need to both grow both our local and corporate manage cases and kind of have that in the right ratio that will help us on the brand penetration.

I think, again, on the momentum part of it, it was a really, really nice quarter, and we did a lot of good things and benefited from that. I think from an external standpoint, there were some tailwinds that I don't think you can plan on every quarter in terms of some of the favorable weather comparisons and that kind of thing. And we may be seeing a little bit of a softening out there right now in terms of what we're seeing in our business and the industry. So I think there's the external aspect of that. We can't do much to manage that, but I think, obviously, we're managing within that environment very well right now, and we expect to continue to do that. I'll get to your question here in a second. The key, I really think is what Tom spoke to earlier in the earlier question, in terms of sustainability, it has to come from the book of business that we have today in terms of our ability to do that. So certainly, our ability to continue to fill a pipeline with quality new account business, and that may come from different segments, to your point. We are doing some things on the retail side. We have talked a fair amount about some good work we've done over the last couple of years on the ethnic side, in particular, Hispanic. We have some more opportunity there beyond Hispanic and within Hispanic. The whole area of fresh and organic is an area that provides a lot of opportunity. So whether it's customer segments, product segments, trends in the industry, those are all opportunities for us that we are exploring and beginning to get some traction. With that said, for us to sustain what we put up here over the last several quarters, and in particular, this quarter, we need to continue to penetrate with our existing accounts, that's the most profitable business for us, bring in some new accounts from that quality pipeline and do a little bit better, and we're starting to in terms of our customer retention. So we need to do all of those things, and the good news is we are doing those things right now. So I wouldn't overreact to one quarter or another, but when you look at the year-to-date numbers, those are well within the range of what we've targeted for the 3 years, and we remain quite confident that we can deliver that."

We -- one of the things we were very careful about and meticulous about in terms of the 3-year plan was to lock in on 2 or 3 key objectives that we have financially that we thought would resonate with our investors and potential investors based upon feedback that we've got. So we locked in on operating income growth. And we also acknowledged that we would expect to grow our EPS somewhat faster over that 3-year period than the operating income growth. And we locked in on return on invested capital. And we set a goal out there for 15%. Now obviously, that was before the Brakes deal, but we're on track today within the business as it sits today, Ed, to hit or slightly surpass the 15%. Once we close on the Brakes deal, we're going to bring that in and give you some color on the impact of that. But we are very, very focused on the return of invested capital. And obviously, they come together, to your point, in terms of free cash flow and EBITDA growth. So we don't have a particular delta target, if you will, for EBITDA growth or free cash flow right now, but it's been strong here for some time. And I would expect it to continue to be strong. And in terms of how we're going to invest it, I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business. You're right. We're a little under where we thought we will be on CapEx this year. I think Joel commented that we expect to be around $500 million for the year. It's about 1%. In any given year, that could go up or down a little bit based on timing. But I think that 1%, maybe slightly more every now and then is what you should expect there. And we're going to continue to -- obviously, we're going to be very focused on assimilating Brakes in the right way and even more focused on continuing to run the business here as we've laid out. So bottom line is I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business at about 1% CapEx, increase the dividend modestly, probably not quite as fast as the earnings go up, continue to look for good acquisitions and opportunistically look at buying back shares.

I mean, a lot of it -- the way we kind of got here is the center-of-the-plate, these protein categories are flat to now down, whereas a year, 18 months ago, they were up double digit. And the rest of the categories are roughly flat, maybe up a little bit or down a little bit. So it's primarily being driven in the protein area, and that's what -- that's the area that you will have to watch closely in terms of when we come out of it. But I would just echo what I've said for years and I think with Sysco set for even longer than that, that the best environment for us, and for our customers, is when you have a moderate level of inflation ideally across multiple categories, in 2%, 3%, whatever. And I would say it gets more challenging if you go to where you have 5% or 6% inflation. We've seen that and it's certainly challenging over the medium term when you have deflation. So bottom line, I feel really good about how we're managing it. I think a lot of these commercial initiatives that I'd spoke to earlier, and that Tom has spoken to, have come at just the right time in terms of managing through this process. And yes, there's some short-term benefits with deflation to your point, but medium to long term, not where we want to be."

This morning, Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results. Our performance reflects the soundness of our strategy, the commitment of our associates to supporting the success of our customers and the consistently improving execution of our 3-year plan. 
For the quarter, on a comparable 13-week basis, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of nearly 5% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of approximately 15% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 15% as well.
These results were achieved in a market environment that is experiencing uneven trends and appears to have softened somewhat of late. While consumer confidence and unemployment data points remain relatively favorable compared to a few years ago, the current sentiment for customer spending on meals away from home seems to be trending slightly downward.
Turning to specific restaurant industry data. Overall sales trends weakened as reflected in current NPD and KNAPP-TRACK traffic and spend data. That said, according to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant operator expectations remain somewhat favorable.
Moving to our results for fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with our performance during the year. The improving momentum in our business is the result of strong local case growth, gross profit growth with gross margin expansion and solid expense management. Specifically, for fiscal 2016, on an adjusted 52-week basis, we delivered the following results: total Broadline cases grew 3% and local cases grew 2.7%. Sales grew 1.5% to $50 billion even with the unfavorable impact of deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. Gross profit grew 3.6% to $9 billion and gross margin increased 38 basis points. 
Adjusted operating income increased 10% over the prior year to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. In addition, free cash flow approximated $1.4 billion and adjusted return on invested capital was 14% for the full year. I'm particularly encouraged by our progress to date toward the achievement of our 3-year planned financial objectives, especially our goal to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2018. Our strong progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is supported by a foundation that was built over the past several years through a series of commercial, supply chain and administrative initiatives. 
We continue to build on that foundation throughout fiscal 2016 by accomplishing several key objectives, including: leveraging customer insights to create new and enhanced sales and marketing programs; advancing our progress in several key commercial areas, including category and revenue management; shifting our technology strategy and related spend to a more customer-centric focus; and restructuring our business to drive greater efficiency, including streamlining our market structure, introducing a standard field organization model and further developing a functional structure in key support areas such as merchandising, supply chain and human resources.
All of these has been accomplished by consistently improving the execution of our strategy that is centered on 5 fundamental points: partnership, to profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with Sysco; productivity, to continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business; products, to enhance offerings through our customer-centric innovation program; people, leveraging talent, structure and culture to drive performance; and portfolio, continuously assessing new market opportunities and current business performance.
Regarding the latter point, we recently closed the acquisitions of -- the acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European food service distributor with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. Brakes is a highly regarded company whose management team and strategy are well aligned with the vision we have for Sysco: to be our customer's most valued and trusted business partner. 
This acquisition will serve as a platform for future expansion in Europe. We're looking forward to working together with the entire Brakes team to execute their business strategy, and we feel fortunate to welcome them into the Sysco family. Joel will discuss with you in a few minutes the anticipated contribution of Brakes to Sysco's financial results.
As we ended the new fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level, working effectively together as One Sysco, and we remain committed to the success of our customers. We have even bigger goals for fiscal 2017, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our financial and business objectives in the year ahead and throughout the 3-year plan.
The new fiscal year brings an expanded global presence, enhanced technology and continued focus on our customers. Specifically, we intend to deliver solid local case growth, increase our gross profit, reduce cost in the right way and put processing tools in place that will further enable our associates to provide our customers with industry-leading service and support.
Our past and future success is driven by the ongoing dedication and commitment of all of our associates, and I thank each of them for their effort to deliver a very successful year in fiscal 2016. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Fiscal 2016 was a great year for Sysco, and I'm proud of the contributions made by all of our associates throughout the year. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress on several key multiyear initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for success. 
Our favorable operating performance was driven by our ongoing focus on the key drivers of our 3-year plan, including accelerating our sales with local customers by providing them with exceptional service, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses. This morning, I'll provide an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they have continued to positively impact our business results.  
The first of which is our focus on accelerating local case growth. During the year, we grew U.S. Broadline local cases 2.6% on an adjusted 52-week basis, the strongest performance we've had in several years. Also on an adjusted 52-week basis, gross profit in U.S. Broadline grew 4.7% for the fiscal year and gross margin increased 47 basis points, driven by our focus on profitable case growth, revenue management activities and improved Sysco Brand penetration. 
The focus our sales team has had on helping our customers succeed and grow has been further enhanced throughout fiscal year 2016. During the year, we remain focused on improving our industry-leading category management practices, fully deploying revenue management in the field and enhancing our sales training and support tools that continue to free up our marketing associates' time to better support our customers with business building solutions. 
We also rolled out various promotional programs and key initiatives throughout the year, including those that highlight product innovation and reinforce the Sysco Brand, which delivers tremendous value to our customers. That value is delivered through an unrelenting focus on the highest-quality products and best-in-class traceability from a food safety perspective. Finally, we continue to focus on delivering new and improved customer-facing technology solutions that add value to their business and allow our associates to be more efficient.
On the cost side, the expense management throughout the year was also solid and remains a key area of focus moving forward. For U.S. Broadline, during fiscal year 2016, we limited total adjusted expense growth to only 2.2% on a comparable 52-week basis compared to gross profit growth of 4.7%. We also reduced our overall cost per case in U.S. Broadline by $0.04 during the year. Adjusting for the impact of fuel prices, our adjusted cost per case in U.S. Broadline was flat.
As we've discussed, we have been very focused on reducing cost and improving productivity while continuing to deliver improved service levels to our customers. In fiscal year 2016, we reduced expenses in a number of key areas. In the supply chain area, we have reduced indirect spend and we'll continue to focus on maximizing transportation and warehouse efficiencies. We've also standardized our organizational design and reduced the number of our markets in the U.S. from 8 to 6. And throughout the organization, we have reduced overall SG&A costs.
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our 3-year plan. In fiscal year 2016, we've made significant progress in all areas, and I remain extremely optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."

As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year.

As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong mobile case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. I'll begin my remarks by speaking to our fourth quarter.
For the purposes of matching your models, our fourth quarter results reflecting an extra week include: sales growth of 10.0%, gross profit growth of 12.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 9.6%, adjusted operating income growth of 23.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 23.1%. 
Excluding the extra week on a comparable basis, the fourth quarter results include: sales growth of 2.2%, gross profit growth of 4.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 1.7%, adjusted operating income growth of 14.6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15.4%. 
Sales during the quarter were negatively impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange of 0.5%, largely offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions of 1.2%. On a comparable 13-week basis, total Broadline case growth for the fourth quarter was 2.2%, local was 2.4% and corporate managed growth was 2.0%.
During the fourth quarter, we had some certain items that impacted our results. In the prior year, we had acquisition costs of $390 million. In the current year, we had remeasurements of foreign-denominated cash due to lower exchange rates at quarter end as well as the premium on foreign currency option contracts for the Brakes acquisition. As a result, other expense, net for the quarter, was approximately $141 million, primarily driven by certain items from fiscal 2016. 
As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35% compared to negative 6% in the prior year. Both quarters' tax rates were reduced primarily from the impact of certain items, which lowered net income and resulted in lower tax rates. A similar event occurred last year related to the US Foods termination cost, which drove an unusual GAAP tax rate. On an adjusted for certain items basis, our tax rate would have been approximately 36.8% in both years.
Now turning to our results for the year. Our fiscal 2016, including the extra week, included: sales growth of 3.5%, gross profit growth of 5.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 4%, adjusted operating income growth of 12.1% and adjusted EPS growth of 14.1%. 
To provide a relevant comparison to the prior year, all income statement measures I discuss from this point forward will be adjusted for certain items and presented on a 52-week comparable basis. Looking at our full year results, we grew sales by 1.5% year-over-year despite deflation of 0.7%. We saw continued deflation in center of the plate protein categories such as meat and seafood, along with deflation in dairy. 
Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.7%. During the year, we closed 5 acquisitions, including Gilchrist & Soames and Northstar Seafood. Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.3%, largely driven by the U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar. The negative impact we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we begin to wrap the initial decline and relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant-currency basis, sales would have been up 2.7%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had strong performance for the year. On a comparable 52-week basis, total Broadline case growth for the year was 3%, local was 2.7% and corporate managed was 3.3%.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins for the year. We grew our gross profit at a solid 3.6% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 38 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management of our beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted gross profit growth was 4.8%.
Adjusted operating expense on a comparable 52-week basis grew [ph] 2% for the year and by 3.3% on a constant-currency basis. This increase is mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals and was partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case, as Tom mentioned, which was flat, excluding fuel price changes.
As a result, adjusted operating income for the year was $1.96 billion, up 9.6% compared to the prior year and up 10.6% on a constant-currency basis. Compared to the prior year on a 52-week basis, adjusted net earnings grew 8% and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion, up approximately 24% from last year. It is important to note that a timing difference in tax payments impacted our cash flow during fiscal 2016.
Net working capital improved by 6/10 of 1 day [ph] for the full year compared to last year. This was largely driven by improvements in inventory. Net CapEx for the full year was $504 million and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow included the cash impact of certain items of $280 million in fiscal 2016. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to termination of the proposed merger with US Foods. Lastly, we improved our adjusted return on invested capital to approximately 14% during the fiscal year, up from approximately 13% in the prior year. 
Now I'd like to close some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2017. The deflationary trend has been persistent over the last 4 quarters and will likely continue for the remainder of the calendar year, creating a modest sales and gross profit headwind for the first half year. 
The restaurant environment appears to be softening, and as a result, we anticipate modest case volume growth for the next quarter or 2. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately 1% of sales, including Brakes. We intend to continue to improve working capital days to achieve our 3-year planned goal of 4 days improvement when comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015. And we expect to complete our $3 billion 2-year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2017, driven by reduction in average shares outstanding.
Regarding the addition of Brakes to Sysco's financial results, we expect the combined company will have roughly $55 billion in annualized revenue on a pro forma basis. In their most recent fiscal year ending December of 2015, Brakes reported nearly $5 billion in revenue, up roughly approximately 6.5% from 2014. They also reported an approximately 5% adjusted EBITDA margin with a double-digit growth rate. 
Roughly 2/3 of their revenue comes from the United Kingdom where they have a leading share. We continue to believe this acquisition will be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by lower to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. This acquisition is also expected to reduce our normalized effective tax rate to about 35% to 36%.
In summary, we had a strong quarter and year, reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.
Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

While you're right, there are some reports out there of some traffic headwinds for some of these folks, the good news for them obviously is in the deflationary environment is their cost of products, in general, are not necessarily going up, so that's been a good thing for those restaurant operators. But from our perspective, we spend a lot of our time trying to think about what are those areas where we can help them be more successful. And you mentioned labor rates potentially going up, that's obviously a key concern of many of these operators today. And so whether it's Sysco Brand, where we bring not only value but also things I talked about, which is great reliability and traceability and high-quality products, that's a big area of focus for us. These tools, things -- think about some of the innovative products we're bringing, we're focused on how do we reduce the labor cost for these operators. So if there are products that are labor-saving type of products in the preparation that allows them to leverage some of those things to offset maybe some potential labor increases they're seeing. And as Bill said, I think technology and tools, in general, that allow them to manage their business more efficiently are also things we're focused on. So it's a really combination of things, but it's -- you're right, there's a lot of things that they're dealing with and I think the more we can focus on helping them be successful, that's a good place for us to be."

And I think the implied thought would be that once there was certainty, then things would kind of bounce back a little bit. I think I assumed certainly would be to remain and obviously went the other way. So now what you got is continued uncertainty. So I just think it's going to be extended period of time here. And I think it'll play out politically, it'll play out economically. So a little slower in the U.K. right now. The good news for us is we've seen some good things coming out of France and Sweden, albeit that's about 1/3 of their business. So I think as far as Brexit is concerned, I think we're all watching it.

I'll start and let Joel give you detail a little bit more. I would say in terms of why our performance for '16 was better than originally what we projected, I think part of it is just having the time to refine the plan and to go deep on the plan and our execution was just very good. And so if you put all those some type of context, our merger agreement with US Foods was terminated in late June. We regrouped as a management team very quickly, and in July put together the framework over the 3-year plan and share to that with the investor group in September and along with our board. And so I wouldn't say we were cautious but we certainly were thoughtful in terms of what we were leading people to. And as we've built some momentum, if you'll recall first quarter, we had a very solid quarter in U.S. Broadline, but there's some tailwinds with incentives and that kind of -- our headwinds with incentives, and the first quarter was a little flattish and then very strong second, third and fourth. So we built momentum as the year went along to bring it back to the numbers, we've been able to manage this deflationary environment very well and create a good spread between our gross profit growth and our expense growth by managing our expenses very smartly and thoughtfully. So overall, I would just say the execution has been good, very good. And as we got deeper into the year, we were able to raise our estimate to $500 million. Not quite ready to do that right now would like to give further into this plan. We're 1/3 of the way through it, so I'd like to see another quarter or 2 and see how we perform, see how the marketplace performs and reassess that outlook at that point in time. Joel?"

So let me take the first part and I'll let Tom talk about the segments a little bit. I think it's just what you said. I mean, we, and obviously, anybody in this business understands that where we have the opportunity to bring the most value is in that locally managed, highly street-oriented customer base and we continue to focus there in a myriad of ways that we spoke to in terms of commercial initiatives, supply chain, all that type of thing. And that's continued to pay dividends for us here over the last 2 years-plus. So we feel good about that. We also want to continue to grow that corporate managed business in the right way. And so you're seeing the slope of that growth follow somewhat. It's still positive and there's still very, very important relationships we have out there are some very large customers that work for us as well from a profitability standpoint. So balance is always key here. And it's key if you're running an operating company and it's key from the overall corporate standpoint and which you saw here was a quarter with pretty good balance. And any point in time, one segment, if you want to call it that for the moment, may be growing a little faster than the other, and that's okay, but generally we're looking to grow both in the right way with good discipline. And we've been making great strides here over the last year or 2. So I'll let Tom speak a little bit to the segment performance."

For us I think it's a really -- as Bill said, a balance. And so looking at different customers and relative profitability in where we can actually have the most value is where we're trying to focus our efforts. And clearly, that's in that local restaurant segment certainly probably more so than in the chain restaurant segment.

They are, as we've alluded to in the past, going through some significant transformative changes of their own, a fair amount of which is playing out in the supply chain in the United Kingdom, where they're consolidating warehouses into warehouses that look more like ours where you have multiple capacity, storage capacity all in one building, which in and of itself will create cost savings, improved productivity that kind of thing. So certainly, the supply chain, in particular in the U.K., is an opportunity for Brakes to expand their margins but there's other opportunities as well starting with growing with the right customers and making sure that those customers are interfacing with them and ordering product in the way that they want sort of channels that they prefer.

It's been a focus area for us. And so we continue to look at those types of opportunities where there's nice kind of tailwinds that we can provide incremental value to those folks and also grow our business.

That's more than the sales of many, many of the people that we compete with head to head. So that's a huge number that we've been able to grow very nicely on an adjusted basis over the last year to 2 years. And how do we do that? I mean, it comes back to the levers that we talked about. Case growth with a particular emphasis on local case growth, managing the margins, utilizing a lot of tools, many of which are technology-based today and taking a hard look at where our potential is in terms of territories within each district within each OpCo. So assessing the opportunity for growth by territory, by district, by OpCo, taking advantage of some of the revenue management tools that Tom and his teams or have put in place over the last year to just know beginning to mature, continue to utilize category management across both from leveraging our spend but also bringing innovation to that product, staying close to our customers, refining our customer insight to be as currently possibly can into some of the need to some of those operators are as they face the challenges. So you have to start with gross profit, and your ability to grow those dollars, and we've done a nice job then expect us to continue to do well. With that said, as I said in terms of the pillars of our strategy, we need to be more productive and everything we do. And we set some goals out there and certainly running the business at a flat cost per piece for yet another year here is a very appropriate, yet aggressive goal, and it's going to be paramount for us to have success this year to do that. So we've got some good momentum there in supply chain. We're managing our SG&A very well. So I feel very good about our corporate spend as well. We're still spending some money in business technology to kind of tools that we've been talking about year in particular on the commercial side. So I think we're spending the money in the right place. Over time, we'll continue to flatten out that corporate spend, try to keep the flat cost per case, keep cost per case flat in the field and that combination of good solid gross profit growth and well-managed expenses should serve us very well."

This morning, Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results. Our performance reflects the soundness of our strategy, the commitment of our associates to supporting the success of our customers and the consistently improving execution of our 3-year plan. 
For the quarter, on a comparable 13-week basis, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of nearly 5%, while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of approximately 15% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 15% as well.
These results were achieved in a market environment that is experiencing uneven trends and appears to have softened somewhat of late. While consumer confidence and unemployment data points remain relatively favorable compared to a few years ago, the current sentiment for customer spending on meals away from home seems to be trending slightly downward.
Turning to specific restaurant industry data. Overall sales trends weakened as reflected in current NPD and KNAPP-TRACK traffic and spend data. That said, according to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant operator expectations remain somewhat favorable.
Moving to our results for fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with our performance during the year. The improving momentum in our business is the result of strong local case growth, gross profit growth with gross margin expansion and solid expense management. Specifically, for fiscal 2016, on an adjusted 52-week basis, we delivered the following results: total Broadline cases grew 3% and local cases grew 2.7%. Sales grew 1.5% to $50 billion even with the unfavorable impact of deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. Gross profit grew 3.6% to $9 billion and gross margin increased 38 basis points. 
Adjusted operating income increased 10% over the prior year to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. In addition, free cash flow approximated $1.4 billion and adjusted return on invested capital was 14% for the full year. I'm particularly encouraged by our progress to date toward the achievement of our 3-year plan financial objectives, especially our goal to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2018. Our strong progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is supported by a foundation that was built over the past several years through a series of commercial, supply chain and administrative initiatives. 
We continue to build on that foundation throughout fiscal 2016 by accomplishing several key objectives, including: leveraging customer insights to create new and enhanced sales and marketing programs; advancing our progress in several key commercial areas, including category and revenue management; shifting our technology strategy and related spend to a more customer-centric focus; and restructuring our business to drive greater efficiency, including streamlining our market structure, introducing a standard field organization model and further developing a functional structure in key support areas such as merchandising, supply chain and human resources.
All of these has been accomplished by consistently improving the execution of our strategy that is centered on 5 fundamental points: partnership, to profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with Sysco; productivity, to continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business; products, to enhance offerings through our customer-centric innovation program; people, leveraging talent, structure and culture to drive performance; and portfolio, continuously assessing new market opportunities and current business performance.
Regarding the latter point, we recently closed the acquisitions of -- the acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European food service distributor, with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. Brakes is a highly regarded company whose management team and strategy are well aligned with the vision we have for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. 
This acquisition will serve as a platform for future expansion in Europe. We're looking forward to working together with the entire Brakes team to execute their business strategy, and we feel fortunate to welcome them into the Sysco family. Joel will discuss with you in a few minutes the anticipated contribution of Brakes to Sysco's financial results.
As we ended the new fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level, working effectively together as One Sysco, and we remain committed to the success of our customers. We have even bigger goals for fiscal 2017, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our financial and business objectives in the year ahead and throughout the 3-year plan.
The new fiscal year brings an expanded global presence, enhanced technology and continued focus on our customers. Specifically, we intend to deliver solid local case growth, increase our gross profit, reduce cost in the right way and put processing tools in place that will further enable our associates to provide our customers with industry-leading service and support.
Our past and future success is driven by the ongoing dedication and commitment of all of our associates, and I thank each of them for their effort to deliver a very successful year in fiscal 2016. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Fiscal 2016 was a great year for Sysco, and I'm proud of the contributions made by all of our associates throughout the year. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress on several key multiyear initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for success. 
Our favorable operating performance was driven by our ongoing focus on the key drivers of our 3-year plan, including accelerating our sales with local customers by providing them with exceptional service, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses. This morning, I'll provide an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they have continued to positively impact our business results.  
The first of which is our focus on accelerating local case growth. During the year, we grew U.S. Broadline local cases 2.6% on an adjusted 52-week basis, the strongest performance we've had in several years. Also on an adjusted 52-week basis, gross profit in U.S. Broadline grew 4.7% for the fiscal year and gross margin increased 47 basis points, driven by our focus on profitable case growth, revenue management activities and improved Sysco Brand penetration. 
The focus our sales team has had on helping our customers succeed and grow has been further enhanced throughout fiscal year 2016. During the year, we remain focused on improving our industry-leading category management practices, fully deploying revenue management in the field and enhancing our sales training and support tools that continue to free up our marketing associates' time to better support our customers with business building solutions. 
We also rolled out various promotional programs and key initiatives throughout the year, including those that highlight product innovation and reinforce the Sysco Brand, which delivers tremendous value to our customers. That value is delivered through an unrelenting focus on the highest-quality products and best-in-class traceability from a food safety perspective. Finally, we continue to focus on delivering new and improved customer-facing technology solutions that add value to their business and allow our associates to be more efficient.
On the cost side, the expense management throughout the year was also solid, and it remains a key area of focus moving forward. For U.S. Broadline, during fiscal year 2016, we limited total adjusted expense growth to only 2.2% on a comparable 52-week basis compared to gross profit growth of 4.7%. We also reduced our overall cost per case in U.S. Broadline by $0.04 during the year. Adjusting for the impact of fuel prices, our adjusted cost per case in U.S. Broadline was flat.
As we've discussed, we have been very focused on reducing cost and improving productivity while continuing to deliver improved service levels to our customers. In fiscal year 2016, we reduced expenses in a number of key areas. In the supply chain area, we have reduced indirect spend and we'll continue to focus on maximizing transportation and warehouse efficiencies. We've also standardized our organizational design and reduced the number of our markets in the U.S. from 8 to 6. And throughout the organization, we have reduced overall SG&A costs.
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our 3-year plan. In fiscal year 2016, we've made significant progress in all areas, and I remain extremely optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."
189096,309043639,1035419,"Sysco Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2016",2016-08-15,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong mobile case",1306,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong mobile case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. I'll begin my remarks by speaking to our fourth quarter.
For the purposes of matching your models, our fourth quarter results reflecting an extra week, include: sales growth of 10.0%, gross profit growth of 12.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 9.6%, adjusted operating income growth of 23.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 23.1%. 
Excluding the extra week on a comparable basis, the fourth quarter results include: sales growth of 2.2%, gross profit growth of 4.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 1.7%, adjusted operating income growth of 14.6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15.4%.
Sales during the quarter were negatively impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange of 0.5%, largely offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions of 1.2%. On a comparable 13-week basis, total Broadline case growth for the fourth quarter was 2.2%, local was 2.4% and corporate managed growth was 2.0%.
During the fourth quarter, we had some certain items that impacted our results. In the prior year, we had acquisition costs of $390 million. In the current year, we had remeasurements of foreign-denominated cash due to lower exchange rates at quarter end as well as the premium on foreign currency option contracts for the Brakes acquisition. As a result, other expense, net for the quarter, was approximately $141 million, primarily driven by certain items from fiscal 2016. 
As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35% compared to negative 6% in the prior year. Both quarters' tax rates were reduced primarily from the impact of certain items, which lowered net income and resulted in lower tax rates. A similar event occurred last year related to the US Foods termination cost, which drove an unusual GAAP tax rate. On an adjusted for certain items basis, our tax rate would have been approximately 36.8% in both years.
Now turning to our results for the year. Our fiscal 2016, including the extra week, included: sales growth of 3.5%, gross profit growth of 5.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 4%, adjusted operating income growth of 12.1% and adjusted EPS growth of 14.1%. 
To provide a relevant comparison to the prior year, all income statement measures I'd discuss from this point forward will be adjusted for certain items and presented on a 52-week comparable basis. Looking at our full year results, we grew sales by 1.5% year-over-year despite deflation of 0.7%. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories such as meat and seafood, along with deflation in dairy. 
Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.7%. During the year, we closed 5 acquisitions, including Gilchrist & Soames and North Star Seafood. Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.3%, largely driven by the U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar. The negative impact we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we begin to wrap the initial decline and relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant-currency basis, sales would have been up 2.7%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had strong performance for the year. On a comparable 52-week basis, total Broadline case growth for the year was 3%, local was 2.7% and corporate managed was 3.3%.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins for the year. We grew our gross profit at a solid 3.6% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 38 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management of our beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit growth was 4.8%.
Adjusted operating expense on a comparable 52-week basis grew 2% for the year and by 3.3% on a constant currency basis. This increase is mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals and was partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case, as Tom mentioned, which was flat, excluding fuel price changes.
As a result, adjusted operating income for the year was $1.96 billion, up 9.6% compared to the prior year and up 10.6% on a constant currency basis. Compared to the prior year on a 52-week basis, adjusted net earnings grew 8% and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion, up approximately 24% from last year. It is important to note that a timing difference in tax payments impacted our cash flow during fiscal 2016.
Net working capital improved by 0.6 day for the full year compared to last year. This was largely driven by improvements in inventory. Net CapEx for the full year was $504 million and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow included the cash impact of certain items of $280 million in fiscal 2016. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods. Lastly, we improved our adjusted return on invested capital to approximately 14% during the fiscal year, up from approximately 13% in the prior year. 
Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2017. The deflationary trend has been persistent over the last 4 quarters and will likely continue for the remainder of the calendar year, creating a modest sales and gross profit headwind for the first half year. 
The restaurant environment appears to be softening, and as a result, we anticipate modest case volume growth for the next quarter or 2. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately 1% of sales, including Brakes. We intend to continue to improve working capital days to achieve our 3-year plan goal of 4 days improvement when comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015. And we expect to complete our $3 billion 2-year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2017, driven by reduction in average shares outstanding.
Regarding the addition of Brakes to Sysco's financial results, we expect the combined company will have roughly $55 billion in annualized revenue on a pro forma basis. In their most recent fiscal year ending December of 2015, Brakes reported nearly $5 billion in revenue, up roughly approximately 6.5% from 2014. They also reported an approximately 5% adjusted EBITDA margin with a double-digit growth rate. 
Roughly 2/3 of their revenue comes from the United Kingdom where they have a leading share. We continue to believe this acquisition will be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by lower to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. This acquisition is also expected to reduce our normalized effective tax rate to about 35% to 36%.
In summary, we had a strong quarter and year, reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.
Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

Well, you're right, there are some reports out there of some traffic headwinds for some of these folks. The good news for them, obviously, is in the deflationary environment is their cost of products, in general, are not necessarily going up, so that's been a good thing for those restaurant operators. But from our perspective, we spend a lot of our time trying to think about what are those areas where we can help them be more successful. And you mentioned labor rates potentially going up, that's obviously a key concern of many of these operators today. And so whether it's a Sysco Brand, where we bring not only value but also just things I talked about, which is great reliability and traceability and high-quality products, that's a big area of focus for us. These tools, things -- think about  these as some of the innovative products we're bringing, we're focused on how do we reduce the labor cost for these operators. So if there are products that are labor-saving type of products in the preparation that allows them to leverage some of those things to offset maybe some potential labor increases they're seeing. And as Bill said, I think technology and tools, in general, that allow them to manage their business more efficiently are also things we're focused on. So it's a really combination of things, but it's -- you're right, there's a lot of things that they're dealing with and I think the more we can focus on helping them be successful, that's a good place for us to be."

And I think the implied thought would be that once there was certainty, then things would kind of bounce back a little bit. I think I'd assume that this certainly would be -- to remain and, obviously, it went the other way. So now what you got is continued uncertainty. So I just think it's going to be extended period of time here. And I think it'll play out politically, it'll play out economically. So it is a little slower in the U.K. right now. The good news for us is we're seeing some good things coming out of France and Sweden, albeit that's about 1/3 of their business. So I think as far as Brexit is concerned, I think we're all watching it. And to this point, I don't know that I've seen any clear analysis in terms of what the specific impact is going to be at a certain point in time. My judgment would say that it's going to play out over the next 2 or 3 years. It will become business-as-usual here over that period of time, and it'll be somewhat of a headwind in the context of uncertainty that our people will work through in their marketplace."

I'll start and let Joel get into detail a little bit more. I would say in terms of why our performance for '16 was better than originally what we projected, I think part of it is just having the time to refine the plan and to go deep on the plan, and our execution was just very good. So if you put all these to some type of context, our merger agreement with US Foods was terminated in late June. We regrouped, as a management team, very quickly, and in July put together the framework over the 3-year plan and shared that with the investor group in September and along the way with our board. And so I wouldn't say we were cautious, but we certainly were thoughtful in terms of what we were leading people to. And as we've built some momentum, if you'll recall, first quarter, we had a very solid quarter in U.S. Broadline, but there's some tailwinds with incentives and that kind of -- or headwinds with incentives, and the first quarter was a little flattish, and then very strong second, third and fourth. So we've built momentum as the year went along to bring it back to the numbers. We've been able to manage this deflationary environment very well and create a good spread between our gross profit growth and our expense growth by managing our expenses very smartly and thoughtfully. So overall, I would just say, the execution has been good, very good. And as we got deeper into the year, we were able to raise our estimate to $500 million. We're not quite ready to do that right now. But I think if further into this plan, we're 1/3 of the way through it, so I'd like to see another quarter or 2 and see how we perform, see how the marketplace performs and reassess that outlook at that point in time.

And so that's certainly -- again, this has generated a good part of the free cash flow. You talked about the focus we've had on working capital. We've had some -- we had some aggressive goals at the start of our 3-year plan, and I think the -- one of the primary benefits this year was in our focus on inventory. We made some good progress in that area. And I think you'll continue to see opportunities there, again, both, you called out, in the payables area as well as inventory and some in AR as well. So we've got some continued focus on working capital that I believe we're making good progress on and we'll continue to drive that. We did have some benefit this year, as I mentioned, some timing issues on cash taxes, things that were related to the timing of payments and the ability to accelerate some deductions. Having said that, we also did have something -- some stuff going the other way on the US Foods payments that we made in the first quarter this year. So I would guess -- what I would say to you in general is I think the level of free cash flow you're seeing that we experienced this year is a pretty reasonable view of what I believe this business can generate here as we move forward over the next couple of years. And so I think we're in a good place and we're going to continue driving the initiatives that we're driving and continue to improve that performance as well."

So let me take the first part and then let Tom talk about the segments a little bit. I think it's just what you said. I mean, I -- we and obviously anybody in this business understands that where we have the opportunity to bring the most value is in that locally managed, highly street-oriented customer base and we continue to focus there in a myriad of ways that we spoke to in terms of commercial initiatives, supply chain, all that type of thing. And that's continued to pay dividends for us here over the last 2 years-plus. And so we feel good about that. We also want to continue to grow that corporate managed business in the right way. And so you've seen the slope of that growth fall somewhat. It's still positive. And there are still very, very important relationships we have out there, some -- with some very large customers that work for us as well from a profitability standpoint. So balance is always key here. And it's a key if you're running an operating company and it's key from the overall corporate standpoint. And what you saw here is a quarter with pretty good balance. So in any point in time, one segment, if you want to call it that for the moment, may be growing a little faster than the other, and that's okay. But generally, we're looking to grow both in the right way with good discipline and we've been making great strides here over the last year or 2. So I'll let Tom speak a little bit to the segment performance."

For us, I think it's a really, as Bill said, a balance. And so looking at different customers and their relative profitability and where we can actually have the most value is where we are trying to focus our efforts. And clearly, that's in that local restaurant segment certainly probably more so than in the chain restaurant segment.

So certainly, the supply chain, in particular in the U.K., is an opportunity for Brakes to expand their margins.

It's been a focus area for us. And so we continue to look at those types of opportunities where there's nice kind of tailwinds that we can provide incremental value to those folks and also grow our business.

Of course, the deal closed right after the year, and so we had -- the balance sheet needs to be revalued to the exchange rate that exists at that point in time. Our team did a great job of hedging to protect us on the upside and purchasing currency opportunistically to maximize our ability to minimize that foreign exchange devaluation.

So our numbers are modest, but they're beginning to grow. But again, the overall target is -- here is to drive the business in the right way. It's not necessarily at a particular percentage. Go ahead, Tom."

Now -- through the fourth quarter now, we're seeing over 10% of our orders from these local customers coming through this mobile or digital platform. So we do see some progression continue to happen. But as Bill said, it's really for us about creating the environment where they can order how they want, when they want and where they want. And so there were also a few tools we needed to build to be able to get in place to enable them to do that more effectively, and we've got some of those tools now in place and that we believe we'll continue to see that number grow as more customers have that interest. But we also know from a lot of work we do that our marketing associates are one of the most highest valued resource we have and that we provide our customers. So we're trying to make sure that we balance the -- how they order with the service and support they need to get day in and day out from our selling resources. So we feel good about the progress, but certainly, we'll probably see that continue to grow. But we're very focused on that overall customer experience and letting them choose."

So there's maybe a little bit of a modest correction. I don't think that, that's an overriding issue. I think it's somewhat self-correcting. We don't really track our sales -- new stores. The way we track it, Mark, is we track new business for us, which is making a count to an operator that we didn't sell a year ago this time. Then we track lost business, which is just the opposite where we had a sale a year ago and we don't have any. And then we track penetration.

That's more than the sales of many, many of the people that we compete with head to head. So that's a huge number that we've been able to grow very nicely on an adjusted basis over the last year to 2 years. And how do we do that? I mean, it comes back to the levers that we've talked about: case growth with a particular emphasis on local case growth; managing the margins; utilizing a lot of the tools, many of which are technology based today; and taking a good, hard look at where our potential is in terms of territories within each district, within each OpCo. So assessing the opportunity for growth by territory, by district, by OpCo; taking advantage of some of the revenue management tools that Tom and his teams are -- have put in place over the last year that are just now beginning to mature; continue to utilize the category management process both from leveraging our spend but also bringing innovation to that product; staying close to our customers; refining our customer insight where -- to be as current that we possibly can in terms of what the needs of those operators are as they face the challenges. So you have to start with gross profit and your ability to grow those dollars. And we've done a nice job there, and I expect us to continue to do well. With that said, as I said in terms of the pillars of our strategy, we need to be more productive in everything we do. And we've set some goals out there, and certainly running the business at a flat cost per piece for yet another year here is a very appropriate yet aggressive goal, and it's going to be paramount for us to have success this year to do that. So we've got some good momentum there in the supply chain. We're managing our SG&A very well. So I feel very good about our corporate spend as well. We're still spending some money in business technology to kind of create those tools that we've been talking about year in particular on the commercial side. So I think we're spending the money in the right place. Over time, we'll continue to flatten out that corporate spend, try to keep the flat cost per case -- keep cost per case flat in the field. And that combination of good, solid gross profit growth and well-managed expenses should serve us very well."

And so even in times when we've had some impact of deflation on the gross profit dollars, again we've continued to focus on driving the expenses to where we look at that spread. And again, on a year-to-date basis, we're up a little over 1.5% in terms of that delta between those 2. And so the only other thing I may call out is just to think about -- because that's certainly the way we think about that.

But we have the tools to make sure we're highly competitive in our key items but also where there's opportunity to grow.

This morning, Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results. Our performance reflects the soundness of our strategy, the commitment of our associates to supporting the success of our customers and the consistently improving execution of our 3-year plan. 
For the quarter, on a comparable 13-week basis, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of nearly 5%, while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of approximately 15% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 15% as well.
These results were achieved in a market environment that is experiencing uneven trends and appears to have softened somewhat of late. While consumer confidence and unemployment data points remain relatively favorable compared to a few years ago, the current sentiment for customer spending on meals away from home seems to be trending slightly downward.
Turning to specific restaurant industry data. Overall sales trends weakened as reflected in current NPD and KNAPP-TRACK traffic and spend data. That said, according to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant operator expectations remain somewhat favorable.
Moving to our results for fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with our performance during the year. The improving momentum in our business is the result of strong local case growth, gross profit growth with gross margin expansion and solid expense management. Specifically, for fiscal 2016, on an adjusted 52-week basis, we delivered the following results: Total Broadline cases grew 3% and local cases grew 2.7%. Sales grew 1.5% to $50 billion even with the unfavorable impact of deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. Gross profit grew 3.6% to $9 billion and gross margin increased 38 basis points. 
Adjusted operating income increased 10% over the prior year to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. In addition, free cash flow approximated $1.4 billion and adjusted return on invested capital was 14% for the full year. I'm particularly encouraged by our progress to date toward the achievement of our 3-year plan financial objectives, especially our goal to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2018. Our strong progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is supported by a foundation that was built over the past several years through a series of commercial, supply chain and administrative initiatives. 
We continue to build on that foundation throughout fiscal 2016 by accomplishing several key objectives, including: leveraging customer insights to create new and enhanced sales and marketing programs; advancing our progress in several key commercial areas, including category and revenue management; shifting our technology strategy and related spend to a more customer-centric focus; and restructuring our business to drive greater efficiency, including streamlining our market structure, introducing a standard field organization model and further developing a functional structure in key support areas such as merchandising, supply chain and human resources.
All of this has been accomplished by consistently improving the execution of our strategy that is centered on 5 fundamental points: partnership, to profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with Sysco; productivity, to continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business; products, to enhance offerings through our customer-centric innovation program; people, leveraging talent, structure and culture to drive performance; and portfolio, continuously assessing new market opportunities and current business performance.
Regarding the latter point, we recently closed the acquisitions of -- the acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European food service distributor, with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. Brakes is a highly regarded company whose management team and strategy are well aligned with the vision we have for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. 
This acquisition will serve as a platform for future expansion in Europe. We're looking forward to working together with the entire Brakes team to execute their business strategy, and we feel fortunate to welcome them into the Sysco family. Joel will discuss with you in a few minutes the anticipated contribution of Brakes to Sysco's financial results.
As we ended the new fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level, working effectively together as One Sysco, and we remain committed to the success of our customers. We have even bigger goals for fiscal 2017, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our financial and business objectives in the year ahead and throughout the 3-year plan.
The new fiscal year brings an expanded global presence, enhanced technology and continued focus on our customers. Specifically, we intend to deliver solid local case growth, increase our gross profit, reduce cost in the right way and put processing tools in place that will further enable our associates to provide our customers with industry-leading service and support.
Our past and future success is driven by the ongoing dedication and commitment of all of our associates, and I thank each of them for their effort to deliver a very successful year in fiscal 2016. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Fiscal 2016 was a great year for Sysco, and I'm proud of the contributions made by all of our associates throughout the year. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress on several key multiyear initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for success. 
Our favorable operating performance was driven by our ongoing focus on the key drivers of our 3-year plan, including accelerating our sales with local customers by providing them with exceptional service, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses. This morning I'll provide an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they have continued to positively impact our business results. 
The first of which is our focus on accelerating local case growth. During the year, we grew U.S. Broadline local cases 2.6% on an adjusted 52-week basis, the strongest performance we've had in several years. Also on an adjusted 52-week basis, gross profit in U.S. Broadline grew 4.7% for the fiscal year and gross margin increased 47 basis points, driven by our focus on profitable case growth, revenue management activities and improved Sysco Brand penetration. 
The focus our sales team has had on helping our customers succeed and grow has been further enhanced throughout fiscal year 2016. During the year, we remain focused on improving our industry-leading category management practices, fully deploying revenue management in the field and enhancing our sales training and support tools that continue to free up our marketing associates' time to better support our customers with business building solutions. 
We also rolled out various promotional programs and key initiatives throughout the year, including those that highlight product innovation and reinforce the Sysco Brand, which delivers tremendous value to our customers. That value is delivered through an unrelenting focus on the highest-quality products and best-in-class traceability from a food safety perspective. Finally, we continue to focus on delivering new and improved customer-facing technology solutions that add value to their business and allow our associates to be more efficient.
On the cost side, the expense management throughout the year was also solid, and it remains a key area of focus moving forward. For U.S. Broadline, during fiscal year 2016, we limited total adjusted expense growth to only 2.2% on a comparable 52-week basis compared to gross profit growth of 4.7%. We also reduced our overall cost per case in U.S. Broadline by $0.04 during the year. Adjusting for the impact of fuel prices, our adjusted cost per case in U.S. Broadline was flat.
As we've discussed, we have been very focused on reducing cost and improving productivity while continuing to deliver improved service levels to our customers. In fiscal year 2016, we reduced expenses in a number of key areas. In the supply chain area, we have reduced indirect spend and we'll continue to focus on maximizing transportation and warehouse efficiencies. We've also standardized our organizational design and reduced the number of our markets in the U.S. from 8 to 6. And throughout the organization, we have reduced overall SG&A costs.
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our 3-year plan. In fiscal year 2016, we've made significant progress in all areas, and I remain extremely optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."
189096,309043639,1035572,"Sysco Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 15, 2016",2016-08-15,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case",1306,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. I'll begin my remarks by speaking to our fourth quarter.
For the purposes of matching your models, our fourth quarter results reflecting an extra week, include: sales growth of 10.0%, gross profit growth of 12.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 9.6%, adjusted operating income growth of 23.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 23.1%. 
Excluding the extra week on a comparable basis, the fourth quarter results include: sales growth of 2.2%, gross profit growth of 4.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 1.7%, adjusted operating income growth of 14.6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15.4%.
Sales during the quarter were negatively impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange of 0.5%, largely offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions of 1.2%. On a comparable 13-week basis, total Broadline case growth for the fourth quarter was 2.2%, local was 2.4% and corporate managed growth was 2.0%.
During the fourth quarter, we had some certain items that impacted our results. In the prior year, we had acquisition costs of $390 million. In the current year, we had remeasurements of foreign-denominated cash due to lower exchange rates at quarter end as well as the premium on foreign currency option contracts for the Brakes acquisition. As a result, other expense, net for the quarter, was approximately $141 million, primarily driven by certain items from fiscal 2016. 
As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35% compared to negative 6% in the prior year. Both quarters' tax rates were reduced primarily from the impact of certain items, which lowered net income and resulted in lower tax rates. A similar event occurred last year related to the US Foods termination cost, which drove an unusual GAAP tax rate. On an adjusted for certain items basis, our tax rate would have been approximately 36.8% in both years.
Now turning to our results for the year. Our fiscal 2016, including the extra week, included: sales growth of 3.5%, gross profit growth of 5.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 4%, adjusted operating income growth of 12.1% and adjusted EPS growth of 14.1%. 
To provide a relevant comparison to the prior year, all income statement measures I discuss from this point forward will be adjusted for certain items and presented on a 52-week comparable basis. Looking at our full year results, we grew sales by 1.5% year-over-year despite deflation of 0.7%. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories such as meat and seafood, along with deflation in dairy. 
Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.7%. During the year, we closed 5 acquisitions, including Gilchrist & Soames and North Star Seafood. Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.3%, largely driven by the U.S. dollar's strength against the Canadian dollar. The negative impact we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we begin to wrap the initial decline and relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant-currency basis, sales would have been up 2.7%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had strong performance for the year. On a comparable 52-week basis, total Broadline case growth for the year was 3%, local was 2.7% and corporate managed was 3.3%.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins for the year. We grew our gross profit at a solid 3.6% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 38 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management of our beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit growth was 4.8%.
Adjusted operating expense on a comparable 52-week basis grew 2% for the year and by 3.3% on a constant currency basis. This increase is mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals and was partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case, as Tom mentioned, which was flat, excluding fuel price changes.
As a result, adjusted operating income for the year was $1.96 billion, up 9.6% compared to the prior year and up 10.6% on a constant currency basis. Compared to the prior year on a 52-week basis, adjusted net earnings grew 8% and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion, up approximately 24% from last year. It is important to note that a timing difference in tax payments impacted our cash flow during fiscal 2016.
Net working capital improved by 0.6 day for the full year compared to last year. This was largely driven by improvements in inventory. Net CapEx for the full year was $504 million and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow included the cash impact of certain items of $280 million in fiscal 2016. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods. Lastly, we improved our adjusted return on invested capital to approximately 14% during the fiscal year, up from approximately 13% in the prior year. 
Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2017. The deflationary trend has been persistent over the last 4 quarters and will likely continue for the remainder of the calendar year, creating a modest sales and gross profit headwind for the first half year. 
The restaurant environment appears to be softening, and as a result, we anticipate modest case volume growth for the next quarter or 2. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately 1% of sales, including Brakes. We intend to continue to improve working capital days to achieve our 3-year plan goal of 4 days' improvement when comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015. And we expect to complete our $3 billion 2-year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2017, driven by reduction in average shares outstanding.
Regarding the addition of Brakes to Sysco's financial results, we expect the combined company will have roughly $55 billion in annualized revenue on a pro forma basis. In their most recent fiscal year ending December of 2015, Brakes reported nearly $5 billion in revenue, up roughly approximately 6.5% from 2014. They also reported an approximately 5% adjusted EBITDA margin with a double-digit growth rate. 
Roughly 2/3 of their revenue comes from the United Kingdom where they have a leading share. We continue to believe this acquisition will be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by low- to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. This acquisition is also expected to reduce our normalized effective tax rate to about 35% to 36%.
In summary, we had a strong quarter and year, reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.
Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

While you're right, there are some reports out there of some traffic headwinds for some of these folks, the good news for them, obviously, is in the deflationary environment is their cost of products, in general, are not necessarily going up, so that's been a good thing for those restaurant operators. But from our perspective, we spend a lot of our time trying to think about what are those areas where we can help them be more successful. And you mentioned labor rates potentially going up. That's obviously a key concern of many of these operators today. And so whether it's a Sysco Brand, where we bring not only value but also just things I talked about, which is great reliability and traceability and high-quality products, that's a big area of focus for us. These tools, think about even some of the innovative products we're bringing, we're focused on how do we reduce the labor cost for these operators. So if there are products that are labor-saving type of products in the preparation that allows them to leverage some of those things to offset maybe some potential labor increases they're seeing. And as Bill said, I think technology and tools, in general, that allow them to manage their business more efficiently are also things we're focused on.

I'll start and let Joel get into detail a little bit more. I would say in terms of why our performance for '16 was better than originally what we projected, I think part of it is just having the time to refine the plan and to go deep on the plan, and our execution was just very good. So if you put all this to some type of context, our merger agreement with US Foods was terminated in late June. We regrouped, as a management team, very quickly in July and put together the framework over the 3-year plan and shared that with the investor group in September and along the way with our board. And so I wouldn't say we were cautious, but we certainly were thoughtful in terms of what we were leading people to. And as we've built some momentum, if you'll recall, first quarter, we had a very solid quarter in U.S. Broadline, but there's some tailwinds with incentives and that kind of -- or headwinds with incentives, and the first quarter was a little flattish, and then very strong second, third and fourth. So we've built momentum as the year went along to bring it back to the numbers. We've been able to manage this deflationary environment very well and create a good spread between our gross profit growth and our expense growth by managing our expenses very smartly and thoughtfully. So overall, I would just say, the execution has been good, very good. And as we got deeper into the year, we were able to raise our estimate to $500 million. We're not quite ready to do that right now. We'd like to get further into this plan. We're 1/3 of the way through it, so I'd like to see another quarter or 2 and see how we perform, see how the marketplace performs and reassess that outlook at that point in time. Joel?"

And so that's certainly -- again, this has generated a good part of the free cash flow. You talked about the focus we've had on working capital. We've had some -- we had some aggressive goals at the start of our 3-year plan, and I think the -- one of the primary benefits this year was in our focus on inventory. We made some good progress in that area. And I think you'll continue to see opportunities there, again, both, you called out, in the payables area as well as inventory and some in AR as well. So we've got some continued focus on working capital that I believe we're making good progress on and we'll continue to drive that. We did have some benefit this year, as I mentioned, some timing issues on cash taxes, things that were related to the timing of payments and the ability to accelerate some deductions. Having said that, we also did have something -- some stuff going the other way on the US Foods payments that we made in the first quarter this year. So I would guess -- what I would say to you in general is I think the level of free cash flow you're seeing that we experienced this year is a pretty reasonable view of what I believe this business can generate here as we move forward over the next couple of years. And so I think we're in a good place and we're going to continue driving the initiatives that we're driving and continue to improve that performance as well."

And that's continued to pay dividends for us here over the last 2 years-plus. And so we feel good about that. We also want to continue to grow that corporate managed business in the right way. And so you've seen the slope of that growth fall somewhat. It's still positive. And there are still very, very important relationships we have out there, some -- with some very large customers that work for us as well from a profitability standpoint. So balance is always key here. And it's a key if you're running an operating company and it's key from the overall corporate standpoint. And what you saw here is a quarter with pretty good balance. So in any point in time, one segment, if you want to call it that for the moment, may be growing a little faster than the other, and that's okay. But generally, we're looking to grow both in the right way with good discipline and we've been making great strides here over the last year or 2. So I'll let Tom speak a little bit to the segment performance."

For us, I think it's a really, as Bill said, a balance. And so looking at different customers and their relative profitability and where we can actually add the most value is where we are trying to focus our efforts.

So certainly, the supply chain, in particular in the U.K., is an opportunity for Brakes to expand their margins.

Of course, the deal closed right after the year, and so we had -- the balance sheet needs to be revalued to the exchange rate that exists at that point in time. Our team did a great job of hedging to protect us on the upside and purchasing currency opportunistically to maximize our ability to minimize that foreign exchange devaluation. But we did experience some of that, some of which was also reflected in the end purchase price.

I just think it's a little bit of a malaise. I just think it's -- the -- you're going to have these cycles and soft cycles at any point in time, and some of it, we're going up against some stronger numbers a year ago. So there's some math in it. But it just feels a little bit softer out there. I think people are being a little more cautious with their spend. Maybe the election, maybe -- I'm not sure. So I guess I wouldn't want to just conjecture here. But I don't think it's the Olympics. And I don't think it's any one thing in particular. I just think it's a little softer, and it seems to be showing up in multiple places. So I don't think it's a certain type of customer per se or anything like that. I just think it's one of these of soft cycles that we're going to go through, and time will tell whether it's a 3- to 6-month deal or longer. But again, from our perspective, we've been managing through some pretty significant headwinds with deflation over the last year, and I couldn't be more pleased with how we've been executing. So again, we can't totally control the industry top line, but I feel good about what we're doing in our space and how we're driving earnings and, at the same time, staying very close to our customers and focusing on what's important to them. So that's the best I can probably give you from our [indiscernible] stance."

But as Bill said, it's really, for us, about creating the environment where they can order how they want, when they want and where they want. And so there were also a few tools we needed to build to be able to get in place to enable them to do that more effectively, and we've got some of those tools now in place and that we believe we'll continue to see that number grow as more customers have that interest. But we also know from a lot of work we do that our marketing associates are one of the most highest valued resource we have and -- that we provide our customers. So we're trying to make sure that we balance the how they order with the service and support they need to get day in and day out from our selling resources.

So there's maybe a little bit of a modest correction. I don't think that, that's an overriding issue. I think it's somewhat self-correcting. We don't really track our sales -- new stores. The way we track it, Mark, is we track new business for us, which is making a count to an operator that we didn't sell a year ago this time. Then we track lost business, which is just the opposite where we had a sale a year ago and we don't have any. And then we track penetration.

That's more than the sales of many, many of the people that we compete with head to head. So that's a huge number that we've been able to grow very nicely on an adjusted basis over the last year to 2 years. And how do we do that? I mean, it comes back to the levers that we've talked about: case growth with a particular emphasis on local case growth; managing the margins; utilizing a lot of the tools, many of which are technology -- based today; and taking a good, hard look at where our potential is in terms of territories within each district, within each OpCo. So assessing the opportunity for growth by territory, by district, by OpCo; taking advantage of some of the revenue management tools that Tom and his teams are -- have put in place over the last year that are just now beginning to mature; continue to utilize the category management process both from leveraging our spend but also bringing innovation to that product; staying close to our customers; refining our customer insight where -- to be as current that we possibly can in terms of what the needs of those operators are as they face the challenges. So you have to start with gross profit and your ability to grow those dollars. And we've done a nice job there, and I expect us to continue to do well. With that said, as I said in terms of the pillars of our strategy, we need to be more productive in everything we do. And we've set some goals out there, and certainly running the business at a flat cost per case for yet another year here is a very appropriate yet aggressive goal, and it's going to be paramount for us to have success this year to do that. So we've got some good momentum there in the supply chain. We're managing our SG&A very well. So I feel very good about our corporate spend as well. We're still spending some money in business technology to kind of create those tools that we've been talking about year in particular on the commercial side. So I think we're spending the money in the right place. Over time, we'll continue to flatten out that corporate spend, try to keep the flat cost per case -- keep cost per case flat in the field. And that combination of good, solid gross profit growth and well-managed expenses should serve us very well."

And so even in times when we've had some impact of deflation on the gross profit dollars, again we've continued to focus on driving the expenses to where we look at that spread. And again, on a year-to-date basis, we're up a little over 1.5% in terms of that delta between those 2. And so the only other thing I may call out is just to think about -- because that's certainly the way we think about that.

And to do that, you need to continue to take costs out to become more efficient. So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular going on right now that's different than what we've experienced over the last 2 or 3 years, and that I wouldn't -- and I also think we still have opportunity to be more consistent in our pricing, and that should be a win for our customers and win for us."

This morning, Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results. Our performance reflects the soundness of our strategy, the commitment of our associates to supporting the success of our customers and the consistently improving execution of our 3-year plan. 
For the quarter, on a comparable 13-week basis, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of nearly 5%, while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of approximately 15% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 15% as well.
These results were achieved in a market environment that is experiencing uneven trends and appears to have softened somewhat of late. While consumer confidence and unemployment data points remain relatively favorable compared to a few years ago, the current sentiment for customer spending on meals away from home seems to be trending slightly downward.
Turning to specific restaurant industry data. Overall sales trends weakened as reflected in current NPD and KNAPP-TRACK traffic and spend data. That said, according to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant operator expectations remain somewhat favorable.
Moving to our results for fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with our performance during the year. The improving momentum in our business is the result of strong local case growth, gross profit growth with gross margin expansion and solid expense management. Specifically, for fiscal 2016, on an adjusted 52-week basis, we delivered the following results: Total Broadline cases grew 3% and local cases grew 2.7%. Sales grew 1.5% to $50 billion even with the unfavorable impact of deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. Gross profit grew 3.6% to $9 billion and gross margin increased 38 basis points. 
Adjusted operating income increased 10% over the prior year to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. In addition, free cash flow approximated $1.4 billion and adjusted return on invested capital was 14% for the full year. I'm particularly encouraged by our progress to date toward the achievement of our 3-year plan financial objectives, especially our goal to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2018. Our strong progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is supported by a foundation that was built over the past several years through a series of commercial, supply chain and administrative initiatives. 
We continue to build on that foundation throughout fiscal 2016 by accomplishing several key objectives, including: leveraging customer insights to create new and enhanced sales and marketing programs; advancing our progress in several key commercial areas, including category and revenue management; shifting our technology strategy and related spend to a more customer-centric focus; and restructuring our business to drive greater efficiency, including streamlining our market structure, introducing a standard field organization model and further developing a functional structure in key support areas such as merchandising, supply chain and human resources.
All of this has been accomplished by consistently improving the execution of our strategy that is centered on 5 fundamental points: partnership, to profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with Sysco; productivity, to continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business; products, to enhance offerings through our customer-centric innovation program; people, leveraging talent, structure and culture to drive performance; and portfolio, continuously assessing new market opportunities and current business performance.
Regarding the latter point, we recently closed the acquisitions of -- the acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European food service distributor, with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. Brakes is a highly regarded company whose management team and strategy are well aligned with the vision we have for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner. 
This acquisition will serve as a platform for future expansion in Europe. We're looking forward to working together with the entire Brakes team to execute their business strategy, and we feel fortunate to welcome them into the Sysco family. Joel will discuss with you in a few minutes the anticipated contribution of Brakes to Sysco's financial results.
As we ended the new fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level, working effectively together as One Sysco, and we remain committed to the success of our customers. We have even bigger goals for fiscal 2017, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve our financial and business objectives in the year ahead and throughout the 3-year plan.
The new fiscal year brings an expanded global presence, enhanced technology and continued focus on our customers. Specifically, we intend to deliver solid local case growth, increase our gross profit, reduce cost in the right way and put processing tools in place that will further enable our associates to provide our customers with industry-leading service and support.
Our past and future success is driven by the ongoing dedication and commitment of all of our associates, and I thank each of them for their effort to deliver a very successful year in fiscal 2016. And now I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Fiscal 2016 was a great year for Sysco, and I'm proud of the contributions made by all of our associates throughout the year. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress on several key multiyear initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for success. 
Our favorable operating performance was driven by our ongoing focus on the key drivers of our 3-year plan, including accelerating our sales with local customers by providing them with exceptional service, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses. This morning I'll provide an update on some of the initiatives related to our 3-year plan and how they have continued to positively impact our business results. 
The first of which is our focus on accelerating local case growth. During the year, we grew U.S. Broadline local cases 2.6% on an adjusted 52-week basis, the strongest performance we've had in several years. Also on an adjusted 52-week basis, gross profit in U.S. Broadline grew 4.7% for the fiscal year and gross margin increased 47 basis points, driven by our focus on profitable case growth, revenue management activities and improved Sysco Brand penetration. 
The focus our sales team has had on helping our customers succeed and grow has been further enhanced throughout fiscal year 2016. During the year, we remain focused on improving our industry-leading category management practices, fully deploying revenue management in the field and enhancing our sales training and support tools that continue to free up our marketing associates' time to better support our customers with business building solutions. 
We also rolled out various promotional programs and key initiatives throughout the year, including those that highlight product innovation and reinforce the Sysco Brand, which delivers tremendous value to our customers. That value is delivered through an unrelenting focus on the highest-quality products and best-in-class traceability from a food safety perspective. Finally, we continue to focus on delivering new and improved customer-facing technology solutions that add value to their business and allow our associates to be more efficient.
On the cost side, the expense management throughout the year was also solid, and it remains a key area of focus moving forward. For U.S. Broadline, during fiscal year 2016, we limited total adjusted expense growth to only 2.2% on a comparable 52-week basis compared to gross profit growth of 4.7%. We also reduced our overall cost per case in U.S. Broadline by $0.04 during the year. Adjusting for the impact of fuel prices, our adjusted cost per case in U.S. Broadline was flat.
As we've discussed, we have been very focused on reducing cost and improving productivity while continuing to deliver improved service levels to our customers. In fiscal year 2016, we reduced expenses in a number of key areas. In the supply chain area, we have reduced indirect spend and we'll continue to focus on maximizing transportation and warehouse efficiencies. We've also standardized our organizational design and reduced the number of our markets in the U.S. from 8 to 6. And throughout the organization, we have reduced overall SG&A costs.
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our 3-year plan. In fiscal year 2016, we've made significant progress in all areas, and I remain extremely optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."

As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year.

As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. I'll begin my remarks by speaking to our fourth quarter.
For the purposes of matching your models, our fourth quarter results reflecting an extra week, include: sales growth of 10.0%, gross profit growth of 12.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 9.6%, adjusted operating income growth of 23.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 23.1%. 
Excluding the extra week on a comparable basis, the fourth quarter results include: sales growth of 2.2%, gross profit growth of 4.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 1.7%, adjusted operating income growth of 14.6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15.4%.
Sales during the quarter were negatively impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange of 0.5%, largely offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions of 1.2%. On a comparable 13-week basis, total Broadline case growth for the fourth quarter was 2.2%, local was 2.4% and corporate managed growth was 2.0%.
During the fourth quarter, we had some certain items that impacted our results. In the prior year, we had acquisition costs of $390 million. In the current year, we had remeasurements of foreign-denominated cash due to lower exchange rates at quarter end as well as the premium on foreign currency option contracts for the Brakes acquisition. As a result, other expense, net for the quarter, was approximately $141 million, primarily driven by certain items from fiscal 2016. 
As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35% compared to negative 6% in the prior year. Both quarters' tax rates were reduced primarily from the impact of certain items, which lowered net income and resulted in lower tax rates. A similar event occurred last year related to the US Foods termination cost, which drove an unusual GAAP tax rate. On an adjusted for certain items basis, our tax rate would have been approximately 36.8% in both years.
Now turning to our results for the year. Our fiscal 2016, including the extra week, included: sales growth of 3.5%, gross profit growth of 5.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 4%, adjusted operating income growth of 12.1% and adjusted EPS growth of 14.1%. 
To provide a relevant comparison to the prior year, all income statement measures I discuss from this point forward will be adjusted for certain items and presented on a 52-week comparable basis. Looking at our full year results, we grew sales by 1.5% year-over-year despite deflation of 0.7%. We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories such as meat and seafood, along with deflation in dairy. 
Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.7%. During the year, we closed 5 acquisitions, including Gilchrist & Soames and North Star Seafood. Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.3%, largely driven by the U.S. dollar's strength against the Canadian dollar. The negative impact we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we begin to wrap the initial decline and relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant-currency basis, sales would have been up 2.7%.
Turning to case growth. Consistent with our 3-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had strong performance for the year. On a comparable 52-week basis, total Broadline case growth for the year was 3%, local was 2.7% and corporate managed was 3.3%.
Looking at gross profit and gross margins for the year. We grew our gross profit at a solid 3.6% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 38 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management of our beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit growth was 4.8%.
Adjusted operating expense on a comparable 52-week basis grew 2% for the year and by 3.3% on a constant currency basis. This increase is mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals and was partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case, as Tom mentioned, which was flat, excluding fuel price changes.
As a result, adjusted operating income for the year was $1.96 billion, up 9.6% compared to the prior year and up 10.6% on a constant currency basis. Compared to the prior year on a 52-week basis, adjusted net earnings grew 8% and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion, up approximately 24% from last year. It is important to note that a timing difference in tax payments impacted our cash flow during fiscal 2016.
Net working capital improved by 0.6 day for the full year compared to last year. This was largely driven by improvements in inventory. Net CapEx for the full year was $504 million and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow included the cash impact of certain items of $280 million in fiscal 2016. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods. Lastly, we improved our adjusted return on invested capital to approximately 14% during the fiscal year, up from approximately 13% in the prior year. 
Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2017. The deflationary trend has been persistent over the last 4 quarters and will likely continue for the remainder of the calendar year, creating a modest sales and gross profit headwind for the first half year. 
The restaurant environment appears to be softening, and as a result, we anticipate modest case volume growth for the next quarter or 2. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately 1% of sales, including Brakes. We intend to continue to improve working capital days to achieve our 3-year plan goal of 4 days' improvement when comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015. And we expect to complete our $3 billion 2-year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2017, driven by reduction in average shares outstanding.
Regarding the addition of Brakes to Sysco's financial results, we expect the combined company will have roughly $55 billion in annualized revenue on a pro forma basis. In their most recent fiscal year ending December of 2015, Brakes reported nearly $5 billion in revenue, up roughly approximately 6.5% from 2014. They also reported an approximately 5% adjusted EBITDA margin with a double-digit growth rate. 
Roughly 2/3 of their revenue comes from the United Kingdom where they have a leading share. We continue to believe this acquisition will be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by low- to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. This acquisition is also expected to reduce our normalized effective tax rate to about 35% to 36%.
In summary, we had a strong quarter and year, reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.
Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

But from our perspective, we spend a lot of our time trying to think about what are those areas where we can help them be more successful. And you mentioned labor rates potentially going up. That's obviously a key concern of many of these operators today. And so whether it's a Sysco Brand, where we bring not only value but also just things I talked about, which is great reliability and traceability and high-quality products, that's a big area of focus for us. These tools, think about even some of the innovative products we're bringing, we're focused on how do we reduce the labor cost for these operators. So if there are products that are labor-saving type of products in the preparation that allows them to leverage some of those things to offset maybe some potential labor increases they're seeing.

Heading into Brexit, I would say, and as we got into March and April, we did see, through their eyes, we got some feel for it in terms of the data out there. And there were some slowing in their business in the U.K., just in general, and a lot of that was attributed to the uncertainty of Brexit. And I think the implied thought would be that once there was certainty, then things would kind of bounce back a little bit. I think I'd assume that the certainty would be to remain and obviously the vote went the other way. So now what you got is continued uncertainty. So I just think it's going to be extended period of time here. And I think it'll play out politically, it'll play out economically. So it is a little slower in the U.K. right now. The good news for us is we're seeing some good things coming out of France and Sweden, albeit that's about 1/3 of their business. So I think as far as Brexit is concerned, I think we're all watching it. And to this point, I don't know that I've seen any clear analysis in terms of what the specific impact is going to be at a certain point in time. My judgment would say that it's going to play out over the next 2 or 3 years. It will become business-as-usual here over that period of time, and it'll be somewhat of a headwind in the context of uncertainty that our people will work through in their marketplace."

I'll start and let Joel get into detail a little bit more. I would say in terms of why our performance for '16 was better than originally what we projected, I think part of it is just having the time to refine the plan and to go deep on the plan, and our execution was just very good. So if you put all this to some type of context, our merger agreement with US Foods was terminated in late June. We regrouped, as a management team, very quickly in July and put together the framework over the 3-year plan and shared that with the investor group in September and along the way with our board. And so I wouldn't say we were cautious, but we certainly were thoughtful in terms of what we were leading people to. And as we've built some momentum, if you'll recall, first quarter, we had a very solid quarter in U.S. Broadline, but there's some tailwinds with incentives and that kind of -- or headwinds with incentives, and the first quarter was a little flattish, and then very strong second, third and fourth. So we've built momentum as the year went along to bring it back to the numbers. We've been able to manage this deflationary environment very well and create a good spread between our gross profit growth and our expense growth by managing our expenses very smartly and thoughtfully. So overall, I would just say, the execution has been good, very good. And as we got deeper into the year, we were able to raise our estimate to $500 million. We're not quite ready to do that right now. We'd like to get further into this plan. We're 1/3 of the way through it, so I'd like to see another quarter or 2 and see how we perform, see how the marketplace performs and reassess that outlook at that point in time. Joel?"

We've had some -- we had some aggressive goals at the start of our 3-year plan, and I think the -- one of the primary benefits this year was in our focus on inventory. We made some good progress in that area. And I think you'll continue to see opportunities there, again, both, you called out, in the payables area as well as inventory and some in AR as well. So we've got some continued focus on working capital that I believe we're making good progress on and we'll continue to drive that. We did have some benefit this year, as I mentioned, some timing issues on cash taxes, things that were related to the timing of payments and the ability to accelerate some deductions. Having said that, we also did have something -- some stuff going the other way on the US Foods payments that we made in the first quarter this year. So I would guess -- what I would say to you in general is I think the level of free cash flow you're seeing that we experienced this year is a pretty reasonable view of what I believe this business can generate here as we move forward over the next couple of years. And so I think we're in a good place and we're going to continue driving the initiatives that we're driving and continue to improve that performance as well."

And that's continued to pay dividends for us here over the last 2 years-plus. And so we feel good about that. We also want to continue to grow that corporate managed business in the right way. And so you've seen the slope of that growth fall somewhat. It's still positive. And there are still very, very important relationships we have out there, some -- with some very large customers that work for us as well from a profitability standpoint. So balance is always key here. And it's a key if you're running an operating company and it's key from the overall corporate standpoint. And what you saw here is a quarter with pretty good balance. So in any point in time, one segment, if you want to call it that for the moment, may be growing a little faster than the other, and that's okay. But generally, we're looking to grow both in the right way with good discipline and we've been making great strides here over the last year or 2.

Actually, I think what I said about Brakes is in the U.K. market in general, what we've seen is for March and April, I know it's connected to Brexit, the uncertainty of the Brexit vote. And since the vote, we've seen some softening over there in that market, and the data and the government data will support that as well. We're not in a position, obviously, to comment on their numbers. We've just closed that deal last month. Now we'll talk more about that certainly in November when we release for the first quarter. But we feel good about -- as Joel said, we feel very good about this acquisition, about the leadership, investment for the long term, acquisition platform, all the things we said from the beginning. So Brexit, I'm going to let Joel take you through the currency issues. I think we managed it quite well actually as far as the transaction goes. As you said, there's the normal translation of earnings and that type of thing. And while I'm not going to dispute all your points, I would just say from my perspective the bigger issue as far as Brexit is concerned is always -- is what it comes down to here in our markets as well is what's the impact on the consumer. I think it's less about foreign exchange at the consumer level. And because of some of the uncertainty, we've seen some softening over there. The weather -- I mean, you hear all the same things, weather in London in summertime and that kind of thing. So I think there's going to be some ups and downs, and we'll be in a better position to talk about it in November. But overall, we're very pleased with the acquisition.

I mean, the translation impacts, again, certainly, will be something we'll be dealing with as we move forward. In terms of the price itself, I mean, as we mentioned, there was actually -- we had a foreign currency remeasurement that basically resulted from the fact that at the end of the year, we're holding sterling on our balance sheet for the purchase price. Of course, the deal closed right after the year, and so we had -- the balance sheet needs to be revalued to the exchange rate that exists at that point in time. Our team did a great job of hedging to protect us on the upside and purchasing currency opportunistically to maximize our ability to minimize that foreign exchange devaluation. But we did experience some of that, some of which was also reflected in the end purchase price. But overall, again, I would just tell you that we'll continue to manage through that stuff and, as Bill said, continue to focus on driving focus on the customers and the operational performance of that company."

So I guess I wouldn't want to just conjecture here. But I don't think it's the Olympics. And I don't think it's any one thing in particular.

I just think it's one of these of soft cycles that we're going to go through, and time will tell whether it's a 3- to 6-month deal or longer. But again, from our perspective, we've been managing through some pretty significant headwinds with deflation over the last year, and I couldn't be more pleased with how we've been executing.

That's more than the sales of many, many of the people that we compete with head to head. So that's a huge number that we've been able to grow very nicely on an adjusted basis over the last year to 2 years. And how do we do that? I mean, it comes back to the levers that we've talked about: case growth with a particular emphasis on local case growth; managing the margins; utilizing a lot of the tools, many of which are technology -- based today; and taking a good, hard look at where our potential is in terms of territories within each district, within each OpCo. So assessing the opportunity for growth by territory, by district, by OpCo; taking advantage of some of the revenue management tools that Tom and his teams are -- have put in place over the last year that are just now beginning to mature; continue to utilize the category management process both from leveraging our spend but also bringing innovation to that product; staying close to our customers; refining our customer insight where -- to be as current that we possibly can in terms of what the needs of those operators are as they face the challenges. So you have to start with gross profit and your ability to grow those dollars. And we've done a nice job there, and I expect us to continue to do well. With that said, as I said in terms of the pillars of our strategy, we need to be more productive in everything we do. And we've set some goals out there, and certainly running the business at a flat cost per case for yet another year here is a very appropriate yet aggressive goal, and it's going to be paramount for us to have success this year to do that. So we've got some good momentum there in the supply chain. We're managing our SG&A very well. So I feel very good about our corporate spend as well. We're still spending some money in business technology to kind of create those tools that we've been talking about year in particular on the commercial side. So I think we're spending the money in the right place. Over time, we'll continue to flatten out that corporate spend, try to keep the flat cost per case -- keep cost per case flat in the field.

There's a lot of salespeople out there in the street and a lot of very sophisticated customers. So pricing is always going to be a key part of how customers look at value. I think what you heard Tom say is as we look at revenue management, which pricing is a component but not the only component, we're getting better in terms of strategically and tactically facing up with each customer one-on-one and really understanding what is key for them. But we have the tools to make sure we're highly competitive in our key items but also where there's opportunity to grow. So when you look at our economic model, it's really about having the right price for the right item and the right day for that customer, for the street business and remain very competitive with our contract customers. And to do that, you need to continue to take costs out to become more efficient. So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular going on right now that's different than what we've experienced over the last 2 or 3 years, and that I wouldn't -- and I also think we still have opportunity to be more consistent in our pricing, and that should be a win for our customers and win for us."

I'm very pleased with our start in fiscal 2017. And this morning, we reported strong first quarter financial results. These results reflect our relentless focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco, the benefits of several key business initiatives that we have implemented over the past few years and the contributions from our new colleagues at Brakes who joined Sysco in early July.
For the quarter and excluding the impact of Brakes, sales grew 1%, gross profit grew 5%, while operating expense grew less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 15%. After reflecting the business results of Brakes, adjusted operating income grew 24% to $627 million and adjusted earnings per share grew to $0.67.
While we benefited from some favorable year-over-year expense comparisons which Joel will touch on in a few minutes, these results were achieved in an uneven economic environment that is impacting our customers' business. Some metrics reflect positive implications for longer-term consumer demand such as steadying unemployment levels, modest GDP growth, increased consumer confidence and healthy momentum in the housing market.
However, the restaurant industry, which represents approximately 60% of the foodservice market, is not currently experiencing the level of growth we have seen in recent quarters. Restaurant traffic continues to show year-over-year declines and restaurant spend has decelerated as well. More specifically, recent data from both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK show weakening overall sales trends.
That said, we continue to execute our business plan and key initiatives very well. I am pleased with our progress to-date toward the achievement of our 3-year financial goals and I remain confident in our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives over the long-term.
Our improved and increasingly consistent performance for the past 2 years is attributed to multiyear foundational work we have carried out in customer insights, category management, revenue management, supply chain efficiencies and administrative expense management. The benefits of these work streams have positioned us to continue to effectively support the needs of our customers and profitably leverage our volume growth.
Moving forward, we will build on this momentum by maintaining our customer-centric approach while focusing on targeted, disciplined and profitable growth. Both Tom and Joel will provide more detail about these specific initiatives we are currently implementing and the related benefits.
Turning to the Brakes transaction. We continue to work closely with our experienced and talented leadership team to support their growth, drive after transformative initiatives and identify additional acquisition opportunities. I'm very excited about the long-term benefits that this business will provide Sysco.
In summary, we are off to a good start to fiscal 2017 and I'm encouraged with the progress we are making as we approach the midpoint of our 3-year plan. I'm especially appreciative of the efforts and contributions from all 65,000 of our associates as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.

Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multiyear initiatives. Our favorable operating performance continues to be driven by our ongoing focus on the key levers of our 3-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through our focus on local customers, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses, both in our supply chain and administrative functions.
This morning, I'll be providing an update on our business results based on our new segment reporting structure, which highlights U.S. Foodservice operations, International Foodservice operations, SYGMA and all other.
During the quarter, U.S. Foodservice operations, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Broadline, specialty meat, FreshPoint and our European Imports business, grew sales 0.8%, driven by overall case growth in the U.S. Broadline of 1.8%, with local cases driving our growth at 1.9%.
Gross profit in U.S. Foodservice operations grew 4.3% for the quarter and gross margin increased 68 basis points, driven by a combination of factors including our ongoing category management efforts, which is how we now go-to-market with an improved product assortment and centralized approach for a majority of our product procurement, which in turn helps us drive out costs for ourselves and our suppliers; second, improved Sysco Brand performance with our local customers; the deployment of a suite of revenue management tools and processes that bring more discipline to our sales and merchandising teams and, ultimately, more consistent pricing to our customers; and the impact of deflation.
During the quarter, we continued to focus our sales teams on initiatives and activities that will help our customers succeed and grow their business. We have been implementing a variety of sales training and support tools that build overall capability within our selling organization. And we have restructured some of the work within that organization to both free up our marketing associates' time and provide access to our targeted resources to better support our customers.
These efforts, in conjunction with ongoing enhancements to our e-commerce tools which allow our customers to choose how they place their orders with Sysco, are enabling us to better leverage our marketing associates to spend more time supporting our customers with unique programs, innovative products and other business-building solutions.
From a cost perspective, our expense management for the quarter was solid and remains a key area of focus for us moving forward. For U.S. Foodservice operations during the first quarter, we limited total adjusted operating expense growth to 1.8%. Our supply chain performance is progressing well and we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and continuing process improvements that are driving efficiencies.
For U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by $0.04 for the quarter and, on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case was flat. The continuous improvement efforts in our facilities and the continued investment in training for our warehouse associates and drivers has allowed us to build further capability throughout our supply chain. One such example is the implementation of a labor forecasting tool that enables us to proactively manage hours at our facilities based on the anticipated workload for each shift. We also remain on track to deliver our previously communicated administrative cost reductions, both in corporate and within the operations.
Moving to International Foodservice operations, which is made up of Canada, Europe, Bahamas, International Food Group and our joint ventures in Mexico and Costa Rica. Sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $50 million, both driven by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group. We appreciate the Brakes Group early performance and continue to look forward to working with the management team on achieving our collective plans in the future.
During the quarter, Brakes performed reasonably well in the U.K. amidst a challenging environment and performance in both brands in Sweden was relatively strong. Our business in Canada is off to a good start for the fiscal year as we are effectively managing cost within a deflationary and somewhat soft market environment. And lastly, our joint ventures in both Costa Rica and Mexico had solid performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.
SYGMA continues to make progress against their key business initiatives and had 4% sales growth for the first quarter. We continue to feel confident in their ability to deliver their full year growth goals and objectives.
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as part of our 3-year plan. We have continued to make significant progress in all areas for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and I remain optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."

As Bill and Tom had mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including local solid case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management as well as a solid contribution from Brakes. The results that I'll cover for you this morning include Brakes, which significantly impacted our results.
In summary, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, sales grew 11.2%, gross profit dollars grew 20.3%, operating expense growth was 19.2%, all of which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 23.8% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 28.8%. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by the inclusion of Brakes in our results, though partially offset by deflation of 2.2% in our legacy Sysco business.
Continuing with gross profit and gross margins beyond the addition of Brakes, the key drivers of improvement included category management, revenue management, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. The categories impacted most by deflation continue to be the Center of the Plate, protein and dairy. We expect the trend to continue into calendar 2017. That said, we continue to manage this environment effectively as evidenced by our strong gross profit dollar growth.
The increasing expenses during the quarter beyond the addition of Brakes were mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and a timing shift of expenses related to our option grants from the second quarter into the first and was partially offset by various decreases in indirect spend, fuel costs, favorable comparisons to the prior year which included planned investments and technology spend related to our 3-year plan and foreign exchange translation.
As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.9% compared to 36.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in tax rate is driven by tax credits, lower tax rates in the U.K. due to new tax laws that were recently passed and the mix of business as we grow in lower rate jurisdictions. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 20.7%.
Cash flow from operations was $249 million, which is $510 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $111 million, which is $492 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both are due mainly to improved working capital performance and payments made on the prior year related to the proposed merger with US Foods.
Net CapEx for the quarter was $138 million.
I'm pleased with our net working capital performance for the quarter. We had a net 2-day improvement versus the prior year and a 2.8-day improvement versus fiscal 2015 and are making good progress towards our 3-year goal of a 4-day improvement. These improvements are driven primarily by improvements of all 3 phases of working capital: payables, receivables and inventory.
Our first quarter results included some certain items that were mostly related to the Brakes acquisition, including amortization associated with the transaction. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had significant amount of certain items primarily related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods.
Now I'd like to transition to 3 business updates. First, regarding Brakes. As a reminder, we initially guided that the acquisition will be modestly accretive to fiscal 2017 earnings per share by low to mid-single digits. We are now updating that guidance due to finalizing the treatment of amortization as a certain item and believe this acquisition will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by high single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in subsequent years assuming constant currency.
For the first quarter, Brakes was approximately $0.04 accretive to our business on an adjusted basis. It is important to note that Brakes' business does have some seasonality as the performance is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Accordingly, we do not expect the same accretion each quarter, in particular in quarter number 3.
Second, regarding fuel expense. We expect the favorability we've had over the past few quarters to begin to lap in November.
Separately, we are enhancing our fuel strategy. In the past, we used a third party to forward buy fixed price contracts approximately 12 months out. Going forward, we are transitioning the management of our fuel expense by using derivatives to hedge our exposure. By separating the management of our fuel purchases from our risk management, we will allow for more effective management of the risks. We'll continue to cover approximately 2/3 of our needs with hedges in place to minimize volatility in price.
Finally, we are announcing today the upsizing of our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion and we'll upsize our commercial paper lines accordingly to provide greater liquidity to support our growing business.
In summary, we had a quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that improve our financial performance in both the near and long-term. I'm confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.
Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

And so we're very focused on trying to get our case growth back up over 2%. I think that's very important. We're real pleased with how we're managing the margins and still growing the business and taking care of our customers in the right way. And a lot of the steps we took back in the spring to initiate deeper expense reductions are benefiting us right now. So I think the things that we can influence and control, we're doing a really good job with. We're probably a little cautious in terms of the overall macro out there for our customers. We still got 2 points of deflation out there, largely driven by those  [indiscernible] category so those will be 2 areas where we're probably a little bit cautious. Obviously, -- we're in our third year in of earnings growth, and I think this is the fourth quarter of double-digit earnings growth on an adjusted basis, so obviously the bar gets higher and we're ready for that, so we feel very good overall by what we're doing. A little cautious on the environment. I think to your first question, the way I'm looking at that is we're 1 quarter into this year, and we're just not quite to the halfway point of the 3-year plan. So I'm going to get a little further into this year and get halfway through the 3-year plan, and then I think we'll be able to reassess where we are on the goals."

As you know, we've been basically in that operating model now for the last 3 years and it's why we've gone through, I'd say the major cycle with that.

And so one of the things again, we certainly have done a good job of managing through this deflationary times and still continue to grow of our growth and gross profit dollars. We've also done a good job, I think, of focusing and driving expenses downward as both Joel and Tom had talked about. I think when we looked at that plan and sort the puts and takes of what was going to drive it, we certainly knew we could have had more inflation, could've had less inflation. Some of those factors are what they are. But the reality of it is our continued focus on that gap and that delta between those 2 numbers, I think, is really important."

One of the things you see in our certain item reconciliation this quarter is that we'll see this in our were Q. Our G&A is up a bit for this quarter and it's for a couple of different reasons. Number one, as we talked about last year, we actually expected some the of the SAP system there was an acceleration of the amortization related to that. And so there's roughly $30 million, I'd say, on the certain item related to that this year that's part of our DNA. There's also as a result of the Brakes deal, there is both additional depreciation and amortization as part of that. And so I think if you look at our overall G&A expense for this particular quarter relative to where we've been, those are really the 2 primary contributors on that line as it relates to this. What Bill is referring to as -- in his comments earlier, if you'll recall at the time, and we increased our target from $400 million to $500 million and again, a while back, we had made a couple of comments as it relates to that, number one was the fact that a component of that difference was related to the fact that we -- with that  changeover in our technology strategy that there would be some benefits once again, the asset was fully written off again accelerated amortization we've been experiencing at the end of last year and through this about benefit to that starting in 2018. So I think that's really what goes relating to on that. And so hopefully that gives you some clarity on some of the comments and a little bit of be done on that.

So I think right now, they are managing it pretty well and the deflation is helping them at some point, I guess, it could become more acute if we were to see the deflation reverse.

I'm very pleased with our start in fiscal 2017. And this morning, we reported strong first quarter financial results. These results reflect our relentless focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco, the benefits of several key business initiatives that we have implemented over the past few years and the contributions from our new colleagues at Brakes who joined Sysco in early July.
For the quarter and excluding the impact of Brakes, sales grew 1%, gross profit grew 5%, while operating expense grew less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 15%. After reflecting the business results of Brakes, adjusted operating income grew 24% to $627 million and adjusted earnings per share grew to $0.67.
While we benefited from some favorable year-over-year expense comparisons which Joel will touch on in a few minutes, these results were achieved in an uneven economic environment that is impacting our customers' business. Some metrics reflect positive implications for longer-term consumer demand such as steadying unemployment levels, modest GDP growth, increased consumer confidence and healthy momentum in the housing market.
However, the restaurant industry, which represents approximately 60% of the foodservice market, is not currently experiencing the level of growth we have seen in recent quarters. Restaurant traffic continues to show year-over-year declines and restaurant spend has decelerated as well. More specifically, recent data from both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK show weakening overall sales trends.
That said, we continue to execute our business plan and key initiatives very well. I am pleased with our progress to-date toward the achievement of our 3-year financial goals and I remain confident in our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives over the long-term.
Our improved and increasingly consistent performance for the past 2 years is attributed to multiyear foundational work we have carried out in customer insights, category management, revenue management, supply chain efficiencies and administrative expense management. The benefits of these work streams have positioned us to continue to effectively support the needs of our customers and profitably leverage our volume growth.
Moving forward, we will build on this momentum by maintaining our customer-centric approach while focusing on targeted, disciplined and profitable growth. Both Tom and Joel will provide more detail about these specific initiatives we are currently implementing and the related benefits.
Turning to the Brakes transaction. We continue to work closely with our experienced and talented leadership team to support their growth, drive after transformative initiatives and identify additional acquisition opportunities. I'm very excited about the long-term benefits that this business will provide Sysco.
In summary, we are off to a good start to fiscal 2017 and I'm encouraged with the progress we are making as we approach the midpoint of our 3-year plan. I'm especially appreciative of the efforts and contributions from all 65,000 of our associates as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom Bené, Sysco's President and Chief Operating Officer."

Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multiyear initiatives. Our favorable operating performance continues to be driven by our ongoing focus on the key levers of our 3-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through our focus on local customers, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses, both in our supply chain and administrative functions.
This morning, I'll be providing an update on our business results based on our new segment reporting structure, which highlights U.S. Foodservice operations, International Foodservice operations, SYGMA and all other.
During the quarter, U.S. Foodservice operations, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Broadline, specialty meat, FreshPoint and our European Imports business, grew sales 0.8%, driven by overall case growth in the U.S. Broadline of 1.8%, with local cases driving our growth at 1.9%.
Gross profit in U.S. Foodservice operations grew 4.3% for the quarter and gross margin increased 68 basis points, driven by a combination of factors including our ongoing category management efforts, which is how we now go-to-market with an improved product assortment and centralized approach for a majority of our product procurement, which in turn helps us drive out costs for ourselves and our suppliers; second, improved Sysco Brand performance with our local customers; the deployment of a suite of revenue management tools and processes that bring more discipline to our sales and merchandising teams and, ultimately, more consistent pricing to our customers; and the impact of deflation.
During the quarter, we continued to focus our sales teams on initiatives and activities that will help our customers succeed and grow their business. We have been implementing a variety of sales training and support tools that build overall capability within our selling organization. And we have restructured some of the work within that organization to both free up our marketing associates' time and provide access to our targeted resources to better support our customers.
These efforts, in conjunction with ongoing enhancements to our e-commerce tools which allow our customers to choose how they place their orders with Sysco, are enabling us to better leverage our marketing associates to spend more time supporting our customers with unique programs, innovative products and other business-building solutions.
From a cost perspective, our expense management for the quarter was solid and remains a key area of focus for us moving forward. For U.S. Foodservice operations during the first quarter, we limited total adjusted operating expense growth to 1.8%. Our supply chain performance is progressing well and we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and continuing process improvements that are driving efficiencies.
For U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by $0.04 for the quarter and, on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case was flat. The continuous improvement efforts in our facilities and the continued investment in training for our warehouse associates and drivers has allowed us to build further capability throughout our supply chain. One such example is the implementation of a labor forecasting tool that enables us to proactively manage hours at our facilities based on the anticipated workload for each shift. We also remain on track to deliver our previously communicated administrative cost reductions, both in corporate and within the operations.
Moving to International Foodservice operations, which is made up of Canada, Europe, Bahamas, International Food Group and our joint ventures in Mexico and Costa Rica. Sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $50 million, both driven by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group. We appreciate the Brakes Group early performance and continue to look forward to working with the management team on achieving our collective plans in the future.
During the quarter, Brakes performed reasonably well in the U.K. amidst a challenging environment and performance in both brands in Sweden was relatively strong. Our business in Canada is off to a good start for the fiscal year as we are effectively managing cost within a deflationary and somewhat soft market environment. And lastly, our joint ventures in both Costa Rica and Mexico had solid performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.
SYGMA continues to make progress against their key business initiatives and had 4% sales growth for the first quarter. We continue to feel confident in their ability to deliver their full year growth goals and objectives.
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as part of our 3-year plan. We have continued to make significant progress in all areas for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and I remain optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."
189096,309739803,1078231,"Sysco Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2016",2016-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Sysco Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone.As Bill and Tom had mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter.

As Bill and Tom had mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including local solid case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management as well as a solid contribution from Brakes. The results that I'll cover for you this morning include Brakes, which significantly impacted our results.
In summary, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, sales grew 11.2%, gross profit dollars grew 20.3%, operating expense growth was 19.2%, all of which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 23.8% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 28.8%. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by the inclusion of Brakes in our results, though partially offset by deflation of 2.2% in our legacy Sysco business.
Continuing with gross profit and gross margins beyond the addition of Brakes, the key drivers of improvement included category management, revenue management, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. The categories impacted most by deflation continue to be the Center of the Plate, protein and dairy. We expect the trend to continue into calendar 2017. That said, we continue to manage this environment effectively as evidenced by our strong gross profit dollar growth.
The increasing expenses during the quarter beyond the addition of Brakes were mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and a timing shift of expenses related to our option grants from the second quarter into the first and was partially offset by various decreases in indirect spend, fuel costs, favorable comparisons to the prior year which included planned investments and technology spend related to our 3-year plan and foreign exchange translation.
As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.9% compared to 36.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in tax rate is driven by tax credits, lower tax rates in the U.K. due to new tax laws that were recently passed and the mix of business as we grow in lower rate jurisdictions. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 20.7%.
Cash flow from operations was $249 million, which is $510 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $111 million, which is $492 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both are due mainly to improved working capital performance and payments made on the prior year related to the proposed merger with US Foods.
Net CapEx for the quarter was $138 million.
I'm pleased with our net working capital performance for the quarter. We had a net 2-day improvement versus the prior year and a 2.8-day improvement versus fiscal 2015 and are making good progress towards our 3-year goal of a 4-day improvement. These improvements are driven primarily by improvements of all 3 phases of working capital: payables, receivables and inventory.
Our first quarter results included some certain items that were mostly related to the Brakes acquisition, including amortization associated with the transaction. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had significant amount of certain items primarily related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods.
Now I'd like to transition to 3 business updates. First, regarding Brakes. As a reminder, we initially guided that the acquisition will be modestly accretive to fiscal 2017 earnings per share by low to mid-single digits. We are now updating that guidance due to finalizing the treatment of amortization as a certain item and believe this acquisition will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by high single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in subsequent years assuming constant currency.
For the first quarter, Brakes was approximately $0.04 accretive to our business on an adjusted basis. It is important to note that Brakes' business does have some seasonality as the performance is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Accordingly, we do not expect the same accretion each quarter, in particular in quarter number 3.
Second, regarding fuel expense. We expect the favorability we've had over the past few quarters to begin to lap in November.
Separately, we are enhancing our fuel strategy. In the past, we used a third party to forward buy fixed price contracts approximately 12 months out. Going forward, we are transitioning the management of our fuel expense by using derivatives to hedge our exposure. By separating the management of our fuel purchases from our risk management, we will allow for more effective management of the risks. We'll continue to cover approximately 2/3 of our needs with hedges in place to minimize volatility in price.
Finally, we are announcing today the upsizing of our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion and we'll upsize our commercial paper lines accordingly to provide greater liquidity to support our growing business.
In summary, we had a quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that improve our financial performance in both the near and long-term. I'm confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.
Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

And ours is off a little bit as well. So it just reinforces the importance of solidifying those customer relationships and getting penetration where there's that opportunity where customers are growing as well as continue to stay really locked in on retaining our customers and identifying opportunities as we go along.

We're real pleased with how we're managing the margins and still growing the business and taking care of our customers in the right way, and a lot of the steps we took back in the spring to initiate deeper expense reductions are benefiting us right now. So I think the things that we can influence and control we're doing a really good job with.
We're probably a little cautious in terms of the overall macro out there for our customers. We still got 2 points of deflation out there, largely driven by those Center of the Plate categories. So those will be 2 areas where we're probably a little bit cautious.
Obviously, we're in our third year now of earnings growth and I think this is the fourth quarter of double-digit earnings growth on an adjusted basis. So obviously, the bar gets higher and we're ready for that. So we feel very good overall by what we're doing, a little cautious on the environment.
I think to your first question, the way I'm looking at that is we're one quarter into this year and we're just not quite to the halfway point of the 3-year plan.

And while the spend is up, it's not rising at the same rate it was rising. So yes, there's currently a softening out there, I mean, whether it's because of the election or relative pricing between grocery store and restaurants, what others kind of critiqued out. I just -- look, I think there's ebbs and flows in many cycles of economies and I think we're going through that right now. But I think it just puts a premium on quality operators, both in terms of our customer base as well as ourselves. And we feel good about what we're doing and we're doing everything we can to support our customers.
As far as the competitive environment, I wouldn't say there's any change. It's acutely competitive as we've talked about before, all different types of competitors out there. We feel we're very well-positioned. It does play out differently in some markets. But overall, I'd say it's about the same."

So we're doing everything we can in a disciplined way to grow that top line.

We know it certainly impacts the gross margin percent, but it's also, I think, probably most important to think about those other 3 areas that we're focused on because that's how we manage the dollar side of it.
Category management continues to be a very positive for us. As you know, we've been basically in that operating model now for the last 3 years. And it's -- well, we've gone through, I'd say, the major cycle with that. We continue to work with our suppliers and we look at long-term partnerships that continue to provide value for us and, ultimately, for our customers. So category management continues to be a very important part of what we do and how we operate.
Revenue management has been something that now is fully deployed within our organization. And I think we've got a really good set of processes and tools and, ultimately, routines for our sales and merchandising teams to leverage in the marketplace. And it allows us to be, I think, a little quicker on our feet and be able to do the things that we need to do to make sure that our customers' pricing is right on a regular basis. And it's driving really more consistency out of our customers as well.
And then, lastly, partly with the work we're doing in category management, but a continued focus on Sysco Brand, which brings value also to our customers and obviously delivers additional profitability for Sysco has been a key driver for us. And we continue to see improvement within our local customers with our local business. And we, again, saw an improvement in Sysco Brands this last quarter.
So it really is a combination of all of those. And it's hard for us to kind of piece apart each of them individually, but I can tell you that each of them is definitely playing a role."

We've also done a good job, I think, of focusing and driving expenses downward as both Bill and Tom had talked about. And I think when we looked at that plan and sort of the puts and takes of what was going to drive it, we certainly knew there were -- we could have had more inflation, could have had less inflation, some of those factors are what they are.

What we've talked about over the past few quarters was a difference that was primarily driven by the Canadian exchange rate, but that has pretty much mitigated, frankly.

So one of the things you'll see in our certain item reconciliation this quarter is that -- you will see this in our Q. Our D&A is up a bit for this quarter, and it's for a couple of different reasons. Number one, as we talked about last year, we actually expected some -- due to the write-off of the SAP system, there was an acceleration of the amortization related to that. And so there is, again, say, roughly $30 million, I'd say, of the certain item related to that this year that's part of our D&A. There's also -- as a result of the Brakes deal, there is both additional depreciation and amortization as part of that. And so I think if you look at our overall D&A expense for this particular quarter relative to where we've been, those are really the 2 primary contributors on that line as it relates to this.
What Bill is referring to as -- in his comment earlier, if you recall, at the time when we increased our target from $400 million to $500 million at, again, a while back, we had made a couple of comments as it relates to that. Number one was the fact that a component of that difference was related to the fact that we -- with the changeover in our technology strategy that there would be some benefits once, again, the asset was fully written off. Again, there is accelerated amortization we'll be experiencing at the end of last year and through this year, but the benefit of that starting in 2018. So I think that's really what Bill is relating to on that. And so, hopefully, that gives you some clarity on some of the comments and a little bit of the breakdown on that. But you should expect that accelerated amortization from that plus the Brakes to be present throughout the rest of this year."

But it's well beyond just products and pricing. And so I'd say it's the whole portfolio of things we bring to them that's allowed us to be successful and certainly what we believe is the right strategy for us going forward, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's competitive out there each and every day and we just have to make sure that we're doing those right things in the market.

What we're doing, what Tom addressed earlier with the revenue management is using a lot of tools to be more consistent, more targeted in our pricing, but we still need to compete the 2 points out every day for that business.
And interestingly, to me, on the data that we see, to your point, while they're benefiting from deflation, they've got some labor pressures that had been out there for a while now, but the restaurant as a group continue to pass along about a 2-point increase to their customers and that has been incredibly consistent through every cycle that we've seen here. So I think, right now, they are managing it pretty well and the deflation is helping them at some point. I guess, it could become more acute if we were to see the deflation reverse, but as I think Joel pointed out, we don't see that happening here, at least not in this calendar year."

I'm very pleased with our start in fiscal 2017. And this morning, we reported strong first quarter financial results. These results reflect our relentless focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco, the benefits of several key business initiatives that we have implemented over the past few years and the contributions from our new colleagues at Brakes who joined Sysco in early July.
For the quarter and excluding the impact of Brakes, sales grew 1%, gross profit grew 5%, while operating expense grew less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 15%. After reflecting the business results of Brakes, adjusted operating income grew 24% to $627 million and adjusted earnings per share grew to $0.67.
While we benefited from some favorable year-over-year expense comparisons which Joel will touch on in a few minutes, these results were achieved in an uneven economic environment that is impacting our customers' business. Some metrics reflect positive implications for longer-term consumer demand such as steadying unemployment levels, modest GDP growth, increased consumer confidence and healthy momentum in the housing market.
However, the restaurant industry, which represents approximately 60% of the foodservice market, is not currently experiencing the level of growth we have seen in recent quarters. Restaurant traffic continues to show year-over-year declines and restaurant spend has decelerated as well. More specifically, recent data from both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK show weakening overall sales trends.
That said, we continue to execute our business plan and key initiatives very well. I am pleased with our progress to date toward the achievement of our 3-year financial goals and I remain confident in our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives over the long term.
Our improved and increasingly consistent performance for the past 2 years is attributed to multiyear foundational work we have carried out in customer insights, category management, revenue management, supply chain efficiencies and administrative expense management. The benefits of these work streams have positioned us to continue to effectively support the needs of our customers and profitably leverage our volume growth.
Moving forward, we will build on this momentum by maintaining our customer-centric approach while focusing on targeted, disciplined and profitable growth. Both Tom and Joel will provide more detail about the specific initiatives we are currently implementing and the related benefits.
Turning to the Brakes transaction. We continue to work closely with our experienced and talented leadership team to support their growth, drive out their transformative initiatives and identify additional acquisition opportunities. I'm very excited about the long-term benefits that this business will provide Sysco.
In summary, we are off to a good start to fiscal 2017 and I'm encouraged with the progress we are making as we approach the midpoint of our 3-year plan. I'm especially appreciative of the efforts and contributions from all 65,000 of our associates as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.

Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multiyear initiatives. Our favorable operating performance continues to be driven by our ongoing focus on the key levers of our 3-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses, both in our supply chain and administrative functions.
This morning, I'll be providing an update on our business results based on our new segment reporting structure, which highlights U.S. Foodservice operations, International Foodservice operations, SYGMA and all other.
During the quarter, U.S. Foodservice operations, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Broadline, specialty meat, FreshPoint and our European Imports business, grew sales 0.8%, driven by overall case growth in the U.S. Broadline of 1.8%, with local cases driving our growth at 1.9%.
Gross profit in U.S. Foodservice operations grew 4.3% for the quarter and gross margin increased 68 basis points, driven by a combination of factors including our ongoing category management efforts, which is how we now go-to-market with an improved product assortment and centralized approach for a majority of our product procurement, which in turn helps us drive out costs for ourselves and our suppliers; second, improved Sysco Brand performance with our local customers; the deployment of a suite of revenue management tools and processes that bring more discipline to our sales and merchandising teams and, ultimately, more consistent pricing to our customers; and the impact of deflation.
During the quarter, we continued to focus our sales teams on initiatives and activities that will help our customers succeed and grow their business. We have been implementing a variety of sales training and support tools that build overall capability within our selling organization. And we have restructured some of the work within that organization to both free up our marketing associates' time and provide access to our targeted resources to better support our customers.
These efforts, in conjunction with ongoing enhancements to our e-commerce tools which allow our customers to choose how they place their orders with Sysco, are enabling us to better leverage our marketing associates to spend more time supporting our customers with unique programs, innovative products and other business-building solutions.
From a cost perspective, our expense management for the quarter was solid and remains a key area of focus for us moving forward. For U.S. Foodservice operations during the first quarter, we limited total adjusted operating expense growth to 1.8%. Our supply chain performance is progressing well, and we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and continuing process improvements that are driving efficiencies.
For U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by $0.04 for the quarter, and on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case was flat. The continuous improvement efforts in our facilities and the continued investment in training for our warehouse associates and drivers has allowed us to build further capability throughout our supply chain. One such example is the implementation of a labor forecasting tool that enables us to proactively manage hours at our facilities based on the anticipated workload for each shift. We also remain on track to deliver our previously communicated administrative cost reductions, both in corporate and within the operations.
Moving to International Foodservice operations, which is made up of Canada, Europe, Bahamas, International Food Group and our joint ventures in Mexico and Costa Rica. Sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $50 million, both driven by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group. We appreciate the Brakes Group early performance and continue to look forward to working with the management team on achieving our collective plans in the future.
During the quarter, Brakes performed reasonably well in the U.K. amidst a challenging environment and performance in both France and Sweden was relatively strong. Our business in Canada is off to a good start for the fiscal year as we are effectively managing cost within a deflationary and somewhat soft market environment. And lastly, our joint ventures in both Costa Rica and Mexico had solid performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.
SYGMA continues to make progress against their key business initiatives and had 4% sales growth for the first quarter. We continue to feel confident in their ability to deliver their full year growth goals and objectives.
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as part of our 3-year plan. We have continued to make significant progress in all areas for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and I remain optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."

As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including local solid case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management as well as a solid contribution from Brakes. The results that I'll cover for you this morning include Brakes, which significantly impacted our results.
In summary, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, sales grew 11.2%, gross profit dollars grew 20.3%, operating expense growth was 19.2%, all of which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 23.8%, and our adjusted earnings per share grew 28.8%. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by the inclusion of Brakes in our results, though partially offset by deflation of 2.2% in our legacy Sysco business.
Continuing with gross profit and gross margins beyond the addition of Brakes, the key drivers of improvement included category management, revenue management, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. The categories impacted most by deflation continue to be the Center of the Plate, protein and dairy. We expect the trend to continue into calendar 2017. That said, we continue to manage this environment effectively as evidenced by our strong gross profit dollar growth.
The increase in expenses during the quarter beyond the addition of Brakes were mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and a timing shift of expenses related to our option grants from the second quarter into the first and was partially offset by various decreases in indirect spend, fuel costs, favorable comparisons to the prior year which included planned investments and technology spend related to our 3-year plan and foreign exchange translation.
As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.9% compared to 36.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in tax rate is driven by tax credits, lower tax rates in the U.K. due to new tax laws that were recently passed and the mix of business as we grow in lower-rate jurisdictions. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 20.7%.
Cash flow from operations was $249 million, which was $510 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $111 million, which is $492 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both are due mainly to improved working capital performance and payments made on the prior year related to the proposed merger with US Foods.
Net CapEx for the quarter was $138 million.
I'm pleased with our net working capital performance for the quarter. We had a net 2-day improvement versus the prior year and a 2.8-day improvement versus fiscal 2015 and are making good progress towards our 3-year goal of a 4-day improvement. These improvements are driven primarily by improvements of all 3 phases of working capital: payables, receivables and inventory.
Our first quarter results included some certain items that were mostly related to the Brakes acquisition, including amortization associated with the transaction. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had significant amount of certain items primarily related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods.
Now I'd like to transition to 3 business updates. First, regarding Brakes. As a reminder, we initially guided that the acquisition would be modestly accretive to fiscal 2017 earnings per share by low to mid-single digits. We are now updating that guidance due to finalizing the treatment of amortization as a certain item and believe this acquisition will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by high single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in subsequent years assuming constant currency.
For the first quarter, Brakes was approximately $0.04 accretive to our business on an adjusted basis. It is important to note that Brakes' business does have some seasonality as the performance is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Accordingly, we do not expect the same accretion each quarter, in particular in quarter number 3.
Second, regarding fuel expense. We expect the favorability we've had over the past few quarters to begin to lap in November.
Separately, we are enhancing our fuel strategy. In the past, we used a third party to forward buy fixed price contracts approximately 12 months out. Going forward, we are transitioning the management of our fuel expense by using derivatives to hedge our exposure. By separating the management of our fuel purchases from our risk management, we will allow for more effective management of the risk. We'll continue to cover approximately 2/3 of our needs with hedges in place to minimize volatility in price.
Finally, we are announcing today the upsizing of our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, and we'll upsize our commercial paper lines accordingly to provide greater liquidity to support our growing business.
In summary, we had a quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I'm confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.
Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

We're real pleased with how we're managing the margins and still growing the business and taking care of our customers in the right way, and a lot of the steps we took back in the spring to initiate deeper expense reductions are benefiting us right now. So I think the things that we can influence and control we're doing a really good job with. We're probably a little cautious in terms of the overall macro out there for our customers. We still got 2 points of deflation out there, largely driven by those Center of the Plate categories. So those will be 2 areas where we're probably a little bit cautious. Obviously, we're in our third year now of earnings growth and I think this is the fourth quarter of double-digit earnings growth on an adjusted basis. So obviously, the bar gets higher and we're ready for that. So we feel very good overall about what we're doing, a little cautious on the environment.

In terms of where it goes from here, I can just tell you, internally, Tom and his team are very, very focused on penetration, on improved retention and, where appropriate, bringing on new quality customers. So we're doing everything we can in a disciplined way to grow that top line.

Let me -- I did talk about 4 different drivers, and I think we continue to believe each of those is contributing to the work we're doing. It's hard to pull out the deflation component. We know it certainly impacts the gross margin percent, but it's also, I think, probably most important to think about those other 3 areas that we're focused on because that's how we manage the dollar side of it. Category management continues to be a very positive for us. As you know, we've been basically in that operating model now for the last 3 years. And it's -- while we've gone through, I'd say, the major cycle with that. We continue to work with our suppliers and we look at long-term partnerships that continue to provide value for us and, ultimately, for our customers. So category management continues to be a very important part of what we do and how we operate. Revenue management has been something that now is fully deployed within our organization. And I think we've got a really good set of processes and tools and, ultimately, routines for our sales and merchandising teams to leverage in the marketplace. And it allows us to be, I think, a little quicker on our feet and be able to do the things that we need to do to make sure that our customers' pricing is right on a regular basis. And it's driving really more consistency I know for our customers as well. And then, lastly, partly with the work we're doing in category management, but a continued focus on Sysco Brand, which brings value also to our customers and obviously delivers additional profitability for Sysco has been a key driver for us. And we continue to see improvement within our local customers with our local business. And we, again, saw an improvement in Sysco Brands this last quarter. So it really is a combination of all of those. And it's hard for us to kind of tease apart each of them individually, but I can tell you that each of them is definitely playing a role."

And so one of the things -- again, we certainly have done a good job of managing through this deflationary time and still continue to grow our growth in gross profit dollars. We've also done a good job, I think, of focusing and driving expenses downward as both Bill and Tom have talked about. And I think when we looked at that plan and sort of the puts and takes of what was going to drive it, we certainly knew there were -- we could have had more inflation, could have had less inflation, some of those factors are what they are.

So one of the things you'll see in our certain item reconciliation this quarter is that -- you will see this in our Q. Our D&A is up a bit for this quarter, and it's for a couple of different reasons. Number one, as we talked about last year, we actually expected some -- due to the write-off of the SAP system, there was an acceleration of the amortization related to that. And so there is, again, say, roughly $30 million, I'd say, of the certain item related to that this year that's part of our D&A. There's also -- as a result of the Brakes deal, there is both additional depreciation and amortization as part of that. And so I think if you look at our overall D&A expense for this particular quarter relative to where we've been, those are really the 2 primary contributors on that line as it relates to this. What Bill is referring to as -- in his comment earlier, if you recall, at the time when we increased our target from $400 million to $500 million at, again, a while back, we had made a couple of comments as it related to that. Number one was the fact that a component of that difference was related to the fact that we -- with the changeover in our technology strategy that there would be some benefits once, again, the asset was fully written off. Again, there is accelerated amortization we'll be experiencing at the end of last year and through this year, but there’d be benefit of that starting in 2018. So I think that's really what Bill is relating to on that. And so, hopefully, that gives you some clarity on some of the comments and a little bit of the breakdown on that. But you should expect that accelerated amortization from that plus the Brakes to be present throughout the rest of this year."

But it's well beyond just products and pricing. And so I'd say it's the whole portfolio of things we bring to them that's allowed us to be successful and certainly what we believe is the right strategy for us going forward, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's competitive out there each and every day, and we just have to make sure that we're doing those right things in the market.

What we're doing, what Tom addressed earlier with the revenue management is using a lot of tools to be more consistent, more targeted in our pricing, but we still need to compete, as he points out, every day for that business. And interestingly, to me, on the data that we see, to your point, while they're benefiting from deflation, they've got some labor pressures that had been out there for a while now, but the restaurant as a group continue to pass along about a 2-point increase to their customers and that has been incredibly consistent through every cycle that we've seen here. So I think, right now, they are managing it pretty well and the deflation is helping them. At some point, I guess, it could become more acute if we were to see the deflation reverse, but as I think Joel pointed out, we don't see that happening here, at least not in this calendar year."

I'm very pleased with our start in fiscal 2017. And this morning, we reported strong first quarter financial results. These results reflect our relentless focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco, the benefits of several key business initiatives that we have implemented over the past few years and the contributions from our new colleagues at Brakes who joined Sysco in early July.
For the quarter and excluding the impact of Brakes, sales grew 1%, gross profit grew 5%, while operating expense grew less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 15%. After reflecting the business results of Brakes, adjusted operating income grew 24% to $627 million and adjusted earnings per share grew to $0.67.
While we benefited from some favorable year-over-year expense comparisons which Joel will touch on in a few minutes, these results were achieved in an uneven economic environment that is impacting our customers' business. Some metrics reflect positive implications for longer-term consumer demand such as steadying unemployment levels, modest GDP growth, increased consumer confidence and healthy momentum in the housing market.
However, the restaurant industry, which represents approximately 60% of the foodservice market, is not currently experiencing the level of growth we have seen in recent quarters. Restaurant traffic continues to show year-over-year declines and restaurant spend has decelerated as well. More specifically, recent data from both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK show weakening overall sales trends.
That said, we continue to execute our business plan and key initiatives very well. I am pleased with our progress to date toward the achievement of our 3-year financial goals and I remain confident in our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives over the long term.
Our improved and increasingly consistent performance for the past 2 years is attributed to multiyear foundational work we have carried out in customer insights, category management, revenue management, supply chain efficiencies and administrative expense management. The benefits of these work streams have positioned us to continue to effectively support the needs of our customers and profitably leverage our volume growth.
Moving forward, we will build on this momentum by maintaining our customer-centric approach while focusing on targeted, disciplined and profitable growth. Both Tom and Joel will provide more detail about the specific initiatives we are currently implementing and the related benefits.
Turning to the Brakes transaction. We continue to work closely with our experienced and talented leadership team to support their growth, drive out their transformative initiatives and identify additional acquisition opportunities. I'm very excited about the long-term benefits that this business will provide Sysco.
In summary, we are off to a good start to fiscal 2017 and I'm encouraged with the progress we are making as we approach the midpoint of our 3-year plan. I'm especially appreciative of the efforts and contributions from all 65,000 of our associates as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.

Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multiyear initiatives. Our favorable operating performance continues to be driven by our ongoing focus on the key levers of our 3-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses, both in our supply chain and administrative functions.
This morning, I'll be providing an update on our business results based on our new segment reporting structure, which highlights U.S. Foodservice operations, International Foodservice operations, SYGMA and all other.
During the quarter, U.S. Foodservice operations, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Broadline, specialty meat, FreshPoint and our European Imports business, grew sales 0.8%, driven by overall case growth in the U.S. Broadline of 1.8%, with local cases driving our growth at 1.9%.
Gross profit in U.S. Foodservice operations grew 4.3% for the quarter and gross margin increased 68 basis points, driven by a combination of factors including our ongoing category management efforts, which is how we now go-to-market with an improved product assortment and centralized approach for a majority of our product procurement, which in turn helps us drive out costs for ourselves and our suppliers; second, improved Sysco Brand performance with our local customers; the deployment of a suite of revenue management tools and processes that bring more discipline to our sales and merchandising teams and, ultimately, more consistent pricing to our customers; and the impact of deflation.
During the quarter, we continued to focus our sales teams on initiatives and activities that will help our customers succeed and grow their business. We have been implementing a variety of sales training and support tools that build overall capability within our selling organization. And we have restructured some of the work within that organization to both free up our marketing associates' time and provide access to our targeted resources to better support our customers.
These efforts, in conjunction with ongoing enhancements to our e-commerce tools which allow our customers to choose how they place their orders with Sysco, are enabling us to better leverage our marketing associates to spend more time supporting our customers with unique programs, innovative products and other business-building solutions.
From a cost perspective, our expense management for the quarter was solid and remains a key area of focus for us moving forward. For U.S. Foodservice operations during the first quarter, we limited total adjusted operating expense growth to 1.8%. Our supply chain performance is progressing well, and we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and continuing process improvements that are driving efficiencies.
For U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by $0.04 for the quarter, and on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case was flat. The continuous improvement efforts in our facilities and the continued investment in training for our warehouse associates and drivers has allowed us to build further capability throughout our supply chain. One such example is the implementation of a labor forecasting tool that enables us to proactively manage hours at our facilities based on the anticipated workload for each shift. We also remain on track to deliver our previously communicated administrative cost reductions, both in corporate and within the operations.
Moving to International Foodservice operations, which is made up of Canada, Europe, Bahamas, International Food Group and our joint ventures in Mexico and Costa Rica. Sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $50 million, both driven by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group. We appreciate the Brakes Group early performance and continue to look forward to working with the management team on achieving our collective plans in the future.
During the quarter, Brakes performed reasonably well in the U.K. amidst a challenging environment and performance in both France and Sweden was relatively strong. Our business in Canada is off to a good start for the fiscal year as we are effectively managing cost within a deflationary and somewhat soft market environment. And lastly, our joint ventures in both Costa Rica and Mexico had solid performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.
SYGMA continues to make progress against their key business initiatives and had 4% sales growth for the first quarter. We continue to feel confident in their ability to deliver their full year growth goals and objectives.
In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as part of our 3-year plan. We have continued to make significant progress in all areas for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and I remain optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.
Now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer."

As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including local solid case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management as well as a solid contribution from Brakes. The results that I'll cover for you this morning include Brakes, which significantly impacted our results.
In summary, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, sales grew 11.2%, gross profit dollars grew 20.3%, operating expense growth was 19.2%, all of which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 23.8%, and our adjusted earnings per share grew 28.8%. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by the inclusion of Brakes in our results, though partially offset by deflation of 2.2% in our legacy Sysco business.
Continuing with gross profit and gross margins beyond the addition of Brakes, the key drivers of improvement included category management, revenue management, higher Sysco Brand penetration in our local business and deflation. The categories impacted most by deflation continue to be the Center of the Plate, protein and dairy. We expect the trend to continue into calendar 2017. That said, we continue to manage this environment effectively as evidenced by our strong gross profit dollar growth.
The increase in expenses during the quarter beyond the addition of Brakes were mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and a timing shift of expenses related to our option grants from the second quarter into the first and was partially offset by various decreases in indirect spend, fuel costs, favorable comparisons to the prior year which included planned investments and technology spend related to our 3-year plan and foreign exchange translation.
As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.9% compared to 36.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in tax rate is driven by tax credits, lower tax rates in the U.K. due to new tax laws that were recently passed and the mix of business as we grow in lower-rate jurisdictions. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 20.7%.
Cash flow from operations was $249 million, which was $510 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $111 million, which is $492 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both are due mainly to improved working capital performance and payments made on the prior year related to the proposed merger with US Foods.
Net CapEx for the quarter was $138 million.
I'm pleased with our net working capital performance for the quarter. We had a net 2-day improvement versus the prior year and a 2.8-day improvement versus fiscal 2015 and are making good progress towards our 3-year goal of a 4-day improvement. These improvements are driven primarily by improvements of all 3 phases of working capital: payables, receivables and inventory.
Our first quarter results included some certain items that were mostly related to the Brakes acquisition, including amortization associated with the transaction. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had significant amount of certain items primarily related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods.
Now I'd like to transition to 3 business updates. First, regarding Brakes. As a reminder, we initially guided that the acquisition would be modestly accretive to fiscal 2017 earnings per share by low to mid-single digits. We are now updating that guidance due to finalizing the treatment of amortization as a certain item and believe this acquisition will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by high single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in subsequent years assuming constant currency.
For the first quarter, Brakes was approximately $0.04 accretive to our business on an adjusted basis. It is important to note that Brakes' business does have some seasonality as the performance is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Accordingly, we do not expect the same accretion each quarter, in particular in quarter number 3.
Second, regarding fuel expense. We expect the favorability we've had over the past few quarters to begin to lap in November.
Separately, we are enhancing our fuel strategy. In the past, we used a third party to forward buy fixed price contracts approximately 12 months out. Going forward, we are transitioning the management of our fuel expense by using derivatives to hedge our exposure. By separating the management of our fuel purchases from our risk management, we will allow for more effective management of the risk. We'll continue to cover approximately 2/3 of our needs with hedges in place to minimize volatility in price.
Finally, we are announcing today the upsizing of our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, and we'll upsize our commercial paper lines accordingly to provide greater liquidity to support our growing business.
In summary, we had a quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our 3-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I'm confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.
Operator, we are now ready for Q&A."

We're real pleased with how we're managing the margins and still growing the business and taking care of our customers in the right way, and a lot of the steps we took back in the spring to initiate deeper expense reductions are benefiting us right now. So I think the things that we can influence and control we're doing a really good job with. We're probably a little cautious in terms of the overall macro out there for our customers. We still got 2 points of deflation out there, largely driven by those Center of the Plate categories. So those will be 2 areas where we're probably a little bit cautious. Obviously, we're in our third year now of earnings growth and I think this is the fourth quarter of double-digit earnings growth on an adjusted basis. So obviously, the bar gets higher and we're ready for that. So we feel very good overall about what we're doing, a little cautious on the environment. I think to your first question, the way I'm looking at that, Ed, is we're one quarter into this year and we're just not quite to the halfway point of the 3-year plan.

And so at this point, we feel very good about how we're managing the environment.
In terms of where it goes from here, I can just tell you, internally, Tom and his team are very, very focused on penetration, on improved retention and, where appropriate, bringing on new quality customers. So we're doing everything we can in a disciplined way to grow that top line. But clearly, it puts a premium on managing our expenses here and continue to find ways to price in a way that works for us as well as for our customers. So that's the part we can control and influence. As far as where the market goes, it's really hard to call right now, given everything that's going on in the country.

Let me -- I did talk about 4 different drivers, and I think we continue to believe each of those is contributing to the work we're doing. It's hard to pull out the deflation component. We know it certainly impacts the gross margin percent, but it's also, I think, probably most important to think about those other 3 areas that we're focused on because that's how we manage the dollar side of it. Category management continues to be a very positive for us. As you know, we've been basically in that operating model now for the last 3 years. And it's -- while we've gone through, I'd say, the major cycle with that. We continue to work with our suppliers and we look at long-term partnerships that continue to provide value for us and, ultimately, for our customers. So category management continues to be a very important part of what we do and how we operate. Revenue management has been something that now is fully deployed within our organization. And I think we've got a really good set of processes and tools and, ultimately, routines for our sales and merchandising teams to leverage in the marketplace. And it allows us to be, I think, a little quicker on our feet and be able to do the things that we need to do to make sure that our customers' pricing is right on a regular basis. And it's driving really more consistency I know for our customers as well. And then, lastly, partly with the work we're doing in category management, but a continued focus on Sysco Brand, which brings value also to our customers and obviously delivers additional profitability for Sysco has been a key driver for us. And we continue to see improvement within our local customers with our local business. And we, again, saw an improvement in Sysco Brands this last quarter. So it really is a combination of all of those. And it's hard for us to kind of tease apart each of them individually, but I can tell you that each of them is definitely playing a role."

I think the really important part of this, though, is to -- one of the things we've talked about a bit externally is this gap or this delta between our growth in gross profit dollars and our growth in expense dollars. And so one of the things -- again, we certainly have done a good job of managing through this deflationary time and still continue to grow our growth in gross profit dollars. We've also done a good job, I think, of focusing and driving expenses downward as both Bill and Tom have talked about. And I think when we looked at that plan and sort of the puts and takes of what was going to drive it, we certainly knew there were -- we could have had more inflation, could have had less inflation, some of those factors are what they are.

Firstly, there seems to be some confusion about what non-GAAP D&A should be for the business in '17 and maybe even '18. Bill, I think in the last question, you mentioned some technology write-off that you had done recently that may benefit that D&A line. But I hate to ask such a specific question because a lot of people are -- do have some really different estimates. Can you give us a little bit more specific help on that specific line?"

So one of the things you'll see in our certain item reconciliation this quarter is that -- you will see this in our Q. Our D&A is up a bit for this quarter, and it's for a couple of different reasons. Number one, as we talked about last year, we actually expected some -- due to the write-off of the SAP system, there was an acceleration of the amortization related to that. And so there is, again, say, roughly $30 million, I'd say, of the certain item related to that this year that's part of our D&A. There's also -- as a result of the Brakes deal, there is both additional depreciation and amortization as part of that. And so I think if you look at our overall D&A expense for this particular quarter relative to where we've been, those are really the 2 primary contributors on that line as it relates to this. What Bill is referring to as -- in his comment earlier, if you recall, at the time when we increased our target from $400 million to $500 million at, again, a while back, we had made a couple of comments as it related to that. Number one was the fact that a component of that difference was related to the fact that we -- with the changeover in our technology strategy that there would be some benefits once, again, the asset was fully written off. Again, there is accelerated amortization we'll be experiencing at the end of last year and through this year, but there’d be benefit of that starting in 2018. So I think that's really what Bill is relating to on that. And so, hopefully, that gives you some clarity on some of the comments and a little bit of the breakdown on that. But you should expect that accelerated amortization from that plus the Brakes to be present throughout the rest of this year."

As we said earlier, it continues to be very competitive out there, whether it's a chain restaurant customer or a street customer for us. And I think the way we try to look at value we bring to those customers is certainly beyond just price. We offer a wide range of, obviously, products and services to these folks. We believe we bring them value each and every day. We talked a little bit about Sysco Brand earlier, and Sysco Brand is a great example of where we're able to bring basically lower cost of goods to our customers and put them in a position where they can earn as much as they can from their offering. But it's well beyond just products and pricing. And so I'd say it's the whole portfolio of things we bring to them that's allowed us to be successful and certainly what we believe is the right strategy for us going forward, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's competitive out there each and every day, and we just have to make sure that we're doing those right things in the market. We absolutely believe we need to be price competitive, and that's one of the components of what we focus on."

So the customers, they're benefiting from the food cost deflation. What we're doing, what Tom addressed earlier with the revenue management is using a lot of tools to be more consistent, more targeted in our pricing, but we still need to compete, as he points out, every day for that business. And interestingly, to me, on the data that we see, to your point, while they're benefiting from deflation, they've got some labor pressures that had been out there for a while now, but the restaurant as a group continue to pass along about a 2-point increase to their customers and that has been incredibly consistent through every cycle that we've seen here. So I think, right now, they are managing it pretty well and the deflation is helping them. At some point, I guess, it could become more acute if we were to see the deflation reverse, but as I think Joel pointed out, we don't see that happening here, at least not in this calendar year."
