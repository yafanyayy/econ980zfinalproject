2015 was a year in which we began the transformation of Albermarle with the acquisition of Rockwood. It was a year of change, integration and most importantly, execution and performance. We laid out our goals for the year in 2015. 
Integrated Rockwood businesses achieved $50 million of synergies, delivered adjusted of between $935 million and $1 billion, deliver adjusted free cash flow of $450 million to $550 million in diverse noncore assets. We delivered on all of these objectives and raise our dividend for the 21st consecutive year. 
The Lithium and Chemetall Surface Treatment businesses we acquired exceeded our initial 2015 profitability expectations. In total, as forecasted, the company generated $959 million of adjusted EBITDA and $506 million of free cash flow before one-time items. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, Lithium, Chemetall Surface Treatment, heavy oil upgrading and PCS, each grew adjusted EBITDA by greater than 10% versus 2014. 
We completed the sale of the metal sulfides business in January and of our minerals business at the beginning of February 2016. Neither of these businesses were core for us and the proceeds from those sales have already been applied against our debt, allowing us to retire roughly $330 million in debt. As a result, our net debt has been reduced to about $3.3 billion as of early February, in line with our expectations. This is an important step toward our goal of reaching our net debt to EBITDA target of 2.5x by the end of 2017. 
In 2015, our focused efforts on integrations and synergies allowed us to reduce costs and become more efficient without negatively impacting our businesses in any way. In total, our team achieved $60 million of synergies related savings in 2015, 20% above our original commitment. On a full year basis, synergies achieved in 2015 delivered savings of roughly $88 million in 2016, putting us slightly ahead of schedule and leaving only $32 million needing in additional synergies to reach our goal of $120 million in savings in 2016 as compared to 2014. We already have identified profits in place that give us confidence that we will achieve this goal. 
Finally, we strengthened our industry-leading Lithium business by reaching 3 critical milestones. First, we completed and started up our new 20,000 net time battery grade lithium carbonate plant in the La Negra, Chile. Second, we received a new permit, which allows us to significantly increase [indiscernible] at the [indiscernible]this to feed our expansion plans for battery grade lithium derivatives. Third, we announced the memorandum of understanding with [indiscernible], which will extend the life and increase the volume of our lithium in Chile. Once the definitive agreement on the was signed, which we expect in the next few months, we will have significantly increased our permitted annual production capacity of lithium carbonate from the outcome of source to more than 70,000 metric tons. The definitive agreement will increase both the quantity of lithium that we can extract from the [indiscernible] and the expected lifetime of our secured reserves in Chile to 27 years from the beginning of 2017 based on about 70,000 metric tons of annual production capacity of lithium carbonate. The combination of the permit and the increase quota further cement our leadership position in lithium and better position us to meet our strategic goal to capture 50% of the incremental lithium growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."
18671,321717215,935589,"Albemarle Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Luke. For the fourth quarter, we reported all in diluted earnings per share of $1.55 or $1.03 per share, excluding special items. For the full year, we reported all in diluted earnings per share of $3 or $3.94, excluding special items. There wer",1384,"Thanks, Luke. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported all in diluted earnings per share of $1.55 or $1.03 per share, excluding special items. For the full year, we reported all in diluted earnings per share of $3 or $3.94, excluding special items. There were a number of one-time special gains and losses during the quarter in the year, including the release of a tax reserved, our normal fourth quarter marked-to-market adjustments for pensions and matters related to the Rockwood acquisition and refinancing. 
A full reconciliation of these items for both the quarter and the year can be found in both the earnings release and in the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
Our 2015 effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and items transit ended 2015 at just under 25%, 2-percentage points less than prior guidance. In the fourth quarter, which are actions related to the repatriation of cash to the United States, the results within a lower full year tax rate for purposes. This results in a non-cash earnings per share benefit of about $0.10 in the fourth quarter. 
Capital expenditures ended 2015 at $228 million, just over 6% of sales, and in line with previous guidance. At year-end, operating working capital, including assets held for sale, was 26% of sales, unchanged from the end of the third quarter. Similarly, operating working capital in our core businesses remained at 25% of sales at the end of the year, also unchanged from the end of the third quarter. Combining all these elements, we generated free cash flow, defined as cash from operations, adding back pension and post retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures of $506 million in 2015, excluding one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related cost. This number is well in line with our guidance as $475 million to $525 million at the end of the third quarter as we, again, generated significant cash from our businesses in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow, including one-time cost for the full year 2015, was $155 million. At the end of the year, Albermarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as measured by our bank covenants was 3.8x, an improvement from our original fourth quarter projection of 3.9x. 
Finally, as we've discussed all year, unfavorable currency exchange impacts had a notable negative effect on earnings throughout 2015. For the full year, negative currency impacts related to our businesses reduced revenue by $240 million or 6% and adjusted EBITDA by $55 million, also 6% compared to 2014. 
Now we turn to business unit performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Refining Solutions reported fourth quarter net sales of $200 million and adjusted EBITDA of $53 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. Sequentially, from the third quarter 2015, sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. Both clean fuels technologies or HPC Catalysts and heavy oil upgrading or FCC Catalysts performed in line with expectations. Results were negatively impacted by just over $5 million related to certain reserves taken in the quarter. For the full year 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Refining Solutions was down 19%, excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts. All of the decline was in clean fuels technologies. In contrast,, excluding years where rare earth surcharges had a significant impact on results, Heavy Oil Upgrading profits reached a new high in 2015. Underscoring our confidence in the value that our catalyst delivered to our customers, we recently announced the 10% price increase in Heavy Oil Upgrading catalyst. 
Fourth quarter net sales in Performance Chemicals were $386 million with adjusted EBITDA of over $120 million resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. Compared to fourth quarter 2014, net sales were down 1% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. For all of 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Performance Chemicals increased by 10% compared to 2014. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, adjusted EBITDA growth was an even more impressive 14%, driven by strong growth -- strong earnings growth in lithium and PCS. 
Lithium continues to deliver strong results. Fourth quarter net sales were up almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA was up almost 15% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the fourth straight quarter of greater than 40% margins. 
Overall volume grew in the fourth quarter -- overall volume growth, excuse me, in the fourth quarter was 14% year-on-year with pricing improving by approximately 3%. Battery grade prices -- price increases in volume growth were again significantly above these averages. For the full year, lithium delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of almost 19%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 42%. Adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $42 million in the fourth quarter, results were in line with expectations from the beginning of the quarter. As planned, end of year inventory management has significant negative impact on profitability. 
For the full year, Bromine adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat on an as-reported basis and was up 5%, excluding negative currency exchange impacts with better-than-expected volumes in clear brine fluids and overall pricing improvement versus 2014. 
Finally, PCS, our polyolefin catalysts business delivered another strong quarter with both net sales and adjusted EBITDA similar to fourth quarter 2014. Fourth quarter results were above initial expectations due to stronger than forecasted sales, favorable raw materials and utilities costs and the impact of synergies. For the year, PCS delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 22%, driven by sales growth and product mix and our specialty single-site catalyst business and cost savings related to assets rationalization at the end of 2014. 
Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $208 million with adjusted EBITDA of $54 million resulting in margins of almost 26%. Excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts, sales on adjusted EBITDA were up 13% and 26%, respectively, compared to fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, excluding negative currency exchange impacts, growth was impressive, with net sales up by almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA by 14%. Growth was most significant in automotive, aerospace, aluminum finishing and coil-end markets. Regionally, North America and Asia-Pacific, where we are benefiting from 100% ownership of the former Shanghai JV, let the way. Western Europe also performed well, especially Germany, Spain and Scandinavia. 
Now, I'll turn to 2016. First, I'll bring the balance sheet items in foreign exchange, and then Luke will cover the business and overall company forecast. 
We currently expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and items to be approximately 27% in 2016. Note that we do not expect the same rate benefits related to the repatriation of cash to the United States in 2016 that we saw in 2015. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate to return to the level originally expected for most of last year. 
Our capital spending remains firmly under control, and we plan to maintain 2016 spending at a level similar to 2015 or our to $230 million to $240 million. Note that this includes growth capital required for lithium this year, as well as maintenance and continuity capital for all of our businesses. Our plan does not foresee working capital improvement, but we do expect to maintain operating working capital in our core businesses at approximately 25% of sales. However, working capital remains potential source of additional cash for us, and we will continue programs to create incremental improvement over time. 
Depreciation and amortization will be in the range of $280 million to $290 million, an increase from $260 million in 2015, driven primarily by the impact of our new battery grade lithium carbonate plant in La Negra, Chile. Corporate costs are expected to be about $80 million in line with 2015. 
Finally, we do not expect foreign exchange to have the same negative impact on earnings as in 2015, but we do expect another $10 million to $20 million of headwind versus last year related to exchange rates versus the dollar and that impact will be reflected in the guidance Luke will provide for each of the businesses. The key driver will be the U.S. dollar to euro rate and given the mix changes in our business since the acquisition of Rockwood, we expect every penny move to the dollar against the euro to impact EBITDA by about $1.5 million to $2.5 million on all full year basis. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke."

The impact of lower oil prices in the global economy worries about economic weakness in China and other emerging economies, questionable gross prospects in the U.S., Europ",869,"2015 ended and 2016 has begun with continued economic uncertainty around the world. The impact of lower oil prices in the global economy worries about economic weakness in China and other emerging economies, questionable gross prospects in the U.S., Europe and Japan and currency fluctuations all underscore this uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we still expect growth in most of our businesses in 2016. 
We expect 2016 net sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA of between $900 million and $950 million and adjusted earnings per share of between $3.45 to $3.80. We recognize that the timing of a potential sale of biochemistry services create some additional uncertainty in these ranges. We currently expect the cadence of earnings to be roughly equal between the first and second half of 2016 but note that normal fluctuation in our businesses, such as catalysts orders moving from one quarter to another, could have a significant impact on quarterly results. 
As shown on Page 16 of the earnings presentation posted on the website, excluding the impact of the $52 million non-cash foreign exchange gain from the first quarter of 2015 and the operations of the 2 divested businesses from 2015 adjusted EBITDA, our forecasted 2016 adjusted EBITDA range represents an increase of 3.5% to 9% versus 2015. Overall adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be right around 28%, an increase from 26% in 2015 as we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and the performance of our core businesses. 
We were just over the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted free-cash-flow guidance of $475 million to $525 million, which positions us well to meet 2016 guidance that we first provided in September of last year. Specifically,, we expect to generate $550 million to $650 million of free cash flow before one-time items related to the acquisition and $450 million to $550 million, including those cost, more than triple our 2015 actual free cash flow. 
Turning to each of our businesses. We expect a double-digit percentage increase in lithium earnings. Volume growth in battery grade applications continues to be strong. Note that global sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles in 2015 increased by 70% compared to 2014. We also expect favorable overall pricing versus 2015, and we continue to enjoy a favorable cost position given the quality of our lithium reserves in Chile and the Talison joint venture. These factors positioned us to maintain strong margins that we saw in 2015. 
PCS is expected to be relatively flat. After a 22% increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2015, we expect 2016 to be a year where we consolidate and maintain this gain as opposed to seeing much additional growth in earnings. Chemetall Surface Treatment is forecasted to grow adjusted EBITDA by mid- to high-single digits on a percentage basis. The diversity of our business in various end markets and geographies combined with the strength of our technologies and our commercial team, will allow this business to continue to grow even in a more uncertain economy. 
Refining Solutions should return to earnings growth in 2016 with adjusted EBITDA expected to increase by high-single digits on a percentage basis. Although we do have some customers with planned shutdowns that will dampen result in the first half of the year, the low price of oil should continue to drive strong global gasoline demand benefiting Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts. Additional refinery turnarounds should improve Clean Fuels Technologies results, although we expect continued mix challenges in this business given the operating environment for integrated refiners. 
For example, certain national oil companies in South America have postponed all hydroprocessing catalysts purchasers, which we originally planned for 2016. In Bromine, as we have previously discussed, our methyl bromide supplier agreement expired at the end of 2015 and was not replaced. The loss of this business, combined with an expected decline for clear brine fluids in offshore drilling projects throughout 2016 puts downward pressure on a year-over-year Bromine results. Despite this pressure on earnings, we expect this business to deliver free cash flow similar to levels in 2015. We will continue to drive pricing in this business and will aggressively seek cost-reduction opportunities to address margins and profitability. 
With respect to synergies, as previously noted, projects already executed in 2015 will drive calendar year savings of $88 million in 2016 and we have additional identify products that makes us confident in achieving the $120 million incremented savings in 2016 versus 2014. The net productivity numbers that will flow through the P&L versus 2015 is forecasted to be an additional $40 million to $50 million in 2016. We are currently, forecasting to invest in R&D, technology and increased sales coverage in lithium, Refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment given the attractive opportunities we see in those businesses. 
In closing, 2015 was a year in which we delivered on our commitments and began the transformation of Albermarle. In 2016, we will continue that momentum. Our focus is clear, we will continue to drive superior performance in our industry-leading businesses and use the cash generated from those businesses to deleverage, return cash to shareholders via dividends and invest in the key growth opportunities we see before us."

We are going to price lithium so that we get value today and so that we are ensuring that this market continues to grow. We are not going to price lithium in such a way that drive the demand out of the market. It's very critical that we do this because this is the best growth business in the specialty chemical industry and we're not going to get greedy early.

And I think, that's how the entire industry views it. So you will see in my comments that we are investing in R&D to drive that technological advantage to give our customers the ability to make more money, and then we'll get the price. Nor as we talked about the last time we raised prices, this is a 3-year process because that's how the contracts flows.

I think if you really look at the Bromine what I would say is remember we lost that Bromine contracts so it was a profitable business for us, and we framed that up last year, about the type or profitability was, and we lost that. So that was a big hurdle to overcome. At then from a volume standpoint, the big volume play that we're seeing is completion fluids. And what's going to happen to completion fluids during the year, you've got about 25% of the CapEx from the E&P's or out of the market, they've already announced it. So eventually, that's going to slide out. So those are the 2 big volumes. I think, prices, we've seen, in some pockets, you've seen price down a little bit but overall, prices holding up pretty good and we're getting some price increases across. I think, how long it's going to last, whether it's the bottom of the cycle are not, really depends upon completion fluids and it's a big tail on completion fluids that you need to remember. So if they start -- oil prices pop up and they start putting deepwater rigs back out and the capital budgets come up, the completion fluids won't pop right back up for us in deepwater. You'll see a lag. So we're on the tail right now. We were on the tail in 2016, we're still good. In 2017, I can't predict that because I don't know what oil's going to be then, but I think that our focus in Bromine will continue to be what it is in 2016. We are going to drive that business for cash to take that cash to allow us to deleverage, to allow us to invest in other growth opportunities in our business positioned our cost position in our technology will allow us to do that."

And as a result, they're going to be testing to see if there's another catalyst out there that gives them an advantage over a catalyst they're using. If we -- I want to make sure you understand, if we have a 3-year contract to supply an FCC Catalysts to a unit, the catalyst that we're supplying at the end of that 3-year period can be very different than a catalyst we're supplying at the beginning because our people are in there with that unit on a daily basis making sure they're understanding the change in their crudes, like the change in the operating mode, change in the pressure drop, all of those things and tweaking and changing that FCC Catalysts so that we're getting them the best performance they could have so they can make more money. So it is -- they are looking for that every time and they bring in test catalyst from other people because they want to understand if they're really doing that and the only way they know to do it, is to work in that specific unit. So we welcome that, that's why we invest in technology. That's why this is the great business to be if you got a technological advantage, and we're excited about it and we're looking forward to a great 2016. And another thing on HPC, remember HBC was down in 2015, fairly significantly. So we're planning a big uptick there but not for 2014."

I was hoping somebody would ask this having just personally returned from China. So we do seem, as you've noted, there has been an increase in the Bromine price in China throughout 2015, that was driven by tightness in local supply. It's our review and also we had commissions and external research through some that collaborated our view, which is really a few different pieces to it. One of them is, depending on the area, Bromine production in China was suspended 3 separate times. Weather-related, safety and environmental, some of that was at the Shenzhen explosions, as well as the military parade in Beijing, as well as the annual winter shutdown. So up to 25% of the market, of the capacity, was shut down in China at some point throughout 2015. But on an annualized basis, according to the research that we commissioned, it really amounted to about 10% of total production. A big driver to this and I think it's also been noted by others, is also the reduction year-over-year in imports in the end of 2015. So the inventory dry down in China had an impact on price as well and that was up to a 30% year-over-year reduction in imports and the back half of 2015, and that was somewhat of a lag effect on pricing. It's our view that as the winter shutdown ends, end of February, beginning of March, we will start to see prices come back down. So post winter shutdown and as imports are resuming, we also think that, that will put downward pressure on what's currently a high price for Bromine in China. That being said, we are taking the opportunity where we can to capture price on derivatives in China. We haven't seen much of an effect outside of China, but it is our strategy to have a position in China, and we are doing what we can currently, to capture additional price opportunity that market."

If you look at the businesses that we have, you've got lithium that, I think, and we've been pretty open about it. We think lithium obviously high- single to double-digit growth and our cost position in that will work ourselves down at the cost chain as we were able to get more efficient and bring more capacity online because we've already got the fixed cost. So if I look at catalyst, I think long-term catalyst is growth position where you're going to see it grow. A lot of it depends upon oil, but it really is tied to the demand for transportation fuel, that's what drives it. And that's generally raised in 1% to 3% a year and that's what's so important in those businesses, so we can now earn that. The third piece if you look at Surface Treatment, they've grown about mid- to high single digits on a regular basis and I would expect that to continue. So when you roll all the stuff together and we get the synergies baked in and rode through and get more efficiencies, I don't see the reason we can't get up and see nice year-over-year earnings growth in that kind of range for mid- to high single digits which you can extrapolate that out and see what that number will be. But I think the earning power -- the other thing I would say about '11 and '12, when you look at those numbers, you've got still in '11 that falls demand from a Bromine but we allocate Bromine on a daily basis because of the demand for coming out of the 2009 recession and you've got a lot of pass-through in there related to that rare earth spike and the pass-throughs from that. So just be a little mindful of the year should kick, but I would say is from where we are today, you should see continued growth in EPS that will deliver nice shareholder return for our shareholders."

2015 was a year in which we began the transformation of Albermarle with the acquisition of Rockwood. It was a year of change, integration and most importantly, execution and performance. We laid out our goals for the year in early 2015. 
Integrated Rockwood businesses achieved $50 million of synergies, delivered adjusted EBITDA between $935 million and $1 billion, deliver adjusted free cash flow of $450 million to $550 million and divest noncore assets. We delivered on all of these objectives and raised our dividend for the 21st consecutive year. 
The Lithium and Chemetall Surface Treatment businesses we acquired exceeded our initial 2015 profitability expectations. In total, as forecasted, the company generated $959 million of adjusted EBITDA and $506 million of free cash flow before one-time items. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, Lithium, Chemetall Surface Treatment, Heavy Oil Upgrading and PCS, each grew adjusted EBITDA by greater than 10% versus 2014. 
We completed the sale of a metal sulfides business in January and of our minerals business at the beginning of February 2016. Neither of these businesses were core for us and the proceeds from those sales have already been applied against our debt, allowing us to retire roughly $330 million in debt. As a result, our net debt has been reduced to about $3.3 billion as of early February, in line with our expectations. This is an important step toward our goal of reaching our net debt-to-EBITDA target of 2.5x by the end of 2017. 
In 2015, our focused efforts on integrations and synergies allowed us to reduce costs and become more efficient without negatively impacting our businesses in any way. In total, our team achieved $60 million of synergies-related savings in 2015, 20% above our original commitment. On a full year basis, synergies achieved in 2015 will deliver savings of roughly $88 million in 2016, putting us slightly ahead of schedule and leaving only $32 million needed in additional synergies to reach our goal of $120 million in savings in 2016 as compared to 2014. We already have identified projects in place that give us confidence that we will achieve this goal. 
Finally, we strengthened our industry-leading Lithium business by reaching 3 critical milestones. First, we completed and started up our new 20,000 met ton battery-grade lithium carbonate plant in the La Negra, Chile. Second, we received a new permit, which allows us to significantly increase brine pump at the Salar de Atacama to feed our expansion plans for battery-grade lithium derivatives. Third, we announced the memorandum of understanding with Korfu [ph], which will extend the life and increase the volume of our lithium quota in Chile. Once the definitive agreement on the quota is signed, which we expect in the next few months, we will have significantly increased our permitted annual production capacity of lithium carbonate from the Atacama brine source to more than 70,000 metric tons. The definitive agreement will increase both the quantity of lithium that we can extract from the Salar de Atacama and the expected lifetime of our secured reserves in Chile to 27 years from the beginning of 2017 based on about 70,000 metric tons of annual production capacity of lithium carbonate. The combination of the permit and the increased quota further cement our leadership position in lithium and better position us to meet our strategic goal to capture 50% of the incremental lithium growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

For the fourth quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $1.55 or $1.03 per share, excluding special items. For the full year, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $3 or $3.94, excluding special items. There were a number of one-time special gains and losses during the quarter and the year, including the release of a tax reserved, our normal fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustments for pensions and matters related to the Rockwood acquisition and refinancing. A full reconciliation of these items for both the quarter and the year can be found in both the earnings release and in the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
Our 2015 effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items ended 2015 at just under 25%, 2 percentage points less than prior guidance. In the fourth quarter, we took actions related to the repatriation of cash to the United States that resulted in a lower full year tax rate for book purposes. This resulted in a noncash earnings per share benefit of about $0.10 in the fourth quarter. 
Capital expenditures ended 2015 at $228 million, just over 6% of sales and in line with previous guidance. At year end, operating working capital, including assets held for sale, was 26% of sales, unchanged from the end of the third quarter. Similarly, operating working capital in our core businesses remained at 25% of sales at the end of the year, also unchanged from the end of the third quarter. Combining all these elements, we generated free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures of $506 million in 2015, excluding one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related cost. This number is well in line with our guidance of $475 million to $525 million at the end of the third quarter as we, again, generated significant cash from our businesses in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow, including one-time cost for the full year 2015, was $155 million. At the end of the year, Albermarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by our bank covenants, was 3.8x, an improvement from our original fourth quarter projection of 3.9x. 
Finally, as we've discussed all year, unfavorable currency exchange impacts had a notable negative effect on earnings throughout 2015. For the full year, negative currency impacts related to our businesses reduced revenue by $240 million or 6% and adjusted EBITDA by $55 million, also 6% compared to 2014. 
Now let me turn to business unit performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Refining Solutions reported fourth quarter net sales of $200 million and adjusted EBITDA of $53 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. Sequentially, from the third quarter 2015, sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. Both Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC Catalysts and Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts performed in line with expectations. Results were negatively impacted by just over $5 million related to certain reserves taken in the quarter. For the full year 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Refining Solutions was down 19%, excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts. All of the decline was in Clean Fuels Technologies. In contrast, excluding years where rare earth surcharges had a significant impact on results, Heavy Oil Upgrading profits reached a new high in 2015. Underscoring our confidence in the value that our catalyst delivered to our customers, we recently announced a 10% price increase in Heavy Oil Upgrading catalyst. 
Fourth quarter net sales in Performance Chemicals were $386 million with adjusted EBITDA of $120 million resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. Compared to fourth quarter 2014, net sales were down 1% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. For all of 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Performance Chemicals increased by 10% compared to 2014. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, adjusted EBITDA growth was an even more impressive 14%, driven by strong growth -- strong earnings growth in Lithium and PCS. 
Lithium continues to deliver strong results. Fourth quarter net sales were up almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA was up almost 15% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the fourth straight quarter of greater than 40% margins. 
Overall volume grew in the fourth quarter -- overall volume growth, excuse me, in the fourth quarter was 14% year-on-year with pricing improving by approximately 3%. Battery-grade prices -- price increases and volume growth were again significantly above these averages. For the full year, Lithium delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of almost 19%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 42%. Adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $42 million in the fourth quarter, results were in line with expectations from the beginning of the quarter as planned end-of-year inventory management has significant negative impact on profitability. 
For the full year, Bromine adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat on an as-reported basis and was up 5%, excluding negative currency exchange impacts with better-than-expected volumes in clear brine fluids and overall pricing improvement versus 2014. 
Finally, PCS, our polyolefin catalyst and [indiscernible] business delivered another strong quarter with both net sales and adjusted EBITDA similar to fourth quarter 2014. Fourth quarter results were above initial expectations due to stronger-than-forecasted sales, favorable raw materials and utilities costs and the impact of synergies. For the year, PCS delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 22%, driven by sales growth and product mix in our specialty single-side catalyst business and cost savings related to asset rationalization at the end of 2014. 
Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $208 million with adjusted EBITDA of $54 million resulting in margins of almost 26%. Excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts, sales on adjusted EBITDA were up 13% and 26%, respectively, compared to fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, excluding negative currency exchange impacts, growth was impressive with net sales up by almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA by 14%. Growth was most significant in automotive, aerospace, aluminum finishing and coil end markets. Regionally, North America and Asia Pacific, where we are benefiting from 100% ownership of the former Shanghai JV, led the way. Western Europe also performed well, especially Germany, Spain and Scandinavia. 
Now I'll turn to 2016. First, I'll frame the balance sheet items and foreign exchange, and then Luke will cover the business and overall company forecast. 
We currently expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items to be approximately 27% in 2016. Note that we do not expect the same rate benefits related to repatriation of cash to the United States in 2016 that we saw in 2015. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate to return to the level originally expected for most of last year. 
Our capital spending remains firmly under control and we plan to maintain 2016 spending at a level similar to 2015 or our to $230 million to $240 million. Note that this includes growth capital required for Lithium this year as well as maintenance and continuity capital for all of our businesses. Our plan does not foresee working capital improvement, but we do expect to maintain operating working capital in our core businesses at approximately 25% of sales. However, working capital remains potential source of additional cash for us and we'll continue programs to create incremental improvement over time. 
Depreciation and amortization will be in the range of $280 million to $290 million, an increase from $260 million in 2015, driven primarily by the impact of our new battery-grade lithium carbonate plant in La Negra, Chile. Corporate costs are expected to be about $80 million in line with 2015. 
Finally, we do not expect foreign exchange to have the same negative impact on earnings as in 2015, but we do expect another $10 million to $20 million of headwind versus last year related to exchange rates versus the dollar and that impact will be reflected in the guidance Luke will provide for each of the businesses. The key driver will be the U.S. dollar to euro rate. And given the mix changes in our business since the acquisition of Rockwood, we expect every penny move of the dollar against the euro to impact EBITDA by about $1.5 million to $2.5 million on a full year basis. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke."
18671,321717215,935909,"Albemarle Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","2015 ended and 2016 has begun with continued economic uncertainty around the world. The impact of low oil prices on the global economy, worries about economic weakness in China and other emerging economies, questionable growth prospects in the U.S., Europ",873,"2015 ended and 2016 has begun with continued economic uncertainty around the world. The impact of low oil prices on the global economy, worries about economic weakness in China and other emerging economies, questionable growth prospects in the U.S., Europe and Japan and currency fluctuations all underscore this uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we still expect growth in most of our businesses in 2016. 
We expect 2016 net sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of between $900 million and $950 million and adjusted earnings per share of between $3.45 to $3.80. We recognize that the timing of a potential sale of Fine Chemistry Services create some additional uncertainty in these ranges. We currently expect the cadence of earnings to be roughly equal between the first and second half of 2016, but note that normal fluctuation in our businesses, such as large catalyst orders moving from one quarter to another, could have a significant impact on quarterly results. 
As shown on Page 16 of the earnings presentation posted on our website, excluding the impact of the $52 million noncash foreign exchange gain from the first quarter of 2015 and the operations of the 2 divested businesses from 2015 adjusted EBITDA, our forecasted 2016 adjusted EBITDA range represents an increase of 3.5% to 9% versus 2015. Overall, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be right around 28%, an increase from 26% in 2015 as we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and the performance of our core businesses. 
We were just over the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance of $475 million to $525 million, which positions us well to meet 2016 guidance that we first provided in September of last year. Specifically, we expect to generate $550 million to $650 million of free cash flow before one-time items related to the acquisition and $450 million to $550 million, including those costs, or more than triple our 2015 actual free cash flow. 
Turning to each of our businesses. We expect a double-digit percentage increase in Lithium earnings. Volume growth in battery-grade applications continues to be strong. Note that global sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles in 2015 increased by 70% compared to 2014. We also expect favorable overall pricing versus 2015 and we continue to enjoy a favorable cost position given the quality of our lithium reserves in Chile and the Talison joint venture. These factors position us to maintain strong margins that we saw in 2015. 
PCS is expected to be relatively flat. After a 22% increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2015, we expect 2016 to be a year where we consolidate and maintain this gain as opposed to seeing much additional growth in earnings. Chemetall Surface Treatment is forecasted to grow adjusted EBITDA by mid- to high-single digits on a percentage basis. The diversity of our business in various end markets and geographies combined with the strength of our technologies and our commercial team, will allow this business to continue to grow even in a more uncertain economy. 
Refining Solutions should return to earnings growth in 2016 with adjusted EBITDA expected to increase by high-single digits on a percentage basis. Although we do have some customers with planned shutdowns that will dampen results in the first half of the year, the low price of oil should continue to drive strong global gasoline demand benefiting Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts. Additional refinery turnarounds should improve Clean Fuels Technologies results, although we expect continued mix challenges in this business given the operating environment for integrated refiners. For example, certain national oil companies in South America have postponed all hydroprocessing catalysts purchasers, which we originally planned for 2016. 
In Bromine, as we have previously discussed, our methyl bromide supply agreement expired at the end of 2015 and was not replaced. The loss of this business, combined with an expected decline for clear brine fluids in offshore drilling projects throughout 2016, puts downward pressure on year-over-year Bromine results. Despite this pressure on earnings, we expect this business to deliver free cash flow similar to levels in 2015. We will continue to drive pricing in this business and will aggressively seek cost-reduction opportunities to address margins and profitability. 
With respect to synergies, as previously noted, projects already executed in 2015 will drive calendar year savings of $88 million in 2016 and we have additional identified products that makes us confident in achieving the $120 million in committed savings in 2016 versus 2014. The net productivity number that will flow through the P&L versus 2015 is forecasted to be an additional $40 million to $50 million in 2016. We are currently, forecasting to invest in R&D, technology and increased sales coverage in Lithium, Refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment, given the attractive opportunities we see in those businesses. 
In closing, 2015 was a year in which we delivered on our commitments and began the transformation of Albermarle. In 2016, we will continue that momentum. Our focus is clear, we will continue to drive superior performance in our industry-leading businesses and use the cash generated from those businesses to deleverage, return cash to shareholders via dividends and invest in the key growth opportunities we see before us."

Battery grade was higher than that and, look, we've always said we've got a good pricing environment, but I know we're going to get this question a lot, David, so let me just address this upfront. We are going to price lithium so that we get value today and so that we are ensuring that this market continues to grow. We are not going to price lithium in such a way that it drives the demand out of the market. It's very critical that we do this because this is the best growth business in the specialty chemical industry and we're not going to get greedy early.

And I think that's how the entire industry views it. So you will see in my comments that we are investing in R&D to drive that technological advantage to give our customers the ability to make more money, and then we'll get the price. Now as we talked about the last time we raised prices, this is a 3-year process because that's how the contracts flows. So we've got contracts that fall off this year, some later in the year, some in '17 and some in '18. So you'll see a gradual increase in those pricing as long as we're able to deliver that technical superior service that allow them to make more money."

I think if you really look at the Bromine what I would say is remember we lost that methyl bromide contract. So it was a profitable business for us, and we framed that up last year, on what the type of profitability was and we lost that. So that was a big hurdle to overcome. At then from a volume standpoint, the big volume play that we're seeing is completion fluids. And what's going to happen to completion fluids during the year, you've got about 25% of the CapEx from the E&Ps are out of the market. They've already announced those. So eventually, that's going to slide out. So those are the 2 big volumes. I think prices, we've seen -- in some pockets, you've seen price down a little bit, but overall price is holding up pretty good and we're getting some price increases across. I think how long it's going to last, whether it's the bottom of the cycle are not, really depends upon completion fluids and it's a big tail on completion fluids that we -- that you need to remember. So if they start -- oil prices pop up and they start putting deepwater rigs back out and the capital budgets come up, the completion fluids won't pop right back up for us in deepwater. You'll see a lag. So we're see -- we're on the tail right now. We were on the tail in 2016, we're still good. In 2017, I can't predict that because I don't know what oil's going to be then, but I think that our focus in Bromine will continue to be what it is in 2016. We are going to drive that business for cash to take that cash, to allow us to deleverage, to allow us to invest in other growth opportunities, and our business positioned, our cost position and our technology will allow us to do that."

So if we were to get some more incremental sales out of our La Negra plant in 2016 towards the end of the year, we can see a little bit a benefit there. There's a lot of -- there are some of our customers that are looking at their businesses today and trying to understand whether they put all turnarounds or not. So we always have, in the oil, particularly in the integrated businesses, are they going to push out of the year? Are they going to push out of the quarter? So catalyst is always, at a time like this, when all is at this rate, what's going to happen the capital and the turnaround for the integrated refinery.

So we do seem, as you've noted, there has been an increase in the Bromine price in China throughout 2015. That was driven by tightness in local supply. It's our view and also we had commissioned some external research through SunSource that corroborated our view, which is really that there's a few different pieces to it. One of them is, depending on the area, bromine production in China was suspended 3 separate times: weather-related, safety and environmental, some of that was the Tianjin explosion as well as the military parade in Beijing as well as the annual winter shutdown. So up to 25% of the market, of the capacity, was shut down in China at some point throughout 2015. But on an annualized basis, according to the research that we commissioned, it really amounted to about 10% of total production. A big driver to this and I think it's also been noted by others, is also the reduction year-over-year in imports in the end of 2015. So the inventory drawdown in China had an impact on price as well and that was up to a 30% year-over-year reduction in imports in the back half of 2015, and that has somewhat of a lag effect on pricing. It's our view that as the winter shutdown ends, end of February, beginning of March, we will start to see prices come back down. So post-winter shutdown and as imports are resuming, we also think that, that will put downward pressure on what's currently a high price for Bromine in China. That being said, we are taking the opportunity, where we can, to capture price on derivatives in China. We haven't seen much of an effect outside of China, but it is our strategy to have a position in China, and we are doing what we can currently, to capture additional price opportunity in that market."

If you look at the businesses that we have, you've got lithium that, I think, and we've been pretty open about it. We think lithium, you ought to see, high-single to double-digit growth. And our cost position in that, we'll work ourselves down the cost chain as we're able to get more efficient and bring more capacity online because we've already got the fixed cost. So if I look at catalyst, I think long-term catalyst is growth position where you're going to see it grow. A lot of it depends upon oil, but it really is tied to the demand for transportation fuel, that's what drives it. And that's generally raised in 1% to 3% a year, and that's why technology is so important in those businesses so we can outearn that. The third piece, if you look at Surface Treatment, they've grown about mid- to high single digits on a regular basis and I would expect that to continue. So when you roll all that stuff together and we get these synergies baked in and rolled through and get more efficiencies, I don't see any reason we can't get up and see nice year-over-year earnings growth in that kind of range for mid- to high single digits, which you can extrapolate that out and see what that number will be. But I think the earning power -- the other thing I would say about '11 and '12, Mike, is when you look at those numbers, remember, you've got still in '11 that false demand from a Bromine, where we're allocating Bromine on a daily basis because of the demand coming out of the 2009 recession and you've got a lot of pass-through in there related to that rare earth spike and the pass-throughs from that. So just be a little mindful of the years you pick, but I would say is from where we are today, you should see continued growth in EPS that will deliver nice shareholder return for our shareholders."

2015 was a year in which we began the transformation of Albermarle with the acquisition of Rockwood. It was a year of change, integration and most importantly, execution and performance. We laid out our goals for the year in early 2015. 
Integrated Rockwood businesses achieved $50 million of synergies, delivered adjusted EBITDA between $935 million and $1 billion, deliver adjusted free cash flow of $450 million to $550 million and divest noncore assets. We delivered on all of these objectives and raised our dividend for the 21st consecutive year. 
The Lithium and Chemetall Surface Treatment businesses we acquired exceeded our initial 2015 profitability expectations. In total, as forecasted, the company generated $959 million of adjusted EBITDA and $506 million of free cash flow before one-time items. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, Lithium, Chemetall Surface Treatment, Heavy Oil Upgrading and PCS, each grew adjusted EBITDA by greater than 10% versus 2014. 
We completed the sale of a metal sulfides business in January and of our minerals business at the beginning of February 2016. Neither of these businesses were core for us and the proceeds from those sales have already been applied against our debt, allowing us to retire roughly $330 million in debt. As a result, our net debt has been reduced to about $3.3 billion as of early February, in line with our expectations. This is an important step toward our goal of reaching our net debt-to-EBITDA target of 2.5x by the end of 2017. 
In 2015, our focused efforts on integrations and synergies allowed us to reduce costs and become more efficient without negatively impacting our businesses in any way. In total, our team achieved $60 million of synergies-related savings in 2015, 20% above our original commitment. On a full year basis, synergies achieved in 2015 will deliver savings of roughly $88 million in 2016, putting us slightly ahead of schedule and leaving only $32 million needed in additional synergies to reach our goal of $120 million in savings in 2016 as compared to 2014. We already have identified projects in place that give us confidence that we will achieve this goal. 
Finally, we strengthened our industry-leading Lithium business by reaching 3 critical milestones. First, we completed and started up our new 20,000 met ton battery-grade lithium carbonate plant in the La Negra, Chile. Second, we received a new permit, which allows us to significantly increase brine pump at the Salar de Atacama to feed our expansion plans for battery-grade lithium derivatives. Third, we announced the memorandum of understanding with CORFO, which will extend the life and increase the volume of our lithium quota in Chile. Once the definitive agreement on the quota is signed, which we expect in the next few months, we will have significantly increased our permitted annual production capacity of lithium carbonate from the Atacama brine source to more than 70,000 metric tons. 
The definitive agreement will increase both the quantity of lithium that we can extract from the Salar de Atacama and the expected lifetime of our secured reserves in Chile to 27 years from the beginning of 2017 based on about 70,000 metric tons of annual production capacity of lithium carbonate. The combination of the permit and the increased quota further cement our leadership position in lithium and better position us to meet our strategic goal to capture 50% of the incremental lithium growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

For the fourth quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $1.55 or $1.03 per share, excluding special items.

For the fourth quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $1.55 or $1.03 per share, excluding special items. For the full year, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $3 or $3.94, excluding special items. There were a number of one-time special gains and losses during the quarter and the year, including the release of a tax reserve, our normal fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustments for pensions and matters related to the Rockwood acquisition and refinancing. A full reconciliation of these items for both the quarter and the year can be found in both the earnings release and in the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
Our 2015 effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items ended 2015 at just under 25%, 2 percentage points less than prior guidance. In the fourth quarter, we took actions related to the repatriation of cash to the United States that resulted in a lower full year tax rate for book purposes. This resulted in a noncash earnings per share benefit of about $0.10 in the fourth quarter. 
Capital expenditures ended 2015 at $228 million, just over 6% of sales and in line with previous guidance. At yearend, operating working capital, including assets held for sale, was 26% of sales, unchanged from the end of the third quarter. Similarly, operating working capital in our core businesses remained at 25% of sales at the end of the year, also unchanged from the end of the third quarter. Combining all these elements, we generated free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures of $506 million in 2015, excluding one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related cost. This number is well in line with our guidance of $475 million to $525 million at the end of the third quarter as we, again, generated significant cash from our businesses in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow, including one-time cost for the full year 2015, was $155 million. At the end of the year, Albermarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by our bank covenants, was 3.8x, an improvement from our original fourth quarter projection of 3.9x. 
Finally, as we've discussed all year, unfavorable currency exchange impacts had a notable negative effect on earnings throughout 2015. For the full year, negative currency impacts related to our businesses reduced revenue by $240 million or 6% and adjusted EBITDA by $55 million, also 6% compared to 2014. 
Now let me turn to business unit performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Refining Solutions reported fourth quarter net sales of $200 million and adjusted EBITDA of $53 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. Sequentially, from the third quarter 2015, sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. Both Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC Catalysts and Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts performed in line with expectations. Results were negatively impacted by just over $5 million related to certain reserves taken in the quarter. For the full year 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Refining Solutions was down 19%, excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts. All of the decline was in Clean Fuels Technologies. 
In contrast, excluding years where rare earth surcharges had a significant impact on ourselves, Heavy Oil Upgrading profits reached a new high in 2015. Underscoring our confidence in the value that our catalyst delivered to our customers, we recently announced a 10% price increase in Heavy Oil Upgrading catalyst. 
Fourth quarter net sales in Performance Chemicals were $386 million with adjusted EBITDA of $120 million resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. Compared to fourth quarter 2014, net sales were down 1% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. For all of 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Performance Chemicals increased by 10% compared to 2014. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, adjusted EBITDA growth was an even more impressive 14%, driven by strong growth -- strong earnings growth in Lithium and PCS. 
Lithium continues to deliver strong results. Fourth quarter net sales were up almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA was up almost 15% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the fourth straight quarter of greater than 40% margins. 
Overall volume grew in the fourth quarter -- our overall volume growth, excuse me, in the fourth quarter was 14% year-on-year with pricing improving by approximately 3%. Battery-grade prices -- price increases and volume growth were again significantly above these averages. For the full year, Lithium delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of almost 19%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 42%. Adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $42 million in the fourth quarter. Results were in line with expectations from the beginning of the quarter as planned end-of-year inventory management has significant negative impact on profitability. 
For the full year, Bromine adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat on an as-reported basis and was up 5%, excluding negative currency exchange impacts with better-than-expected volumes in clear brine fluids and overall pricing improvement versus 2014. 
Finally, PCS, our polyolefin catalyst and curatives business delivered another strong quarter with both net sales and adjusted EBITDA similar to fourth quarter 2014. Fourth quarter results were above initial expectations due to stronger-than-forecasted sales, favorable raw materials and utilities costs and the impact of synergies. For the year, PCS delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 22%, driven by sales growth and product mix in our specialty single-side catalyst business and cost savings related to asset rationalization at the end of 2014. 
Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $208 million with adjusted EBITDA of $54 million resulting in margins of almost 26%. Excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts, sales on adjusted EBITDA were up 13% and 26%, respectively, compared to fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, excluding negative currency exchange impacts, growth was impressive with net sales up by almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA by 14%. Growth was most significant in automotive, aerospace, aluminum finishing and coil end markets. Regionally, North America and Asia Pacific, where we are benefiting from 100% ownership of the former Shanghai JV, led the way. Western Europe also performed well, especially Germany, Spain and Scandinavia. 
Now I'll turn to 2016. First, I'll frame the balance sheet items and foreign exchange, and then Luke will cover the business and overall company forecast. 
We currently expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items to be approximately 27% in 2016. Note that we do not expect the same rate benefits related to repatriation of cash to the United States in 2016 that we saw in 2015. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate to return to the level originally expected for most of last year. 
Our capital spending remains firmly under control and we plan to maintain 2016 spending at a level similar to 2015 of ours to $230 million to $240 million. Note that this includes growth capital required for Lithium this year as well as maintenance and continuity capital for all of our businesses. Our plan does not foresee working capital improvement, but we do expect to maintain operating working capital in our core businesses at approximately 25% of sales. However, working capital remains potential source of additional cash for us and we'll continue programs to create incremental improvement over time. 
Depreciation and amortization will be in the range of $280 million to $290 million, an increase from $260 million in 2015, driven primarily by the impact of our new battery-grade lithium carbonate plant in La Negra, Chile. Corporate costs are expected to be about $80 million in line with 2015. 
Finally, we do not expect foreign exchange to have the same negative impact on earnings as in 2015, but we do expect another $10 million to $20 million of headwind versus last year related to exchange rates versus the dollar and that impact will be reflected in the guidance Luke will provide for each of the businesses. The key driver will be the U.S. dollar to euro rate. And given the mix changes in our business since the acquisition of Rockwood, we expect every penny move of the dollar against the euro to impact EBITDA by about $1.5 million to $2.5 million on a full year basis. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke."
18671,321717215,936187,"Albemarle Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","2015 ended and 2016 has begun with continued economic uncertainty around the world. The impact of low oil prices on the global economy, worries about economic weakness in China and other emerging economies, questionable growth prospects in the U.S., Europ",873,"2015 ended and 2016 has begun with continued economic uncertainty around the world. The impact of low oil prices on the global economy, worries about economic weakness in China and other emerging economies, questionable growth prospects in the U.S., Europe and Japan and currency fluctuations all underscore this uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we still expect growth in most of our businesses in 2016. 
We expect 2016 net sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of between $900 million and $950 million and adjusted earnings per share to between $3.45 to $3.80. Recognize that the timing of a potential sale of Fine Chemistry Services create some additional uncertainty in these ranges. We currently expect the cadence of earnings to be roughly equal between the first and second half of 2016, but note that normal fluctuation in our businesses, such as a large catalyst order moving from one quarter to another, could have a significant impact on quarterly results. 
As shown on Page 16 of the earnings presentation posted on our website, excluding the impact of the $52 million noncash foreign exchange gain from the first quarter of 2015 and the operations of the 2 divested businesses from 2015 adjusted EBITDA, our forecasted 2016 adjusted EBITDA range represents an increase of 3.5% to 9% versus 2015. Overall, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be right around 28%, an increase from 26% in 2015 as we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and the performance of our core businesses. 
We were just over the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance of $475 million to $525 million, which positions us well to meet 2016 guidance that we first provided in September of last year. Specifically, we expect to generate $550 million to $650 million of free cash flow before one-time items related to the acquisition and $450 million to $550 million, including those costs, or more than triple our 2015 actual free cash flow. 
Turning to each of our businesses. We expect a double-digit percentage increase in Lithium earnings. Volume growth in battery-grade applications continues to be strong. Note that global sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles in 2015 increased by 70% compared to 2014. We also expect favorable overall pricing versus 2015 and we continue to enjoy a favorable cost position given the quality of our lithium reserves in Chile and the Talison joint venture. These factors position us to maintain strong margins that we saw in 2015. 
PCS is expected to be relatively flat. After a 22% increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2015, we expect 2016 to be a year where we consolidate and maintain this gain as opposed to seeing much additional growth in earnings. Chemetall Surface Treatment is forecasted to grow adjusted EBITDA by mid- to high-single digits on a percentage basis. The diversity of our business in various end markets and geographies combined with the strength of our technologies and our commercial team, will allow this business to continue to grow even in a more uncertain economy. 
Refining Solutions should return to earnings growth in 2016 with adjusted EBITDA expected to increase by high-single digits on a percentage basis. Although we do have some customers with planned shutdowns that will dampen results in the first half of the year, the low price of oil should continue to drive strong global gasoline demand benefiting Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts. Additional refinery turnarounds should improve Clean Fuels Technologies results, although we expect continued mix challenges in this business given the operating environment for integrated refiners. For example, certain national oil companies in South America have postponed all hydroprocessing catalysts purchasers, which were originally planned for 2016. 
In Bromine, as we have previously discussed, our methyl bromide supply agreement expired at the end of 2015 and was not replaced. The loss of this business, combined with an expected decline for clear brine fluids in offshore drilling projects throughout 2016, puts downward pressure on year-over-year Bromine results. Despite this pressure on earnings, we expect this business to deliver free cash flow similar to levels in 2015. We will continue to drive pricing in this business and will aggressively seek cost-reduction opportunities to address margins and profitability. 
With respect to synergies, as previously noted, projects already executed in 2015 will drive calendar year savings of $88 million in 2016 and we have additional identified projects that makes us confident in achieving the $120 million in committed savings in 2016 versus 2014. The net productivity number that will flow through the P&L versus 2015 is forecasted to be an additional $40 million to $50 million in 2016. We are currently, forecasting to invest in R&D, technology and increased sales coverage in Lithium, Refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment, given the attractive opportunities we see in those businesses. 
In closing, 2015 was a year in which we delivered on our commitments and began the transformation of Albermarle. In 2016, we will continue that momentum. Our focus is clear, we will continue to drive superior performance in our industry-leading businesses and use the cash generated from those businesses to deleverage, return cash to shareholders via dividends and invest in the key growth opportunities we see before us."

We are going to price lithium so that we get value today and so that we are ensuring that this market continues to grow. We are not going to price lithium in such a way that it drives the demand out of the market. It's very critical that we do this because this is the best growth business in the specialty chemical industry and we're not going to get greedy early. We're going to get the value that we need to get and we're going to price it so that we can allow this industry to continue to grow and achieve the objectives that we had when we acquired the Rockwood business."

When you deliver technology and you allow that customer to make more money, you can get a piece of that more money that they're making and drive your pricing. And I think that's how the entire industry views it. So you will see in my comments that we are investing in R&D to drive that technological advantage to give our customers the ability to make more money, and then we'll get the price. Now as we talked about the last time we raised prices, this is a 3-year process because that's how the contracts flow. So we've got contracts that fall off this year, some later in the year, some in '17 and some in '18. So you'll see a gradual increase in those pricing as long as we're able to deliver that technical superior service that allow them to make more money."

I think if you really look at the Bromine, what I would say is remember we lost that methyl bromide contract. So it was a profitable business for us, and we framed that up last year, on what the type of profitability was and we lost that. So that was a big hurdle to overcome. And then from a volume standpoint, the big volume play that we're seeing is completion fluids. And what's going to happen to completion fluids during the year, you've got about 25% of the CapEx from the E&Ps are out of the market. They've already announced those. So eventually, that's going to slide out. So those are the 2 big volumes. I think prices, we've seen -- in some pockets, you've seen price down a little bit, but overall price is holding up pretty good and we're getting some price increases across. I think how long it's going to last, whether it's the bottom of the cycle or not, really depends upon completion fluids and it's a big tail on completion fluids that we -- that you need to remember. So if they start -- oil prices pop up and they start putting deepwater rigs back out and the capital budgets come up, the completion fluids won't pop right back up for us in deepwater. You'll see a lag. So we're see -- we're on the tail right now. We were on the tail in 2016, where it was still good. In 2017, I can't predict that because I don't know what oil's going to be then, but I think that our focus in Bromine will continue to be what it is in 2016. We are going to drive that business for cash to take that cash, to allow us to deleverage, to allow us to invest in other growth opportunities, and our business position, our cost position and our technology will allow us to do that."

There's a lot of -- there are some of our customers that are looking at their businesses today and trying to understand whether they put off turnarounds or not.

So catalyst is always, at a time like this, when all is at this rate, what's going to happen the capital and the turnaround for the integrated refinery.

If we have a 3-year contract to supply an FCC Catalyst to a unit, the catalyst that we're supplying at the end of that 3-year period can be very different than a catalyst we're supplying at the beginning because our people are in there with that unit on a daily basis making sure they're understanding the change in this crude slate, the change in the operating rates, the change in the pressure drop, all of those things and tweaking and changing that FCC Catalyst so that we're getting them the best performance they could have so they can make more money.

So we do seem -- as you've noted, there has been an increase in the Bromine price in China throughout 2015. That was driven by tightness in local supply. It's our view and also we had commissioned some external research through SunSource that corroborated our view, which is really that there's a few different pieces to it. One of them is, depending on the area, bromine production in China was suspended 3 separate times: weather-related, safety and environmental, some of that was the Tianjin explosion as well as the military parade in Beijing as well as the annual winter shutdown. So up to 25% of the market, of the capacity, was shut down in China at some point throughout 2015. But on an annualized basis, according to the research that we commissioned, it really amounted to about 10% of total production. A big driver to this and I think it's also been noted by others, is also the reduction year-over-year in imports in the end of 2015. So the inventory drawdown in China had an impact on price as well and that was up to a 30% year-over-year reduction in imports in the back half of 2015, and that has somewhat of a lag effect on pricing. It's our view that as the winter shutdown ends, end of February, beginning of March, we will start to see prices come back down. So post-winter shutdown and as imports are resuming, we also think that, that will put downward pressure on what's currently a high price for Bromine in China. That being said, we are taking the opportunity, where we can, to capture price on derivatives in China. We haven't seen much of an effect outside of China, but it is our strategy to have a position in China, and we are doing what we can currently, to capture additional price opportunity in that market."

If you look at the businesses that we have, you've got lithium that, I think, and we've been pretty open about it. We think lithium, you ought to see high-single to double-digit growth. And our cost position in that, we'll work ourselves down the cost chain as we're able to get more efficient and bring more capacity online because we've already got the fixed cost. So if I look at catalyst, I think, long-term, catalyst is a growth position where you're going to see it grow. A lot of it depends upon oil, but it really is tied to the demand for transportation fuels, that's what drives it. And that's generally raising 1% to 3% a year, and that's why technology is so important in those businesses so we can outearn that. The third piece, if you look at Surface Treatment, they've grown about mid- to high single digits on a regular basis and I would expect that to continue. So when you roll all that stuff together and we get these synergies baked in and rolled through and get more efficiencies, I don't see any reason we can't get up and see nice year-over-year earnings growth in that kind of range for mid- to high single digits, which you can extrapolate that out and see what that number will be. But I think the earning power -- the other thing I would say about '11 and '12, Mike, is when you look at those numbers, remember, you've got still in '11 that false demand from a Bromine, where we were allocating Bromine on a daily basis because of the demand coming out of the 2009 recession and you've got a lot of pass-through in there related to that rare earth spike and the pass-throughs from that.

2015 was a year in which we began the transformation of Albermarle with the acquisition of Rockwood. It was a year of change, integration and most importantly, execution and performance. We laid out our goals for the year in early 2015. 
Integrated Rockwood businesses achieved $50 million of synergies, delivered adjusted EBITDA between $935 million and $1 billion, deliver adjusted free cash flow of $450 million to $550 million and divest noncore assets. We delivered on all of these objectives and raised our dividend for the 21st consecutive year. 
The Lithium and Chemetall Surface Treatment businesses we acquired exceeded our initial 2015 profitability expectations. In total, as forecasted, the company generated $959 million of adjusted EBITDA and $506 million of free cash flow before one-time items. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, Lithium, Chemetall Surface Treatment, Heavy Oil Upgrading and PCS, each grew adjusted EBITDA by greater than 10% versus 2014. 
We completed the sale of a metal sulfides business in January and of our minerals business at the beginning of February 2016. Neither of these businesses were core for us and the proceeds from those sales have already been applied against our debt, allowing us to retire roughly $330 million in debt. As a result, our net debt has been reduced to about $3.3 billion as of early February, in line with our expectations. This is an important step toward our goal of reaching our net debt-to-EBITDA target of 2.5x by the end of 2017. 
In 2015, our focused efforts on integrations and synergies allowed us to reduce costs and become more efficient without negatively impacting our businesses in any way. In total, our team achieved $60 million of synergies-related savings in 2015, 20% above our original commitment. On a full year basis, synergies achieved in 2015 will deliver savings of roughly $88 million in 2016, putting us slightly ahead of schedule and leaving only $32 million needed in additional synergies to reach our goal of $120 million in savings in 2016 as compared to 2014. We already have identified projects in place that give us confidence that we will achieve this goal. 
Finally, we strengthened our industry-leading Lithium business by reaching 3 critical milestones. First, we completed and started up our new 20,000 met ton battery-grade lithium carbonate plant in the La Negra, Chile. Second, we received a new permit, which allows us to significantly increase brine pump at the Salar de Atacama to feed our expansion plans for battery-grade lithium derivatives. Third, we announced the memorandum of understanding with CORFO, which will extend the life and increase the volume of our lithium quota in Chile. Once the definitive agreement on the quota is signed, which we expect in the next few months, we will have significantly increased our permitted annual production capacity of lithium carbonate from the Atacama brine source to more than 70,000 metric tons. 
The definitive agreement will increase both the quantity of lithium that we can extract from the Salar de Atacama and the expected lifetime of our secured reserves in Chile to 27 years from the beginning of 2017 based on about 70,000 metric tons of annual production capacity of lithium carbonate. The combination of the permit and the increased quota further cement our leadership position in lithium and better position us to meet our strategic goal to capture 50% of the incremental lithium growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

For the fourth quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $1.55 or $1.03 per share, excluding special items. For the full year, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $3 or $3.94, excluding special items. There wer",1382,"Thanks, Luke. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $1.55 or $1.03 per share, excluding special items. For the full year, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $3 or $3.94, excluding special items. There were a number of one-time special gains and losses during the quarter and the year, including the release of a tax reserve, our normal fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustments for pensions and matters related to the Rockwood acquisition and refinancing. A full reconciliation of these items for both the quarter and the year can be found in both the earnings release and in the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
Our 2015 effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items ended 2015 at just under 25%, 2 percentage points less than prior guidance. In the fourth quarter, we took actions related to the repatriation of cash to the United States that resulted in a lower full year tax rate for book purposes. This resulted in a noncash earnings per share benefit of about $0.10 in the fourth quarter. 
Capital expenditures ended 2015 at $228 million, just over 6% of sales and in line with previous guidance. At yearend, operating working capital, including assets held for sale, was 26% of sales, unchanged from the end of the third quarter. Similarly, operating working capital in our core businesses remained at 25% of sales at the end of the year, also unchanged from the end of the third quarter. Combining all these elements, we generated free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures of $506 million in 2015, excluding one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related cost. This number is well in line with our guidance of $475 million to $525 million at the end of the third quarter as we, again, generated significant cash from our businesses in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow, including one-time cost for the full year 2015, was $155 million. At the end of the year, Albermarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by our bank covenants, was 3.8x, an improvement from our original fourth quarter projection of 3.9x. 
Finally, as we've discussed all year, unfavorable currency exchange impacts had a notable negative effect on earnings throughout 2015. For the full year, negative currency impacts related to our businesses reduced revenue by $240 million or 6% and adjusted EBITDA by $55 million, also 6% compared to 2014. 
Now let me turn to business unit performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Refining Solutions reported fourth quarter net sales of $200 million and adjusted EBITDA of $53 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. Sequentially, from the third quarter 2015, sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. Both Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC Catalysts and Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts performed in line with expectations. Results were negatively impacted by just over $5 million related to certain reserves taken in the quarter. For the full year 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Refining Solutions was down 19%, excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts. All of the decline was in Clean Fuels Technologies. 
In contrast, excluding years where rare earth surcharges had a significant impact on ourselves, Heavy Oil Upgrading profits reached a new high in 2015. Underscoring our confidence in the value that our catalyst delivered to our customers, we recently announced a 10% price increase in Heavy Oil Upgrading catalyst. 
Fourth quarter net sales in Performance Chemicals were $386 million with adjusted EBITDA of $120 million resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. Compared to fourth quarter 2014, net sales were down 1% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. For all of 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Performance Chemicals increased by 10% compared to 2014. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, adjusted EBITDA growth was an even more impressive 14%, driven by strong growth -- strong earnings growth in Lithium and PCS. 
Lithium continues to deliver strong results. Fourth quarter net sales were up almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA was up almost 15% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the fourth straight quarter of greater than 40% margins. 
Overall volume grew in the fourth quarter -- our overall volume growth, excuse me, in the fourth quarter was 14% year-on-year with pricing improving by approximately 3%. Battery-grade prices -- price increases and volume growth were again significantly above these averages. For the full year, Lithium delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of almost 19%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 42%. Adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $42 million in the fourth quarter. Results were in line with expectations from the beginning of the quarter as planned end-of-year inventory management has significant negative impact on profitability. 
For the full year, Bromine adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat on an as-reported basis and was up 5%, excluding negative currency exchange impacts with better-than-expected volumes in clear brine fluids and overall pricing improvement versus 2014. 
Finally, PCS, our polyolefin catalyst and curatives business delivered another strong quarter with both net sales and adjusted EBITDA similar to fourth quarter 2014. Fourth quarter results were above initial expectations due to stronger-than-forecasted sales, favorable raw materials and utilities costs and the impact of synergies. For the year, PCS delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 22%, driven by sales growth and product mix in our specialty single-side catalyst business and cost savings related to asset rationalization at the end of 2014. 
Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $208 million with adjusted EBITDA of $54 million resulting in margins of almost 26%. Excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts, sales on adjusted EBITDA were up 13% and 26%, respectively, compared to fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, excluding negative currency exchange impacts, growth was impressive with net sales up by almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA by 14%. Growth was most significant in automotive, aerospace, aluminum finishing and coil end markets. Regionally, North America and Asia Pacific, where we are benefiting from 100% ownership of the former Shanghai JV, led the way. Western Europe also performed well, especially Germany, Spain and Scandinavia. 
Now I'll turn to 2016. First, I'll frame the balance sheet items and foreign exchange, and then Luke will cover the business and overall company forecast. 
We currently expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items to be approximately 27% in 2016. Note that we do not expect the same rate benefits related to repatriation of cash to the United States in 2016 that we saw in 2015. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate to return to the level originally expected for most of last year. 
Our capital spending remains firmly under control and we plan to maintain 2016 spending at a level similar to 2015 of ours to $230 million to $240 million. Note that this includes growth capital required for Lithium this year as well as maintenance and continuity capital for all of our businesses. Our plan does not foresee working capital improvement, but we do expect to maintain operating working capital in our core businesses at approximately 25% of sales. However, working capital remains potential source of additional cash for us and we'll continue programs to create incremental improvement over time. 
Depreciation and amortization will be in the range of $280 million to $290 million, an increase from $260 million in 2015, driven primarily by the impact of our new battery-grade lithium carbonate plant in La Negra, Chile. Corporate costs are expected to be about $80 million in line with 2015. 
Finally, we do not expect foreign exchange to have the same negative impact on earnings as in 2015, but we do expect another $10 million to $20 million of headwind versus last year related to exchange rates versus the dollar and that impact will be reflected in the guidance Luke will provide for each of the businesses. The key driver will be the U.S. dollar to euro rate. And given the mix changes in our business since the acquisition of Rockwood, we expect every penny move of the dollar against the euro to impact EBITDA by about $1.5 million to $2.5 million on a full year basis. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke."
18671,321717215,936598,"Albemarle Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","2015 ended and 2016 has begun with continued economic uncertainty around the world. The impact of low oil prices on the global economy, worries about economic weakness in China and other emerging economies, questionable growth prospects in the U.S., Europ",873,"2015 ended and 2016 has begun with continued economic uncertainty around the world. The impact of low oil prices on the global economy, worries about economic weakness in China and other emerging economies, questionable growth prospects in the U.S., Europe and Japan and currency fluctuations all underscore this uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we still expect growth in most of our businesses in 2016. 
We expect 2016 net sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of between $900 million and $950 million and adjusted earnings per share to between $3.45 to $3.80. Recognize that the timing of a potential sale of Fine Chemistry Services create some additional uncertainty in these ranges. We currently expect the cadence of earnings to be roughly equal between the first and second half of 2016, but note that normal fluctuation in our businesses, such as a large catalyst order moving from one quarter to another, could have a significant impact on quarterly results. 
As shown on Page 16 of the earnings presentation posted on our website, excluding the impact of the $52 million noncash foreign exchange gain from the first quarter of 2015 and the operations of the 2 divested businesses from 2015 adjusted EBITDA, our forecasted 2016 adjusted EBITDA range represents an increase of 3.5% to 9% versus 2015. Overall, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be right around 28%, an increase from 26% in 2015 as we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and the performance of our core businesses. 
We were just over the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance of $475 million to $525 million, which positions us well to meet 2016 guidance that we first provided in September of last year. Specifically, we expect to generate $550 million to $650 million of free cash flow before one-time items related to the acquisition and $450 million to $550 million, including those costs, or more than triple our 2015 actual free cash flow. 
Turning to each of our businesses. We expect a double-digit percentage increase in Lithium earnings. Volume growth in battery-grade applications continues to be strong. Note that global sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles in 2015 increased by 70% compared to 2014. We also expect favorable overall pricing versus 2015 and we continue to enjoy a favorable cost position given the quality of our lithium reserves in Chile and the Talison joint venture. These factors position us to maintain strong margins that we saw in 2015. 
PCS is expected to be relatively flat. After a 22% increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2015, we expect 2016 to be a year where we consolidate and maintain this gain as opposed to seeing much additional growth in earnings. Chemetall Surface Treatment is forecasted to grow adjusted EBITDA by mid- to high-single digits on a percentage basis. The diversity of our business in various end markets and geographies combined with the strength of our technologies and our commercial team, will allow this business to continue to grow even in a more uncertain economy. 
Refining Solutions should return to earnings growth in 2016 with adjusted EBITDA expected to increase by high-single digits on a percentage basis. Although we do have some customers with planned shutdowns that will dampen results in the first half of the year, the low price of oil should continue to drive strong global gasoline demand benefiting Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts. Additional refinery turnarounds should improve Clean Fuels Technologies results, although we expect continued mix challenges in this business given the operating environment for integrated refiners. For example, certain national oil companies in South America have postponed all hydroprocessing catalysts purchasers, which were originally planned for 2016. 
In Bromine, as we have previously discussed, our methyl bromide supply agreement expired at the end of 2015 and was not replaced. The loss of this business, combined with an expected decline for clear brine fluids in offshore drilling projects throughout 2016, puts downward pressure on year-over-year Bromine results. Despite this pressure on earnings, we expect this business to deliver free cash flow similar to levels in 2015. We will continue to drive pricing in this business and will aggressively seek cost-reduction opportunities to address margins and profitability. 
With respect to synergies, as previously noted, projects already executed in 2015 will drive calendar year savings of $88 million in 2016 and we have additional identified projects that makes us confident in achieving the $120 million in committed savings in 2016 versus 2014. The net productivity number that will flow through the P&L versus 2015 is forecasted to be an additional $40 million to $50 million in 2016. We are currently, forecasting to invest in R&D, technology and increased sales coverage in Lithium, Refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment, given the attractive opportunities we see in those businesses. 
In closing, 2015 was a year in which we delivered on our commitments and began the transformation of Albermarle. In 2016, we will continue that momentum. Our focus is clear, we will continue to drive superior performance in our industry-leading businesses and use the cash generated from those businesses to deleverage, return cash to shareholders via dividends and invest in the key growth opportunities we see before us."

We are going to price lithium so that we get value today and so that we are ensuring that this market continues to grow. We are not going to price lithium in such a way that it drives the demand out of the market. It's very critical that we do this because this is the best growth business in the specialty chemical industry and we're not going to get greedy early. We're going to get the value that we need to get and we're going to price it so that we can allow this industry to continue to grow and achieve the objectives that we had when we acquired the Rockwood business."

When you deliver technology and you allow that customer to make more money, you can get a piece of that more money that they're making and drive your pricing. And I think that's how the entire industry views it. So you will see in my comments that we are investing in R&D to drive that technological advantage to give our customers the ability to make more money, and then we'll get the price. Now as we talked about the last time we raised prices, this is a 3-year process because that's how the contracts flow. So we've got contracts that fall off this year, some later in the year, some in '17 and some in '18. So you'll see a gradual increase in those pricing as long as we're able to deliver that technical superior service that allow them to make more money."

I think if you really look at the Bromine, what I would say is remember we lost that methyl bromide contract. So it was a profitable business for us, and we framed that up last year, on what the type of profitability was and we lost that. So that was a big hurdle to overcome. And then from a volume standpoint, the big volume play that we're seeing is completion fluids. And what's going to happen to completion fluids during the year, you've got about 25% of the CapEx from the E&Ps are out of the market. They've already announced those. So eventually, that's going to slide out. So those are the 2 big volumes. I think prices, we've seen -- in some pockets, you've seen price down a little bit, but overall price is holding up pretty good and we're getting some price increases across. I think how long it's going to last, whether it's the bottom of the cycle or not, really depends upon completion fluids and it's a big tail on completion fluids that we -- that you need to remember. So if they start -- oil prices pop up and they start putting deepwater rigs back out and the capital budgets come up, the completion fluids won't pop right back up for us in deepwater. You'll see a lag. So we're see -- we're on the tail right now. We were on the tail in 2016, where it was still good. In 2017, I can't predict that because I don't know what oil's going to be then, but I think that our focus in Bromine will continue to be what it is in 2016. We are going to drive that business for cash to take that cash, to allow us to deleverage, to allow us to invest in other growth opportunities, and our business position, our cost position and our technology will allow us to do that."

And when market conditions allow, we'll look for price in that market."

So if we were to get some more incremental sales out of our La Negra plant in 2016 towards the end of the year, we can see a little bit a benefit there. There's a lot of -- there are some of our customers that are looking at their businesses today and trying to understand whether they put off turnarounds or not.

So catalyst is always, at a time like this, when all is at this rate, what's going to happen the capital and the turnaround for the integrated refinery.

If we have a 3-year contract to supply an FCC Catalyst to a unit, the catalyst that we're supplying at the end of that 3-year period can be very different than a catalyst we're supplying at the beginning because our people are in there with that unit on a daily basis making sure they're understanding the change in this crude slate, the change in the operating rates, the change in the pressure drop, all of those things and tweaking and changing that FCC Catalyst so that we're getting them the best performance they could have so they can make more money.

So we do seem -- as you've noted, there has been an increase in the Bromine price in China throughout 2015. That was driven by tightness in local supply. It's our view and also we had commissioned some external research through SunSource that corroborated our view, which is really that there's a few different pieces to it. One of them is, depending on the area, bromine production in China was suspended 3 separate times: weather-related, safety and environmental, some of that was the Tianjin explosion as well as the military parade in Beijing as well as the annual winter shutdown. So up to 25% of the market, of the capacity, was shut down in China at some point throughout 2015. But on an annualized basis, according to the research that we commissioned, it really amounted to about 10% of total production. A big driver to this and I think it's also been noted by others, is also the reduction year-over-year in imports in the end of 2015. So the inventory drawdown in China had an impact on price as well and that was up to a 30% year-over-year reduction in imports in the back half of 2015, and that has somewhat of a lag effect on pricing. It's our view that as the winter shutdown ends, end of February, beginning of March, we will start to see prices come back down. So post-winter shutdown and as imports are resuming, we also think that, that will put downward pressure on what's currently a high price for Bromine in China. That being said, we are taking the opportunity, where we can, to capture price on derivatives in China. We haven't seen much of an effect outside of China, but it is our strategy to have a position in China, and we are doing what we can currently, to capture additional price opportunity in that market."

If you look at the businesses that we have, you've got lithium that, I think, and we've been pretty open about it. We think lithium, you ought to see high-single to double-digit growth. And our cost position in that, we'll work ourselves down the cost chain as we're able to get more efficient and bring more capacity online because we've already got the fixed cost. So if I look at catalyst, I think, long-term, catalyst is a growth position where you're going to see it grow. A lot of it depends upon oil, but it really is tied to the demand for transportation fuels, that's what drives it. And that's generally raising 1% to 3% a year, and that's why technology is so important in those businesses so we can outearn that. The third piece, if you look at Surface Treatment, they've grown about mid- to high single digits on a regular basis and I would expect that to continue. So when you roll all that stuff together and we get these synergies baked in and rolled through and get more efficiencies, I don't see any reason we can't get up and see nice year-over-year earnings growth in that kind of range for mid- to high single digits, which you can extrapolate that out and see what that number will be. But I think the earning power -- the other thing I would say about '11 and '12, Mike, is when you look at those numbers, remember, you've got still in '11 that false demand from a Bromine, where we were allocating Bromine on a daily basis because of the demand coming out of the 2009 recession and you've got a lot of pass-through in there related to that rare earth spike and the pass-throughs from that. So just be a little mindful of the years you pick, but I would say is from where we are today, you should see continued growth in EPS that will deliver nice shareholder return for our shareholders."

I'm very pleased with our start to the year as we open 2016 with a great first quarter for each of our businesses. Excluding adjusted EBITDA from divested businesses and year-over-year currency exchange impacts, revenue grew by $58 million or almost 7% and adjusted EBITDA grew by almost $44 million or 22% compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by increases of 31% in Refining Solutions, 26% in Lithium, 16% and Bromine and 14% in Chemetall Surface Treatment. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 28%. 
Our 4 core businesses delivered combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 32%, up from 29% in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, actual free cash flow in the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
Profit improvement was driven by volume growth, price gains and lower cost across most of our businesses. These results highlight the strength of our businesses and the quality of our employees. In January, we reached the 1 year anniversary of the Rockwood acquisition, and we are now truly one company with a focused, performance-driven organization. 
Before I turn the call over to Scott to discuss P&L and business unit highlights, let me update you on 2 strategic projects. First, our synergy projects continue to add to our bottom line results. As of the end of the first quarter, we have achieved synergies that will deliver $105 million in cost savings versus 2014, putting us well within reach of our goal of $120 million. We are working a number of identified projects that should allow us to easily meet our target with our supply chain initiatives making significant contributions. 
Second, as we discussed in the fourth quarter call, we successfully divested 2 noncore businesses, minerals and metal sulfides, in early 2016. This left us with only 1 business, Fine Chemistry Services, of the 3 targeted for sale in early 2015. We ran a structured auction process for this business, but the offers received in negotiations with potential purchasers, sales to result in a value proposition that met our expectations. As such, we believe it's in the best interest of our shareholders to keep Fine Chemistry Services and to run it as a standalone business. 
First quarter 2016 results of this business showed slight improvement over 2015, and keeping the business will not impact our ability to deleverage in any meaningful way. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Scott."

For the first quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $2.02 or $1.12 per share, excluding special items.

For the first quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $2.02 or $1.12 per share, excluding special items. The major special items were the gains of $1.02 related to the sales of minerals and metal sulfides businesses. A full reconciliation of all special items in the quarter can be found in both the earnings release and in the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
Before going into the details, I want to put our EPS performance into perspective. Our first quarter 2015 adjusted EPS was $1.17. This included $0.36 from the onetime non-cash foreign exchange gain and a net $0.03 from the 2 divested businesses. Excluding these items from 2015, yields of first quarter 2015 pro forma EPS of $0.78. So on a like-for-like basis, the EPS of $1.12 from this year is up 44. [ph] Most of the growth, $0.28 per share was driven by core business performance. We have small benefits from corporate STS performance, lower interest costs, lower D&A and tax rates and a higher -- and a headwind of $0.04 per share from a higher average share count. A detailed walk can be found on Page 8 of the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
In the first quarter, we saw changes in business mix by country, particularly a great quarter by our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture. That led to a lower-than-expected company-wide effective tax rate. As such, we now expect our 2016 tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items to be about 22% to 23%. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is now forecasted at $260 million to $270 million for the year, lower than originally expected. Final revisions to purchase price accounting related to the Rockwood acquisition and a slight change to the depreciation schedule for the new La Negra battery grade lithium carbonate plant are driving the lower forecast. 
First quarter capital expenditures were right in line with expectations, and we continue to expect and forecast capital expenditures in 2016 of between $230 million and $240 million. 
Operating working capital, including the Fine Chemistry Services business, was 27% of sales at the end of the first quarter, up slightly from the end of 2015, but fully in line with expectations, and we expect operating working capital to range between 26% and 27% for the year. 
In the first quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, were $160 million. This excludes one-time synergy acquisition and tax-related cost and is right in line with our full year expectations of $550 million to $650 million. All-in reported free cash flow, including those onetime cost, was $119 million, also in line with our full year expectations of $450 million to $550 million. 
Note that we made a final cash tax payments of $20 million related to the repatriation of cash from overseas in the first quarter as cost related to the Rockwood integration continue to wind down. 
At the end of the quarter, Albermarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by our bank covenants, was 3.5x down from 3.8x at year-end 2015. This improvement reflects both the strong first quarter performance in both adjusted EBITDA and then free cash flow, and allowed us to retire the $300 million 1-year term loan following the completion of the 2 business divestitures in early 2016. 
Finally, negative currency exchange impacts were not as significant as in 2015 continue to affect our results. In the first quarter of this year, these impacts reduced net sales by $23 million and adjusted EBITDA by about $4 million versus first quarter 2015, very much in line with our guidance of $10 million to $20 million of adjusted EBITDA impact for the full year. 
Now let me get to the details from our business units. But before we get into the numbers, remember that we are reporting in our organizational structure that became effective on January 1. We are now aligned under 4 global business units, refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment are unchanged. The prior Performance Chemicals GBU is now aligned into 2 GBUs: Bromine Specialties, which encompasses all of our bromine-related businesses; and Lithium and Advanced Materials, which includes both lithium and PCS, our polyolefin catalyst and curatives businesses. 
Let's start with the Lithium and Advance Materials. First quarter net sales were $260 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $87 million resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%. Compared to first quarter 2015, net sales were up 9% and adjusted EBITDA was up 11%. The lithium portfolio continues to deliver out [indiscernible] sales were up 19% and adjusted EBITDA up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins were 47%, the fifth quarter in a row with margins greater than 40%. Overall volume grew in the first quarter by 17% and pricing improved by approximately 5%. 
Battery grade products, as expected, drove the increases and it helped to overcome headwinds related to lower potash volumes and pricing. Remember that potash is a by-product of our lithium production in Chile. 
We have previously discussed our intent to move our customers for lithium carbonate and hydroxides to multiyear. While initial reception was mixed, we are pleased with our progress to date. More than 60% of our lithium carbonate and hydroxides business is now covered by multiyear agreements, and we expect that percentage to continue to increase in the coming months. 
We see this as a win-win. Our customers benefit from improved security of supply, and we increased volume certainty and create additional opportunities to adjust price based on market conditions, which will support our capital investments in this business. 
PCS performed in line with expectations. Net sales were down 6% and adjusted EBITDA was down 16% compared to the first quarter of 2015. But note that last year's first quarter benefited from the timing of customer demand for key catalyst component. While most of the PCS business continues to meet our expectations, the rest of the year may be challenged due to the bankruptcy filing of Sun Edison, our customer in this segment that is also has manufacturing facilities located at our Pasadena plant site and purchases services there from Albermarle. While the bankruptcy is in the very early stages, Sun Edison's issues could impact PCS adjusted EBITDA by as much as $10 million this year. 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $62 million, up 16% year-on-year, with net sales up just under 4 [ph] and adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. The improvements were driven by better-than-expected clear completion fluids demand, particularly in the Middle East. Timing of some flame retardant orders and favorable cause as a result of our synergy projects and lower raw material prices. 
While we do not expect to see this level of performance for the rest of the year, we were pleased with the first quarter performance across the Bromine portfolio. 
Refining Solutions reported first quarter net sales of $171 million and adjusted EBITDA of $55 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. Year-over-year, sales were down 5%, but adjusted EBITDA was up 30%. Both clean fuels technologies or HPC Catalysts and heavy oil upgrading or FCC Catalysts performed in line with expectations. Heavy oil upgrading volumes, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were all up as expected compared to the first quarter 2015, which was negatively impacted by an elevated number of customer trials. Though the operating environment continues to be a challenge for clean fuels technologies, the business delivered a solid quarter with improved EBITDA, driven by a better product mix and lower variable cost. 
Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales in the first quarter of 2016 were $208 million with adjusted EBITDA of $53 million, resulting in margins of 25%. Net sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The business remains on track to expectations and is seeing a especially good growth in automotive and coil applications. 
Regionally, Asia Pacific and Western Europe continue to lead the growth, with the year-over-year growth in China and India, particularly noteworthy, which bodes well for the future growth potential of this business. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Luke to update our view for the rest of 2016."

As I said, I'm very pleased with our start to 2016 with all of our businesses delivering adjusted EBITDA growth of double digits on a percentage basis versus the first quarter of 2015. 
In the second quarter, we expect Lithium, Chemetall Surface Treatment and Refining Solutions to again show growth versus the second quarter 2015. Bromine faces the tough comp  versus the second quarter 2015 due to the loss of a methyl bromide contract that contributed roughly $15 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2015. PCS will likely struggle to overcome the impact of the Sun Edison bankruptcy that Scott discussed. 
Overall, however, our businesses are outperforming our initial 2016 expectations, and are more than overcoming significant headwinds like Sun Edison and lower potash volume and pricing. Given that, we now expect 2016 net sales of between $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, up from $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion at the beginning of the year. 
We are also raising our adjusting EBITDA guidance to between $920 million and $970 million. Adjusted EPS should be between $3.90 to $4.25, up from $3.45 and $3.80 at the beginning of the year.

And frankly, we just need to execute on converting these great EBITDA margins into cash, and will be well placed. So I think we're in great shape, and you'll continue to see us delever."

Bromine much more mature business, and it requires it to be run differently. So we're going to run bromine and not for growth, but they're going to maximize the cash that we get out of that business to fund lithium. And I'll think it takes 2 different focus is to run those businesses. One is all about growth and delivering this great opportunities we have. The other is ensuring our cost structure is where it needs to be, maintaining what we have, ensuring that we are a solid supplier, achieve growth where possible, but run it for cash. It requires 2 different focuses, and to us, it made the most sense to do that. In addition, whenever we were speaking with investors after the transaction, we were going around, that was a clarity from our major investors that they wanted to seek transparency on how bromine was doing but mainly how lithium was performing versus what we said and what we thought it was going to do. So we thought that given the 2 different focuses of the leadership teams, as well as request for the clear transparency from the investors, this made the most sense to operate in that regard, Dmitry."

So that's led to somewhat of a supply shortage. What we saw last year in the beginning of the this year was really lower imports, imports are resuming to back up the 2014 levels. And now we think it's local production. In our Q1, our estimate has been that roughly 30% of the capacity was in China was utilized for elemental bromine, but we see a run rate of increased production which perhaps a double in later in Q2.

I'm very pleased with our start to the year as we open 2016 with a great first quarter for each of our businesses. Excluding adjusted EBITDA from divested businesses and year-over-year currency exchange impacts, revenue grew by $58 million or almost 7% and adjusted EBITDA grew by almost $44 million or 22% compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by increases of 31% in Refining Solutions, 26% in Lithium, 16% and Bromine and 14% in Chemetall Surface Treatment. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 28%. Our 4 core businesses delivered combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 32%, up from 29% in the first quarter of 2015. Additional -- additionally, excuse me, actual free cash flow in the quarter was in line with our expectations. 
Profit improvement was driven by volume growth, price gains and lower cost across most of our businesses. These results highlight the strength of our businesses and the quality of our employees. In January, we reached the 1 year anniversary of the Rockwood acquisition and we are now truly one company with a focused, performance-driven organization. 
Before I turn the call over to Scott to discuss P&L and business unit highlights, let me update you on 2 strategic projects. First, our synergy projects continue to add to our bottom line results. As of the end of the first quarter, we have achieved synergies that will deliver $105 million in cost savings versus 2014, putting us well within reach of our goal of $120 million. We are working a number of identified projects that should allow us to easily meet our target with our supply chain initiatives making significant contributions. 
Second, as we discussed in the fourth quarter call, we successfully divested 2 noncore businesses, minerals and metal sulfides, in early 2016. This left us with only one business, Fine Chemistry Services, of the 3 targeted for sale in early 2015. We ran a structured auction process for this business, but the offers received in negotiations with potential purchasers, sales to result in a value proposition that met our expectations. 
As such, we believe this is in the best interest of our shareholders to keep Fine Chemistry Services and to run it as a standalone business. First quarter 2016 results of this business showed slight improvement over 2015, and keeping the business will not impact our ability to deleverage in any meaningful way. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Scott."
18671,330368150,981493,"Albemarle Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 11, 2016",2016-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Luke. For the first quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $2.02 or $1.12 per share, excluding special items. The major special items were the gains of $1.02 related to the sales of the minerals and metal sulfides businesses. A",1395,"Thanks, Luke. For the first quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $2.02 or $1.12 per share, excluding special items. The major special items were the gains of $1.02 related to the sales of the minerals and metal sulfides businesses. A full reconciliation of all special items in the quarter can be found in both the earnings release and in the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
Before going into the details, I want to put our EPS performance into perspective. Our first quarter 2015 adjusted EPS was $1.17. This included $0.36 from the onetime noncash foreign exchange gain and a net $0.03 from the 2 divested businesses. Excluding these items from 2015, yields of first quarter 2015 pro forma EPS of $0.78. So on a like-for-like basis, the EPS of $1.12 from this year is up 44% from 2015 pro forma. 
Most of the growth, $0.28 per share, was driven by core business performance. We have small benefits from corporate FCS performance, lower interest costs, lower D&A and tax rates and a higher -- and a headwind of $0.04 per share from a higher average share count. A detailed walk can be found on Page 8 of the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
In the first quarter, we saw changes in business mix by country, particularly a great quarter by our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture. That led to a lower-than-expected company-wide effective tax rate. As such, we now expect our 2016 tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items to be about 22% to 23%. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is now forecasted at $260 million to $270 million for the year, lower than originally expected. Final revisions to purchase price accounting related to the Rockwood acquisition and a slight change to the depreciation schedule for the new La Negra battery grade lithium carbonate plant are driving the lower forecast. 
First quarter capital expenditures were right in line with expectations and we continue to expect and forecast capital expenditures in 2016 of between $230 million and $240 million. Operating working capital, including the Fine Chemistry Services business, was 27% of sales at the end of the first quarter, up slightly from the end of 2015 but fully in line with expectations, and we expect operating working capital to range between 26% and 27% for the year. 
In the first quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures were $160 million. This excludes onetime synergy acquisition and tax-related cost and is right in line with our full year expectations of $550 million to $650 million. All-in reported free cash flow, including those onetime costs, was $119 million also in line with our full year expectations of $450 million to $550 million. 
Note that we made a final cash tax payment of $20 million related to the repatriation of cash from overseas in the first quarter as cost related to the Rockwood integration continue to wind down. 
At the end of the quarter, Albermarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by our bank covenants, was 3.5x down from 3.8x at year-end 2015. This improvement reflects both a strong first quarter performance in both adjusted EBITDA and then free cash flow, and allowed us to retire the $300 million 1 year term loan following the completion of the 2 business divestitures in early 2016. 
Finally, negative currency exchange impacts, while not as significant as in 2015, continue to affect our results. In the first quarter of this year, these impacts reduced net sales by $23 million and adjusted EBITDA by about $4 million versus first quarter 2015, very much in line with our guidance of $10 million to $20 million of adjusted EBITDA impact for the full year. 
Now let me get to the details from our business units. But before we get into the numbers, remember that we are reporting in our organizational structure that became effective on January 1. We are now aligned under 4 global business units, refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment are unchanged. The prior Performance Chemicals GBU is now aligned into 2 GBUs: Bromine Specialties, which encompasses all of our bromine-related businesses; and Lithium & Advanced Materials, which includes both lithium and PCS, our polyolefin catalyst and curatives businesses. 
Let's start with Lithium & Advanced Materials. First quarter net sales were $260 million with adjusted EBITDA of $87 million resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%. Compared to first quarter 2015, net sales were up 9% and adjusted EBITDA was up 11%. The Lithium portfolio continues to deliver outstanding results. First quarter net sales were up 19% and adjusted EBITDA up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 47%, the fifth quarter in a row with margins greater than 40%. Overall volume grew in the first quarter by 17% and pricing improved by approximately 5%. 
Battery grade products, as expected, drove the increases and it helped to overcome headwinds related to lower potash volumes and pricing. Remember that potash is a by-product of our lithium production in Chile. 
We have previously discussed our intent to move our customers for lithium carbonate and hydroxides to multiyear contracts. While the initial reception was mixed, we are pleased with our progress to date. More than 60% of our lithium carbonate and hydroxide business is now covered by multiyear agreements, and we expect that percentage to continue to increase in the coming months. 
We see this as a win-win. Our customers benefit from improved security of supply, and we increased volume certainty and create additional opportunities to adjust price based on market conditions, which will support our capital investments in this business. 
PCS performed in line with expectations. Net sales were down 6% and adjusted EBITDA was down 16% compared to the first quarter of 2015. But note that last year's first quarter benefited from the timing of customer demand for key catalyst component. 
While most of the PCS business continues to meet our expectations, the rest of the year may be challenged due to the bankruptcy filing of Sun Edison, a customer in this segment that is -- also has manufacturing facilities located at our Pasadena plant site and purchases services there from Albermarle. While the bankruptcy is in the very early stages, Sun Edison's issues could impact PCS adjusted EBITDA by as much as $10 million this year. 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $62 million, up 16% year-on-year with net sales up just under 4% to $197 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. The improvements were driven by better-than-expected clear completion fluids demand, particularly in the Middle East, timing of some flame retardant orders and favorable cause as a result of our synergy projects and lower raw material prices. While we do not expect to see this level of performance for the rest of the year, we were pleased with the first quarter performance across the Bromine portfolio. 
Refining Solutions reported first quarter net sales of $171 million and adjusted EBITDA of $55 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. Year-over-year, sales were down 5%, but adjusted EBITDA was up 30%. Both Clean Fuels Technologies, or HPC Catalysts, and Heavy Oil Upgrading, or FCC Catalysts, performed in line with expectations. Heavy Oil Upgrading volumes revenue and adjusted EBITDA were all up as expected compared to the first quarter 2015, which was negatively impacted by an elevated number of customer trials. Though the operating environment continues to be a challenge for Clean Fuels Technologies, the business delivered a solid quarter with improved EBITDA, driven by a better product mix and lower variable cost. 
Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales in the first quarter of 2016 were $208 million with adjusted EBITDA of $53 million, resulting in margins of 25%. Net sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The business remains on track to expectations and is seeing a especially good growth in automotive and coil applications. Regionally, Asia Pacific and Western Europe continue to lead the growth, with the year-over-year growth in China and India, particularly noteworthy, which bodes well for the future growth potential of this business. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Luke to update our view for the rest of 2016."

As I said, I'm very pleased with our start to 2016 with all of our businesses delivering adjusted EBITDA growth of double digits on a percentage basis versus the first quarter of 2015. 
In the second quarter, we expect Lithium, Chemetall Surface Treatment and Refining Solutions to again show growth versus the second quarter 2015. Bromine faces a tough comp against the second quarter 2015 due to the loss of a methyl bromide contract that contributed roughly $15 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2015. PCS will likely struggle to overcome the impact of the Sun Edison bankruptcy that Scott discussed. 
Overall, however, our businesses are outperforming our initial 2016 expectations and are more than overcoming significant headwinds like Sun Edison and lower potash volume and pricing. Given that, we now expect 2016 net sales of between $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, up from $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion at the beginning of the year. We are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $920 million and $970 million. Adjusted EPS should be between $3.90 to $4.25, up from $3.45 and $3.80 at the beginning of the year. 
We told you in early 2016 that we expected to build on the momentum that we have developed across our businesses in 2016. In the first quarter, we did just that and had every expectation that we will continue to do so for the remainder of 2016."

So far, we're seeing a relatively flattish outlook for BFRs into electronics. There's some things going up and some things going down. As you mentioned, server demand is up. We're expecting, at least from what we've seen in published reports, that to be up 8% in total server demand year-over-year. But offsetting some of that is a low single-digit decline in PCs and TVs year-over-year. So on the balance, it's relatively flat. When we do look at some of the other indicators of, for example, Bishop & Associates puts out a global connector confidence index, that's had about 76 right now and anything north of 50 tends to be a positive sign for electronics.

So I don't see another large acquisition in our future -- in our near future, in the next 12 to 18 months, I would assume. We've got our plate full executing on what we are doing. And then if you fast forward out then, we're going to look at the kind of acquisition if we do want at that time, where we would build on the growth that we've got, build on the great technology positions that we would have.

As mentioned, bromine prices have stayed higher longer than I think we would have expected coming out of last year and into this year. On the supply side, there's a few things that have affected pricing on elemental bromine. Most recently, in February, there were storm tides in the Northern coastal regions that damaged pipelines and other infrastructure, and that slowed start-up of several units, several operations in China. So that's led to somewhat of a supply shortage. What we saw last year and into the beginning of this year was really lower imports. Imports have resumed back up the 2014 levels and now we think it's local production. And in Q1, our estimate has been that roughly 30% of the capacity within China was utilized for elemental bromine, but we see a run rate of increased production which would perhaps a double in -- later in Q2. So we think on that supply side, it will certainly loosen up. On the demand side, there were lower inventories of tetrabrom that led to increased demand for bromine. So on the balance, it looks favorable. For us, personally, the bromine business in China, the elemental bromine business is not a significant piece of our business.

I'm very pleased with our start to the year as we open 2016 with a great first quarter for each of our businesses. Excluding adjusted EBITDA from divested businesses and year-over-year currency exchange impacts, revenue grew by $58 million o",413,"Thanks, Matt. I'm very pleased with our start to the year as we open 2016 with a great first quarter for each of our businesses. Excluding adjusted EBITDA from divested businesses and year-over-year currency exchange impacts, revenue grew by $58 million or almost 7% and adjusted EBITDA grew by almost $44 million or 22% compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by increases of 31% in Refining Solutions, 26% in Lithium, 16% and Bromine and 14% in Chemetall Surface Treatment. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 28%. Our 4 core businesses delivered combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 32%, up from 29% in the first quarter of 2015. Additional -- additionally, excuse me, actual free cash flow in the quarter was in line with our expectations.  Profit improvement was driven by volume growth, price gains and lower cost across most of our businesses. These results highlight the strength of our businesses and the quality of our employees. In January, we reached the 1 year anniversary of the Rockwood acquisition and we are now truly one company with a focused, performance-driven organization. 
Before I turn the call over to Scott to discuss P&L and business unit highlights, let me update you on 2 strategic projects. First, our synergy projects continue to add to our bottom line results. As of the end of the first quarter, we have achieved synergies that will deliver $105 million in cost savings versus 2014, putting us well within reach of our goal of $120 million. We are working a number of identified projects that should allow us to easily meet our target with our supply chain initiatives making significant contributions. 
Second, as we discussed in the fourth quarter call, we successfully divested 2 noncore businesses, minerals and metal sulfides, in early 2016. This left us with only one business, Fine Chemistry Services, of the 3 targeted for sale in early 2015. We ran a structured auction process for this business, but the offers received in negotiations with potential purchasers failed to result in a value proposition that met our expectations. As such, we believe it is in the best interest of our shareholders to keep Fine Chemistry Services and to run it as a standalone business. First quarter 2016 results of this business showed slight improvement over 2015, and keeping the business will not impact our ability to deleverage in any meaningful way. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Scott."
18671,330368150,981740,"Albemarle Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 11, 2016",2016-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Luke. For the first quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $2.02 or $1.12 per share, excluding special items. The major special items were the gains of $1.02 related to the sales of the minerals and metal sulfides businesses. A",1394,"Thanks, Luke. For the first quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $2.02 or $1.12 per share, excluding special items. The major special items were the gains of $1.02 related to the sales of the minerals and metal sulfides businesses. A full reconciliation of all special items in the quarter can be found in both the earnings release and in the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
Before going into the details, I want to put our EPS performance into perspective. Our first quarter 2015 adjusted EPS was $1.17. This included $0.36 from the onetime noncash foreign exchange gain and a net $0.03 from the 2 divested businesses. Excluding these items from 2015, yields of first quarter 2015 pro forma EPS of $0.78. So on a like-for-like basis, the EPS of $1.12 from this year is up 44% from 2015 pro forma.  Most of the growth, $0.28 per share, was driven by core business performance. We had small benefits from corporate FCS performance, lower interest costs, lower D&A and tax rates and a higher -- and a headwind of $0.04 per share from a higher average share count. A detailed walk can be found on Page 8 of the earnings presentation posted on our website. 
In the first quarter, we saw changes in business mix by country, particularly a great quarter by our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture. That led to a lower-than-expected company-wide effective tax rate. As such, we now expect our 2016 tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items to be about 22% to 23%. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is now forecasted at $260 million to $270 million for the year, lower than originally expected. Final revisions to purchase price accounting related to the Rockwood acquisition and a slight change to the depreciation schedule for the new La Negra battery grade lithium carbonate plant are driving the lower forecast. 
First quarter capital expenditures were right in line with expectations and we continue to expect and forecast capital expenditures in 2016 of between $230 million and $240 million. Operating working capital, including the Fine Chemistry Services business, was 27% of sales at the end of the first quarter, up slightly from the end of 2015 but fully in line with expectations, and we expect operating working capital to range between 26% and 27% for the year. 
In the first quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures was $160 million. This excludes onetime synergy acquisition and tax-related cost and is right in line with our full year expectations of $550 million to $650 million. All-in reported free cash flow, including those onetime costs, was $119 million also in line with our full year expectations of $450 million to $550 million. Note that we made a final cash tax payment of $20 million related to the repatriation of cash from overseas in the first quarter as cost related to the Rockwood integration continue to wind down. 
At the end of the quarter, Albemarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by our bank covenants, was 3.5x, down from 3.8x at year-end 2015. This improvement reflects both a strong first quarter performance in both adjusted EBITDA and then free cash flow, and allowed us to retire the $300 million 1 year term loan following the completion of the 2 business divestitures in early 2016. Finally, negative currency exchange impacts, while not as significant as in 2015, continue to affect our results. In the first quarter this year, these impacts reduced net sales by $23 million and adjusted EBITDA by about $4 million versus first quarter 2015, very much in line with our guidance of $10 million to $20 million of adjusted EBITDA impact for the full year. 
Now let me get to the details from our business units. But before we get into the numbers, remember that we are reporting in our organizational structure that became effective on January 1. We are now aligned under 4 global business units, refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment are unchanged. The prior Performance Chemicals GBU is now aligned into 2 GBUs: Bromine Specialties, which encompasses all of our bromine-related businesses; and Lithium & Advanced Materials, which includes both lithium and PCS, our polyolefin catalyst and curatives businesses. 
Let's start with Lithium & Advanced Materials. First quarter net sales were $216 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $87 million resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%. Compared to first quarter 2015, net sales were up 9% and adjusted EBITDA was up 11%. The Lithium portfolio continues to deliver outstanding results. First quarter net sales were up 19% and adjusted EBITDA up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 47%, the fifth quarter in a row with margins greater than 40%. Overall volume grew in the first quarter by 17% and pricing improved by approximately 5%.  Battery grade products, as expected, drove the increases and it helped to overcome headwinds related to lower potash volumes and pricing. Remember that potash is a byproduct of our lithium production in Chile. 
We have previously discussed our intent to move our customers for lithium carbonate and hydroxides to multiyear contracts. While the initial reception was mixed, we are pleased with our progress to date. More than 60% of our lithium carbonate and hydroxide business is now covered by multiyear agreements, and we expect that percentage to continue to increase in the coming months. We see this as a win-win. Our customers benefit from improved security of supply, and we increased volume certainty and create additional opportunities to adjust price based on market conditions, which will support our capital investments in this business. 
PCS performed in line with expectations. Net sales were down 6% and adjusted EBITDA was down 16% compared to the first quarter of 2015. But note that last year's first quarter benefited from the timing of customer demand for a key catalyst component. While most of the PCS business continues to meet our expectations, the rest of the year may be challenged due to the bankruptcy filing of Sun Edison, a customer in this segment that is -- also has manufacturing facilities located at our Pasadena plant site and purchases services there from Albemarle. While the bankruptcy is in the very early stages, Sun Edison's issues could impact PCS adjusted EBITDA by as much as $10 million this year. 
First quarter adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $62 million, up 16% year-on-year with net sales up just under 4% to $197 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. The improvements were driven by better-than-expected clear completion fluids demand, particularly in the Middle East, timing of some flame retardant orders and favorable cost as a result of our synergy projects and lower raw material prices. While we do not expect to see this level of performance for the rest of the year, we were pleased with the first quarter performance across the Bromine portfolio. 
Refining Solutions reported first quarter net sales of $171 million and adjusted EBITDA of $55 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. Year-over-year, sales were down 5%, but adjusted EBITDA was up 30%. Both Clean Fuels Technologies, or HPC Catalysts, and Heavy Oil Upgrading, or FCC Catalysts, performed in line with expectations. Heavy Oil Upgrading volumes, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were all up as expected compared to the first quarter 2015, which was negatively impacted by an elevated number of customer trials. Though the operating environment continues to be a challenge for Clean Fuels Technologies, the business delivered a solid quarter with improved EBITDA, driven by a better product mix and lower variable costs. 
Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales in the first quarter of 2016 were $208 million with adjusted EBITDA of $53 million, resulting in margins of 25%. Net sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The business remains on track to expectations and is seeing especially good growth in automotive and coil applications. Regionally, Asia Pacific and Western Europe continue to lead the growth, with the year-over-year growth in China and India, particularly noteworthy, which bodes well for the future growth potential of this business. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Luke to update our view for the rest of 2016."

As I've said, I'm very pleased with our start to 2016 with all of our businesses delivering adjusted EBITDA growth of double digits on a percentage basis versus the first quarter of 2015. 
In the second quarter, we expect Lithium, Chemetall Surface Treatment and Refining Solutions to again show growth versus the second quarter 2015. Bromine faces a tough comp against the second quarter 2015 due to the loss of a methyl bromide contract that contributed roughly $15 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2015. PCS will likely struggle to overcome the impact of the Sun Edison bankruptcy that Scott discussed. 
Overall, however, our businesses are outperforming our initial 2016 expectations and are more than overcoming significant headwinds like Sun Edison and lower potash volume and pricing. Given that, we now expect 2016 net sales of between $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, up from $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion at the beginning of the year. We are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $920 million and $970 million. Adjusted EPS should be between $3.90 to $4.25, up from $3.45 and $3.80 at the beginning of the year. 
We told you in early 2016 that we expected to build on the momentum that we have developed across our businesses in 2016. In the first quarter, we did just that and have every expectation that we will continue to do so for the remainder of 2016."

Plus we've got headwinds that we've got from Sun Edison that we've got in there as well as lower potash pricing and volume. So the view that you ought to have is increase in our guidance for the year is not only a buildup of a pass-through of our first quarter beat, but in addition to that, overcoming some of the headwinds, but it's very, very -- it's a minimal amount in there for the custom services. And Scott, for currency that will be -- can you take that, please?"

The other one is ensuring our cost structure is where it needs to be, maintaining what we have, ensuring that we are a solid supplier, achieve growth where possible, but run it for cash. It requires 2 different focuses. And to us, it made the most sense to do that.

So on your question on end-market demand for bromine, the largest market for us is brominated flame retardants and the largest piece of that is going into electronics. So far, we're seeing a relatively flattish outlook for BFRs into electronics. There's some things going up and some things going down. As you mentioned, server demand is up. We're expecting, at least from what we've seen in published reports, that to be up 8% in total server demand year-over-year. But offsetting some of that is a low single-digit decline in PCs and TVs year-over-year. So on the balance, it's relatively flat. When we do look at some of the other indicators of, for example, Bishop & Associates puts out a global connector confidence index, that's had about 76 right now and anything north of 50 tends to be a positive sign for electronics. So we're cautiously optimistic. But so far, the indications we get from our customers looks relatively flat to slightly positive."

We've got to capture those synergies that we talked about. We've got a lot of focus on getting more efficient as a company, and we'll do that. We need to pay down our debt. We made a commitment that we're going to deleverage, and we need to do that. That will take us probably through the end of 2017, early '18, that kind of range, to pay off the deleverage. And we need to follow through on the capital plans for lithium and the growth. So I don't see another large acquisition in our near future, in the next 12 to 18 months, I would assume. We've got our plate full executing on what we are doing. And then if you fast forward out then, we're going to look at the kind of acquisition if we do want at that time, where we would build on the growth that we've got, build on the great technology positions that we would have. But it's really premature to talk about that now because the focus is all about finishing this integration, executing against the strategy we have, both with our businesses and the corporation and deleveraging and cleaning up our balance sheet.

That will impact the royalties from the carbonate and hydroxide produced out of Chile, not the rest of the world. It won't have any impact on spodumene. So it will see some downward pressure on margins because of royalty, that should be able to be offset because of the additional volume will be running through, as well as price increases. So to model something now into 2020 and try to extrapolate what the margins are out of Chile versus the margins out of spodumene versus the model out of specialties, you're quite frankly just slicing it too thin.

We haven't seen that with low oil prices or high oil prices. It's been a consistent growth for Lithium. And last year, FCC had a record year. So when you talk about -- you'd have to see a titanic shift to electric vehicles to 50%-plus kind of range to really see a huge negative impact on our Catalysts business. Particularly as we see the slate around the world, the crude slate getting heavier and getting more sour. So that'll require more catalyst even to process the same amount of crude, if it's heavier, if it's more sour. So we love both of the businesses.

As mentioned, bromine prices have stayed higher longer than I think we would have expected coming out of last year and into this year. On the supply side, there's a few things that have affected pricing on elemental bromine. Most recently, in February, there were storm tides in the Northern coastal regions that damaged pipelines and other infrastructure, and that slowed start-up of several units, several operations in China. So that's led to somewhat of a supply shortage. What we saw last year and into the beginning of this year was really lower imports. Imports have resumed back up the 2014 levels and now we think it's local production. And in Q1, our estimate has been that roughly 30% of the capacity within China was utilized for elemental bromine, but we see a run rate of increased production which would perhaps a double that in -- later in Q2. So we think on the supply side, it will certainly loosen up. On the demand side, there were lower inventories of tetrabrom that led to increased demand for bromine. So on the balance, it looks favorable. For us, personally, the bromine business in China, the elemental bromine business is not a significant piece of our business. But where we can, we are taking advantage of the increased pricing in China to capture additional margin for Albemarle."

In addition, with the execution of a definitive agreement to sell the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF, U.S. GAAP requires that we report the business as a discontinued operation. As such, all of our comments today, unless specifically noted, refer to our continuing operations and exclude the impact of Chemetall Surface Treatment. However, given the timing of reporting Surface Treatment as a discontinued operation, we have provided bridges in our earnings deck to better explain the impact of this change. These can be found on Pages 4, 7 and 16 of the deck, which is posted on the website. 
In addition, Page 8 and the appendix of the earnings deck provide details of our reported earnings, along with non-GAAP reconciliations related to discontinued operations and other special items in the quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke."

In the second quarter of 2016, we again delivered outstanding results in our core businesses and made significant progress against our strategic objectives. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in Lithium and by 28% in R",334,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter of 2016, we again delivered outstanding results in our core businesses and made significant progress against our strategic objectives. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in Lithium and by 28% in Refining Solutions compared to the second quarter of 2015. For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of the minerals and metal sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $19 million or 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted earnings per share by $0.25 or 37%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 28%, with our 3 reported segments delivering combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%, up from 33% in the second quarter of 2015.
The second quarter was also highlighted by the signing of a definitive agreement to divest the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF for $3.2 billion over 15x trailing 12 months EBITDA. Combining the expected proceeds from this sale with those already received for the divestiture of metal sulfides implies that we purchased the Lithium business at a pretax multiple of about 10x 2014 EBITDA. The closing of this sale, which we expect before the end of 2016, will marks another major step in our transformation into a company focused on our high-growth lithium and catalyst franchises. 
Also in the quarter, we became a component of the S&P 500 and received the 2016 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award from the EPA in recognition of the development of the AlkyClean process technology and the AlkyStar [ph] catalyst used in conjunction with that technology. This is the world's first solid acids alkylation technology and was successfully commercialized in 2015. AlkyClean is a potential game-changing technology and another demonstration of the innovation we bring to our customers. 
Our businesses and our employees continue to deliver strong results despite a weak and uncertain macro environment, a testimony to the quality of both our businesses and our people. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott."
18671,372189178,1024761,"Albemarle Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, including Chemetall Surface Treatment, but excluding special items. On a continuing operations basis, we reported adjusted earnings per s",1071,"Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, including Chemetall Surface Treatment, but excluding special items. 
On a continuing operations basis, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.93, an increase of 36% compared to second quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested minerals and metal sulfides businesses. The increase was driven by strong core business growth, a lower effective tax rate and lower corporate and interest costs. 
Before I turn to other financial metrics, let me remind you again that all of these will be discussed on a continuing operations basis unless noted. 
In the second quarter, business mix by country and continued strength in our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture again drove a favorable effective tax rate. As such, we now expect our 2016 effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items, to be about 19%. 
D&A for 2016 is now forecasted at $185 million to $200 million, with 2016 capital expenditures, excluding Chemetall, expected to be in roughly the same range. 
Operating working capital crept up to about 29% of sales at the end of the second quarter. Very strong sales in bromine and lithium in the second half of the quarter drove an increase in accounts receivables and a corresponding increase in working capital. However, we expect to reduce operating working capital to between 27% and 28% by the end of the year. 
In the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow, including contributions from discontinued operations, was $237 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, but excludes onetime synergy acquisition and tax-related costs. Free cash flow, including those one-time costs, was $163 million through June, up significantly from 2015. 
The impact of foreign exchange on our businesses continued to decline in the second quarter to the point that the overall year-over-year impact was essentially negligible, with a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of less than 1% in the quarter. 
Before I turn to our core business unit performance, note that our Fine Chemistry Services business remains a challenge. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA in that business was several million dollars below expectations at the beginning of the quarter. In addition, Fine Chemistry Services is facing challenges due to the difficult environment for customers in the ag industry and the need to rebuild relationships and business with a customer base after the extended sales process. As a result, our forecast for full year adjusted EBITDA in 2016 has now been reduced by about $15 million since April. 
Moving on to our core businesses. Let's start with Lithium and Advanced materials. Second quarter net sales were $233 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $83 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, net sales were up 10% and adjusted EBITDA was up over 3%. 
The lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. Second quarter net sales were up 24% and adjusted EBITDA up 20% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the sixth quarter in a row with margins greater than 40%. Overall volume grew in the quarter by 19%, and pricing improved by approximately 3%. All of the growth and most of the pricing improvement were in battery-grade applications, where we achieved double-digit price increases compared to second quarter 2015. Margins were in line with our expectations as we continued to ramp up lower margin tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide to meet demand growth. Lower year-over-year potash pricing continues to be a headwind for this business of about $7 million of full year adjusted EBITDA.
From an operations standpoint, the startup and customer qualifications of our new La Negra lithium carbonate plant in Chile are progressing as planned, and we continue to see good perception from our customers on the shift to long-term contracts. 
We were also pleased to announce the initiation of a collaborative effort between Albemarle and SQM to safeguard the ecosystem of the Salar de Atacama and to ensure the sustainable extraction of brine over the long term. 
TCS experienced headwinds during the second quarter from both polyolefins catalysts and curatives. Net sales were down just over $10 million, and adjusted EBITDA was down almost $8 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Lower curatives volumes and pricing due to increased product availability from competitors and the impact from the Sun Edison bankruptcy were the primary drivers.
PCS adjusted EBITDA could be negatively impacted by as much as $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015, a worsening of $5 million from our expectations at the time of the first quarter call.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $67 million, down 3% year-on-year, with net sales down almost 8% to $207 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 32%. Better-than-expected clear completion fluids demand in the Middle East, timing of certain large volume flame retardant orders, favorable costs and a better-than-expected pricing environment for some of our bromine derivatives helped the business overcome most of our $15 million year-on-year adjusted EBITDA headwind due to the loss of a large methyl bromide customer in 2015. 
While we do not expect to see a repeat of the strong first half performance in the second half of 2016, we now expect the business to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance of $223 million. 
Refining Solutions reported second quarter net sales of $178 million and adjusted EBITDA of $62 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was up 28%. Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts continued to perform at a high level, with volume, revenue and adjusted EBITDA all up as expected compared to second quarter 2015. Heavy Oil Upgrading also benefited from a more favorable product mix and lower variable costs compared to second quarter 2015.
Clean fuels technologies or HPC Catalysts results also continued to improve as expected, with improved adjusted EBITDA driven by volume, a more favorable product mix and lower variable costs. Overall, Refining Solutions expectations for 2016 remained fully in line with our view at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Luke to update our view of the year."
18671,372189178,1024761,"Albemarle Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Just as in the first quarter, lithium, Refining Solutions and Bromine Specialties exceeded our high expectations in the second quarter and helped us to overcome weakness in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS. For the first half of the year, we",567,"Thanks, Scott. Just as in the first quarter, lithium, Refining Solutions and Bromine Specialties exceeded our high expectations in the second quarter and helped us to overcome weakness in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS. For the first half of the year, we have exceeded our initial 2016 expectations in all 3 of these core businesses. In the third quarter, we expect lithium and Refining Solutions to again show solid growth compared to the third quarter of 2015. While our full year outlook for bromine has improved due to the strong first half performance, we do expect to see both sequential and year-over-year weakness in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Strong first half clear brine fluid demand outside the U.S. is not expected to continue, and certain large volume flame retardant sales in the first half aren't likely to be repeated in the second half of the year. 
Finally, the issues that Scott noted in the Fine Chemistry Services and PCS lead to an adjusted EBITDA headwinds of about $15 million compared to our guidance in the first quarter earnings call. 
Even with those headwinds, the overall balance for the year continues to improve, and we are increasing our guidance for the year. On a continuing operations basis, our updated full year 2016 net sales expectations are now $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $705 million and $750 million and adjusted EPS to between $3.35 and $3.60 per share, driven by the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast and the impact of a lower effective tax rate. 
As a reminder, given the changes to guidance resulting from the move of Chemetall Surface Treatment to discontinued operations, we have provided a bridge to prior guidance on Page 16 of the earnings deck posted to our website. 
Albemarle's power to generate free cash flow will remain strong even with the sale of Chemetall Surface Treatment. We estimate that Albemarle's free cash flow in 2016, excluding one-time items and the expected free cash generated by Chemetall, will range from $400 million to $500 million. 
We expect to close the Chemetall Surface Treatment sales before the end of 2016. Our priorities for the use of the proceeds from that sale are the same as those we have consistently communicated since we acquired Rockwood in early 2015. First, we expect to deleverage to a gross debt-to-EBITDA range of around 2.5x. Second, we will leave some cash on the balance sheet to accelerate growth in our core businesses. In the near term, investments will likely be focused on high-growth battery applications in our lithium business. Third, we will work to return cash to shareholders through some combination of dividend increases and stock repurchases. While you should not expect us to completely finalize plans until sometime after the sale closes, rest assured that we intend to put this cash to work in ways that will generate the highest shareholder returns over time.
In closing, I am very pleased with our overall execution in the first half of this year. Our core businesses exceeded expectations, and we entered into a contract to sell our Chemetall Surface Treatment business at an attractive valuation. Once the sale closes, we will have a very strong balance sheet and are set up nicely to continue strong performance in the rest of 2016 and to accelerate the execution of our longer-term strategy."

We would look from a standpoint of anything that would accelerate our already stated goals. Those goals are to capture 50% of the growth in the lithium market over the next 5 to 10 years. So you can look at -- that will require additional resources that we will need to bring online, to be exploited in the 2022 kind of timeframe. We'll have to find those assets, acquire them. We've got teams around the road looking at them and talking with people about options because not only do we need to satisfy the demand today, but we've got to decide -- meet it into the next decade. And that will require additional resources, as we've stated. So we would look at that. As a part of that, you can expect us to look for high-quality rock reserves as well as high-quality brine reserves. We have, today, the low-cost position in brine, the low-cost position in rock. We have geographic diversity. We got a diversity of our portfolio of our end products. And we believe that gives us a tremendous competitive advantage, and you will see us take steps to enhance that advantage that we believe we already have. With regard to Kings Mountain, that is the original, I believe, rock mine in North America. Still best of everything that I've seen today. The data would show it's probably the second or third most concentrated rock reserve in the world. And we are in the process of analyzing the costs to bring that back online if it was necessitated. But what it would be, would be a simple mathematical equation for us. What's the cost of bringing it online versus what our other options are around the world and does it give us a competitive advantage or not, and we will pick the one that is the highest.

I think it's -- as I look across it, what I would say is that I think lithium has got -- has kind of a double-digit growth for the next -- if you look now through the rest of this decade and as long as we get the additional resources, continuing. So",467,"Yes. I think it's -- as I look across it, what I would say is that I think lithium has got -- has kind of a double-digit growth for the next -- if you look now through the rest of this decade and as long as we get the additional resources, continuing. So I see continued strength in lithium, at least double-digit growth year-over-year for the next 4, 5 years. And that's about as far as I can see, right? So -- and that could be accelerated based on energy storage, based on EVs and other items. But I don't see any change coming on that. On Refining Solutions, demand for transportation fuels is going to drive that, and that's usually going to grow somewhere around 2% to 3% to 4%. And I think we'll grow a little bit better than that because of our capabilities in the complex tough-to-crack crude slate. I feel great about our ability to have year-over-year growth there. It will, I think, moderate from what we've seen this year. Remember, this year was about a bounce-back year. Wouldn't expect to see the type of growth well into the future, but I think that the strength of our innovation and catalyst will allow us to continue to grow that low to mid-single digits. And dependent upon how our incumbencies are in Clean Fuels, we can pop about that from quarter-to-quarter. I think there's still continued growth in that catalyst business. Bromine, as I've said before, this year, the bromines outperformed my expectations. We said they were going to be down. I still think they're going to be down this year year-over-year. But they've got a fighting chance to get close here to what they did in 2015. That business, we're not counting on it for growth, but if we get a little bit of growth from bromine over the years, certainly, the free cash flow generation from that is going to accelerate our ability to drive more of our profits in the lithium. So I think you'll see that. I think the free cash flow will continue very strong. We'll have some capital that we need to invest in lithium, obviously. But even with that, I expect our maintenance capital, if you will, to probably be around 4% across our base. And we're going to have growth capital in lithium that will take us up higher than that. So continuation of the free cash flow story here, and I think good solid growth and growth opportunities between lithium, leading the way, followed by Refining Solutions and then counting on bromine to remain flat. It may go up 1 year, a little bit down 1 year a little bit. But overall, I feel great about the ability of these portfolio to drive shareholder value."

For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of the minerals and metal sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $19 million or 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted earnings per share by $0.25 or 37%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 28%, with our 3 reported segments delivering combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%, up from 33% in the second quarter of 2015.
The second quarter was also highlighted by the signing of a definitive agreement to divest the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF for $3.2 billion over 15x trailing 12-month EBITDA. Combining the expected proceeds from this sale with those already received for the divestiture of metal sulfides implies that we purchased the Lithium business at a pretax multiple of about 10x 2014 EBITDA. The closing of this sale, which we expect before the end of 2016, will mark another major step in our transformation into a company focused on our high-growth lithium and catalyst franchises.
Also, in the quarter, we became a component of the S&P 500 and received the 2016 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge award from the EPA in recognition of the development of the AlkyClean process technology and the AlkyStar catalyst used in conjunction with that technology. This is the world's first solid acid alkylation technology and was successfully commercialized in 2015. AlkyClean is a potential game-changing technology and another demonstration of the innovation we bring to our customers.
Our businesses and our employees continue to deliver strong results despite a weak and uncertain macro environment, a testimony to the quality of both our businesses and our people.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, including Chemetall Surface Treatment but excluding special items.On a continuing operations basis, we reported adjusted earnings per sha",1072,"Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, including Chemetall Surface Treatment but excluding special items.
On a continuing operations basis, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.93, an increase of 36% compared to second quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested minerals and metal sulfides businesses. The increase was driven by strong core business growth, a lower effective tax rate and lower corporate and interest costs.
Before I turn to other financial metrics, let me remind you again that all of these will be discussed on a continuing operations basis, unless noted.
In the second quarter, business mix by country and continued strength in our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture again drove a favorable effective tax rate. As such, we now expect our 2016 effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items, to be about 19%.
D&A for 2016 is now forecasted at $185 million to $200 million, with 2016 capital expenditures excluding Chemetall expected to be in, roughly, the same range.
Operating working capital crept up to about 29% of sales at the end of the second quarter. Very strong sales in Bromine and Lithium in the second half of the quarter drove an increase in accounts receivables and a corresponding increase in working capital. However, we expect to reduce operating working capital to between 27% and 28% by the end of the year.
In the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow, including contributions from discontinued operations, was $237 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, but excludes onetime synergy acquisition and tax-related costs. Free cash flow, including those onetime costs, was $163 million through June, up significantly from 2015.
The impact of foreign exchange on our businesses continued to decline in the second quarter to the point that the overall year-over-year impact was essentially negligible, with a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of less than 1% in the quarter. 
Before I turn to our core business unit performance, note that our Fine Chemistry Services business remains a challenge. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA in that business was several million dollars below expectations at the beginning of the quarter. In addition, Fine Chemistry Services is facing challenges due to the difficult environment for customers in the ag industry and the need to rebuild relationships and business with a customer base after the extended sales process. As a result, our forecast for full year adjusted EBITDA in 2016 has now been reduced by about $15 million since April.
Moving on to our core businesses. Let's start with Lithium & Advanced Materials. Second quarter net sales were $233 million with adjusted EBITDA of $83 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, net sales were up 10% and adjusted EBITDA was up over 3%.
The Lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. Second quarter net sales were up 24% and adjusted EBITDA up 20% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the sixth quarter in a row with margins greater than 40%. Overall volume grew in the quarter by 19% and pricing improved by approximately 3%. All of the growth and most of the pricing improvement were in battery-grade applications, where we achieved double-digit price increases compared to second quarter of 2015. Margins were in line with our expectations as we continue to ramp up lower-margin tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide to meet demand growth. Lower year-over-year potash pricing continues to be a headwind for this business of about $7 million of full year adjusted EBITDA.
From an operations standpoint, the start-up and customer qualifications of our new La Negra lithium carbonate plant in Chile are progressing as planned, and we continue to see good reception from our customers on the shift to long-term contracts.
We were also pleased to announce the initiation of a collaborative effort between Albemarle and SQM to safeguard the ecosystem of the Salar de Atacama and to ensure the sustainable extraction of brine over the long term.
PCS experienced headwinds during the second quarter from both polyolefin catalysts and curatives. Net sales were down just over $10 million and adjusted EBITDA was down almost $8 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Lower curatives volumes and pricing due to increased product availability from competitors and the impact from the Sun Edison bankruptcy were the primary drivers.
PCS adjusted EBITDA could be negatively impacted by as much as $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015, a worsening of $5 million from our expectations at the time of the first quarter call.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $67 million, down 3% year-on-year, with net sales down almost 8% to 2,000 -- $207 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 32%. Better-than-expected clear completion fluids demand in the Middle East, timing of certain large-volume flame retardant orders, favorable costs and a better-than-expected pricing environment for some of our bromine derivatives helped the business overcome most of our $15 million year-on-year adjusted EBITDA headwind due to the loss of a large methyl bromide customer in 2015.
While we do not expect to see a repeat of the strong first half performance in the second half of 2016, we now expect the business to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance of $223 million.
Refining Solutions reported second quarter net sales of $178 million and adjusted EBITDA of $62 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was up 28%. Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts continued to perform at a high level, with volume, revenue and adjusted EBITDA all up as expected compared to second quarter 2015. Heavy Oil Upgrading also benefited from a more favorable product mix and lower variable costs compared to second quarter 2015.
Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalysts results also continued to improve as expected, with improved adjusted EBITDA driven by volume, a more favorable product mix and lower variable costs. Overall, Refining Solutions expectations for 2016 remained fully in line with our view at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Luke to update our view of the year."
18671,372189178,1025118,"Albemarle Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Just as in the first quarter, Lithium, Refining Solutions and Bromine Specialties exceeded our high expectations in the second quarter and helped us to overcome weakness in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS. For the first half of the year, we",565,"Thanks, Scott. Just as in the first quarter, Lithium, Refining Solutions and Bromine Specialties exceeded our high expectations in the second quarter and helped us to overcome weakness in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS. For the first half of the year, we have exceeded our initial 2016 expectations in all 3 of these core businesses. In the third quarter, we expect Lithium and Refining Solutions to again show solid growth compared to the third quarter of 2015. While our full year outlook for Bromine has improved due to the strong first half performance, we do expect to see both sequential and year-over-year weakness in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Strong first half clear brine fluid demand outside the U.S. is not expected to continue, and certain large-volume flame retardant sales in the first half aren't likely to be repeated in the second half of the year.
Finally, the issues that Scott noted in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS lead to an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $15 million compared to our guidance in the first quarter earnings call.
Even with those headwinds, the overall balance for the year continues to improve, and we are increasing our guidance for the year. On a continuing operations basis, our updated full year 2016 net sales expectations are now $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $705 million and $750 million and adjusted EPS to between $3.35 and $3.60 per share, driven by the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast and the impact of a lower effective tax rate.
As a reminder, given the changes to guidance resulting from the move of Chemetall Surface Treatment to discontinued operations, we have provided a bridge to prior guidance on Page 16 of the earnings deck posted to our website. 
Albemarle's power to generate free cash flow will remain strong even with the sale of Chemetall Surface Treatment. We estimate that Albemarle's free cash flow in 2016, excluding onetime items and the expected free cash generated by Chemetall, will range from $400 million to $500 million.
We expect to close the Chemetall Surface Treatment sale before the end of 2016. Our priorities for the use of the proceeds from that sale are the same as those we have consistently communicated since we acquired Rockwood in early 2015. First, we expect to deleverage to a gross debt-to-EBITDA range of around 2.5x. Second, we will leave some cash on the balance sheet to accelerate growth in our core businesses. In the near term, investments will likely be focused on high-growth battery applications in our Lithium business. Third, we will work to return cash to shareholders through some combination of dividend increases and stock repurchases. While you should not expect us to completely finalize plans until sometime after the sale closes, rest assured that we intend to put this cash to work in ways that will generate the highest shareholder returns over time.
In closing, I am very pleased with our overall execution in the first half of this year. Our core businesses exceeded expectations, and we entered into a contract to sell our Chemetall Surface Treatment business at an attractive valuation. Once the sale closes, we will have a very strong balance sheet and are set up nicely to continue strong performance in the rest of 2016 and to accelerate the execution of our longer-term strategy."

We would look from a standpoint of anything that would accelerate our already stated goals. Those goals are to capture 50% of the growth in the lithium market over the next 5 to 10 years. So you can look at -- that will require additional resources that we will need to bring online to be exploited in the 2022 kind of  time frame. We'll have to find those assets, acquire them. We've got teams around the world looking at them and talking with people about options because not only do we need to satisfy the demand today, but we've got to decide -- meet it into the next decade. And that will require additional resources, as we've stated. So we will look at that. We -- as a part of that, you can expect us to look for high-quality rock reserves as well as high-quality brine reserves. We have today the low-cost position in brine, the low-cost position in rock. We have geographic diversity. We've got a diversity of our portfolio of our end products. And we believe that gives us a tremendous competitive advantage. And you will see us take steps to enhance that advantage that we believe we already have. With regard to Kings Mountain, that is the original, I believe, rock mine in North America, still best of everything that I've seen today. The data would show it's probably the second or third most concentrated rock reserve in the world. And we are in the process of analyzing the cost to bring that back online if it was necessitated. But what it would be would be a simple mathematical equation for us, what's the cost of bringing it online versus what our other options are around the world and does it give us a competitive advantage or not. And we will pick the one that is the highest. So I don't have an answer to your second question, and it would just -- it would be premature for me to throw a number out there, P.J. I'm sorry.

So I",475,"Yes. I think it's -- as I look across it, what I would say is that I think Lithium has got -- has kind of a double-digit growth for the next -- if you look now through the rest of this decade and as long as we get the additional resources continuing. So I see continued strength in Lithium, at least double-digit growth year-over-year for the next 4, 5 years. And that's about as far as anything I can see, right? So -- and that could be accelerated based on energy storage, based on EVs and other items. But I don't see any change coming on that. On Refining Solutions, demand for transportation fuels is going to drive that. And that's usually going to grow somewhere around 2% to 3% to 4%. And I think we will grow a little bit better than that because of our capabilities in the complex tough-to-crack crude slate. So I feel great about our ability to have year-over-year growth there. It will, I think, moderate then from what we've seen this year. Remember, this year was about a bounce-back year. I wouldn't expect to see the type of growth well into the future, but I think that the strength of our innovation in catalysts will allow us to continue to grow that low to mid-single digits. And depending upon how our incumbencies are in Clean Fuels, we could pop above that from quarter-to-quarter. But I think there's still continued growth in that catalyst business. Bromine, as I've said before, this year, Bromine has outperformed my expectations. We said they were going to be down. I still think they're going to be down this year year-over-year. But they've got a fighting chance to get close here to what they did in 2015. That business, we're not counting on it for growth. But if we get a little bit of growth from Bromine over the years, that certainly the free cash flow generation from that is going to accelerate our ability to drive more of our profits into Lithium. So I think you'll see that. I don't think the free cash flow will continue very strong. We'll have some capital that we need to invest in Lithium, obviously. But even with that, I expect our maintenance capital, if you will, to probably be around 4% across our base, and you're going to have growth capital in Lithium that will take us up higher than that. So a continuation of the free cash flow story here and, I think, good solid growth and growth opportunities between Lithium, leading the way, followed by Refining Solutions, and then counting on Bromine to remain flat. It may go up 1 year, a little bit down 1 year a little bit. But overall, I feel great about the ability of these portfolios to drive shareholder value."

In the second quarter of 2016, we again delivered outstanding results in our core businesses and made significant progress against our strategic objectives.
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in Lithium and by 28% in Refining Solutions compared to the second quarter of 2015. For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of the minerals and metal sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $19 million or 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted earnings per share by $0.25 or 37%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 28%, with our 3 reported segments delivering combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%, up from 33% in the second quarter of 2015.
The second quarter was also highlighted by the signing of a definitive agreement to divest the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF for $3.2 billion, over 15x trailing 12-month EBITDA. Combining the expected proceeds from this sale with those already received for the divestiture of metal sulfides implies that we purchased the Lithium business at a pretax multiple of about 10x 2014 EBITDA. The closing of this sale, which we expect before the end of 2016, will mark another major step in our transformation into a company focused on our high-growth lithium and catalyst franchises.
Also in the quarter, we became a component of the S&P 500 and received the 2016 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge award from the EPA in recognition of the development of the AlkyClean process technology and the AlkyStar catalyst used in conjunction with that technology. This is the world's first solid acid alkylation technology and was successfully commercialized in 2015. AlkyClean is a potential game-changing technology and another demonstration of the innovation we bring to our customers.
Our businesses and our employees continue to deliver strong results despite a weak and uncertain macro environment, a testimony to the quality of both our businesses and our people.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott."
18671,372189178,1025559,"Albemarle Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, including Chemetall Surface Treatment but excluding special items.On a continuing operations basis, we reported adjusted earnings per sha",1072,"Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, including Chemetall Surface Treatment but excluding special items.
On a continuing operations basis, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.93, an increase of 36% compared to second quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested minerals and metal sulfides businesses. The increase was driven by strong core business growth, a lower effective tax rate and lower corporate and interest costs.
Before I turn to other financial metrics, let me remind you again that all of these will be discussed on a continuing operations basis, unless noted.
In the second quarter, business mix by country and continued strength in our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture again drove a favorable effective tax rate. As such, we now expect our 2016 effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items, to be about 19%.
D&A for 2016 is now forecasted at $185 million to $200 million, with 2016 capital expenditures excluding Chemetall expected to be in roughly the same range.
Operating working capital crept up to about 29% of sales at the end of the second quarter. Very strong sales in Bromine and Lithium in the second half of the quarter drove an increase in accounts receivables and a corresponding increase in working capital. However, we expect to reduce operating working capital to between 27% and 28% by the end of the year.
In the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow, including contributions from discontinued operations, was $237 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, but excludes onetime synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs. Free cash flow, including those onetime costs, was $163 million through June, up significantly from 2015.
The impact of foreign exchange on our businesses continue to decline in the second quarter to the point that the overall year-over-year impact was essentially negligible, with a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of less than 1% in the quarter. 
Before I turn to our core business unit performance, note that our Fine Chemistry Services business remains a challenge. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA in that business was several million dollars below expectations at the beginning of the quarter. In addition, Fine Chemistry Services is facing challenges due to the difficult environment for customers in the ag industry and the need to rebuild relationships and business with a customer base after the extended sales process. As a result, our forecast for full year adjusted EBITDA in 2016 has now been reduced by about $15 million since April.
Moving on to our core businesses. Let's start with Lithium & Advanced Materials. Second quarter net sales were $233 million with adjusted EBITDA of $83 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, net sales were up 10% and adjusted EBITDA was up over 3%.
The Lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. Second quarter net sales were up 24% and adjusted EBITDA up 20% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the sixth quarter in a row with margins greater than 40%. Overall volume grew in the quarter by 19% and pricing improved by approximately 3%. All of the growth and most of the pricing improvement were in battery-grade applications, where we achieved double-digit price increases compared to second quarter of 2015. Margins were in line with our expectations as we continue to ramp up lower-margin tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide to meet demand growth. Lower year-over-year potash pricing continues to be a headwind for this business of about $7 million of full year adjusted EBITDA.
From an operations standpoint, the start-up and customer qualifications of our new La Negra lithium carbonate plant in Chile are progressing as planned, and we continue to see good reception from our customers on the shift to long-term contracts.
We were also pleased to announce the initiation of a collaborative effort between Albemarle and SQM to safeguard the ecosystem of the Salar de Atacama and to ensure the sustainable extraction of brine over the long term.
PCS experienced headwinds during the second quarter from both polyolefin catalysts and curatives. Net sales were down just over $10 million and adjusted EBITDA was down almost $8 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Lower curatives volumes and pricing due to increased product availability from competitors and the impact from the Sun Edison bankruptcy were the primary drivers.
PCS adjusted EBITDA could be negatively impacted by as much as $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015, a worsening of $5 million from our expectations at the time of the first quarter call.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $67 million, down 3% year-on-year, with net sales down almost 8% to 2,000 -- $207 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 32%. Better-than-expected clear completion fluids demand in the Middle East, timing of certain large-volume flame retardant orders, favorable costs and a better-than-expected pricing environment for some of our bromine derivatives helped the business overcome most of a $15 million year-on-year adjusted EBITDA headwind due to the loss of a large methyl bromide customer in 2015.
While we do not expect to see a repeat of the strong first half performance in the second half of 2016, we now expect the business to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance of $223 million.
Refining Solutions reported second quarter net sales of $178 million and adjusted EBITDA of $62 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was up 28%. Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts continued to perform at a high level, with volume, revenue and adjusted EBITDA all up as expected compared to second quarter 2015. Heavy Oil Upgrading also benefited from a more favorable product mix and lower variable costs compared to second quarter 2015.
Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalysts results also continued to improve as expected, with improved adjusted EBITDA driven by volume, a more favorable product mix and lower variable costs. Overall, Refining Solutions expectations for 2016 remained fully in line with our view at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Luke to update our view of the year."
18671,372189178,1025559,"Albemarle Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Just as in the first quarter, Lithium, Refining Solutions and Bromine Specialties exceeded our high expectations in the second quarter and helped us to overcome weakness in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS. For the first half of the year, we",564,"Thanks, Scott. Just as in the first quarter, Lithium, Refining Solutions and Bromine Specialties exceeded our high expectations in the second quarter and helped us to overcome weakness in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS. For the first half of the year, we've exceeded our initial 2016 expectations in all 3 of these core businesses. In the third quarter, we expect Lithium and Refining Solutions to again show solid growth compared to the third quarter of 2015. While our full year outlook for Bromine has improved due to the strong first half performance, we do expect to see both sequential and year-over-year weakness in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Strong first half clear brine fluid demand outside the U.S. is not expected to continue, and certain large-volume flame retardant sales in the first half are unlikely to be repeated in the second half of the year.
Finally, the issues that Scott noted in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS lead to an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $15 million compared to our guidance in the first quarter earnings call.
Even with those headwinds, the overall balance for the year continues to improve, and we are increasing our guidance for the year. On a continuing operations basis, our updated full year 2016 net sales expectations are now $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $705 million and $750 million and adjusted EPS to between $3.35 and $3.60 per share, driven by the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast and the impact of a lower effective tax rate.
As a reminder, given the changes to guidance resulting from the move of Chemetall Surface Treatment to discontinued operations, we have provided a bridge to prior guidance on Page 16 of the earnings deck posted to our website. 
Albemarle's power to generate free cash flow will remain strong even with the sale of Chemetall Surface Treatment. We estimate that Albemarle's free cash flow in 2016, excluding onetime items and the expected free cash generated by Chemetall, will range from $400 million to $500 million.
We expect to close the Chemetall Surface Treatment sale before the end of 2016. Our priorities for the use of the proceeds from that sale are the same as those we have consistently communicated since we acquired Rockwood in early 2015. First, we expect to deleverage to a gross debt-to-EBITDA range of around 2.5x. Second, we will leave some cash on the balance sheet to accelerate growth in our core businesses. In the near term, investments will likely be focused on high-growth battery applications in our Lithium business. Third, we will work to return cash to shareholders through some combination of dividend increases and stock repurchases. While you should not expect us to completely finalize plans until sometime after the sale closes, rest assured that we intend to put this cash to work in ways that will generate the highest shareholder returns over time.
In closing, I am very pleased with our overall execution in the first half of this year. Our core businesses exceeded expectations, and we entered into a contract to sell our Chemetall Surface Treatment business at an attractive valuation. Once the sale closes, we will have a very strong balance sheet and are set up nicely to continue strong performance in the rest of 2016 and to accelerate the execution of our longer-term strategy."

We would look from a standpoint of anything that would accelerate our already stated goals. Those goals are to capture 50% of the growth in the lithium market over the next 5 to 10 years. So you can look at -- that will require additional resources that we will need to bring online to be exploited in the 2022 kind of time frame. We'll have to find those assets, acquire them. We've got teams around the world looking at them and talking with people about options because not only do we need to satisfy the demand today, but we've got to decide -- meet it into the next decade. And that will require additional resources, as we've stated. So we will look at that. We -- as a part of that, you can expect us to look for high-quality rock reserves as well as high-quality brine reserves. We have today the low-cost position in brine, the low-cost position in rock. We have geographic diversity. We've got a diversity of our portfolio of our end products. And we believe that gives us a tremendous competitive advantage. And you will see us take steps to enhance that advantage that we believe we already have. With regard to Kings Mountain, that is the original, I believe, rock mine in North America, still best of everything that I've seen today. The data would show it's probably the second or third most concentrated rock reserve in the world. And we are in the process of analyzing the cost to bring that back online if it was necessitated. But what it would be would be a simple mathematical equation for us, what's the cost of bringing it online versus what our other options are around the world and does it give us a competitive advantage or not. And we will pick the one that is the highest. So I don't have an answer to your second question, and it would just -- it would be premature for me to throw a number out there, P.J. I'm sorry.

I think it's -- as I look across it, what I would say is that I think Lithium has got -- has kind of a double-digit growth for the next -- if you look now through the rest of this decade and as long as we get the additional resources continuing. So I",470,"Yes. I think it's -- as I look across it, what I would say is that I think Lithium has got -- has kind of a double-digit growth for the next -- if you look now through the rest of this decade and as long as we get the additional resources continuing. So I see continued strength in Lithium, at least double-digit growth year-over-year for the next 4, 5 years. And that's about as far as anybody can see, right? So -- and that could be accelerated based on energy storage, based on EVs and other items. But I don't see any change coming on that. On Refining Solutions, demand for transportation fuels is going to drive that. And that's usually going to grow somewhere around 2% to 3% to 4%. And I think we'll grow a little bit better than that because of our capabilities in the complex tough-to-crack crude slate. So I feel great about our ability to have year-over-year growth there. It will, I think, moderate then from what we've seen this year. Remember, this year was a bounce-back year. I wouldn't expect to see that type of growth well into the future, but I think that the strength of our innovation in catalysts will allow us to continue to grow that low to mid-single digits. And depending upon how our incumbencies are in Clean Fuels, we could pop above that from quarter-to-quarter. But I think there's still continued growth in that catalyst business. Bromine, as I've said before, this year, Bromine's outperformed my expectations. We said they were going to be down. I still think they're going to be down this year, year-over-year. But they've got a fighting chance to get close here to what they did in 2015. That business, we're not counting on it for growth. But if we get a little bit of growth from Bromine over the years, that certainly the free cash flow generation from that is going to accelerate our ability to drive more of our profits into Lithium. So I think you'll see that. I think the free cash flow will continue very strong. We'll have some capital that we need to invest in Lithium, obviously. But even with that, I expect our maintenance capital, if you will, to probably be around 4% across our base, and you're going to have growth capital in Lithium that will take us up higher than that. So a continuation of the free cash flow story here and, I think, good solid growth and growth opportunities between Lithium, leading the way, followed by Refining Solutions, and then counting on Bromine to remain flat. It may go up 1 year a little bit, down 1 year a little bit. But overall, I feel great about the ability of these portfolios to drive shareholder value."

In the second quarter of 2016, we again delivered outstanding results in our core businesses and made significant progress against our strategic objectives.
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in Lithium and by 28% in Refining Solutions compared to the second quarter of 2015. For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of the minerals and metal sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $19 million or 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015 and adjusted earnings per share by $0.25 or 37%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 28%, with our 3 reported segments delivering combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%, up from 33% in the second quarter of 2015.
The second quarter was also highlighted by the signing of a definitive agreement to divest the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF for $3.2 billion over 15x trailing 12-month EBITDA. Combining the expected proceeds from this sale with those already received for the divestiture of metal sulfides implies that we purchased the Lithium business at a pretax multiple of about 10x 2014 EBITDA. The closing of this sale, which we expect before the end of 2016, will mark another major step in our transformation into a company focused on our high-growth lithium and catalyst franchises.
Also in the quarter, we became a component of the S&P 500 and received the 2016 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge award from the EPA in recognition of the development of the AlkyClean process technology and the AlkyStar catalyst used in conjunction with that technology. This is the world's first solid acid alkylation technology and was successfully commercialized in 2015. AlkyClean is a potential game-changing technology and another demonstration of the innovation we bring to our customers.
Our businesses and our employees continue to deliver strong results despite a weak and uncertain macro environment, a testimony to the quality of both our businesses and our people.
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott."
18671,372189178,1025985,"Albemarle Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, including Chemetall Surface Treatment but excluding special items.On a continuing operations basis, we reported adjusted earnings per sha",1072,"Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, including Chemetall Surface Treatment but excluding special items.
On a continuing operations basis, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.93, an increase of 36% compared to second quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested minerals and metal sulfides businesses. The increase was driven by strong core business growth, a lower effective tax rate and lower corporate and interest costs.
Before I turn to other financial metrics, let me remind you again that all of these will be discussed on a continuing operations basis, unless noted.
In the second quarter, business mix by country and continued strength in our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture again drove a favorable effective tax rate. As such, we now expect our 2016 effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items, to be about 19%.
D&A for 2016 is now forecasted at $185 million to $200 million, with 2016 capital expenditures excluding Chemetall expected to be in roughly the same range.
Operating working capital crept up to about 29% of sales at the end of the second quarter. Very strong sales in Bromine and Lithium in the second half of the quarter drove an increase in accounts receivables and a corresponding increase in working capital. However, we expect to reduce operating working capital to between 27% and 28% by the end of the year.
In the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow, including contributions from discontinued operations, was $237 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, but excludes onetime synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs. Free cash flow, including those onetime costs, was $163 million through June, up significantly from 2015.
The impact of foreign exchange on our businesses continue to decline in the second quarter to the point that the overall year-over-year impact was essentially negligible, with a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of less than 1% in the quarter. 
Before I turn to our core business unit performance, note that our Fine Chemistry Services business remains a challenge. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA in that business was several million dollars below expectations at the beginning of the quarter. In addition, Fine Chemistry Services is facing challenges due to the difficult environment for customers in the ag industry and the need to rebuild relationships and business with a customer base after the extended sales process. As a result, our forecast for full year adjusted EBITDA in 2016 has now been reduced by about $15 million since April.
Moving on to our core businesses. Let's start with Lithium & Advanced Materials. Second quarter net sales were $233 million with adjusted EBITDA of $83 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, net sales were up 10% and adjusted EBITDA was up over 3%.
The Lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. Second quarter net sales were up 24% and adjusted EBITDA up 20% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the sixth quarter in a row with margins greater than 40%. Overall volume grew in the quarter by 19% and pricing improved by approximately 3%. All of the growth and most of the pricing improvement were in battery-grade applications, where we achieved double-digit price increases compared to second quarter of 2015. Margins were in line with our expectations as we continue to ramp up lower-margin tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide to meet demand growth. Lower year-over-year potash pricing continues to be a headwind for this business of about $7 million of full year adjusted EBITDA.
From an operations standpoint, the start-up and customer qualifications of our new La Negra lithium carbonate plant in Chile are progressing as planned, and we continue to see good reception from our customers on the shift to long-term contracts.
We were also pleased to announce the initiation of a collaborative effort between Albemarle and SQM to safeguard the ecosystem of the Salar de Atacama and to ensure the sustainable extraction of brine over the long term.
PCS experienced headwinds during the second quarter from both polyolefin catalysts and curatives. Net sales were down just over $10 million and adjusted EBITDA was down almost $8 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Lower curatives volumes and pricing due to increased product availability from competitors and the impact from the Sun Edison bankruptcy were the primary drivers.
PCS adjusted EBITDA could be negatively impacted by as much as $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015, a worsening of $5 million from our expectations at the time of the first quarter call.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $67 million, down 3% year-on-year, with net sales down almost 8% to 2,000 -- $207 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 32%. Better-than-expected clear completion fluids demand in the Middle East, timing of certain large-volume flame retardant orders, favorable costs and a better-than-expected pricing environment for some of our bromine derivatives helped the business overcome most of a $15 million year-on-year adjusted EBITDA headwind due to the loss of a large methyl bromide customer in 2015.
While we do not expect to see a repeat of the strong first half performance in the second half of 2016, we now expect the business to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance of $223 million.
Refining Solutions reported second quarter net sales of $178 million and adjusted EBITDA of $62 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was up 28%. Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC Catalysts continued to perform at a high level, with volume, revenue and adjusted EBITDA all up as expected compared to second quarter 2015. Heavy Oil Upgrading also benefited from a more favorable product mix and lower variable costs compared to second quarter 2015.
Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalysts results also continued to improve as expected, with improved adjusted EBITDA driven by volume, a more favorable product mix and lower variable costs. Overall, Refining Solutions expectations for 2016 remained fully in line with our view at the start of the year. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Luke to update our view of the year."
18671,372189178,1025985,"Albemarle Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Albemarle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Scott. Just as in the first quarter, Lithium, Refining Solutions and Bromine Specialties exceeded our high expectations in the second quarter and helped us to overcome weakness in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS. For the first half of the year, we",564,"Thanks, Scott. Just as in the first quarter, Lithium, Refining Solutions and Bromine Specialties exceeded our high expectations in the second quarter and helped us to overcome weakness in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS. For the first half of the year, we've exceeded our initial 2016 expectations in all 3 of these core businesses. In the third quarter, we expect Lithium and Refining Solutions to again show solid growth compared to the third quarter of 2015. While our full year outlook for Bromine has improved due to the strong first half performance, we do expect to see both sequential and year-over-year weakness in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Strong first half clear brine fluid demand outside the U.S. is not expected to continue, and certain large-volume flame retardant sales in the first half are unlikely to be repeated in the second half of the year.
Finally, the issues that Scott noted in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS lead to an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $15 million compared to our guidance in the first quarter earnings call.
Even with those headwinds, the overall balance for the year continues to improve, and we are increasing our guidance for the year. On a continuing operations basis, our updated full year 2016 net sales expectations are now $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $705 million and $750 million and adjusted EPS to between $3.35 and $3.60 per share, driven by the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast and the impact of a lower effective tax rate.
As a reminder, given the changes to guidance resulting from the move of Chemetall Surface Treatment to discontinued operations, we have provided a bridge to prior guidance on Page 16 of the earnings deck posted to our website. 
Albemarle's power to generate free cash flow will remain strong even with the sale of Chemetall Surface Treatment. We estimate that Albemarle's free cash flow in 2016, excluding onetime items and the expected free cash generated by Chemetall, will range from $400 million to $500 million.
We expect to close the Chemetall Surface Treatment sale before the end of 2016. Our priorities for the use of the proceeds from that sale are the same as those we have consistently communicated since we acquired Rockwood in early 2015. First, we expect to deleverage to a gross debt-to-EBITDA range of around 2.5x. Second, we will leave some cash on the balance sheet to accelerate growth in our core businesses. In the near term, investments will likely be focused on high-growth battery applications in our Lithium business. Third, we will work to return cash to shareholders through some combination of dividend increases and stock repurchases. While you should not expect us to completely finalize plans until sometime after the sale closes, rest assured that we intend to put this cash to work in ways that will generate the highest shareholder returns over time.
In closing, I am very pleased with our overall execution in the first half of this year. Our core businesses exceeded expectations, and we entered into a contract to sell our Chemetall Surface Treatment business at an attractive valuation. Once the sale closes, we will have a very strong balance sheet and are set up nicely to continue strong performance in the rest of 2016 and to accelerate the execution of our longer-term strategy."

We would look from a standpoint of anything that would accelerate our already stated goals. Those goals are to capture 50% of the growth in the lithium market over the next 5 to 10 years. So you can look at -- that will require additional resources that we will need to bring online to be exploited in the 2022 kind of time frame. We'll have to find those assets, acquire them. We've got teams around the world looking at them and talking with people about options because not only do we need to satisfy the demand today, but we've got to decide -- meet it into the next decade. And that will require additional resources, as we've stated. So we will look at that. We -- as a part of that, you can expect us to look for high-quality rock reserves as well as high-quality brine reserves. We have today the low-cost position in brine, the low-cost position in rock. We have geographic diversity. We've got a diversity of our portfolio of our end products. And we believe that gives us a tremendous competitive advantage. And you will see us take steps to enhance that advantage that we believe we already have. With regard to Kings Mountain, that is the original, I believe, rock mine in North America, still best of everything that I've seen today. The data would show it's probably the second or third most concentrated rock reserve in the world. And we are in the process of analyzing the cost to bring that back online if it was necessitated. But what it would be would be a simple mathematical equation for us, what's the cost of bringing it online versus what our other options are around the world and does it give us a competitive advantage or not. And we will pick the one that is the highest. So I don't have an answer to your second question, and it would just -- it would be premature for me to throw a number out there, P.J. I'm sorry.

I think it's -- as I look across it, what I would say is that I think Lithium has got -- has kind of a double-digit growth for the next -- if you look now through the rest of this decade and as long as we get the additional resources continuing. So I",470,"Yes. I think it's -- as I look across it, what I would say is that I think Lithium has got -- has kind of a double-digit growth for the next -- if you look now through the rest of this decade and as long as we get the additional resources continuing. So I see continued strength in Lithium, at least double-digit growth year-over-year for the next 4, 5 years. And that's about as far as anybody can see, right? So -- and that could be accelerated based on energy storage, based on EVs and other items. But I don't see any change coming on that. On Refining Solutions, demand for transportation fuels is going to drive that. And that's usually going to grow somewhere around 2% to 3% to 4%. And I think we'll grow a little bit better than that because of our capabilities in the complex tough-to-crack crude slate. So I feel great about our ability to have year-over-year growth there. It will, I think, moderate then from what we've seen this year. Remember, this year was a bounce-back year. I wouldn't expect to see that type of growth well into the future, but I think that the strength of our innovation in catalysts will allow us to continue to grow that low to mid-single digits. And depending upon how our incumbencies are in Clean Fuels, we could pop above that from quarter-to-quarter. But I think there's still continued growth in that catalyst business. Bromine, as I've said before, this year, Bromine's outperformed my expectations. We said they were going to be down. I still think they're going to be down this year, year-over-year. But they've got a fighting chance to get close here to what they did in 2015. That business, we're not counting on it for growth. But if we get a little bit of growth from Bromine over the years, that certainly the free cash flow generation from that is going to accelerate our ability to drive more of our profits into Lithium. So I think you'll see that. I think the free cash flow will continue very strong. We'll have some capital that we need to invest in Lithium, obviously. But even with that, I expect our maintenance capital, if you will, to probably be around 4% across our base, and you're going to have growth capital in Lithium that will take us up higher than that. So a continuation of the free cash flow story here and, I think, good solid growth and growth opportunities between Lithium, leading the way, followed by Refining Solutions, and then counting on Bromine to remain flat. It may go up 1 year a little bit, down 1 year a little bit. But overall, I feel great about the ability of these portfolios to drive shareholder value."

I'm very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to deliver strong growth in both Lithium and Refining Solutions and our Bromine Specialties and PCS businesses performed in line with our expectatio",544,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to deliver strong growth in both Lithium and Refining Solutions and our Bromine Specialties and PCS businesses performed in line with our expectations.
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 32% in Lithium and by 19% in Refining Solutions compared to the third quarter of 2015. For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of minerals and metal sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $16 million, an increase of 10% compared to the third quarter of 2015, and adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 or 26%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins were almost 29%, up 270 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. And our 3 reported segments again delivered combined adjusted EBITDA margins greater than 33%. 
The third quarter was also highlighted by additional moves to strengthen our industry-leading Lithium business. In August, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Company with the closing expected by the end of the first quarter 2017. Once closed, these assets will give us spodumene conversion capacity of 15,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate with infrastructure already in place to support a 20,000 to 25,000 metric ton expansion. 
Spodumene for the current operations and the planned expansion will be supplied from our Talison joint venture in Australia. The acquisition increases our control of the supply chain from spodumene mining through production and sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate. In addition to the planned capacity expansion at Jiangxi Jiangli, we will continue to pursue development of a greenfield spodumene conversion plant of approximately another 40,000 metric tons a year so that we can fully utilize the Talison resources over time.
Full utilization of the Talison resources, combined with the additional capacity we expect to add in Chile once the new quota is finalized, will allow us to achieve roughly 160,000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate equivalent production capacity by the beginning of the next decade. Based on current demand projections, we believe we will fully utilize that capacity by the early to mid-2020s. At that point, our assets in Chile and Australia will have many years of useful life remaining. But as of now, we do not believe further expansions are likely. 
Therefore, to meet the expected market growth path to early 2020s, we will need new resources. The agreement with Bolland Minera S.A. that we announced in the third quarter is a positive step in that direction. This agreement gives us exclusive exploration and acquisition rights to a lithium reserve in Antofalla in the Catamarca Province of Argentina. Based on existing data, we believe this resource will be certified as the largest lithium resource in Argentina. Given the development cycle to commercialize a new resource, we must begin investing now to bring new resources on line by the early to mid-2020s. Our very preliminary evaluation on the Antofalla resource is encouraging. But you can expect it to take 1 to 2 years for us to make a decision on commercial viability. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

In the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of 26% compared to third quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested mineral",1057,"Thanks, Luke, and good morning. In the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of 26% compared to third quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested minerals and metal sulfides businesses. The increase was driven primarily by core business growth and a lower effective tax rate compared to 2015. 
Our corporate costs in the quarter increased, driven by increased compensation costs and some one-time costs related to relocations and legal settlements. As a result, our corporate costs for the full year will likely ready to be between $85 million and $90 million. There was no change in our estimated 2016 effective tax rate in the third quarter from the second quarter. Excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items, we continue to expect the 2016 ETR to be about 19%.
We continue to expect D&A in 2016 of $185 million to $200 million with 2016 capital expenditures now expected to be $175 million to $185 million, down from an estimate of $185 million to $200 million at the end of the second quarter. We are not slowing any of our projects. The decline is simply a result of changes in the timing of spending and improved capital efficiency versus our prior estimate.
Operating working capital remained at 29% of sales at the end of the third quarter. Strong sales in our Refining Solutions business at the end of the quarter, especially in Clean Fuels Technologies, drove an increase in accounts receivables. We also saw an increase in Refining Solutions inventories in the quarter. Forecasted demand in clean fuels in the first half of 2017 will necessitate further inventory growth in the fourth quarter to manage production for those expected sales. As such, our working capital is likely to remain in the 28% to 29% range at the end of 2016. 
Through the end of the third quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, including contribution from discontinued operations, was $415 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures but excludes one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs. Free cash flow, including those one-time costs, were $325 million through September, nearly double the cash flow generated last year in the same period.
Before I turn to our core business unit performance, let me briefly update you on our Fine Chemistry Services business. Sales and adjusted EBITDA improved in the third quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. However, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, this business faces tough comparisons. Fine Chemistry Services made all of its total 2015 adjusted EBITDA, over $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we only expect break-even performance due to contract timing.
Moving on to our core businesses. Let's start with Lithium and Advanced Materials. Third quarter net sales were $240 million with adjusted EBITDA of $92 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 38%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, net sales were up 15%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 18%. 
The Lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. The third quarter net sales were up 30% and adjusted EBITDA up 32% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 41% were consistent with our guidance. And this is the seventh consecutive quarter with margins above 40%. 
Overall, volume grew in the quarter by 13% and pricing improved by 16%. We saw continued strong pricing momentum in our battery-grade products and price increases in technical-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide as well. As in the second quarter, volume growth was driven by increased tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and hydroxide. As a reminder, these results include a negative impact from year-over-year potash pricing, which we continue to forecast at $7 million for all of 2016.
PCS performance was in line with our expectations with net sales down just over $6 million and adjusted EBITDA down $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Impact from the Sun Edison bankruptcy and pricing pressure in our organometallics product lines drove the lower results. Our full year expectations are unchanged with PCS adjusted EBITDA likely to be down by about $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Bromine Specialties also performed as expected with third quarter net sales of $194 million and adjusted EBITDA of $52 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 27%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 2% with adjusted EBITDA down 12%. Adjusted EBITDA and margins were impacted by negative pricing and mix, lower completion fluids volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and Europe, lower volumes in certain flame retardants and reduced demand for agricultural intermediates. Consistent with prior guidance, we continue to expect the business to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance despite a $15 million year-over-year headwind due to the loss of a methyl bromide contract at the end of 2015. 
Refining Solutions reported third quarter net sales of $190 million and adjusted EBITDA of $65 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 3% and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. As expected, Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts was down year-on-year as refiners made small operating adjustments for higher-than-normal gasoline inventory in the United States. 
Also while our full year expectations for Heavy Oil Upgrading are unchanged, that is we continue to expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA to be very similar to 2015, this business faces difficult comparisons in the second half of 2016 due to the very strong sales in the second half of 2015. Volume in 2016 has been more evenly spread across the quarters while volume in 2015 was back end-loaded due to both turnarounds and competitive trials at our customer base in the first half of 2015.
Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalysts results were strong as expected with improved sales and adjusted EBITDA driven by increased volume and a more favorable product mix. Overall, Refining Solutions continues to exceed our expectations at the start of 2016 with full year adjusted EBITDA now likely to be up close to 20% versus 2015.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke to update our view on the year."

In the third quarter, we continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth in our businesses. Growth in Lithium and Refining Solutions again led the way with the remaining businesses meeting our expectations coming into the quarter. I",318,"Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth in our businesses. Growth in Lithium and Refining Solutions again led the way with the remaining businesses meeting our expectations coming into the quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect the Lithium business to continue its trend of strong year-over-year EBITDA growth. However, we are forecasting relatively flat year-over-year performance for Refining Solutions, Bromine Specialties and PCS. As Scott already noted, our Fine Chemistry Services business had a strong fourth quarter in 2015 with over $17 million of adjusted EBITDA while we expect a break-even fourth quarter for that business in 2016, which will impact our year-over-year comps.
Still in total, our view of 2016 continues to improve. We are adjusting our full year 2016 forecast upward with net sales expected to range between $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $725 million and $745 million and adjusted EPS between $3.45 and $3.55 per share. 
We remain on track to complete the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF before the end of 2016. All regulatory filings are complete and several more jurisdictions, including the European Union, have cleared the transaction. Once closed, we will begin implementation of a deleveraging plan that will allow us to achieve our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x in early 2017.
We are very pleased with our performance to date in 2016. Our businesses have delivered impressive core EBITDA growth and we have made much progress on our strategic objectives as well. While as expected, the fourth quarter of 2016 will be softer than our first 3 quarters, this does not mean a weakening in our outlook for 2017. We believe we have positioned the company for outstanding performance in 2017. Our budgeting process is well underway. And we are very confident that our high-growth Lithium business will drive another strong year of earnings growth for Albemarle."

There's no contest to that. So the environmental permits are not an issue at all down there. And we have sufficient brine to produce over 80,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent per year down there. The CORFO agreement, there was -- CCHEN is going through that process. The nuclear agency is in discussions down there. And I expect at a high level, we're going to get that agreement done by the end of the year.

We have the financial strength to invest in the conversion capacity needed through 2021 as well as the technical skills and financial resources to bring on the next world-scale resources that allow us to continue to meet that demand. So at the end of the day, I love our position in this market, and I love the strategy that John and his team have put together to meet the demands today and have a sustainable winning business well into the future."

We got some good news on bunker fuels and some other regulations that will cause the use of more hydrotreating catalysts. So longer term, that business will have good, steady business. And it'll all come down to what the mix is of that business and what the mix the catalyst uses, and that'll be more impacted by what their margins are. But overall, I don't break -- I don't know.

With regard to long-term agreements and how does that impact our ability to price product, of course, we are having those critical conversations with customers where we do need the flexibility to adjust price, but we want to treat customers fairly. So there are provision in our agreements that allows us to adjust price as appropriate and also give the customer an opportunity to look at the market if they so choose to do that. But I think the important thing is that we're being -- we're committing a long-term agreement, allow the customers to invest in the energy storage market because they know that they have a partnership with a company like Albemarle that has ability to invest and supply to them. And I think as Luke outlined in the opening comments, when we said during the Lithium Day that the overall market's growing at 20,000 metric tons per year and we're going to invest to supply half of that, I think you've seen, through the tolling, through the acquisitions of the China conversion technology, the expansion of our mine in Australia, what we're doing in Chile, how we're expanding the capacity in Chile, that we have invested and will continue to invest to be able to supply at least 10,000 metric tons per year. We've done it this year. We'll do it next year. And I think we've given you guys the path to see that we can deliver on our promises. And that is going a long way with the customers.

And third, and importantly, we're entering into long-term agreements with our major customers that gives us line of sight into their demand forecast going forward. And so that we want to make sure we have their views on what their demand is so we can meet that demand in a timely fashion. And they are very interested, ensuring they have accurate and quality production to meet that demand. So it's a lot of great conversation. So if you got the resource side, you got the technology side, you got the financial wherewithal to bring that online in a way, in increments that make sense for the market demand and your strategic relationships with the customers who are going to be winners in this industry going forward, that's the way you protect yourself and really drive shareholder value in a market such as this. Go ahead, John."

Our view on supply-demand is that it will remain in balance through 2020. Beyond 2020, none of us have a crystal ball in terms of exactly what the inflection points will look like in terms of EV adoption and who will actually figure out how to build capacity the right way. But one thing, I think, we have a high degree of confidence on. Any one that is built, any kind of large-scale chemical plant understands this. It's one thing to announce a project. It's another thing to actually build it, commercialize it, qualify it, et cetera. And if you just look at what it takes to bring on capacity, if we have hundreds of engineers with scientists working as fast as they can on our projects, but if you look at the marketplace and what it takes to bring on this capacity, I think you'll find some comfort in our prediction that the market will stay in balance through 2020."

I'm very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to deliver strong growth in both Lithium and Refining Solutions and our Bromine Specialties and PCS businesses performed in line with our expectatio",544,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to deliver strong growth in both Lithium and Refining Solutions and our Bromine Specialties and PCS businesses performed in line with our expectations.
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 32% in Lithium and by 19% in Refining Solutions compared to the third quarter of 2015. For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of minerals and metal sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $16 million, an increase of 10% compared to the third quarter of 2015, and adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 or 26%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins were almost 29%, up 270 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. And our 3 reported segments again delivered combined adjusted EBITDA margins greater than 33%. 
The third quarter was also highlighted by additional moves to strengthen our industry-leading Lithium business. In August, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Company with the closing expected by the end of the first quarter 2017. Once closed, these assets will give us spodumene conversion capacity of 15,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate with infrastructure already in place to support a 20,000 to 25,000 metric ton expansion. 
Spodumene for the current operations and the planned expansion will be supplied from our Talison joint venture in Australia. The acquisition increases our control of the supply chain from spodumene mining through production and sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate. In addition to the planned capacity expansion at Jiangxi Jiangli, we will continue to pursue development of a greenfield spodumene conversion plant of approximately another 40,000 metric tons a year so that we can fully utilize the Talison resources over time.
Full utilization of the Talison resources, combined with the additional capacity we expect to add in Chile once the new quota is finalized, will allow us to achieve roughly 160,000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate equivalent production capacity by the beginning of the next decade. Based on current demand projections, we believe we will fully utilize that capacity by the early to mid-2020s. At that point, our assets in Chile and Australia will have many years of useful life remaining. But as of now, we do not believe further expansions are likely. 
Therefore, to meet the expected market growth path to early 2020s, we will need new resources. The agreement with Bolland Minera S.A. that we announced in the third quarter is a positive step in that direction. This agreement gives us exclusive exploration and acquisition rights to a lithium reserve in Antofalla in the Catamarca Province of Argentina. Based on existing data, we believe this resource will be certified as the largest lithium resource in Argentina. Given the development cycle to commercialize a new resource, we must begin investing now to bring new resources on line by the early to mid-2020s. Our very preliminary evaluation on the Antofalla resource is encouraging. But you can expect it to take 1 to 2 years for us to make a decision on commercial viability. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

In the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of 26% compared to third quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested mineral",1057,"Thanks, Luke, and good morning. In the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of 26% compared to third quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested minerals and metal sulfides businesses. The increase was driven primarily by core business growth and a lower effective tax rate compared to 2015. 
Our corporate costs in the quarter increased, driven by increased compensation costs and some one-time costs related to relocations and legal settlements. As a result, our corporate costs for the full year will likely ready to be between $85 million and $90 million. There was no change in our estimated 2016 effective tax rate in the third quarter from the second quarter. Excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items, we continue to expect the 2016 ETR to be about 19%.
We continue to expect D&A in 2016 of $185 million to $200 million with 2016 capital expenditures now expected to be $175 million to $185 million, down from an estimate of $185 million to $200 million at the end of the second quarter. We are not slowing any of our projects. The decline is simply a result of changes in the timing of spending and improved capital efficiency versus our prior estimate.
Operating working capital remained at 29% of sales at the end of the third quarter. Strong sales in our Refining Solutions business at the end of the quarter, especially in Clean Fuels Technologies, drove an increase in accounts receivables. We also saw an increase in Refining Solutions inventories in the quarter. Forecasted demand in clean fuels in the first half of 2017 will necessitate further inventory growth in the fourth quarter to manage production for those expected sales. As such, our working capital is likely to remain in the 28% to 29% range at the end of 2016. 
Through the end of the third quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, including contribution from discontinued operations, was $415 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures but excludes one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs. Free cash flow, including those one-time costs, were $325 million through September, nearly double the cash flow generated last year in the same period.
Before I turn to our core business unit performance, let me briefly update you on our Fine Chemistry Services business. Sales and adjusted EBITDA improved in the third quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. However, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, this business faces tough comparisons. Fine Chemistry Services made all of its total 2015 adjusted EBITDA, over $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we only expect break-even performance due to contract timing.
Moving on to our core businesses. Let's start with Lithium and Advanced Materials. Third quarter net sales were $240 million with adjusted EBITDA of $92 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 38%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, net sales were up 15%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 18%. 
The Lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. The third quarter net sales were up 30% and adjusted EBITDA up 32% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 41% were consistent with our guidance. And this is the seventh consecutive quarter with margins above 40%. 
Overall, volume grew in the quarter by 13% and pricing improved by 16%. We saw continued strong pricing momentum in our battery-grade products and price increases in technical-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide as well. As in the second quarter, volume growth was driven by increased tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and hydroxide. As a reminder, these results include a negative impact from year-over-year potash pricing, which we continue to forecast at $7 million for all of 2016.
PCS performance was in line with our expectations with net sales down just over $6 million and adjusted EBITDA down $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Impact from the Sun Edison bankruptcy and pricing pressure in our organometallics product lines drove the lower results. Our full year expectations are unchanged with PCS adjusted EBITDA likely to be down by about $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Bromine Specialties also performed as expected with third quarter net sales of $194 million and adjusted EBITDA of $52 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 27%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 2% with adjusted EBITDA down 12%. Adjusted EBITDA and margins were impacted by negative pricing and mix, lower completion fluids volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and Europe, lower volumes in certain flame retardants and reduced demand for agricultural intermediates. Consistent with prior guidance, we continue to expect the business to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance despite a $15 million year-over-year headwind due to the loss of a methyl bromide contract at the end of 2015. 
Refining Solutions reported third quarter net sales of $190 million and adjusted EBITDA of $65 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 3% and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. As expected, Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts was down year-on-year as refiners made small operating adjustments for higher-than-normal gasoline inventory in the United States. 
Also while our full year expectations for Heavy Oil Upgrading are unchanged, that is we continue to expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA to be very similar to 2015, this business faces difficult comparisons in the second half of 2016 due to the very strong sales in the second half of 2015. Volume in 2016 has been more evenly spread across the quarters while volume in 2015 was back end-loaded due to both turnarounds and competitive trials at our customer base in the first half of 2015.
Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalysts results were strong as expected with improved sales and adjusted EBITDA driven by increased volume and a more favorable product mix. Overall, Refining Solutions continues to exceed our expectations at the start of 2016 with full year adjusted EBITDA now likely to be up close to 20% versus 2015.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke to update our view on the year."

Growth in Lithium and Refining Solutions again led the way with the remaining businesses meeting our expectations coming into the quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect the Lithium business to continue its trend of strong year-over-year EBITDA growth. However, we are forecasting relatively flat year-over-year performance for Refining Solutions, Bromine Specialties and PCS. As Scott already noted, our Fine Chemistry Services business had a strong fourth quarter in 2015 with over $17 million of adjusted EBITDA while we expect a break-even fourth quarter for that business in 2016, which will impact our year-over-year comps.
Still in total, our view of 2016 continues to improve. We are adjusting our full year 2016 forecast upward with net sales expected to range between $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $725 million and $745 million and adjusted EPS between $3.45 and $3.55 per share.

Once closed, we will begin implementation of a deleveraging plan that will allow us to achieve our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x in early 2017.
We are very pleased with our performance to date in 2016. Our businesses have delivered impressive core EBITDA growth and we have made much progress on our strategic objectives as well. While as expected, the fourth quarter of 2016 will be softer than our first 3 quarters, this does not mean a weakening in our outlook for 2017. We believe we have positioned the company for outstanding performance in 2017. Our budgeting process is well underway. And we are very confident that our high-growth Lithium business will drive another strong year of earnings growth for Albemarle."

There's no contest to that. So the environmental permits are not an issue at all down there. And we have sufficient brine to produce over 80,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent per year down there. The CORFO agreement, there was -- CCHEN is going through that process. The nuclear agency is in discussions down there. And I expect at a high level, we're going to get that agreement done by the end of the year.

So we've seen that demand forecast play out. We're updating that demand forecast and we'll communicate that at the Investor Day in the first quarter. With regard to long-term agreements and how does that impact our ability to price product, of course, we are having those critical conversations with customers where we do need the flexibility to adjust price, but we want to treat customers fairly. So there are provisions in our agreements that allow us to adjust price as appropriate and also give the customer an opportunity to look at the market if they so choose to do that. But I think the important thing is that we're being -- we're committing a long-term agreement, allow the customers to invest in the energy storage market because they know that they have a partnership with a company like Albemarle that has the ability to invest and supply them. And I think as Luke outlined in the opening comments, when we said during the Lithium Day that the overall market is growing at 20,000 metric tons per year and we're going to invest to supply half of that, I think you've seen, through the tolling, through the acquisitions of the China conversion technology, the expansion of our mine in Australia, what we're doing in Chile, how we're expanding the capacity in Chile, that we have invested and will continue to invest to be able to supply at least 10,000 metric tons per year. We've done it this year. We'll do it next year. And I think we've given you guys the path to see that we can deliver on our promises. And that is going a long way with the customers.

So if you get to a boom-bust, we're still going to be the winners in this industry because low cost always wins, right? Secondly, what we're doing is we're working very hard to have the capability to expand to meet that market demand but doing it in a phased approach so that we can continuously monitor the supply/demand situation to understand when we bring on -- what portions of a capacity expansion that we bring on. And third and importantly, we're entering into long-term agreements with our major customers that gives us line of sight into their demand forecast going forward. And so that we want to make sure we have their views on what their demand is, so we can meet that demand in a timely fashion. And they are very interested, ensuring they have accurate and quality production to meet that demand. So it's a lot of great conversation. So if you've got the resource side, you've got the technology side, you've got the financial wherewithal to bring that online in a way in increments that make sense for the market demand and you're in strategic relationships with the customers who are going to be winners in this industry going forward, that's the way you protect yourself and really drive shareholder value in a market such as this.

So it done a good job at cost. And looking at opportunities, remember, we have the fluctuation to move production in some respects between Jordan and Magnolia. And that can have an influence on our bottom line. So they're doing a good job managing that if I look at overall for the full year. So I don't want you to leave here with some view that there's been a big shift in markets, and that's what's happened, because I don't think that's the case."

I'm very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to deliver strong growth in both Lithium and Refining Solutions and our Bromine Specialties and PCS businesses performed in line with our expectatio",544,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to deliver strong growth in both Lithium and Refining Solutions and our Bromine Specialties and PCS businesses performed in line with our expectations.
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 32% in Lithium and by 19% in Refining Solutions compared to the third quarter of 2015. For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of minerals and metal sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $16 million, an increase of 10% compared to the third quarter of 2015, and adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 or 26%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins were almost 29%, up 270 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. And our 3 reported segments again delivered combined adjusted EBITDA margins greater than 33%. 
The third quarter was also highlighted by additional moves to strengthen our industry-leading Lithium business. In August, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Company with the closing expected by the end of the first quarter 2017. Once closed, these assets will give us spodumene conversion capacity of 15,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate with infrastructure already in place to support a 20,000 to 25,000 metric ton expansion. 
Spodumene for the current operations and the planned expansion will be supplied from our Talison joint venture in Australia. The acquisition increases our control of the supply chain from spodumene mining through production and sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate. In addition to the planned capacity expansion at Jiangxi Jiangli, we will continue to pursue development of a greenfield spodumene conversion plant of approximately another 40,000 metric tons a year so that we can fully utilize the Talison resources over time.
Full utilization of the Talison resources, combined with the additional capacity we expect to add in Chile once the new quota is finalized, will allow us to achieve roughly 160,000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate equivalent production capacity by the beginning of the next decade. Based on current demand projections, we believe we will fully utilize that capacity by the early to mid-2020s. At that point, our assets in Chile and Australia will have many years of useful life remaining. But as of now, we do not believe further expansions are likely. 
Therefore, to meet the expected market growth path to early 2020s, we will need new resources. The agreement with Bolland Minera S.A. that we announced in the third quarter is a positive step in that direction. This agreement gives us exclusive exploration and acquisition rights to a lithium reserve in Antofalla in the Catamarca Province of Argentina. Based on existing data, we believe this resource will be certified as the largest lithium resource in Argentina. Given the development cycle to commercialize a new resource, we must begin investing now to bring new resources on line by the early to mid-2020s. Our very preliminary evaluation on the Antofalla resource is encouraging. But you can expect it to take 1 to 2 years for us to make a decision on commercial viability. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

In the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of 26% compared to third quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested mineral",1055,"Thanks, Luke, and good morning. In the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of 26% compared to third quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested minerals and metal sulfides businesses. The increase was driven primarily by core business growth and a lower effective tax rate compared to 2015. 
Our corporate costs in the quarter increased, driven by increased compensation costs and some one-time costs related to relocations and legal settlements. As a result, our corporate costs for the full year will likely range between $85 million and $90 million. There was no change in our estimated 2016 effective tax rate in the third quarter from the second quarter. Excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items, we continue to expect the 2016 ETR to be about 19%.
We continue to expect D&A in 2016 of $185 million to $200 million with 2016 capital expenditures now expected to be $175 million to $185 million, down from an estimate of $185 million to $200 million at the end of the second quarter. We are not slowing any of our projects. The decline is simply a result of changes in the timing of spending and improved capital efficiency versus our prior estimate.
Operating working capital remained at 29% of sales at the end of the third quarter. Strong sales in our Refining Solutions business at the end of the quarter, especially in Clean Fuels Technologies, drove an increase in accounts receivables. We also saw an increase in Refining Solutions inventories in the quarter. Forecasted demand in clean fuels in the first half of 2017 will necessitate further inventory growth in the fourth quarter to manage production for those expected sales. As such, our working capital is likely to remain in the 28% to 29% range at the end of 2016. 
Through the end of the third quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, including contribution from discontinued operations, was $415 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures but excludes one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs. Free cash flow, including those one-time costs, were $325 million through September, nearly double the cash flow generated last year in the same period.
Before I turn to our core business unit performance, let me briefly update you on our Fine Chemistry Services business. Sales and adjusted EBITDA improved in the third quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. However, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, this business faces tough comparisons. Fine Chemistry Services made all of its total 2015 adjusted EBITDA, over $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we only expect break-even performance due to contract timing.
Moving on to our core businesses. Let's start with Lithium and Advanced Materials. Third quarter net sales were $240 million with adjusted EBITDA of $92 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 38%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, net sales were up 15%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 18%. 
The Lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. The third quarter net sales were up 30% and adjusted EBITDA up 32% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 41% were consistent with our guidance. And this is the seventh consecutive quarter with margins above 40%. 
Overall, volume grew in the quarter by 13% and pricing improved by 16%. We saw continued strong pricing momentum in our battery-grade products and price increases in technical-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide as well. As in the second quarter, volume growth was driven by increased tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and hydroxide. As a reminder, these results include a negative impact from year-over-year potash pricing, which we continue to forecast at $7 million for all of 2016.
PCS performance was in line with our expectations with net sales down just over $6 million and adjusted EBITDA down $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Impact from the Sun Edison bankruptcy and pricing pressure in our organometallics product lines drove the lower results. Our full year expectations are unchanged with PCS adjusted EBITDA likely to be down by about $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Bromine Specialties also performed as expected with third quarter net sales of $194 million and adjusted EBITDA of $52 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 27%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 2% with adjusted EBITDA down 12%. Adjusted EBITDA and margins were impacted by negative pricing and mix, lower completion fluids volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and Europe, lower volumes in certain flame retardants and reduced demand for agricultural intermediates. Consistent with prior guidance, we continue to expect the business to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance despite a $15 million year-over-year headwind due to the loss of a methyl bromide contract at the end of 2015. 
Refining Solutions reported third quarter net sales of $190 million and adjusted EBITDA of $65 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 3% and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. As expected, Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts was down year-on-year as refiners made small operating adjustments for higher-than-normal gasoline inventory in the United States. 
Also while our full year expectations for Heavy Oil Upgrading are unchanged, that is we continue to expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA to be very similar to 2015, this business faces difficult comparisons in the second half of 2016 due to the very strong sales in the second half of 2015. Volume in 2016 has been more evenly spread across the quarters while volume in 2015 was back end-loaded due to both turnarounds and competitive trials at our customer base in the first half of 2015.
Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalysts results were strong as expected with improved sales and adjusted EBITDA driven by increased volume and a more favorable product mix. Overall, Refining Solutions continues to exceed our expectations at the start of 2016 with full year adjusted EBITDA now likely to be up close to 20% versus 2015.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke to update our view on the year."

In the third quarter, we continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth in our businesses. Growth in Lithium and Refining Solutions again led the way with the remaining businesses meeting our expectations coming into the quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect the Lithium business to continue its trend of strong year-over-year EBITDA growth. However, we are forecasting relatively flat year-over-year performance for Refining Solutions, Bromine Specialties and PCS. As Scott already noted, our Fine Chemistry Services business had a strong fourth quarter in 2015 with over $17 million of adjusted EBITDA while we expect a break-even fourth quarter for that business in 2016, which will impact our year-over-year comps.
Still in total, our view of 2016 continues to improve. We are adjusting our full year 2016 forecast upward with net sales expected to range between $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $725 million and $745 million and adjusted EPS between $3.45 and $3.55 per share. 
We remain on track to complete the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF before the end of 2016. All regulatory filings are complete and several more jurisdictions, including the European Union, have cleared the transaction. Once closed, we will begin implementation of a deleveraging plan that will allow us to achieve our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x in early 2017.
We are very pleased with our performance to date in 2016. Our businesses have delivered impressive core EBITDA growth and we have made much progress on our strategic objectives as well. While as expected, the fourth quarter of 2016 will be softer than our first 3 quarters, this does not mean a weakening in our outlook for 2017. We believe we have positioned the company for outstanding performance in 2017. Our budgeting process is well underway. And we are very confident that our high-growth Lithium business will drive another strong year of earnings growth for Albemarle."

The nuclear agency is in discussions down there. And I expect at a high level, we're going to get that agreement done by the end of the year.

So if we can do that and continue to do that, where they need that technology, we'll be successful. And the ones, the new refineries that you see coming online over the period of time, they're taking a complex crude slate and they're looking to upgrade to make as much profit as we can. So I feel good about FCC for the long term. HPC, it all comes down to regulations, what those sulfur specs are. We've got some good news on bunker fuels and some other regulations that will cause the use of more hydrotreating catalysts. So longer term, that business will have good, steady business. And it will all come down to what the mix is of that business and what the mix the catalyst uses. And that will be more impacted by what their margins are. But overall, I don't break -- I don't know. It's hard to break it down by what's going to happen next year in both of those businesses. But as we look at our plan and roll it up, we'll see what the turnarounds are going to be, et cetera.

So we've seen that demand forecast play out. We're updating that demand forecast and we'll communicate that at the Investor Day in the first quarter. With regard to long-term agreements and how does that impact our ability to price product, of course, we are having those critical conversations with customers where we do need the flexibility to adjust price, but we want to treat customers fairly. So there are provisions in our agreements that allow us to adjust price as appropriate and also give the customer an opportunity to look at the market if they so choose to do that. But I think the important thing is that we're being -- we're committing a long-term agreement, allow the customers to invest in the energy storage market because they know that they have a partnership with a company like Albemarle that has the ability to invest and supply them. And I think as Luke outlined in the opening comments, when we said during the Lithium Day that the overall market is growing at 20,000 metric tons per year and we're going to invest to supply half of that, I think you've seen, through the tolling, through the acquisitions of the China conversion technology, the expansion of our mine in Australia, what we're doing in Chile, how we're expanding the capacity in Chile, that we have invested and will continue to invest to be able to supply at least 10,000 metric tons per year. We've done it this year. We'll do it next year. And I think we've given you guys the path to see that we can deliver on our promises. And that is going a long way with the customers.

And I don't really hear a lot of that. I mean, a lot of the discussion is about trying to keep up with demand into the foreseeable future.

If you look at what we're trying to do, we're really -- it's a couple-pronged approach. One, we want to be -- have access to the best resources in the world. That allows us to drive our cost down. So if you get to a boom-bust, we're still going to be the winners in this industry because low cost always wins, right? Secondly, what we're doing is we're working very hard to have the capability to expand to meet that market demand but doing it in a phased approach so that we can continuously monitor the supply/demand situation to understand when we bring on -- what portions of a capacity expansion that we bring on. And third and importantly, we're entering into long-term agreements with our major customers that gives us line of sight into their demand forecast going forward. And so that we want to make sure we have their views on what their demand is, so we can meet that demand in a timely fashion. And they are very interested, ensuring they have accurate and quality production to meet that demand. So it's a lot of great conversation. So if you've got the resource side, you've got the technology side, you've got the financial wherewithal to bring that online in a way in increments that make sense for the market demand and you're in strategic relationships with the customers who are going to be winners in this industry going forward, that's the way you protect yourself and really drive shareholder value in a market such as this.

Let's get it closed, and then you'll see what the number is and understand what a great value we believe we've received. With regard to the Chemetall transaction, we expect that to close by year-end. And the leakage on that, because of the way that we structured the deal, Scott, is kind of in that 10-ish percent range. Is that fair?"

I'm very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to deliver strong growth in both Lithium and Refining Solutions and our Bromine Specialties and PCS businesses performed in line with our expectatio",544,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to deliver strong growth in both Lithium and Refining Solutions and our Bromine Specialties and PCS businesses performed in line with our expectations.
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 32% in Lithium and by 19% in Refining Solutions compared to the third quarter of 2015. For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of minerals and metal sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $16 million, an increase of 10% compared to the third quarter of 2015, and adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 or 26%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins were almost 29%, up 270 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. And our 3 reported segments again delivered combined adjusted EBITDA margins greater than 33%. 
The third quarter was also highlighted by additional moves to strengthen our industry-leading Lithium business. In August, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Company with the closing expected by the end of the first quarter 2017. Once closed, these assets will give us spodumene conversion capacity of 15,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate with infrastructure already in place to support a 20,000 to 25,000 metric ton expansion. 
Spodumene for the current operations and the planned expansion will be supplied from our Talison joint venture in Australia. The acquisition increases our control of the supply chain from spodumene mining through production and sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate. In addition to the planned capacity expansion at Jiangxi Jiangli, we will continue to pursue development of a greenfield spodumene conversion plant of approximately another 40,000 metric tons a year so that we can fully utilize the Talison resources over time.
Full utilization of the Talison resources, combined with the additional capacity we expect to add in Chile once the new quota is finalized, will allow us to achieve roughly 160,000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate equivalent production capacity by the beginning of the next decade. Based on current demand projections, we believe we will fully utilize that capacity by the early to mid-2020s. At that point, our assets in Chile and Australia will have many years of useful life remaining. But as of now, we do not believe further expansions are likely. 
Therefore, to meet the expected market growth path to early 2020s, we will need new resources. The agreement with Bolland Minera S.A. that we announced in the third quarter is a positive step in that direction. This agreement gives us exclusive exploration and acquisition rights to a lithium reserve in Antofalla in the Catamarca Province of Argentina. Based on existing data, we believe this resource will be certified as the largest lithium resource in Argentina. Given the development cycle to commercialize a new resource, we must begin investing now to bring new resources on line by the early to mid-2020s. Our very preliminary evaluation on the Antofalla resource is encouraging. But you can expect it to take 1 to 2 years for us to make a decision on commercial viability. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."

In the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of 26% compared to third quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested mineral",1055,"Thanks, Luke, and good morning. In the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of 26% compared to third quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested minerals and metal sulfides businesses. The increase was driven primarily by core business growth and a lower effective tax rate compared to 2015. 
Our corporate costs in the quarter increased, driven by increased compensation costs and some one-time costs related to relocations and legal settlements. As a result, our corporate costs for the full year will likely range between $85 million and $90 million. There was no change in our estimated 2016 effective tax rate in the third quarter from the second quarter. Excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items, we continue to expect the 2016 ETR to be about 19%.
We continue to expect D&A in 2016 of $185 million to $200 million with 2016 capital expenditures now expected to be $175 million to $185 million, down from an estimate of $185 million to $200 million at the end of the second quarter. We are not slowing any of our projects. The decline is simply a result of changes in the timing of spending and improved capital efficiency versus our prior estimate.
Operating working capital remained at 29% of sales at the end of the third quarter. Strong sales in our Refining Solutions business at the end of the quarter, especially in Clean Fuels Technologies, drove an increase in accounts receivables. We also saw an increase in Refining Solutions inventories in the quarter. Forecasted demand in clean fuels in the first half of 2017 will necessitate further inventory growth in the fourth quarter to manage production for those expected sales. As such, our working capital is likely to remain in the 28% to 29% range at the end of 2016. 
Through the end of the third quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, including contribution from discontinued operations, was $415 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures but excludes one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs. Free cash flow, including those one-time costs, were $325 million through September, nearly double the cash flow generated last year in the same period.
Before I turn to our core business unit performance, let me briefly update you on our Fine Chemistry Services business. Sales and adjusted EBITDA improved in the third quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. However, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, this business faces tough comparisons. Fine Chemistry Services made all of its total 2015 adjusted EBITDA, over $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we only expect break-even performance due to contract timing.
Moving on to our core businesses. Let's start with Lithium and Advanced Materials. Third quarter net sales were $240 million with adjusted EBITDA of $92 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 38%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, net sales were up 15%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 18%. 
The Lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. The third quarter net sales were up 30% and adjusted EBITDA up 32% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 41% were consistent with our guidance. And this is the seventh consecutive quarter with margins above 40%. 
Overall, volume grew in the quarter by 13% and pricing improved by 16%. We saw continued strong pricing momentum in our battery-grade products and price increases in technical-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide as well. As in the second quarter, volume growth was driven by increased tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and hydroxide. As a reminder, these results include a negative impact from year-over-year potash pricing, which we continue to forecast at $7 million for all of 2016.
PCS performance was in line with our expectations with net sales down just over $6 million and adjusted EBITDA down $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Impact from the Sun Edison bankruptcy and pricing pressure in our organometallics product lines drove the lower results. Our full year expectations are unchanged with PCS adjusted EBITDA likely to be down by about $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015. 
Bromine Specialties also performed as expected with third quarter net sales of $194 million and adjusted EBITDA of $52 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 27%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 2% with adjusted EBITDA down 12%. Adjusted EBITDA and margins were impacted by negative pricing and mix, lower completion fluids volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and Europe, lower volumes in certain flame retardants and reduced demand for agricultural intermediates. Consistent with prior guidance, we continue to expect the business to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance despite a $15 million year-over-year headwind due to the loss of a methyl bromide contract at the end of 2015. 
Refining Solutions reported third quarter net sales of $190 million and adjusted EBITDA of $65 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 3% and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. As expected, Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts was down year-on-year as refiners made small operating adjustments for higher-than-normal gasoline inventory in the United States. 
Also while our full year expectations for Heavy Oil Upgrading are unchanged, that is we continue to expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA to be very similar to 2015, this business faces difficult comparisons in the second half of 2016 due to the very strong sales in the second half of 2015. Volume in 2016 has been more evenly spread across the quarters while volume in 2015 was back end-loaded due to both turnarounds and competitive trials at our customer base in the first half of 2015.
Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalysts results were strong as expected with improved sales and adjusted EBITDA driven by increased volume and a more favorable product mix. Overall, Refining Solutions continues to exceed our expectations at the start of 2016 with full year adjusted EBITDA now likely to be up close to 20% versus 2015.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke to update our view on the year."

In the third quarter, we continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth in our businesses. Growth in Lithium and Refining Solutions again led the way with the remaining businesses meeting our expectations coming into the quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect the Lithium business to continue its trend of strong year-over-year EBITDA growth. However, we are forecasting relatively flat year-over-year performance for Refining Solutions, Bromine Specialties and PCS. As Scott already noted, our Fine Chemistry Services business had a strong fourth quarter in 2015 with over $17 million of adjusted EBITDA while we expect a break-even fourth quarter for that business in 2016, which will impact our year-over-year comps.
Still in total, our view of 2016 continues to improve. We are adjusting our full year 2016 forecast upward with net sales expected to range between $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $725 million and $745 million and adjusted EPS between $3.45 and $3.55 per share. 
We remain on track to complete the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF before the end of 2016. All regulatory filings are complete and several more jurisdictions, including the European Union, have cleared the transaction. Once closed, we will begin implementation of a deleveraging plan that will allow us to achieve our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x in early 2017.
We are very pleased with our performance to date in 2016. Our businesses have delivered impressive core EBITDA growth and we have made much progress on our strategic objectives as well. While as expected, the fourth quarter of 2016 will be softer than our first 3 quarters, this does not mean a weakening in our outlook for 2017. We believe we have positioned the company for outstanding performance in 2017. Our budgeting process is well underway. And we are very confident that our high-growth Lithium business will drive another strong year of earnings growth for Albemarle."

There's no contest to that. So the environmental permits are not an issue at all down there. And we have sufficient brine to produce over 80,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent per year down there. The CORFO agreement, there was -- CCHEN is going through that process. The nuclear agency is in discussions down there. And I expect at a high level, we're going to get that agreement done by the end of the year.

How does going into longer-term contracts for Lithium impact your ability to dictate price? And then as a follow-up, for the overall lithium market, how have things changed since your Lithium Day almost 2 years ago in terms of overall demand expectations? I think at that point, you were expecting the market to grow about 20,000 metric tons per year with the goal of capturing half that demand. Has that increased at all as more players are bringing on additional capacity. So any commentary you can provide will be greatly appreciated."

Our demand model still remains the same as what we communicated at the last Lithium Day. So just simply put, we think that the overall market is growing at about 20,000 metric tons per year through the 2020 time period. The total market is about 185,000, 190,000 metric tons. So we've seen that demand forecast play out. We're updating that demand forecast and we'll communicate that at the Investor Day in the first quarter. With regard to long-term agreements and how does that impact our ability to price product, of course, we are having those critical conversations with customers where we do need the flexibility to adjust price, but we want to treat customers fairly. So there are provisions in our agreements that allow us to adjust price as appropriate and also give the customer an opportunity to look at the market if they so choose to do that. But I think the important thing is that we're being -- we're committing a long-term agreement, allow the customers to invest in the energy storage market because they know that they have a partnership with a company like Albemarle that has the ability to invest and supply them. And I think as Luke outlined in the opening comments, when we said during the Lithium Day that the overall market is growing at 20,000 metric tons per year and we're going to invest to supply half of that, I think you've seen, through the tolling, through the acquisitions of the China conversion technology, the expansion of our mine in Australia, what we're doing in Chile, how we're expanding the capacity in Chile, that we have invested and will continue to invest to be able to supply at least 10,000 metric tons per year. We've done it this year. We'll do it next year. And I think we've given you guys the path to see that we can deliver on our promises. And that is going a long way with the customers. I mean, as I said, we have very long and deep relationships with these customers. They appreciate it. They appreciate being with a market leader like Albemarle. And we're going to treat each other fairly going forward."

So some of the commentary about your contracts with lithium customers got at my question but really has to do with strategy. And Luke, you emphasized the strategy being establishing a sustainable, winning business into the -- really into the foreseeable future. And I think if you look back a couple of years, even some skeptical investors then would acknowledge that this has been working. And then the most recent portfolio changes, where you've become even a more concentrated play on lithium, the question is, as you've done that, there are some seasoned investors who are taking a step back, looking a little bit more skeptically saying, ""Hey, this has -- they're looking for setting up to be one of these classic boom-bust cycle in lithium. And I don't really hear a lot of that. I mean, a lot of the discussion is about trying to keep up with demand into the foreseeable future. So I'm just wondering if you could just share with us how you think about that risk, that cyclical risk, over time and if there's anything that can be done in your strategic approach with your customers to mitigate that risk looking forward."

So obviously, that's a lot of discussion that we have with the investors, when we go out and meet with them as well as the Board of Directors, in what our concentration is and how do we maintain that growth in profitability going forward. If you look at what we're trying to do, we're really -- it's a couple-pronged approach. One, we want to be -- have access to the best resources in the world. That allows us to drive our cost down. So if you get to a boom-bust, we're still going to be the winners in this industry because low cost always wins, right? Secondly, what we're doing is we're working very hard to have the capability to expand to meet that market demand but doing it in a phased approach so that we can continuously monitor the supply/demand situation to understand when we bring on -- what portions of a capacity expansion that we bring on. And third and importantly, we're entering into long-term agreements with our major customers that gives us line of sight into their demand forecast going forward. And so that we want to make sure we have their views on what their demand is, so we can meet that demand in a timely fashion. And they are very interested, ensuring they have accurate and quality production to meet that demand. So it's a lot of great conversation. So if you've got the resource side, you've got the technology side, you've got the financial wherewithal to bring that online in a way in increments that make sense for the market demand and you're in strategic relationships with the customers who are going to be winners in this industry going forward, that's the way you protect yourself and really drive shareholder value in a market such as this. Go ahead, John."

Our view on supply/demand is that it will remain in balance through 2020. Beyond 2020, none of us has a crystal ball in terms of exactly what the inflection points will look like in terms of easy adoption and who will actually figure out how to build capacity the right way. But one thing, I think, we have a high degree of confidence on is anyone that has built any kind of large-scale chemical plant understands this. It's one thing to announce a project, it's another thing to actually build it, commercialize it, qualify it, et cetera. And if you just look at what it takes to bring on capacity, we have hundreds of engineers and scientists working as fast as they can on our projects. But if you look at the marketplace and what it takes to bring on this capacity, I think you'll find some comfort in our prediction that the market will stay in balance through 2020."

So they've done a good job at cost. And looking at opportunities, remember, we have the fluctuation to move production in some respects between Jordan and Magnolia.
