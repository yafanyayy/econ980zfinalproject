Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter call. In today's call, I'll highlight unusual items in the quarter and importantly, I'll provide an update on our progress in executing on our strategic plan, which we presented on January 26. 
We and the board feel that our plan maximizes franchise value for all stakeholders and is based on achievable goals. This quarter is a further step in providing additional transparency to assess our progress towards our goals. 
Before I comment on the quarter, I want to mention yesterday's news that our Board of Directors agreed to expand the size of AIG's board from 14 to 16 seats. We believe this resolution is in the best interests of all our stakeholders and most importantly, allows us to focus on executing our strategic plan. 
Our fourth quarter results were impacted by our actions to strengthen reserves and the lower returns on alternative investments. As we've previously disclosed, we completed a number of in-depth reserve reviews of our long-term lines and we responded quickly to new information. 
As part of our strategic plan, we announced our intentions to reduce and narrow our hedge fund allocation, which we believe will lead to greater risk-adjusted returns and contribute to our $25 billion return of capital through 2017. 
During the fourth quarter, we took a number of actions towards our goal of being a more streamlined, focused insurer. Importantly, I announced a smaller executive leadership team, a management structure that has resulted in increased accountability across our businesses and accelerated our decision-making. This team is already executing on our strategic plan and today, you'll hear from some of them directly. 
Core to our strategic plan are the organizational changes, strategic actions and operating improvements, which we presented on January 26. 
On the organizational front, the adoption of a modular approach to our business and the creation of our Legacy Portfolio are important steps to improving transparency into the performance of our Operating Portfolio. In the quarter, we announced the sale of PICC shares and took additional actions to monetize Legacy Portfolio assets, which Sid will speak to. We're well on our way to achieving the targeted $9 billion in legacy capital released by 2017. 
The fourth quarter strategic actions are the foundations of the $25 billion of capital return that we expect over the next 2 years. For the full year 2015, we returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders and we expect a similar pace to continue. 
Yesterday's announced additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and 14% increase in our dividend is consistent with the path towards returning the $25 billion over 2 years, or over 1/3 of our market capitalization. 
We also announced the sale of our Advisor Group, which we should expect to close in the second quarter and plan for an IPO of a portion of our interest in UGC. UGC is the market leader in the mortgage insurance industry. 
Finally, we are aggressively pursuing operating performance improvements and you'll see that our progress on operating expense reduction supports our conviction in achieving $1.6 billion in gross operating expense reductions through the end of 2017. Today, we will also provide additional insight into our actions to improve our Commercial Property and casualty accident year loss ratio. 
On Slide 4, we've reaffirmed the targets that we discussed in January and the year ago. We stand by our plan and look forward to sharing our progress with you on an ongoing basis. 
Before Sid begins his remarks on the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the great contribution that David Herzog has made to AIG. David has devoted the last 16 years to the company and was essential to our emerging through the financial and positions the company for its continued future success. His guidance and stewardship of our financials continues to be highly valued and he'll be missed by many here at the company. Sid, will now provide with the financial highlights of the quarter."

This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress made on our expense initiatives, our continued active capital management and certain strategic actions impacting 2016 results. Turning to",1153,"Thank you, Peter and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress made on our expense initiatives, our continued active capital management and certain strategic actions impacting 2016 results. 
Turning to Slide 5. As Peter stated, the fourth quarter operating loss per share of $1.10 was primarily due to the reserve strengthening and [indiscernible] returns in both the Commercial and Consumer segments. 
As I stated on the January 26 call, we believe our reserving actions this quarter will help mitigate the risk of future volatility around our best estimate. 
The reserve strengthening in accident years 2011 through '14 was driven by greater actual versus expected loss emergence from primary and excess auto liability, health care and Financial Lines. The impact of revised tail factors based on emergence in earlier accident years also contributed to the adverse development for excess Specialty and Financial Lines. Of note, the Financial Lines remains well above our current profitability targets. 
Our reported operating tax rate for the quarter was just shy of 39% due to the pretax operating loss and the impact of other discrete tax items reducing our tax expense. We expect our operating effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 32%.
Turning to Slide 6. Total general operating expenses declined 6% in the quarter and 3% for the full year on a constant dollar basis, a rate that is expected to accelerate under our current strategic plan. 
Included in our 2015 results are approximately $145 million of expenses related to the acquisition of 4 companies in the calendar year, offset by approximately $125 million, representing the nonrecurring portion of the pension curtailment gains. 
In addition, we recognized another $222 million in pretax nonoperating restructuring charges in the quarter, $123 million of which relates to the restructuring charge we announced in the third quarter of this year. The remaining $99 million relates to new actions, primarily for additional staff reductions that will results in at least another $200 million reduction in our annual expense run rate. 
Taken together, the actions announced in the third and fourth quarters this year will reduce our annual expense run rate by approximately $700 million to $800 million. We anticipate that we will achieve the majority of these savings by the second half of 2016. These actions, along with other initiatives we are undertaking, gives us confidence we will achieve our $1.4 billion net reduction by 2017.
Slide 7 shows our continued execution against our capital management targets. During the quarter, we deployed over $3.2 billion towards the purchase of approximately 53 million common shares. This year, we've purchased an additional $2.5 billion of common shares through February 11. This leaves about $800 million unused against under the $3 billion authorization that we announced in December, plus an additional $5 billion from the new authorization that Peter referenced. We also announced an increase in our dividend of 14%, which is consistent with our positive view of sustainable profitability. 
From the standpoint of total capital return to shareholders, our annual dividend payment is approximately $1.5 billion based on our current outstanding shares and that amount is included in the $25 billion in capital return we discussed in our strategic update. 
At year-end, we had $9.2 billion of current liquidity, as you can see on Slide 8. While we manage our liquidity within a target range of $6 billion to $8 billion, we maybe slightly higher or lower from this range from time to time. 
Cash inflows from the insurance subsidiaries during the quarter were approximately $400 million, reflecting our annual fourth quarter true-up of tax-sharing payments. 
As we said at the strategy update call, we expect $7 billion to $10 billion in dividends and tax-sharing payments over the next 2 years, which are net of parent and interest expense and the $2.9 billion capital contribution made to the PC subsidiaries in January. 
Slide 9 depicts the composition of our Legacy Portfolio. As we said in our strategic update call, we are creating a Legacy Portfolio, which contains roughly 1/4 of the company's total equity. Legacy will consist of actively manage runoff businesses or noncore assets and liabilities that we are targeting for maximum value. Our actions as they pertain to the Legacy Portfolio focus on how quickly we can extract capital by either divestitures, reinsurance or other efficient runoff methods without giving away too much value. 
In the fourth quarter, we monetized $2.1 billion of Legacy Portfolio assets, including a portion of our stake in PICC, which we previously disclosed and certain DIB assets, as well as some internal sales of assets to our insurance businesses. Legacy Portfolio capital declined $5 billion in the quarter to approximately $17 billion, driven by the $3.6 billion of buybacks and dividends in the quarter, which were partially funded by the monetization of legacy assets. The reduction in Legacy Portfolio capital was also impacted by the additional NOLs created during the quarter, largely as a result of the reserve strengthening we previously announced. 
Slide 10 presents the composition of our deferred tax assets. During the year, we utilized about $600 million of foreign tax benefits. NOLs increased by roughly $1 billion, also primarily as a result of the reserve strengthening we mentioned before.
Finally, I would like to cover 2 of the strategic actions that will impact our earnings in 2016. The first is our planned life reinsurance transactions, which are intended to address the approximately 40% of redundant reserves in our U.S. life companies that have not already been finance. We expect these transactions will optimize our capital and generate $4 billion to $5 billion of additional liquidity to a parent through a combination of dividends and tax-sharing payments. This will also result in annual reduction in net investment income of approximately $200 million to $250 million beginning in 2017. There will be only a modest impact to net investment income in 2016 as transactions are being finalized. 
Secondly, we are reallocating roughly 50% of our hedge fund portfolios, as Peter mentioned, primarily into investment-grade bonds and commercial mortgage loans, which we delivered free up about $2 billion in additional capital from the allocation to lower capital charge assets. If we assumed a 9% normalized return, this would result in approximately $200 million decline in annual net investment income in 2016, net of our reinvestments. This would occur over the course of several quarters.
The net investment income reductions from both of these transactions were reflected in the Commercial and Consumer targets that we provided in our January 26 strategy update presentation. 
We look forward to delivering on our strategic plan that we outlined in January and provide you with additional disclosure by 2016 year end. We remain confident in our plan to deliver $25 billion to shareholders over the next 2 years and our continued operating improvements. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Today, I will discuss the Commercial Insurance segment's quarterly results, our strategic priorities and the actions we're taking to improve operating performance. On Slide 12. The fourth quarter Commercial Property casualty accident los",1157,"Thank you, Sid. Today, I will discuss the Commercial Insurance segment's quarterly results, our strategic priorities and the actions we're taking to improve operating performance. 
On Slide 12. The fourth quarter Commercial Property casualty accident loss ratio as adjusted was 66.4%, an increase of 0.5 point from the prior year quarter, driven by higher severe losses in property. Increased loss in the U.S, including in tracking other segments of commercial auto, also contributed to the higher adjusted accident loss ratio. 
The fourth quarter expense ratio of 28.6% reflected an increase in commission rates and property, partially offset by net improvements in general operating expenses. Net premiums written grew 1.5% after adjusting for foreign exchange. We continue to improve our portfolio mix and grow in areas that meets our targeted ROE.
In the quarter, large limit and middle market properties and segments of our program business continue to grow. We also benefited from fee incomes from NSM, a leading U.S. managing general agent acquired by AIG in April of 2015. 
Overall rate change declined by nearly 1 point in the quarter driven by consent pressure in Property, particularly in the U.S. DNS business. U.S. casualty rates increased by 3%, reflecting margin improvement in line subject to remediation. Rates were essentially flat in Specialty and Financial Lines. 
We see profitable growth opportunities in multinational, Financial Lines, Property upper middle market and major account segment that utilize our risk engineering capabilities, international casualty and areas of emerging risks, such as cyber and M&A insurance. We're also excited about providing clients with best-in-class claims expertise, risk services and analytic capabilities that will strengthen our relationships. These include expanded teams of engineers to analyze and mitigate risks, innovations from our partnership with [indiscernible] University, and investments in companies like human condition safety who's wearable devices can help workers avoidance serious injuries. The breadth of the AIG franchise and the strength of our client relationships position us well to capitalize on new opportunities and current market disruption from some of our competitors. 
With respect to UGC, our CEO, Donna and her team delivered another quarter of increasing profitability. The strength of UGC's business is evident in the default rate that was last seen in 2006. 
For the full year, UGC had a record first lean new insurance written of over $50 billion and pretax operating income of $644 million. The private mortgage insurer eligibility rules the asset test came into effect in December 2015, and I'm pleased to report that UGC will exceed the requirement by approximately 20%.
During our January 26 strategy update call, we announced specific actions to improve Commercial performance that will reduce the accident loss ratio as adjusted by 6 points. On Slide 13, the green line shows that accident loss ratio improvement of almost 11 points in 2011, including the effective prior year development for all of those accident years. 
Following significant progress between 2011 and 2013, our trend rate slowed in 2014 and 2015, but during that time, we made some imported investments in our underwriting tools and analytics.
The bars in the chart highlight the change in business mix as we reduced writings in poorer performing areas of U.S. Casualty from 39% of our portfolio in 2011 to 27% in 2015. In 2016 and 2017, we will continue to focus on improving the portfolio mix and we will accelerate the use of underwriting tools and analytics capabilities developed over the past few years. One of the benefits of AIG's recent organizational changes will be to increase agility and speed the adoption of these tools. 
Slide 14 shows the dispersion of the adjusted accident loss ratio excluding catastrophes of each sub-segment that comprises our $20 billion of net premiums earned in 2015. The loss ratio's range from as low as 30% to about 100% for a handful of subsegments. This illustrates a very important point, we do not need to improve each and every subsegment of our $20 billion portfolio by 6 points in order to achieve our target, rather focusing on our best and worst performing areas will significantly contribute to improved performance. We intent to grow the 15% of the Commercial portfolio included within products that won. It includes the lowest loss ratio businesses, which ran at an average of approximately 41%. We will focus our resources on expanding our presence in the many products and geographies within this product set where we have strong competitive advantages and offer a compelling value proposition. We'll maintain or improve the business captured in product set 2, which represents 70% of total premiums with an average accident loss ratio of approximately 66%.
This is the product set that will benefit the most from the underwriting tools and data analytics I mentioned earlier. For the highest loss ratio subsegments, which are predominantly in U.S. Casualty, we intend to expand our use of quota share reinsurance. The effect will be an improved Commercial loss ratio, release of statutory capital and a higher return on equity. We will remediate product set 3 where the remaining 15% of the Commercial portfolio ran at an average accident loss rate ratio of approximately 91%. This is where we will narrow our focus through strategic exits and remediation.
We already begun taking actions on some of these subsegment in the second half of 2015 and expect to be seeing benefits from these actions in the first half of 2016. Earlier this month, we announced and communicated to our distribution partners the exit of 4 specific high loss ratio areas within U.S. Casualty, which include certain subsegments of health care and Commercial auto that Sid mentioned earlier following our fourth quarter reserve study. We expect to see these benefits beginning in the second half of 2016 and extending through 2017. 
I would note that the majority of the businesses we're remediating in the U.S. will renew relatively evenly throughout the remainder of the year. We will, of course, provide proper notice in compliance with the relevant regulatory rules and communicate with our clients well in advance of these actions.
We believe these levers provide a clear path for achieving the targeted accident loss ratio by year end of 2017. Our strategy is to be targeted using micro-segmentation tools, narrowing our focus to significantly differentiate between products, geographies, clients and distribution channels based on value. 
With respect to underperforming 1 or 2 product accounts, you can expect to see dramatic reductions as we move forward. Our goal is to be our clients most valued insurer and we're focused on clients where we can deliver the most value and grow profitably. 
In closing, Commercial strategy is clear, focused and on pace. While there's a lot of work to do, I'm confident in our strategic plan and our ability to execute. 
Finally, the Commercial leadership team and I are 100% committed to achieving the planned we've outside. 
Thank you. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

This morning, I will discuss our Consumer businesses operating performance, provide an update on DOL's proposed regulations and provide an update on Japan. Beginning with Retirement on Slide 17, as Sid highlighted",805,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our Consumer businesses operating performance, provide an update on DOL's proposed regulations and provide an update on Japan. 
Beginning with Retirement on Slide 17, as Sid highlighted earlier. Lower alternative investment returns, combined with lower base portfolio income, contributed to the decline in pretax operating income. We continue to expect base yields to decline 2 to 4 basis points per quarter on a normalized basis in 2016 based on the current interest rate environment. 
Sales growth was strong from a year ago, particularly in Index Annuities and Fixed Annuities. We are seeing index annuity growth through all of our channels, particularly with independent agents and expanded wholesaling in banks, broker dealers and advisers. 
Fixed Annuities growth was driven by higher interest rates and credit spreads in the latter portion of 2015. 
Retirement net flows improved both sequentially and versus a year-ago due largely to continued positive flows for Retirement Income Solutions and a decline in Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement surrenders. 
Despite a challenging environment, we believe our product and distribution diversity allow for continued positive net flows overall. 
I would like to provide an update on the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations with respect to plans and IRAs. The version of the proposed regulations, which was advanced to the office of management and budget at the end of January, has not been made public. The final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. We remain focused on preparing for its implementation with respect to product development, distribution support, compliance, service and administration. We are in active discussions with our distribution partners to be in the best position possible to meet the evolving needs of the Retirement savers. Through Group Retirement, Fixed Annuities, Index Annuities and variable annuities, we will offer a broad product portfolio to meet the growing needs of consumers for guaranteed lifetime income and other saving solutions. 
Slide 19 presents results for our global Life business. In Life, our new business is already achieved our targeted returns. As Sid mentioned, we are executing on plans to finance our remaining redundant returns with a series of reinsurance transactions that will improve the returns in that portfolio and allow for increased distributions to parent.
We are also executive on a plan for our Life business to narrow our distributional and product focus, including greater specialization, which will result in reduced distribution expenses. Examples of this enhanced emphasis include a greater focus on independent distribution channels with a significant reduction we made in January to our life career your agency force and a narrowing of our product focus at our group benefits business to profitable lines where we have a competitive advantage. 
Turning to Slide 20. Personal Insurance delivered strong growth in new business in the Private Client Group in Japan Property and automobile across all regions. However, there were a number of items that resulted in an increase in accident loss losses. 
During the fourth quarter, we strengthened reserves for Accident and Health as a result of our normal annual review. We saw unsatisfactory performance in some European warranty service programs leading to remedial actions, including contract cancellations and we realized higher auto losses in a number of European countries that are already targeted for exit. 
We continue to move forward with our work in Japan and are preparing for the merger of Fuji Fire and Marine and legal entities. At the same time, we have successfully grown our personal auto business, which grew year-over-year for the first time in over 10 years. Our onetime merger-related expenses were roughly $100 million this year, largely comparable to last year and we further expect onetime expense expenses to peak in 2016 at a slightly higher level is be prepared to enter premerger status. The subsequent legal merger were approved by the authorities will bring to a close the integration of Fuji Fire and Marine, which we acquired in 2011.
I would like to briefly comment as well that our plan to deliver $800 million of pretax operating income improvement by 2017. We expect that much of this improvement will be achieved through significant expense reductions for each of the Consumer businesses, which are part of AIG's firm-wide GOE targets. The largest reductions will be in the Personal Insurance business and U.S. distribution. We expect that these benefits will be partially offset by lower net investment income from hedge fund reallocations as well as from lower invested asset base, resulting from the distributions to the parent company. 
To close, we remain focused on achieving profitable growth across our Consumer business and effectively managing risks by executing our customer-focused strategies, maintaining a prudent risk profile and targeting capital-efficient growth opportunities.

So actions were being taken in 2015, which will see beginning in the first part of 2016. The second thing I want to say is regarding use of reinsurance, I know there's a lot of question about. The first thing I want to say long-term sustainable strategy to be looking to arbitrage our reinsurers. That's not the strategy here. We're Partners with our reinsurers and we see many opportunities for our reinsurance strategy to benefit AIG as well as last the reinsurers. I think there's 3 key points I'd like to make regarding how this work with the reinsurers. First, you should now, I think the reinsurers have an increasingly favorable view about the quality of the data and the quality of our underwriting. Second, the reinsurers themselves, receive significant diversification benefits in their capital models, which make business like our U.S. Casualty business more attractive for them. And third, the longtailed nature of our U.S. Casualty business, for example, gives the reinsurers gives a significant deal of flexibility in their investment allocation decisions, which might differ from the way AIG might choose to structure its investment portfolio. I would say, most of our actions will be with the reinsurers in product set 2 and it will be on the higher end of the loss ratios and product set 2, which is where the U.S. Casualty business sits. The reinsurance will change, of course, our mix of business because if you reduce the amount of business in product set 2 that is U.S. Casualty, the range and loss ratios in and product set 2 is pretty wide, it ranges from as low as the low-50s to as high as the 80s. And so therefore, you'll get a lot of benefit from reinsuring the U.S. Casualty business, which is higher loss ratio business in product set 2."

We're proceeding right now, through the integration and regression testing of about 110 systems. And there has been a new regulatory requirement for a change in the earthquake property rates. And if you can imagine whilst we're trying to do the regression testing till to stop, open up the systems, introduce those new earthquake rates and then go back to integration and regression test and that's essentially what's pushed us back 6 months or so in terms of the expectation of the integration date. And our strategy is in fact is to try to advance as many benefits from the work we have already done in recognition of the fact that we can do so. And examples of that are our ability to recently change our direct marketing strategy and move that away from American Home legal entity and into Fuji Life and the other companies, which will generate further savings that we can now realize. And if so, outside of Japan, what I can say is, when we do the strategic update, we did mention about at the footprint strategy. And many of our Consumer businesses are vestiges from the days when AIG had a multiple financial services presence. For example, in Poland, a number of years ago, we had a Consumer finance company, we had a Life business, we had credit card company and it's a natural expansion of those customer bases and distribution revision channels to build then Consumer Property Casualty business. But as we've divested away from those, we now have expense overhangs and we have subscale operations in quite a few territories. And the reason why we're moving to a focus on our individual business and 15 territories in our group business and our multinational clients and 35 territories going forward, is to address that expense overhang, and that's primarily been the performance issue and much of the non-Japan part of the international portfolio. We do, of course, have some other portfolio, which is like the European warranty business, which we address from time to time. But our loss ratios are generally sustainable and competitive.

With respect to the drivers, I would say to you, first, that's each part of our business, Property, casualty, specialty and Financial Lines plays a part. Obviously, the remediation role for Property are quite casualty significant, whereas the opportunity for growth in strategic areas, particularly for Financial Lines and for some of our Specialty products. With respect to which actions will drive it, it's reasonably evenly mixed between what I would call reinsurance and business mix. Strategic growth in some of the lies I just described where we have opportunities and our loss ratios and our competitive advantages allow us to succeed in the marketplace. And then a contribution, of course, from exits that have already been announced and our work on risk selection and client selection. So I might just say think of it as 3 basic buckets, strategic growth, reinsurance of business mix, exits/client and risk selection has been reasonably equal in terms of their relative contributions."

And since we've acquired Fuji Fire and Marine, we've brought there loss ratio and personal accident business by 9 full points and our automobiles down by 5 full points.

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter call. In today's call, I'll highlight unusual items in the quarter and importantly, I'll provide an update on our progress in executing on our strategic plan, which we presented on January 26. 
We and the board feel that our plan maximizes franchise value for all stakeholders and is based on achievable goals. This quarter is a further step in providing additional transparency to assess our progress towards our goals. 
Before I comment on the quarter, I want to mention yesterday's news that our Board of Directors agreed to expand the size of AIG's board from 14 to 16 seats. We believe this resolution is in the best interest of all our stakeholders and most importantly, allows us to focus on executing our strategic plan. 
Our fourth quarter results were impacted by our actions to strengthen reserves and the lower returns on alternative investments. As we have previously disclosed, we completed a number of in-depth reserve reviews of our long-tail lines and we responded quickly to new information. 
As part of our strategic plan, we announced our intentions to reduce and narrow our hedge fund allocation, which we believe will lead to greater risk-adjusted returns and contribute to our $25 billion return of capital through 2017. 
During the fourth quarter, we took a number of actions towards our goal of being a more streamlined, focused insurer. Importantly, I announced a smaller executive leadership team, a management structure that has already resulted in increased accountability across our businesses and accelerated our decision making. This team is already executing on our strategic plan and today, you'll hear from some of them directly. 
Core to our strategic plan are the organizational changes, strategic actions and operating improvements, which we presented on January 26. 
On the organizational front, the adoption of a modular approach to our business and the creation of our Legacy Portfolio are important steps to improving transparency into the performance of our Operating Portfolio. In the quarter, we announced the sale of PICC shares and took additional actions to monetize Legacy Portfolio assets, which Sid will speak to. We're well on our way to achieving the targeted $9 billion in legacy capital released by 2017. 
The fourth quarter strategic actions are the foundations of the $25 billion of capital return that we expect over the next 2 years. For the full year 2015, we returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders and we expect a similar pace to continue. 
Yesterday's announced additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and 14% increase in our dividend is consistent with the path towards returning the $25 billion over 2 years, or over 1/3 of our market capitalization. 
We also announced the sale of our Advisor Group, which we expect to close in the second quarter; and plans for an IPO of a portion of our interest in UGC. UGC is the market leader in the mortgage insurance industry. 
Finally, we are aggressively pursuing operating performance improvements, and you'll see that our progress on operating expense reduction supports our conviction in achieving $1.6 billion in gross operating expense reductions through the end of 2017. Today, we will also provide additional insight into our actions to improve our commercial Property and Casualty accident year loss ratio. 
On Slide 4, we reaffirm the targets that we discussed in January and the year ago. We stand by our plan and look forward to sharing our progress with you on an ongoing basis. 
Before Sid begins his remarks on the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the great contribution that David Herzog has made to AIG. David has devoted the last 16 years to the company, and was essential to our emerging through the financial crisis and positions the company for its continued future success. His guidance and stewardship of our financials continues to be highly valued, and he'll be missed by many here at the company. 
Sid will now provide you with the financial highlights of the quarter."

This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress made on our expense initiatives, our continued active capital management and certain strategic actions impacting 2016 results. Turning to",1158,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress made on our expense initiatives, our continued active capital management and certain strategic actions impacting 2016 results. 
Turning to Slide 5. As Peter stated, the fourth quarter operating loss per share of $1.10 was primarily due to the reserve strengthening and weaker alternative returns in both the Commercial and Consumer segments. 
As I stated on the January 26 call, we believe our reserving actions this quarter will help mitigate the risk of future volatility around our best estimate. 
The reserve strengthening in accident years 2011 through '14 was driven by greater actual versus expected loss emergence for primary and excess auto liability, health care and Financial Lines. The impact of revised tail factors based on emergence in earlier accident years also contributed to the adverse development for excess Casualty and Financial Lines. Of note, Financial Lines remains well above our current profitability targets. 
Our reported operating tax rate for the quarter was just shy of 39% due to the pretax operating loss and the impact of other discrete tax items reducing our tax expense. We expect our operating effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 32%.
Turning to Slide 6. Total general operating expenses declined 6% in the quarter and 3% for the full year on a constant dollar basis, a rate that is expected to accelerate under our current strategic plan. 
Included in our 2015 results are approximately $145 million of expenses related to the acquisition of 4 companies in the calendar year, offset by approximately $125 million, representing the nonrecurring portion of the pension curtailment gain. 
In addition, we recognized another $222 million in pretax nonoperating restructuring charges in the quarter, $123 million of which relates to the restructuring charge we announced in the third quarter of this year. The remaining $99 million relates to new actions, primarily for additional staff reductions that will result in at least another $200 million reduction in our annual expense run rate. 
Taken together, the actions announced in the third and fourth quarters of this year will reduce our annual expense run rate by approximately $700 million to $800 million. We anticipate that we will achieve the majority of these savings by the second half of 2016. These actions, along with other initiatives we are undertaking, give us confidence we will achieve our $1.4 billion net reduction by 2017.
Slide 7 shows our continued execution against our capital management targets. During the quarter, we deployed over $3.2 billion towards the purchase of approximately 53 million common shares. This year, we have purchased an additional $2.5 billion of common shares through February 11. This leaves about $800 million unused against under the $3 billion authorization that we announced in December, plus an additional $5 billion from the new authorization that Peter referenced. We also announced an increase in our dividend of 14%, which is consistent with our positive view of sustainable profitability. 
From the standpoint of total capital return to shareholders, our annual dividend payment is approximately $1.5 billion based on our current outstanding shares, and that amount is included in the $25 billion in capital return we discussed in our strategic update. 
At year-end, we had $9.2 billion of parent liquidity, as you can see on Slide 8. While we manage our liquidity within a target range of $6 billion to $8 billion, we may be slightly higher or lower from this range from time to time. 
Cash inflows from the insurance subsidiaries during the quarter were approximately $400 million, reflecting our annual fourth quarter true-up of tax-sharing payments. 
As we said at the strategy update call, we expect $7 billion to $10 billion in dividends and tax-sharing payments over the next 2 years, which are net of parent and interest expense and the $2.9 billion capital contribution made to the PC subsidiaries in January. 
Slide 9 depicts the composition of our Legacy Portfolio. As we said in our strategic update call, we are creating a Legacy Portfolio which contains roughly 1/4 of the company's total equity. Legacy will consist of actively managed run-off businesses or noncore assets and liabilities that we are targeting for maximum value. Our actions as they pertain to the Legacy Portfolio focus on how quickly we can extract capital by either divestitures, reinsurance or other efficient run-off methods, without giving away too much value. 
In the fourth quarter, we monetized $2.1 billion of Legacy Portfolio assets, including a portion of our stake in PICC, which we've previously disclosed, and certain DIB assets as well as some internal sales of assets to our Insurance businesses. Legacy Portfolio capital declined $5 billion in the quarter to approximately $17 billion, driven by the $3.6 billion of buybacks and dividends in the quarter, which were partially funded by the monetization of legacy assets. The reduction in Legacy Portfolio capital was also impacted by the additional NOLs created during the quarter, largely as a result of the reserve strengthening we previously announced. 
Slide 10 presents the composition of our deferred tax assets. During the year, we utilized about $600 million of foreign tax credits. NOLs increased by roughly $1 billion, also primarily as a result of the reserve strengthening we mentioned before.
Finally, I would like to cover 2 of the strategic actions that will impact our earnings in 2016. The first is our planned life reinsurance transactions, which are intended to address the approximately 40% of redundant reserves in our U.S. Life companies that have not already been financed. We expect these transactions will optimize our capital and generate $4 billion to $5 billion of additional liquidity to the parent through a combination of dividends and tax-sharing payments. This will also result in annual reduction in net investment income of approximately $200 million to $250 million beginning in 2017. There will be only a modest impact to net investment income in 2016, as transactions are being finalized. 
Secondly, we are reallocating roughly 50% of our hedge fund portfolio, as Peter mentioned, primarily into investment-grade bonds and commercial mortgage loans, which we believe will free up about $2 billion in additional capital from the allocation to lower capital charge assets. If we assumed a 9% normalized return, this would result in approximately $200 million decline in annual net investment income in 2016, net of our reinvestments. This would occur over the course of several quarters.
The net investment income reductions from both of these transactions were reflected in the Commercial and Consumer PTOI targets that we provided in our January 26 strategy update presentation. 
We look forward to delivering on our strategic plan that we outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure by 2016 year end. We remain confident in our plan to deliver $25 billion to shareholders over the next 2 years and our continued operating improvement. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Today, I will discuss the Commercial Insurance segment's quarterly results, our strategic priorities and the actions we're taking to improve operating performance. On Slide 12. The fourth quarter Commercial Property Casualty accident yea",1165,"Thank you, Sid. Today, I will discuss the Commercial Insurance segment's quarterly results, our strategic priorities and the actions we're taking to improve operating performance. 
On Slide 12. The fourth quarter Commercial Property Casualty accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, was 66.4%, an increase of 0.5 point from the prior year quarter, driven by higher severe losses in property. Increased loss, particularly in the U.S., including in E&S trucking and other segments of commercial auto, also contributed to the higher adjusted accident year loss ratio. 
The fourth quarter expense ratio of 28.6% reflected an increase in commission rates in Property, partially offset by net improvements in general operating expenses. Net premiums written grew 1.5% after adjusting for foreign exchange. We continued to improve our portfolio mix and grow in areas that meet our targeted ROE.
In the quarter, large limit and middle market properties and segments of our program business continued to grow. We also benefited from fee incomes from NSM, a leading U.S. managing general agent acquired by AIG in April of 2015. 
Overall rate change declined by nearly 1 point in the quarter, driven by continue pressure in Property, particularly in the U.S. E&S business. U.S. casualty rates increased by 3%, reflecting margin improvement in lines subject to remediation. Rates were essentially flat in Specialty and Financial Lines. 
We see profitable growth opportunities in multinational, Financial Lines, Property upper middle market and major account segments that utilize our risk engineering capabilities, international Casualty and areas of emerging risks, such as cyber and M&A insurance. We're also excited about providing clients with best-in-class claims expertise, risk services and analytic capabilities that will strengthen our relationships. These include expanded teams of engineers to analyze and mitigate risk, innovations from our partnership with Clemson University and investments in companies like Human Condition Safety, whose wearable devices can help workers avoid serious injuries. The breadth of the AIG franchise and the strength of our client relationships position us well to capitalize on new opportunities and current market disruption from some of our competitors. 
With respect to UGC, our CEO, Donna DeMaio, and her team delivered another quarter of increasing profitability. The strength of UGC's business is evident in the default rate that was last seen in 2006. 
For the full year, UGC had a record first lean new insurance written of over $50 billion and pretax operating income of $644 million. The Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility rules asset test came into effect in December 2015, and I'm pleased to report that UGC will exceed the requirement by approximately 20%.
During our January 26 strategy update call, we announced specific actions to improve Commercial performance that will reduce the accident year loss ratio as adjusted by 6 points. 
On Slide 13, the green line shows an accident year loss ratio improvement of almost 11 points since 2011, including the effective prior year development for all of those accident years. 
Following significant progress between 2011 and 2013, our trend rate slowed in 2014 and 2015, but during that time, we made some important advancements in our underwriting tools and analytics.
The bars in the chart highlight the change in business mix as we reduced writings in poorer-performing areas of U.S. Casualty from 39% of our portfolio in 2011 to 27% in 2015. In 2016 and 2017, we will continue to focus on improving the portfolio mix and we will accelerate the use of underwriting tools and analytics capabilities developed over the past few years. One of the benefits of AIG's recent organizational changes will be to increase agility and speed the adoption of these tools. 
Slide 14 shows the dispersion of the adjusted accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes of each sub-segment that comprises our $20 billion of net premiums earned in 2015. The loss ratio has ranged from as low as 30% to above 100% for a handful of subsegments. This illustrates a very important point, we do not need to improve each and every subsegment of our $20 billion portfolio by 6 points in order to achieve our target, rather focusing on our best and worst-performing areas will significantly contribute to improved performance. We intent to grow the 15% of the Commercial portfolio included within product set 1. It includes the lowest loss ratio businesses, which ran at an average of approximately 41%. We will focus our resources on expanding our presence in the many products and geographies within this product set, where we have strong competitive advantages and offer a compelling value proposition. We'll maintain or improve the business captured in product set 2, which represents 70% of total premiums, with an average accident year loss ratio of approximately 66%.
This is the product set that will benefit the most from the underwriting tools and data analytics I mentioned earlier. For the highest loss ratio subsegments, which are predominantly in U.S. Casualty, we intend to expand our use of quota share reinsurance. The effect will be an improved Commercial loss ratio, release of statutory capital and a higher return on equity. We will remediate product set 3, where the remaining 15% of the Commercial portfolio ran at an average accident year loss ratio of approximately 91%. This is where we will narrow our focus through strategic exits and remediation.
We already began taking actions on some of these subsegments in the second half of 2015 and expect to be seeing benefits from these actions in the first half of 2016. Earlier this month, we announced and communicated to our distribution partners the exit of 4 specific high loss ratio areas within U.S. Casualty, which include certain subsegments of health care and commercial auto that Sid mentioned earlier, following our fourth quarter reserve study. We expect to see these benefits beginning in the second half of 2016 and extending through 2017. 
I would note that the majority of the businesses we're remediating in the U.S. will renew relatively evenly throughout the remainder of the year. We will, of course, provide proper notice in compliance with the relevant regulatory rules, and communicate with our clients well in advance of these actions.
We believe these levers provide a clear path for achieving the targeted accident year loss ratio by year-end 2017. Our strategy is to be targeted using micro-segmentation tools, narrowing our focus to significantly differentiate between products, geographies, clients and distribution channels based on value. 
With respect to underperforming 1 or 2 product accounts, you can expect to see dramatic reductions as we move forward. Our goal is to be our clients' most valued insurer, and we're focused on clients where we can deliver the most value and grow profitably. 
In closing, Commercial strategy is clear, focused and on pace. While there's a lot of work to do, I'm confident in our strategic plan and our ability to execute it. 
Finally, the Commercial leadership team and I are 100% committed to achieving the plan we've outlined. 
Thank you. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

This morning, I will discuss our Consumer businesses' operating performance, provide an update on the DOL's proposed regulations and provide an update on Japan. Beginning with Retirement on Slide 17. As Sid hi",810,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our Consumer businesses' operating performance, provide an update on the DOL's proposed regulations and provide an update on Japan. 
Beginning with Retirement on Slide 17. As Sid highlighted earlier, lower alternative investment returns, combined with lower base portfolio income, contributed to the decline in pretax operating income. We continue to expect base yields to decline 2 to 4 basis points per quarter on a normalized basis in 2016 based on the current interest rate environment. 
Sales growth was strong from a year ago, particularly in Index Annuities and Fixed Annuities. We are seeing index annuity growth through all of our channels, particularly with independent agents and expanded wholesaling in banks, broker-dealers and advisers. 
Fixed Annuities growth was driven by higher interest rates and credit spreads in the latter portion of 2015. 
Retirement net flows improved both sequentially and versus a year ago due largely to continued positive flows for Retirement Income Solutions and a decline in Fixed Annuity and Group Retirement surrenders. 
Despite a challenging environment, we believe our product and distribution diversity allow for continued positive net flows overall. 
I would like to provide an update on the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations with respect to RSA plans and IRAs. The version of the proposed regulations, which was advanced to the Office of Management and budget at the end of January, has not been made public. The final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. We remain focused on preparing for its implementation with respect to product development, distribution support, compliance, service and administration. We are in active discussions with our distribution partners to be in the best position possible to meet the evolving needs of retirement savers. Through Group Retirement, Fixed Annuities, Index Annuities and variable annuities, we will offer a broad product portfolio to meet the growing needs of consumers for guaranteed lifetime income and other savings solutions. 
Slide 19 presents results for our global Life business. In Life, our new business is already poised to achieve our targeted returns. As Sid mentioned, we are executing on plans to finance our remaining redundant reserves with a series of reinsurance transactions that will improve the returns in that portfolio and allow for increased distributions to parent.
We are also executive on a plan for our Life business to narrow our distribution and product focus, including greater specialization, which will result in reduced distribution expenses. Examples of this enhanced emphasis include a greater focus on independent distribution channels with a significant reduction we made in January to our Life career agency force and a narrowing of our product focus on our group benefits business to profitable lines where we have a competitive advantage. 
Turning to Slide 20. Personal Insurance delivered strong growth in new business in the Private Client Group in Japan Property and automobile across all regions. However, there were a number of items that resulted in an increase in accident year losses. 
During the fourth quarter, we strengthened reserves for Accident and Health as a result of our normal annual review. We saw unsatisfactory performance in some European warranty service programs leading to remedial actions, including contract cancellations. And we realized higher auto losses in a number of European countries that are already targeted for exit. 
We continue to move forward with our work in Japan, and are preparing for the merger of Fuji Fire and Marine and AIU legal entities. At the same time, we have successfully grown our personal auto business, which grew year-over-year for the first time in over 10 years. Our onetime merger-related expenses were roughly $100 million this year, largely comparable to last year, and we further expect onetime expenses to peak in 2016 at a slightly higher level as we prepare to enter premerger status. The subsequent legal merger, when approved by the authorities, will bring to a close the integration of Fuji Fire and Marine, which we acquired in 2011.
I would like to briefly comment as well on our plan to deliver $800 million of pretax operating income improvement by 2017. We expect that much of this improvement will be achieved through significant expense reductions for each of the Consumer businesses, which are part of AIG's firm-wide GOE targets. The largest reductions will be in the Personal Insurance business and U.S. distribution. We expect that these benefits will be partially offset by lower net investment income from hedge fund reallocations as well as from a lower invested asset base, resulting from the distributions to the parent company. 
To close, we remain focused on achieving profitable growth across our Consumer businesses and effectively managing risks by executing on our customer-focused strategies, maintaining a prudent risk profile and targeting capital-efficient growth opportunities.

The second thing I want to say is regarding use of reinsurance -- I know there's a lot of questions about that. The first thing I want to say is  we don't think it's a long-term sustainable strategy to be looking to arbitrage our reinsurers. That's not the strategy here. We're partners with our reinsurers and we see many opportunities for our reinsurance strategy to benefit AIG as well as the reinsurers. I think there's 3 key points I'd like to make regarding how this work with the reinsurers. First, you should now, I think the reinsurers have an increasingly favorable view about the quality of the data and the quality of our underwriting. Second, the reinsurers themselves receive significant diversification benefits in their capital models, which makes business like our U.S. Casualty business more attractive for them. And third, the long-tail nature of our U.S. Casualty business, for example, gives the reinsurers a significant deal of flexibility in their investment allocation decisions, which might differ from the way AIG might choose to structure its investment portfolio. I would say, most of our actions will be with the reinsurers in product set 2, and it will be on the higher end of the loss ratios in product set 2, which is where the U.S. Casualty business sits. The reinsurance will change, of course, our mix of business because if you reduce the amount of business in product set 2, that is, U.S. Casualty, the range in loss ratios in product set 2 is pretty wide. It ranges from as low as the low-50s to as high as the 80s. And so therefore, you'll get a lot of benefit from reinsuring the U.S. Casualty business, which is higher loss ratio business in product set 2."

I think the -- our competitors are also seeing many of the same things we're seeing, and so I think there's pretty good discipline with respect to U.S. Casualty at this point. With that said, the U.S. property market, in particular, the excess and surplus line property market, has been and continues to be highly competitive. It's why you see AIG shifting its strategy to an increase in the level of engineers that we've added on to our team and seeking to use capabilities and expertise outside of our capital as the primary advantage and the primary thing we offer in the marketplace.

We're proceeding, right now, through the integration and regression testing of about 110 systems. And there has been a new regulatory requirement for a change in the earthquake property rates. And if you can imagine, whilst we're trying to do this integration and regression testing to have to stop, open up the systems, introduce those new earthquake rates and then go back to integration and regression testing, that's essentially what's pushed us back 6 months or so in terms of the expectation of the integration date. And our strategy is, in fact, to try to advance as many benefits from the work we'll already done in recognition of the fact that we can do so. And examples of that are our ability to recently change our direct marketing strategy and move that away from American Home legal entity and into Fuji Life and the other companies, which will generate further savings that we can now realize. And so outside of Japan, what I can say is when we did the strategic update, we did mention about the footprint strategy. And many of our Consumer businesses are vestiges from the days when AIG had a multiple financial services presence. For example, in Poland, a number of years ago, we had a consumer finance company, we had a Life business, we had a credit card company. And it's a natural extension of those customer bases and distribution channels to build a Consumer Property Casualty business. But as we've divested away from those, we now have expense overhangs and we have subscale operations in quite a few territories. And the reason why we're moving to a focus on our individual business and 15 territories in our group business and our multinational clients and 35 territories going forward, is to address that expense overhang. And that's primarily been the performance issue in much of the non-Japan part of the international portfolio. We do, of course, have some other portfolio, which is like the European warranty business which we address from time to time. But our loss ratios are generally sustainable and competitive. It's the expense ratio in the international Property Casualty business we need to address."

And the team is working hard to be delivering those on a schedule that's consistent with a high-quality control of financial disclosures that we obviously want to stick to. But in terms of prospective ROE, perhaps, I should just mention that we have, in our risk-adjusted profit framework, elevated the hurdle rate for all businesses at all territories to a minimum of 10%, which is a shift from where we were a year ago, where territories with low nominal interest rates and with low beta, we rewarded with a lower hurdle rate.

Obviously, the remediation role for Property and Casualty are the most significant, whereas I see the opportunity for growth in strategic areas, particularly for Financial Lines and for some of our Specialty products. With respect to which actions will drive it, it's reasonably evenly mixed between what I would call reinsurance and business mix. Strategic growth in some of the lines I just described, where we have opportunities, and our loss ratios and our competitive advantages allow us to succeed in the marketplace. And then a contribution, of course, from exits that have already been announced and our work on risk selection and client selection.

So that has been masking our results in Japan a little bit. The other thing I think that's important to point out is, if we take away the onetime project expenses associated with the merger and integration of Fuji Fire and Marine, the underlying business portfolio is generating returns, we believe, in that low double-digit area. And since we've acquired Fuji Fire and Marine, we've brought their loss ratio and personal accident business down by 9 full points and on automobile, down by 5 full points. And as I mentioned in my comments, we actually grew that business for the first time in quite a long time this year.

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter call. In today's call, I'll highlight unusual items in the quarter and importantly, I'll provide an update on our progress in executing on our strategic plan, which we presented on January 26. 
We and the board feel that our plan maximizes franchise value for all stakeholders and is based on achievable goals. This quarter is a further step in providing additional transparency to assess our progress towards our goals. 
Before I comment on the quarter, I want to mention yesterday's news that our Board of Directors agreed to expand the size of AIG's board from 14 to 16 seats. We believe this resolution is in the best interest of all our stakeholders and most importantly, allows us to focus on executing our strategic plan. 
Our fourth quarter results were impacted by our actions to strengthen reserves and the lower returns on alternative investments. As we have previously disclosed, we completed a number of in-depth reserve reviews of our long-tail lines and we responded quickly to new information. 
As part of our strategic plan, we announced our intentions to reduce and narrow our hedge fund allocation, which we believe will lead to greater risk-adjusted returns and contribute to our $25 billion return of capital through 2017. 
During the fourth quarter, we took a number of actions towards our goal of being a more streamlined, focused insurer. Importantly, I announced a smaller executive leadership team, a management structure that has already resulted in increased accountability across our businesses and accelerated our decision-making. This team is already executing on our strategic plan and today, you'll hear from some of them directly. 
Core to our strategic plan are the organizational changes, strategic actions and operating improvements, which we presented on January 26. 
On the organizational front, the adoption of a modular approach to our business and the creation of our Legacy Portfolio are important steps to improving transparency into the performance of our Operating Portfolio. In the quarter, we announced the sale of PICC shares and took additional actions to monetize Legacy Portfolio assets, which Sid will speak to. We're well on our way to achieving the targeted $9 billion in legacy capital released by 2017. 
The fourth quarter strategic actions are the foundations of the $25 billion of capital return that we expect over the next 2 years. For the full year 2015, we returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders, and we expect a similar pace to continue. 
Yesterday's announced additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and 14% increase in our dividend is consistent with the path towards returning the $25 billion over 2 years, or over 1/3 of our market capitalization. 
We also announced the sale of our Advisor Group, which we expect to close in the second quarter; and plans for an IPO of a portion of our interest in UGC. UGC is the market leader in the mortgage insurance industry. 
Finally, we are aggressively pursuing operating performance improvements, and you'll see that our progress on operating expense reduction supports our conviction in achieving $1.6 billion in gross operating expense reductions through the end of 2017. Today, we will also provide additional insight into our actions to improve our Commercial Property and Casualty accident year loss ratio. 
On Slide 4, we reaffirm the targets that we discussed in January and a year ago. We stand by our plan and look forward to sharing our progress with you on an ongoing basis. 
Before Sid begins his remarks on the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the great contribution that David Herzog has made to AIG. David has devoted the last 16 years to the company, and was essential to our emerging through the financial crisis and positions the company for its continued future success. His guidance and stewardship of our financials continues to be highly valued, and he'll be missed by many here at the company. 
Sid will now provide you with the financial highlights of the quarter."
250388,321466082,933053,"American International Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2016",2016-02-12,"Earnings Calls","American International Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress made on our expense initiatives, our continued active capital management and certain strategic actions impacting 2016 results. Turning to",1156,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress made on our expense initiatives, our continued active capital management and certain strategic actions impacting 2016 results. 
Turning to Slide 5. As Peter stated, the fourth quarter operating loss per share of $1.10 was primarily due to the reserve strengthening and weaker alternative returns in both the Commercial and Consumer segments. 
As I stated on the January 26 call, we believe our reserving actions this quarter will help mitigate the risk of future volatility around our best estimate. 
The reserve strengthening in accident years 2011 through '14 was driven by greater actual versus expected loss emergence for primary and excess auto liability, Healthcare and Financial Lines. The impact of revised tail factors based on emergence in earlier accident years also contributed to the adverse development for excess Casualty and Financial Lines. Of note, Financial Lines remains well above our current profitability targets. 
Our reported operating tax rate for the quarter was just shy of 39% due to the pretax operating loss and the impact of other discrete tax items reducing our tax expense. We expect our operating effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 32%.
Turning to Slide 6. Total general operating expenses declined 6% in the quarter and 3% for the full year on a constant dollar basis, a rate that is expected to accelerate under our current strategic plan. 
Included in our 2015 results are approximately $145 million of expenses related to the acquisition of 4 companies in the calendar year, offset by approximately $125 million representing the nonrecurring portion of the pension curtailment gain. 
In addition, we recognized another $222 million in pretax nonoperating restructuring charges in the quarter, $123 million of which relates to the restructuring charge we announced in the third quarter of this year. The remaining $99 million relates to new actions, primarily for additional staff reductions that will result in at least another $200 million reduction in our annual expense run rate. 
Taken together, the actions announced in the third and fourth quarters of this year will reduce our annual expense run rate by approximately $700 million to $800 million. We anticipate that we will achieve the majority of these savings by the second half of 2016. These actions, along with other initiatives we are undertaking, give us confidence we will achieve our $1.4 billion net reduction by 2017.
Slide 7 shows our continued execution against our capital management targets. During the quarter, we deployed over $3.2 billion towards the purchase of approximately 53 million common shares. This year, we have purchased an additional $2.5 billion of common shares through February 11. This leaves about $800 million unused against -- under the $3 billion authorization that we announced in December, plus an additional $5 billion from the new authorization that Peter referenced. We also announced an increase in our dividend of 14%, which is consistent with our positive view of sustainable profitability. 
From the standpoint of total capital return to shareholders, our annual dividend payment is approximately $1.5 billion based on our current outstanding shares, and that amount is included in the $25 billion in capital return we discussed in our strategic update. 
At year-end, we had $9.2 billion of parent liquidity, as you can see on Slide 8. While we manage our liquidity within a target range of $6 billion to $8 billion, we may be slightly higher or lower from this range from time to time. 
Cash inflows from the insurance subsidiaries during the quarter were approximately $400 million, reflecting our annual fourth quarter true-up of tax-sharing payments. 
As we said at the strategy update call, we expect $7 billion to $10 billion in dividends and tax-sharing payments over the next 2 years, which are net of parent and interest expense and the $2.9 billion capital contribution made to the PC subsidiaries in January. 
Slide 9 depicts the composition of our Legacy Portfolio. As we said in our strategic update call, we are creating a Legacy Portfolio, which contains roughly 1/4 of the company's total equity. Legacy will consist of actively managed run-off businesses or noncore assets and liabilities that we are targeting for maximum value. Our actions as they pertain to the Legacy Portfolio focus on how quickly we can extract capital by either divestitures, reinsurance or other efficient run-off methods, without giving away too much value. 
In the fourth quarter, we monetized $2.1 billion of Legacy Portfolio assets, including a portion of our stake in PICC, which we've previously disclosed, and certain DIB assets as well as some internal sales of assets to our Insurance businesses. Legacy Portfolio capital declined $5 billion in the quarter to approximately $17 billion, driven by the $3.6 billion of buybacks and dividends in the quarter, which were partially funded by the monetization of legacy assets. The reduction in Legacy Portfolio capital was also impacted by the additional NOLs created during the quarter, largely as a result of the reserve strengthening we previously announced. 
Slide 10 presents the composition of our deferred tax assets. During the year, we utilized about $600 million of foreign tax credits. NOLs increased by roughly $1 billion, also primarily as a result of the reserve strengthening we mentioned before.
Finally, I would like to cover 2 of the strategic actions that will impact our earnings in 2016. The first is our planned life reinsurance transactions, which are intended to address the approximately 40% of redundant reserves in our U.S. Life companies that have not already been financed. We expect these transactions will optimize our capital and generate $4 billion to $5 billion of additional liquidity to the parent through a combination of dividends and tax-sharing payments. This will also result in annual reduction in net investment income of approximately $200 million to $250 million beginning in 2017. There will be only a modest impact to net investment income in 2016, as transactions are being finalized. 
Secondly, we are reallocating roughly 50% of our hedge fund portfolio, as Peter mentioned, primarily into investment-grade bonds and commercial mortgage loans, which we believe will free up about $2 billion in additional capital from the allocation to lower capital-charge assets. If we assumed a 9% normalized return, this would result in approximately $200 million decline in annual net investment income in 2016, net of our reinvestments. This would occur over the course of several quarters.
The net investment income reductions from both of these transactions were reflected in the Commercial and Consumer PTOI targets that we provided in our January 26 strategy update presentation. 
We look forward to delivering on our strategic plan that we outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure by 2016 year-end. We remain confident in our plan to deliver $25 billion to shareholders over the next 2 years and our continued operating improvement. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Today, I will discuss the Commercial Insurance segment's quarterly results, our strategic priorities and the actions we're taking to improve operating performance. On Slide 12. The fourth quarter Commercial Property Casualty accident yea",1159,"Thank you, Sid. Today, I will discuss the Commercial Insurance segment's quarterly results, our strategic priorities and the actions we're taking to improve operating performance. 
On Slide 12. The fourth quarter Commercial Property Casualty accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, was 66.4%, an increase of 0.5 point from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher severe losses in Property. Increased loss, particularly in the U.S., including in E&S trucking and other segments of commercial auto, also contributed to the higher adjusted accident year loss ratio. 
The fourth quarter expense ratio of 28.6% reflected an increase in commission rates in Property, partially offset by net improvements in general operating expenses. Net premiums written grew 1.5% after adjusting for foreign exchange. We continued to improve our portfolio mix and grow in areas that meet our targeted ROE.
In the quarter, large-limit and middle-market property and segments of our program business continued to grow. We also benefited from fee incomes from NSM, a leading U.S. managing general agent acquired by AIG in April of 2015. 
Overall rate change declined by nearly 1 point in the quarter, driven by continued pressure in Property, particularly in the U.S. E&S business. U.S. Casualty rates increased by 3%, reflecting margin improvement in lines subject to remediation. Rates were essentially flat in Specialty and Financial Lines. 
We see profitable growth opportunities in multinational, Financial Lines, Property upper middle market and major account segments that utilize our risk engineering capabilities, international Casualty, and areas of emerging risks, such as cyber and M&A insurance. We're also excited about providing clients with best-in-class claims expertise, risk services and analytic capabilities that will strengthen our relationships. These include expanded teams of engineers to analyze and mitigate risk, innovations from our partnership with Clemson University and investments in companies like Human Condition Safety, whose wearable devices can help workers avoid serious injuries. The breadth of the AIG franchise and the strength of our client relationships position us well to capitalize on new opportunities and current market disruption from some of our competitors. 
With respect to UGC, our CEO, Donna DeMaio, and her team delivered another quarter of increasing profitability. The strength of UGC's business is evident in the default rate that was last seen in 2006. 
For the full year, UGC had a record first-lien new insurance written of over $50 billion and pretax operating income of $644 million. The Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility rules asset test came into effect in December 2015, and I'm pleased to report that UGC will exceed the requirement by approximately 20%.
During our January 26 strategy update call, we announced specific actions to improve Commercial's performance that will reduce the accident year loss ratio as adjusted by 6 points. 
On Slide 13, the green line shows an accident year loss ratio improvement of almost 11 points since 2011, including the effective prior-year development for all of those accident years. 
Following significant progress between 2011 and 2013, our trend rate slowed in 2014 and 2015, but during that time, we made some important advancements in our underwriting tools and analytics.
The bars in the chart highlight the change in business mix, as we reduced writings in poorer-performing areas of U.S. Casualty from 39% of our portfolio in 2011 to 27% in 2015. In 2016 and 2017, we will continue to focus on improving the portfolio mix and we will accelerate the use of underwriting tools and analytics capabilities developed over the past few years. One of the benefits of AIG's recent organizational changes will be to increase agility and speed the adoption of these tools. 
Slide 14 shows the dispersion of the adjusted accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, of each sub-segment that comprises our $20 billion of net premiums earned in 2015. The loss ratio has ranged from as low as 30% to above 100% for a handful of subsegments. This illustrates a very important point, we do not need to improve each and every subsegment of our $20 billion portfolio by 6 points in order to achieve our target, rather focusing on our best- and worst-performing areas will significantly contribute to improved performance. We intent to grow the 15% of the Commercial portfolio included within product set 1. It includes the lowest loss ratio businesses, which ran at an average of approximately 41%. We will focus our resources on expanding our presence in the many products and geographies within this product set, where we have strong competitive advantages and offer a compelling value proposition. We'll maintain or improve the business captured in product set 2, which represents 70% of total premiums, with an average accident year loss ratio of approximately 66%.
This is the product set that will benefit the most from the underwriting tools and data analytics I mentioned earlier. For the highest loss ratio subsegments, which are predominantly in U.S. Casualty, we intend to expand our use of quota share reinsurance. The effect will be an improved Commercial loss ratio, release of statutory capital and a higher return on equity. We will remediate product set 3, where the remaining 15% of the Commercial portfolio ran at an average accident year loss ratio of approximately 91%. This is where we will narrow our focus through strategic exits and remediation.
We already began taking actions on some of these subsegments in the second half of 2015 and expect to be seeing benefits from these actions in the first half of 2016. Earlier this month, we announced and communicated to our distribution partners the exit of 4 specific high loss ratio areas within U.S. Casualty, which include certain subsegments of Healthcare and commercial auto that Sid mentioned earlier, following our fourth quarter reserve study. We expect to see these benefits beginning in the second half of 2016 and extending through 2017. 
I would note that the majority of the businesses we're remediating in the U.S. will renew relatively evenly throughout the remainder of the year. We will, of course, provide proper notice in compliance with the relevant regulatory rules, and communicate with our clients well in advance of these actions.
We believe these levers provide a clear path for achieving the targeted accident year loss ratio by year-end 2017. Our strategy is to be targeted using micro-segmentation tools, narrowing our focus to significantly differentiate between products, geographies, clients and distribution channels based on value. 
With respect to underperforming 1 or 2 product accounts, you can expect to see dramatic reductions as we move forward. Our goal is to be our clients' most valued insurer, and we're focused on clients where we can deliver the most value and grow profitably. 
In closing, Commercial's strategy is clear, focused and on pace. While there's a lot of work to do, I'm confident in our strategic plan and our ability to execute it. 
Finally, the Commercial leadership team and I are 100% committed to achieving the plan we've outlined. 
Thank you. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."
250388,321466082,933053,"American International Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2016",2016-02-12,"Earnings Calls","American International Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our Consumer businesses' operating performance, provide an update on the DOL's proposed regulations and provide an update on Japan. Beginning with Retirement on Slide 17. As Sid hi",810,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our Consumer businesses' operating performance, provide an update on the DOL's proposed regulations and provide an update on Japan. 
Beginning with Retirement on Slide 17. As Sid highlighted earlier, lower alternative investment returns, combined with lower base portfolio income, contributed to the decline in pretax operating income. We continue to expect base yields to decline 2 to 4 basis points per quarter on a normalized basis in 2016 based on the current interest rate environment. 
Sales growth was strong from a year ago, particularly in Index Annuities and Fixed Annuities. We are seeing Index Annuity growth through all of our channels, particularly with independent agents, and expanded wholesaling in banks, broker-dealers and advisers. 
Fixed Annuities growth was driven by higher interest rates and credit spreads in the latter portion of 2015. 
Retirement net flows improved both sequentially and versus a year ago, due largely to continued positive flows for Retirement Income Solutions and a decline in Fixed Annuity and Group Retirement surrenders. 
Despite a challenging environment, we believe our product and distribution diversity allow for continued positive net flows overall. 
I would like to provide an update on the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations with respect to ERISA plans and IRAs. The version of the proposed regulations, which was advanced to the Office of Management and Budget at the end of January, has not been made public. The final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. We remain focused on preparing for its implementation with respect to product development, distribution support, compliance, service and administration. We are in active discussions with our distribution partners to be in the best position possible to meet the evolving needs of retirement savers. Through Group Retirement, Fixed Annuities, Index Annuities and variable annuities, we will offer a broad product portfolio to meet the growing needs of consumers for guaranteed lifetime income and other savings solutions. 
Slide 19 presents results for our global Life business. In Life, our new business is already priced to achieve our targeted returns. As Sid mentioned, we are executing on plans to finance our remaining redundant reserves with a series of reinsurance transactions that will improve the returns in that portfolio and allow for increased distributions to parent.
We are also executing on a plan for our Life business to narrow our distribution and product focus, including greater specialization, which will result in reduced distribution expenses. Examples of this enhanced emphasis include a greater focus on independent distribution channels with a significant reduction we made in January to our Life career agency force, and a narrowing of our product focus on our group benefits business to profitable lines where we have a competitive advantage. 
Turning to Slide 20. Personal Insurance delivered strong growth in new business in the Private Client Group, in Japan Property, and automobile across all regions. However, there were a number of items that resulted in an increase in accident year losses. 
During the fourth quarter, we strengthened reserves for Accident and Health as a result of our normal annual review. We saw unsatisfactory performance in some European warranty service programs leading to remedial actions, including contract cancellations. And we realized higher auto losses in a number of European countries that are already targeted for exit. 
We continue to move forward with our work in Japan, and are preparing for the merger of Fuji Fire and Marine and AIU legal entities. At the same time, we have successfully grown our personal auto business, which grew year-over-year for the first time in over 10 years. Our onetime merger-related expenses were roughly $100 million this year, largely comparable to last year, and we further expect onetime expenses to peak in 2016 at a slightly higher level as we prepare to enter premerger status. The subsequent legal merger, when approved by the authorities, will bring to a close the integration of Fuji Fire and Marine, which we acquired in 2011.
I would like to briefly comment as well on our plan to deliver $800 million of pretax operating income improvement by 2017. We expect that much of this improvement will be achieved through significant expense reductions for each of the Consumer businesses, which are part of AIG's firm-wide GOE targets. The largest reductions will be in the Personal Insurance business and U.S. distribution. We expect that these benefits will be partially offset by lower net investment income from hedge fund reallocations, as well as from a lower invested asset base resulting from the distributions to the parent company. 
To close, we remain focused on achieving profitable growth across our Consumer businesses and effectively managing risks by executing on our customer-focused strategies, maintaining a prudent risk profile and targeting capital-efficient growth opportunities.

The second thing I want to say is regarding use of reinsurance -- I know there's a lot of questions about that. The first thing I want to say is we don't think it's a long-term sustainable strategy to be looking to arbitrage our reinsurers. That's not the strategy here. We're partners with our reinsurers and we see many opportunities for our reinsurance strategy to benefit AIG as well as the reinsurers. I think there's 3 key points I'd like to make regarding how this works with the reinsurers. First, you should know, I think the reinsurers have an increasingly favorable view about the quality of the data and the quality of our underwriting. Second, the reinsurers themselves receive significant diversification benefits in their capital models, which makes business like our U.S. Casualty business more attractive for them. And third, the long-tail nature of our U.S. Casualty business, for example, gives the reinsurers a significant deal of flexibility in their investment allocation decisions, which might differ from the way AIG might choose to structure its investment portfolio. I would say, most of our actions will be with the reinsurers in product set 2, and it will be on the higher end of the loss ratios in product set 2, which is where the U.S. Casualty business sits. The reinsurance will change, of course, our mix of business because if you reduce the amount of business in product set 2 that is U.S. Casualty, the range in loss ratios in product set 2 is pretty wide. It ranges from as low as the low-50s to as high as the 80s. And so therefore, you'll get a lot of benefit from reinsuring the U.S. Casualty business, which is higher loss ratio business in product set 2."

With that said, the U.S. property market, in particular, the Excess & Surplus lines property market, has been and continues to be highly competitive. It's why you see AIG shifting its strategy to an increase in the level of engineers that we've added on to our team and seeking to use capabilities and expertise outside of our capital as the primary advantage and the primary thing we offer in the marketplace.

We're proceeding, right now, through the integration and regression testing of about 110 systems. And there has been a new regulatory requirement for a change in the earthquake property rates. And as you can imagine, whilst we're trying to do this integration and regression testing, to have to stop, open up the systems, introduce those new earthquake rates and then go back to integration and regression testing, that's essentially what's pushed us back 6 months or so in terms of the expectation of the integration date. And our strategy is, in fact, to try to advance as many benefits from the work we'll already done in recognition of the fact that we can do so. And examples of that are our ability to recently change our direct marketing strategy and move that away from American Home legal entity and into Fuji Life and the other companies, which will generate further savings that we can now realize. And so outside of Japan, what I can say is when we did the strategic update, we did mention about the footprint strategy. And many of our Consumer businesses are vestiges from the days when AIG had a multiple financial services presence. For example, in Poland, a number of years ago, we had a consumer finance company, we had a Life business, we had a credit card company. And it's a natural extension of those customer bases and distribution channels to build a Consumer Property Casualty business. But as we've divested away from those, we now have expense overhangs and we have subscale operations in quite a few territories. And the reason why we're moving to a focus on our individual business and 15 territories in our group business and our multinational clients and 35 territories going forward, is to address that expense overhang. And that's primarily been the performance issue in much of the non-Japan part of the international portfolio. We do, of course, have some other portfolio which is like the European warranty business, which we address from time to time. But our loss ratios are generally sustainable and competitive. It's the expense ratio in the international Property Casualty business we need to address."

And the guide to our own thinking here is very much our own internal assessment of risk.

With respect to which actions will drive it, it's reasonably evenly mixed between what I would call reinsurance and business mix. Strategic growth in some of the lines I just described, where we have opportunities, and our loss ratios and our competitive advantages allow us to succeed in the marketplace.

So that has been masking our results in Japan a little bit. The other thing I think that's important to point out is, if we take away the onetime project expenses associated with the merger and integration of Fuji Fire and Marine, the underlying business portfolio is generating returns, we believe, in that low double-digit area. And since we've acquired Fuji Fire and Marine, we've brought their loss ratio on personal accident business down by 9 full points, and on automobile, down by 5 full points. And as I mentioned in my comments, we actually grew that business for the first time in quite a long time this year.

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter call. In today's call, I'll highlight unusual items in the quarter and importantly, I'll provide an update on our progress in executing on our strategic plan, which we presented on January 26. 
We and the board feel that our plan maximizes franchise value for all stakeholders and is based on achievable goals. This quarter is a further step in providing additional transparency to assess our progress towards our goals. 
Before I comment on the quarter, I want to mention yesterday's news that our Board of Directors agreed to expand the size of AIG's board from 14 to 16 seats. We believe this resolution is in the best interest of all our stakeholders and most importantly, allows us to focus on executing our strategic plan. 
Our fourth quarter results were impacted by our actions to strengthen reserves and the lower returns on alternative investments. As we have previously disclosed, we completed a number of in-depth reserve reviews of our long-tail lines and we responded quickly to new information. 
As part of our strategic plan, we announced our intentions to reduce and narrow our hedge fund allocation, which we believe will lead to greater risk-adjusted returns and contribute to our $25 billion return of capital through 2017. 
During the fourth quarter, we took a number of actions towards our goal of being a more streamlined, focused insurer. Importantly, I announced a smaller executive leadership team, a management structure that has already resulted in increased accountability across our businesses and accelerated our decision-making. This team is already executing on our strategic plan and today, you'll hear from some of them directly. 
Core to our strategic plan are the organizational changes, strategic actions and operating improvements, which we presented on January 26. 
On the organizational front, the adoption of a modular approach to our business and the creation of our Legacy Portfolio are important steps to improving transparency into the performance of our Operating Portfolio. In the quarter, we announced the sale of PICC shares and took additional actions to monetize Legacy Portfolio assets, which Sid will speak to. We're well on our way to achieving the targeted $9 billion in legacy capital released by 2017. 
The fourth quarter strategic actions are the foundations of the $25 billion of capital return that we expect over the next 2 years. For the full year 2015, we returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders, and we expect a similar pace to continue. 
Yesterday's announced additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and 14% increase in our dividend is consistent with the path towards returning the $25 billion over 2 years, or over 1/3 of our market capitalization. 
We also announced the sale of our Advisor Group, which we expect to close in the second quarter; and plans for an IPO of a portion of our interest in UGC. UGC is the market leader in the mortgage insurance industry. 
Finally, we are aggressively pursuing operating performance improvements, and you'll see that our progress on operating expense reduction supports our conviction in achieving $1.6 billion in gross operating expense reductions through the end of 2017. Today, we will also provide additional insight into our actions to improve our Commercial Property and Casualty accident year loss ratio. 
On Slide 4, we reaffirm the targets that we discussed in January and a year ago. We stand by our plan and look forward to sharing our progress with you on an ongoing basis. 
Before Sid begins his remarks on the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the great contribution that David Herzog has made to AIG. David has devoted the last 16 years to the company, and was essential to our emerging through the financial crisis and positions the company for its continued future success. His guidance and stewardship of our financials continues to be highly valued, and he'll be missed by many here at the company. 
Sid will now provide you with the financial highlights of the quarter."
250388,321466082,933274,"American International Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2016",2016-02-12,"Earnings Calls","American International Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress made on our expense initiatives, our continued active capital management and certain strategic actions impacting 2016 results. Turning to",1156,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress made on our expense initiatives, our continued active capital management and certain strategic actions impacting 2016 results. 
Turning to Slide 5. As Peter stated, the fourth quarter operating loss per share of $1.10 was primarily due to the reserve strengthening and weaker alternative returns in both the Commercial and Consumer segments. 
As I stated on the January 26 call, we believe our reserving actions this quarter will help mitigate the risk of future volatility around our best estimate. 
The reserve strengthening in accident years 2011 through '14 was driven by greater actual versus expected loss emergence for primary and excess auto liability, Healthcare and Financial Lines. The impact of revised tail factors based on emergence in earlier accident years also contributed to the adverse development for excess Casualty and Financial Lines. Of note, Financial Lines remains well above our current profitability targets. 
Our reported operating tax rate for the quarter was just shy of 39% due to the pretax operating loss and the impact of other discrete tax items reducing our tax expense. We expect our operating effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 32%.
Turning to Slide 6. Total general operating expenses declined 6% in the quarter and 3% for the full year on a constant dollar basis, a rate that is expected to accelerate under our current strategic plan. 
Included in our 2015 results are approximately $145 million of expenses related to the acquisition of 4 companies in the calendar year, offset by approximately $125 million representing the nonrecurring portion of the pension curtailment gain. 
In addition, we recognized another $222 million in pretax nonoperating restructuring charges in the quarter, $123 million of which relates to the restructuring charge we announced in the third quarter of this year. The remaining $99 million relates to new actions, primarily for additional staff reductions that will result in at least another $200 million reduction in our annual expense run rate. 
Taken together, the actions announced in the third and fourth quarters of this year will reduce our annual expense run rate by approximately $700 million to $800 million. We anticipate that we will achieve the majority of these savings by the second half of 2016. These actions, along with other initiatives we are undertaking, give us confidence we will achieve our $1.4 billion net reduction by 2017.
Slide 7 shows our continued execution against our capital management targets. During the quarter, we deployed over $3.2 billion towards the purchase of approximately 53 million common shares. This year, we have purchased an additional $2.5 billion of common shares through February 11. This leaves about $800 million unused against -- under the $3 billion authorization that we announced in December, plus an additional $5 billion from the new authorization that Peter referenced. We also announced an increase in our dividend of 14%, which is consistent with our positive view of sustainable profitability. 
From the standpoint of total capital return to shareholders, our annual dividend payment is approximately $1.5 billion based on our current outstanding shares, and that amount is included in the $25 billion in capital return we discussed in our strategic update. 
At year-end, we had $9.2 billion of parent liquidity, as you can see on Slide 8. While we manage our liquidity within a target range of $6 billion to $8 billion, we may be slightly higher or lower from this range from time to time. 
Cash inflows from the insurance subsidiaries during the quarter were approximately $400 million, reflecting our annual fourth quarter true-up of tax-sharing payments. 
As we said at the strategy update call, we expect $7 billion to $10 billion in dividends and tax-sharing payments over the next 2 years, which are net of parent and interest expense and the $2.9 billion capital contribution made to the PC subsidiaries in January. 
Slide 9 depicts the composition of our Legacy Portfolio. As we said in our strategic update call, we are creating a Legacy Portfolio, which contains roughly 1/4 of the company's total equity. Legacy will consist of actively managed run-off businesses or noncore assets and liabilities that we are targeting for maximum value. Our actions as they pertain to the Legacy Portfolio focus on how quickly we can extract capital by either divestitures, reinsurance or other efficient run-off methods, without giving away too much value. 
In the fourth quarter, we monetized $2.1 billion of Legacy Portfolio assets, including a portion of our stake in PICC, which we've previously disclosed, and certain DIB assets as well as some internal sales of assets to our Insurance businesses. Legacy Portfolio capital declined $5 billion in the quarter to approximately $17 billion, driven by the $3.6 billion of buybacks and dividends in the quarter, which were partially funded by the monetization of legacy assets. The reduction in Legacy Portfolio capital was also impacted by the additional NOLs created during the quarter, largely as a result of the reserve strengthening we previously announced. 
Slide 10 presents the composition of our deferred tax assets. During the year, we utilized about $600 million of foreign tax credits. NOLs increased by roughly $1 billion, also primarily as a result of the reserve strengthening we mentioned before.
Finally, I would like to cover 2 of the strategic actions that will impact our earnings in 2016. The first is our planned life reinsurance transactions, which are intended to address the approximately 40% of redundant reserves in our U.S. Life companies that have not already been financed. We expect these transactions will optimize our capital and generate $4 billion to $5 billion of additional liquidity to the parent through a combination of dividends and tax-sharing payments. This will also result in annual reduction in net investment income of approximately $200 million to $250 million beginning in 2017. There will be only a modest impact to net investment income in 2016, as transactions are being finalized. 
Secondly, we are reallocating roughly 50% of our hedge fund portfolio, as Peter mentioned, primarily into investment-grade bonds and commercial mortgage loans, which we believe will free up about $2 billion in additional capital from the allocation to lower capital-charge assets. If we assumed a 9% normalized return, this would result in approximately $200 million decline in annual net investment income in 2016, net of our reinvestments. This would occur over the course of several quarters.
The net investment income reductions from both of these transactions were reflected in the Commercial and Consumer PTOI targets that we provided in our January 26 strategy update presentation. 
We look forward to delivering on our strategic plan that we outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure by 2016 year-end. We remain confident in our plan to deliver $25 billion to shareholders over the next 2 years and our continued operating improvement.

Today, I will discuss the Commercial Insurance segment's quarterly results, our strategic priorities and the actions we're taking to improve operating performance. On Slide 12. The fourth quarter Commercial Property Casualty accident yea",1159,"Thank you, Sid. Today, I will discuss the Commercial Insurance segment's quarterly results, our strategic priorities and the actions we're taking to improve operating performance. 
On Slide 12. The fourth quarter Commercial Property Casualty accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, was 66.4%, an increase of 0.5 point from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher severe losses in Property. Increased loss, particularly in the U.S., including in E&S trucking and other segments of commercial auto, also contributed to the higher adjusted accident year loss ratio. 
The fourth quarter expense ratio of 28.6% reflected an increase in commission rates in Property, partially offset by net improvements in general operating expenses. Net premiums written grew 1.5% after adjusting for foreign exchange. We continued to improve our portfolio mix and grow in areas that meet our targeted ROE.
In the quarter, large-limit and middle-market property and segments of our program business continued to grow. We also benefited from fee incomes from NSM, a leading U.S. managing general agent acquired by AIG in April of 2015. 
Overall rate change declined by nearly 1 point in the quarter, driven by continued pressure in Property, particularly in the U.S. E&S business. U.S. Casualty rates increased by 3%, reflecting margin improvement in lines subject to remediation. Rates were essentially flat in Specialty and Financial Lines. 
We see profitable growth opportunities in multinational, Financial Lines, Property upper middle market and major account segments that utilize our risk engineering capabilities, international Casualty, and areas of emerging risks, such as cyber and M&A insurance. We're also excited about providing clients with best-in-class claims expertise, risk services and analytic capabilities that will strengthen our relationships. These include expanded teams of engineers to analyze and mitigate risk, innovations from our partnership with Clemson University and investments in companies like Human Condition Safety, whose wearable devices can help workers avoid serious injuries. The breadth of the AIG franchise and the strength of our client relationships position us well to capitalize on new opportunities and current market disruption from some of our competitors. 
With respect to UGC, our CEO, Donna DeMaio, and her team delivered another quarter of increasing profitability. The strength of UGC's business is evident in the default rate that was last seen in 2006. 
For the full year, UGC had a record first-lien new insurance written of over $50 billion and pretax operating income of $644 million. The Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility rules asset test came into effect in December 2015, and I'm pleased to report that UGC will exceed the requirement by approximately 20%.
During our January 26 strategy update call, we announced specific actions to improve Commercial's performance that will reduce the accident year loss ratio as adjusted by 6 points. 
On Slide 13, the green line shows an accident year loss ratio improvement of almost 11 points since 2011, including the effective prior-year development for all of those accident years. 
Following significant progress between 2011 and 2013, our trend rate slowed in 2014 and 2015, but during that time, we made some important advancements in our underwriting tools and analytics.
The bars in the chart highlight the change in business mix, as we reduced writings in poorer-performing areas of U.S. Casualty from 39% of our portfolio in 2011 to 27% in 2015. In 2016 and 2017, we will continue to focus on improving the portfolio mix and we will accelerate the use of underwriting tools and analytics capabilities developed over the past few years. One of the benefits of AIG's recent organizational changes will be to increase agility and speed the adoption of these tools. 
Slide 14 shows the dispersion of the adjusted accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, of each sub-segment that comprises our $20 billion of net premiums earned in 2015. The loss ratio has ranged from as low as 30% to above 100% for a handful of subsegments. This illustrates a very important point, we do not need to improve each and every subsegment of our $20 billion portfolio by 6 points in order to achieve our target, rather focusing on our best- and worst-performing areas will significantly contribute to improved performance. We intent to grow the 15% of the Commercial portfolio included within product set 1. It includes the lowest loss ratio businesses, which ran at an average of approximately 41%. We will focus our resources on expanding our presence in the many products and geographies within this product set, where we have strong competitive advantages and offer a compelling value proposition. We'll maintain or improve the business captured in product set 2, which represents 70% of total premiums, with an average accident year loss ratio of approximately 66%.
This is the product set that will benefit the most from the underwriting tools and data analytics I mentioned earlier. For the highest loss ratio subsegments, which are predominantly in U.S. Casualty, we intend to expand our use of quota share reinsurance. The effect will be an improved Commercial loss ratio, release of statutory capital and a higher return on equity. We will remediate product set 3, where the remaining 15% of the Commercial portfolio ran at an average accident year loss ratio of approximately 91%. This is where we will narrow our focus through strategic exits and remediation.
We already began taking actions on some of these subsegments in the second half of 2015 and expect to be seeing benefits from these actions in the first half of 2016. Earlier this month, we announced and communicated to our distribution partners the exit of 4 specific high loss ratio areas within U.S. Casualty, which include certain subsegments of Healthcare and commercial auto that Sid mentioned earlier, following our fourth quarter reserve study. We expect to see these benefits beginning in the second half of 2016 and extending through 2017. 
I would note that the majority of the businesses we're remediating in the U.S. will renew relatively evenly throughout the remainder of the year. We will, of course, provide proper notice in compliance with the relevant regulatory rules, and communicate with our clients well in advance of these actions.
We believe these levers provide a clear path for achieving the targeted accident year loss ratio by year-end 2017. Our strategy is to be targeted using micro-segmentation tools, narrowing our focus to significantly differentiate between products, geographies, clients and distribution channels based on value. 
With respect to underperforming 1 or 2 product accounts, you can expect to see dramatic reductions as we move forward. Our goal is to be our clients' most valued insurer, and we're focused on clients where we can deliver the most value and grow profitably. 
In closing, Commercial's strategy is clear, focused and on pace. While there's a lot of work to do, I'm confident in our strategic plan and our ability to execute it. 
Finally, the Commercial leadership team and I are 100% committed to achieving the plan we've outlined. 
Thank you. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

This morning, I will discuss our Consumer businesses' operating performance, provide an update on the DOL's proposed regulations and provide an update on Japan. Beginning with Retirement on Slide 17. As Sid hi",810,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss our Consumer businesses' operating performance, provide an update on the DOL's proposed regulations and provide an update on Japan. 
Beginning with Retirement on Slide 17. As Sid highlighted earlier, lower alternative investment returns, combined with lower base portfolio income, contributed to the decline in pretax operating income. We continue to expect base yields to decline 2 to 4 basis points per quarter on a normalized basis in 2016 based on the current interest rate environment. 
Sales growth was strong from a year ago, particularly in Index Annuities and Fixed Annuities. We are seeing Index Annuity growth through all of our channels, particularly with independent agents, and expanded wholesaling in banks, broker-dealers and advisers. 
Fixed Annuities growth was driven by higher interest rates and credit spreads in the latter portion of 2015. 
Retirement net flows improved both sequentially and versus a year ago, due largely to continued positive flows for Retirement Income Solutions and a decline in Fixed Annuity and Group Retirement surrenders. 
Despite a challenging environment, we believe our product and distribution diversity allow for continued positive net flows overall. 
I would like to provide an update on the Department of Labor's fiduciary regulations with respect to ERISA plans and IRAs. The version of the proposed regulations, which was advanced to the Office of Management and Budget at the end of January, has not been made public. The final regulations could be issued as early as March or April. We remain focused on preparing for its implementation with respect to product development, distribution support, compliance, service and administration. We are in active discussions with our distribution partners to be in the best position possible to meet the evolving needs of retirement savers. Through Group Retirement, Fixed Annuities, Index Annuities and variable annuities, we will offer a broad product portfolio to meet the growing needs of consumers for guaranteed lifetime income and other savings solutions. 
Slide 19 presents results for our global Life business. In Life, our new business is already priced to achieve our targeted returns. As Sid mentioned, we are executing on plans to finance our remaining redundant reserves with a series of reinsurance transactions that will improve the returns in that portfolio and allow for increased distributions to parent.
We are also executing on a plan for our Life business to narrow our distribution and product focus, including greater specialization, which will result in reduced distribution expenses. Examples of this enhanced emphasis include a greater focus on independent distribution channels with a significant reduction we made in January to our Life career agency force, and a narrowing of our product focus on our group benefits business to profitable lines where we have a competitive advantage. 
Turning to Slide 20. Personal Insurance delivered strong growth in new business in the Private Client Group, in Japan Property, and automobile across all regions. However, there were a number of items that resulted in an increase in accident year losses. 
During the fourth quarter, we strengthened reserves for Accident and Health as a result of our normal annual review. We saw unsatisfactory performance in some European warranty service programs leading to remedial actions, including contract cancellations. And we realized higher auto losses in a number of European countries that are already targeted for exit. 
We continue to move forward with our work in Japan, and are preparing for the merger of Fuji Fire and Marine and AIU legal entities. At the same time, we have successfully grown our personal auto business, which grew year-over-year for the first time in over 10 years. Our onetime merger-related expenses were roughly $100 million this year, largely comparable to last year, and we further expect onetime expenses to peak in 2016 at a slightly higher level as we prepare to enter premerger status. The subsequent legal merger, when approved by the authorities, will bring to a close the integration of Fuji Fire and Marine, which we acquired in 2011.
I would like to briefly comment as well on our plan to deliver $800 million of pretax operating income improvement by 2017. We expect that much of this improvement will be achieved through significant expense reductions for each of the Consumer businesses, which are part of AIG's firm-wide GOE targets. The largest reductions will be in the Personal Insurance business and U.S. distribution. We expect that these benefits will be partially offset by lower net investment income from hedge fund reallocations, as well as from a lower invested asset base resulting from the distributions to the parent company. 
To close, we remain focused on achieving profitable growth across our Consumer businesses and effectively managing risks by executing on our customer-focused strategies, maintaining a prudent risk profile and targeting capital-efficient growth opportunities. 
Now I'd like to turn it back to Liz to open up for Q&A."

The second thing I want to say is regarding use of reinsurance -- I know there's a lot of questions about that. The first thing I want to say is we don't think it's a long-term sustainable strategy to be looking to arbitrage our reinsurers. That's not the strategy here. We're partners with our reinsurers and we see many opportunities for our reinsurance strategy to benefit AIG as well as the reinsurers. I think there's 3 key points I'd like to make regarding how this works with the reinsurers. First, you should know, I think the reinsurers have an increasingly favorable view about the quality of the data and the quality of our underwriting. Second, the reinsurers themselves receive significant diversification benefits in their capital models, which makes business like our U.S. Casualty business more attractive for them. And third, the long-tail nature of our U.S. Casualty business, for example, gives the reinsurers a significant deal of flexibility in their investment allocation decisions, which might differ from the way AIG might choose to structure its investment portfolio. I would say, most of our actions will be with the reinsurers in product set 2, and it will be on the higher end of the loss ratios in product set 2, which is where the U.S. Casualty business sits. The reinsurance will change, of course, our mix of business because if you reduce the amount of business in product set 2 that is U.S. Casualty, the range in loss ratios in product set 2 is pretty wide. It ranges from as low as the low-50s to as high as the 80s. And so therefore, you'll get a lot of benefit from reinsuring the U.S. Casualty business, which is higher loss ratio business in product set 2."

With that said, the U.S. property market, in particular, the Excess & Surplus lines property market, has been and continues to be highly competitive. It's why you see AIG shifting its strategy to an increase in the level of engineers that we've added on to our team and seeking to use capabilities and expertise outside of our capital as the primary advantage and the primary thing we offer in the marketplace. So we do expect it to continue to be a mixed bag, product-by-product and geography-by-geography."

We're proceeding, right now, through the integration and regression testing of about 110 systems. And there has been a new regulatory requirement for a change in the earthquake property rates. And as you can imagine, whilst we're trying to do this integration and regression testing, to have to stop, open up the systems, introduce those new earthquake rates and then go back to integration and regression testing, that's essentially what's pushed us back 6 months or so in terms of the expectation of the integration date. And our strategy is, in fact, to try to advance as many benefits from the work we'll already done in recognition of the fact that we can do so. And examples of that are our ability to recently change our direct marketing strategy and move that away from American Home legal entity and into Fuji Life and the other companies, which will generate further savings that we can now realize. And so outside of Japan, what I can say is when we did the strategic update, we did mention about the footprint strategy. And many of our Consumer businesses are vestiges from the days when AIG had a multiple financial services presence. For example, in Poland, a number of years ago, we had a consumer finance company, we had a Life business, we had a credit card company. And it's a natural extension of those customer bases and distribution channels to build a Consumer Property Casualty business. But as we've divested away from those, we now have expense overhangs and we have subscale operations in quite a few territories. And the reason why we're moving to a focus on our individual business and 15 territories in our group business and our multinational clients and 35 territories going forward, is to address that expense overhang. And that's primarily been the performance issue in much of the non-Japan part of the international portfolio. We do, of course, have some other portfolio which is like the European warranty business, which we address from time to time. But our loss ratios are generally sustainable and competitive. It's the expense ratio in the international Property Casualty business we need to address."

And the guide to our own thinking here is very much our own internal assessment of risk. And we are very pleased, especially in the light of recent market volatility, that we've done so much over the last 4 years to derisk the balance sheet of the company, the vulnerability to contingent liquidity.

Obviously, the remediation role for Property and Casualty are the most significant, whereas I see the opportunity for growth in strategic areas, particularly for Financial Lines and for some of our Specialty products. With respect to which actions will drive it, it's reasonably evenly mixed between what I would call reinsurance and business mix. Strategic growth in some of the lines I just described, where we have opportunities, and our loss ratios and our competitive advantages allow us to succeed in the marketplace. And then a contribution, of course, from exits that have already been announced and our work on risk selection and client selection.

So that has been masking our results in Japan a little bit. The other thing I think that's important to point out is, if we take away the onetime project expenses associated with the merger and integration of Fuji Fire and Marine, the underlying business portfolio is generating returns, we believe, in that low double-digit area. And since we've acquired Fuji Fire and Marine, we've brought their loss ratio on personal accident business down by 9 full points, and on automobile, down by 5 full points. And as I mentioned in my comments, we actually grew that business for the first time in quite a long time this year.

But I believe that our risk-adjusted profit framework, by targeting the spread between ROE and the hurdle rates, which we call the RAP spread, times the equity employed, and maximizing that risk-adjusted profit is the way to make the volume margin trade-off in a value-accretive way for shareholders."

I'm happy to report the tangible progress we're making as we deliver on our strategic plan. Across AIG, we're working hard to execute on a transformation that will lead to improved profitability and will best serve all our stakeholders. As we've been repositioning the company, the support of our brokers, clients and employees has been greatly appreciated that is essential to our success.
In the first quarter, we reported $0.65 of operating earnings per share, including market-related losses of $0.48 largely due to hedge funds. Our market-sensitive assets continue to decline and Sid will speak to our progress to further reduce these asset exposures. 
We're off to a solid start to the year and in the quarter, we reduced expenses by 5% and returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders. As you can see on on Slide 3 and later in the presentation, our organizational improvements are proceeding on plan and we're on target to reach our $1.6 billion in gross expense reduction by 2017.
The steady pace of capital return continued throughout the quarter. Our strong capital and leverage ratios, attractive free cash flows and risk management discipline allow us to execute on our plan to return $25 billion of capital to shareholders through 2017. 
We have also provided details on the key drivers of our normalized ROE improvement including unusual items. It's important to note that normalized ROE may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to discrete tax items as was the case this quarter. Additionally, the seasonality of anticipated catastrophe losses may result in quarterly ROE volatility. These fluctuations should not meaningfully impact full year ROE and we expect our full year normalized ROE to be within our 8.4% to 8.9% targeted range. 
While we've seen in market volatility impacts our investments this quarter, the broader macro environment has not altered our focus or the direction of our strategic plan as we -- as was evident in our continued pace of capital return. Today, Rob will speak to the successful execution of our Commercial strategy in the competitive Property Casualty market. Kevin will elaborate on the value of the diversity of our Consumer business and in particular, the strong earnings growth in Personal Insurance. 
The accomplishments that I've across the organization what make me most excited about our future. In my meetings with clients, I found that we are viewed as trusted partners who provide solutions to their most complex risk management needs. We were recently recognized at the annual rims conferences as the industry's #1 carrier in National Underwriters' International Risk Management Choice awards, a recognition of our industry leadership by our clients. We also improved our competitive position within the Group Retirement market given our investments in technology, which resulted in greater retention and positive net flows for the first time in 2 years.
Internally, our organizational realignment has eliminated 95% of metrics reporting, which is energizing employees and resulting in faster decision-making. 
Finally, I'd like to mention the news last week of our planned joint venture with Hamilton Re and Two Sigma is consistent with our ability to take advantage of AIG's scale through new initiatives. The joint venture reinforces AIG's commitment to data science and targets the small- to medium-sized enterprise market by combining AIG's expertise in data with Two Sigma's technology platform. 
Before Sid addresses the financials, I'd like to that we are actively managing our operating and legacy portfolios that we presented on our strategy update call. Our success in managing these 2 portfolios is measured by the ROE improvement of the Operating Portfolio and the reduction in capital retained in our Legacy Portfolio. Under Charlie [ph] leadership, the team is focused on execution and is off to a brisk start. We look forward to updating you on his progress in future quarters. We're confident that we're building on the first quarter's accomplishments and moving towards our strategic objectives. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress on our expense initiatives and our active capital management. Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating earnings showed good progress this q",1099,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress on our expense initiatives and our active capital management. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating earnings showed good progress this quarter with solid underwriting results in both Commercial and Consumer as well as strong expense management. We also reported net favorable reserve development this quarter of approximately $60 million across Commercial and Personal Insurance. 
Looking ahead, why we're only 1 month into the second quarter, our early estimates of losses from earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador, along with the Texas floods, are in the range of $200 million to $300 million, roughly split between our Commercial and Consumer profiles. Also of note, UGC delivered another strong quarter driven by improved loss experience and lower expenses. 
Our reported operating tax rate was lower in the first quarter of just over 19%, benefiting from the favorable resolution of certain tax items in the quarter. We continue to expect our 2016 accrued operating tax rate to be approximately 32%. As a reminder, our valuable deferred tax asset allows us to maximize free cash flow to our parent.
Slide 5 depicts the net investment trends for interest and dividends and other market-sensitive assets. Interest and dividends on a core investment portfolio has remained very steady at over $3 billion per quarter. Investments that are effectively mark-to-market through earnings contributed to significant volatility in recent quarters and include hedge funds, PICC and ADSCDOs [ph], which were driven by credit spreads. These investments accounted for roughly $870 million of pretax operating losses in the first quarter.
On our January strategy update call, we announced plans to reduce our hedge fund allocation by about half, freeing up $2 billion of capital towards our $25 billion return goal by the end of 2017. We kicked off our hedge fund strategy in 2015. As of quarter end, we've submitted notices of redemption for $4.1 billion of our hedge fund portfolio and as of today, we have received $1.2 billion of proceeds from those reductions.
Yesterday, we announced the sale of PICC Property Casualty shares for gross proceeds of approximately $1.25 billion that will result in a nonoperating pretax realized gain of nearly $900 million. This transaction will have a positive impact on dividends and tax-sharing payments from subsidiaries as well as book value per share, ex AOCI and DTA. 
In addition, we monetized $1.7 billion of legacy assets during the first quarter and $3.8 billion over the last 2 quarters. We continue to make progress toward divestiture of UGC with the filing of our S-1 and we are on track to close Advisor Group this quarter. With actions taken today, we are already at the low end of the $5 billion to $7 billion of divestitures that are funding part of our $25 billion capital return target. 
Over the past 4 years, we've reduced our exposure to assets and derivatives that are effectively mark-to-market in earnings by approximately 40%. Future volatility will be reduced by the strategic actions with respect to the hedge funds and Legacy Portfolio that I spoke to.
Turning to Slide 6, we're making good progress on our expense reduction efforts with total general operating expenses down 5% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the restructuring actions that we took in the latter part of 2015. In addition, we recognized another $188 million of pretax nonoperating restructuring charges in the quarter, which is largely related to the items announced in the second half of 2015. 
As a result of these actions, we expect our annual GOE run rate to decline by approximately $700 million to $800 million on an annualized basis with the larger impact in the second half of 2016. We remain confident in our $1.4 billion net GOE reduction goal by 2017. 
Slide 7 shows the improvement in our normalized ROE from a year ago, which excluding this quarter's tax benefit, was 8.4%. ROE increased by over 1 point from a year ago due to the nearly $12 billion of capital returned to shareholders in 2015, our focus on expense efficiency and improvements in Personal Insurance underwriting.
Book value per share, ex AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, was essentially flat this quarter at $59.05 per share as shown on Slide 8 and was negatively impacted by capital markets volatility. Including net realized capital losses, which totaled about $700 million after-tax in the first quarter. Approximately half of those net realized losses were related to noneconomic accounting volatility resulting from differences in where we report the impact of FX on intercompany liabilities versus the matching available-for-sale investments. The offsetting FX gain on the AFS investments is recorded in AOCI. 
We also realized losses upon the sale of energy positions, which at the end of the quarter represented roughly 5% of our total AFS portfolio. These Q1 items may result in a shortfall to our 2016 book value per share growth target, however, we still expect to achieve double-digit book value per share growth this year. Our ability to reach a 3-year compounded 10% growth in book value per share will in part due will depend on capital markets and macroeconomic conditions.
Slide 9 shows our continued execution against our capital management targets. During the quarter, we deployed about $3.5 billion towards the purchase of approximately 63 million common shares, and we also repurchased 10 million of our outstanding warrants for $173 million. Since quarter end and through May 2, we repurchased an additional 870 million of common shares, which leaves about $3.7 billion unused under the $5 billion authorization that we announced in February. 
During the quarter, we issued $1.5 billion of 5-year senior debt and $1.5 billion of 10-year senior debt. We created incremental economic value for shareholders through the completion of tender offers for approximately $800 million of purchase price of debt, which had a positive NPV. This leaves our financial leverage ratio at the end of the quarter at just shy of 20%, at the low end of our 20% to 25% targeted range that we spoke to on our strategy update call. Our RBC and rating agency capital ratios continue to remain within our target. In addition, at quarter end, we had to $7.1 billion of parent liquidity. Our balance sheet remains very strong. 
As Peter stated, we look forward to delivering on our strategic by that we outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress throughout 2016. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Net premiums written declined 12% after adjusting for foreign exchange. The single-largest driver of the decrease was the greater use of reinsurance, representing approximately half of the 12% decline. 
Casualty product exits in North America and our remediation efforts also contributed to the decline in the quarter. Overall, we expect to decrease approximately $2.5 billion in net premiums written in 2016, reflecting an increase in our use of reinsurance, along with exits from nonprofitable line. This is an increase from our previous $1.5 billion estimates and is consistent with our 4 points of expected accident year loss ratio improvement and an anticipated flat expense ratio. We continue to experience new business growth and strong retention and profitable subsegments and we'll absolutely continue to grow in these areas. Consistent with our vision to be our clients' most valued insurer, we are investing in less we're offer a compelling value proposition, such as D&O, cyber, M&A, multinational and our large limit and middle-market Property offerings.
Overall, U.S. rate improved almost 1 point in the quarter, despite continued rate pressure in the excess and surplus lines Property business. U.S. Specialty rates increased 3%, which is consistent with what we've seen in the past few quarters and we expect that trend to continue. 
Rates were modestly positive for Financial Lines in our Specialty businesses in the U.S. I would like to stress that we are thoroughly reviewing granular client retention metrics to differentiate our pricing strategy based on account-by-account profitability. 
Slide 13 shows the continued improvement in Commercial's adjusted accident loss ratio between 2011 and the first quarter of 2016, including the effect of prior period development for each accident year which we previously presented on our strategy call. While the first quarter results of 64.5% included higher-than-expected attritional losses in Property, it represents 1.7 point improvement over the full year of 2015 and we are on track to reach our 62% exit run rate for 2016. 
In March, we announced a 2-year agreement under which our share of our new and renewal U.S. Casualty business will be to Swiss Re. We do not disclose the details of individual reinsurance agreements and the Swiss Re deal represents just one of a number of programs we have in place. We extend our thanks to all of our reinsurance partners with whom we are highly aligned through the confidence they have expressed in the continuing improving trend in our portfolio and in our leadership team. Upon exploration of the existing agreements, we expect to have more profitable book of business and to be well positioned to retain more business renewal our reinsurance agreement under terms that lease as favorable as they are today. 
Collectively, we expect to see approximately $1.5 billion in additional premiums related to quota share reinsurance in 2016 compared to the levels seated in 2015. The expected 2016 average seated loss ratio will be at least 5 points higher than 2015 and ceding commissions will continue to cover fully loaded cost for each yield, both individually and in the aggregate. 
The first quarter accident loss ratio does not reflect the full impact of reinsurance as the benefit will grow each quarter over the next year. We expect that reinsurance will account to close to 2 points of our adjusted accident loss ratio improvement by the end of 2017. 
On February 2, we formally communicated to our distribution partners that we will no longer offer coverage in 4 specific underperforming portions of our North American casualty and environmental books. By exiting these few highly targeted areas, we have the ability to significantly improve profitability as well, as refocus our energy and technical expertise towards industry segment and client partnerships that are mutually beneficial. 
Moving to our risk selection strategy, we achieved improvements in U.S. Casualty and U.S. Property as we continue to optimize our mix of business and accelerate the use of underwriting, pricing and analytic tools. With respect to our strategy of sharpening our focus on valued clients, you'll recall that in 2015, approximately 83% of our U.S. Casualty clients purchased only 1 or 2 products and that some of those relationships were unprofitable. This represents approximately 15% of total U.S. Casualty premiums and we successfully remediated the majority of this business s it came up for renewal in the first quarter. 
The top of Slide 14 shows the adjusted action accident loss ratio for each subsegment that made up our $20 billion of net premiums earned in 2015, which falls into 3 product sets: Growth, maintain or improve and remediate. The bottom of the page shows the change in size and the accident loss ratio for each portion of the portfolio for the full year 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
For the first quarter of 2016, we measured size based on net premiums written, which is a leading indicator of our progress since the benefits of our recent actions will emerge in net premiums earned as the year continues. I will highlight 4 key observations for you on this page. First, I'm extremely pleased with the portfolio's change in mix of business. The grow and maintain portion of the business has increased from 50% of total premiums in 2015 to 59% of premiums in the first quarter, while the business we are remediating in product set 3, decreased from 15% of the portfolio to 9% over the same time period. 
The second observation is that in addition to reducing the size of product set 3, the accident loss ratio for this worst-performing portion of the business improved significantly from 91% for the full year 2015 to 86% on an earned basis in the first quarter, driven mostly by the North American casualty and environmental exits.
My third observation is that the improved portion of product set 2 declined from 35% to total premiums in 2015, to 32% to premiums in the first quarter, while we improved the accident loss ratio on an earned basis by 5 points from 73% to 68% over that same time period. These changes were primarily the result of our client and risk selection strategy and the expansion of reinsurance. 
Finally, my fourth observation is that our progress will not always be linear due to market conditions, short-tail losses and other issues outside of our control. Product set 1 declined in size from 15% of total premiums in 2015 to 13% of premiums in the first quarter and the accident loss ratio increased from 41% to 48% during that time, driven mostly by International Property. The accident loss ratio for product set 1 still remains very strong and as I mentioned earlier, investing in growth areas is a fundamental part of our strategy. We are deploying a disproportionate amount of our resources to teams focused on product set 1 to anticipate product needs and foster innovation to create value for our clients. 
Our strategy is best characterized as one of focus and pace. We've move quickly to concentrate our efforts on growing our strongest performing business and our most valued relationships, while continuing to invest in data analytics, innovation and engineering to help our clients better mitigate risk. 
In closing, we took a number of significant actions to improve Commercial's performance for the year. Although there's a lot more work to do, I'm confident that we're headed in the right direction and we're on target with the goals we've communicated. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

This morning, I'll provide an update on the Department of Labor's final rule and discuss the operating performance of our Consumer businesses. Beginning with the final Department of Labor fiduciary rule, publi",726,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide an update on the Department of Labor's final rule and discuss the operating performance of our Consumer businesses. 
Beginning with the final Department of Labor fiduciary rule, published on April 8, the initial compliance data is April 10, 2017, with full compliance required by January 1, 2018. We are currently reviewing this final rule to evaluate its full impact on our customers, distribution partners, financial advisers and our business, while continuing to prepare for compliance with the rule. We remain in active discussions with our distribution partners to be in the best position possible to meet the evolving needs of Retirement savers. We plan to continue to offer a broad product portfolio through our diverse distribution network to meet the growing needs of consumers for guaranteed lifetime income and other savings solutions. 
Turning to Retirement results on Slide 16, it was a strong quarter for Retirement sales with 24% growth from a year ago, led by Fixed Annuities and Retail Mutual Funds. Sales continue to benefit from our multiple product and distribution channel strategy as reflecting in our well-diversified base of assets under management. 
Market volatility during the quarter resulted in a flight to quality and increased investor appetite for Fixed Annuities. While risk-free rates declined, credit spreads were robust allowing us to provide attractive overall rates, while still maintaining our pricing and asset quality disciplines.
Net flows for Retirement this quarter improved both sequentially and year-over-year and notably, were positive for each month of our product lines, reflecting the strength of our distribution platform. The positive net flows in Group Retirement reflect our ongoing investments to enhance both our planned sponsor service and participant experience. 
As you can see on Slide 17, we continue to maintain our disciplined in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our base yields will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter. 
In Life, as shown on Slide 18, we saw growth in premiums and deposits of 4% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Mortality trends continue to be in line with our expectations. We saw good growth in U.S. life sales from the same period last year, reflecting the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of our independent distribution channels. We are also making progress in executing on our plans to finance our remaining redundant reserves with a series of reinsurance transactions that will improve the returns in that portfolio and allow for increased distributions to parent. We will provide you with updates on these transactions as they are completed. 
Turning to Slide 19. The first quarter was very strong for Personal $22 million of pretax operating income. We saw significant improvement in the accident loss ratio in the U.S., which primarily related to U.S. personal Property, which experienced fewer large claims and generated an increase in premiums. We also continue to see strong premium growth in our Private Client Group in the U.S. 
Net premiums written for PCG were up 13% from the same period last year, with 9 consecutive months of double-digit growth. We also continue to make progress on the expense front in Personal Insurance and we are seeing benefits from our strategy to narrow our focus to 15 countries for individual Personal Insurance products, while continuing to serve our multinational partners. 
In addition, we are seeing the results of our overall organizational expense initiatives. Japan delivered a meaningful part of the acquisition costs and GOE savings this quarter and acquisition costs benefited from our efforts to reposition direct marketing in Japan. While we continue to expect that expenses will be the key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments. With respect to Japan, we remain focused on a successful execution of the merger as we had previously reported. 
To close, while we have already experienced some catastrophe and severe loss events as Sid highlighted that will impact Personal Insurance operating results in the second quarter, we remain focused on continued execution of our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses. 
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A."

First of all, I don't want to comment about Swiss Re specifically, let's just talk about reinsurance transactions overall. So what I said in my prepared remarks is that we have -- we expect to see $1.5 billion of additional premiums related to quota share in 2016 compared to the 2015 levels, so we already were using quota share in 2015. The increase from all reinsurance transactions, Swiss Re and other during 2016, we expect to increase the amount that we see about $1.5 billion. So as we write business throughout the course of 2016, a piece of the business that we write in 2016 will attach to this quota share reinsurance agreement. And you should think of it as that premium volume on a net written premium basis will decline but it won't affect earned premium until those premiums earn in over the course of the next year after the date it had been written. So for example, premiums written on December 31, 2016, will be covered by a reinsurance agreement that was covering the year 2016 on a quota share basis but those premiums won't be fully earned until December 31, 2017, so you'll feel the full effect of that in our income statement across -- really, across the -- a year after the premiums have been written, I hope that's helpful."

Our growth in Property has been focused on the highly engineered space. As we mentioned previously, we've increased the number of engineers on our team today to be approximately 700 engineers worldwide, most of those engineers support our Property business, but not solely on Property business. And actually, today, we have more engineers than underwriters in the U.S. Property market. So when we're growing in Property, what we're doing is transforming our book from being one where we were a capital provider amongst many them to instead being a risk management partner with our clients where we're using our engineering capability to reduce the likelihood of a loss in the first place. And so our growth in that area is in the large limit Property space and in the middle-market Property space where engineering is the backbone of the business that we're writing.

I'm wondering if you can update a bit within the group as well as the your general thinking on some of the big strategic questions like remaining in SIFI in light of the Met Life court victory? Or how are you thinking -- how you're thinking on the visitors as evolving as your business become more modular? And I asked both of this in particular I think because you said very much like to beat your $25 billion capital return goals over the next 2 years and I kind of imagine that you'd probably to consider additional divestitures or maybe pursue a path to BCP to achieve that?"

So I would say that there is contingency against adverse market environment even baked into our plan, so I do not think that being a SIFI, in any way, inhibits that $25 billion goal. It's not a binding constraint at all. But I think that the MetLife decision certainly raises the opportunity should it be favorable to consider that down the road. But I repeat that our current designation as a nonbank SIFI does not constrain our objective as laid out in our strategic update, so we are watching very carefully the appeal process. And we point to the efforts that we made as a company to delever the company, to derisk the company since the crisis. And so I think that any designation by or around nonbank SIFI status should look at the metrics relative to others to show what we've done to delever the company. And so I think that we have great confidence that our plan to improve operating margins, to return to capital to shareholders will deliver expansion in ROE in our Operating Portfolio and thoughtful divestiture of the legacy assets in an orderly way will realize the optimal balance between book value growth and ROE expansion."

We'll show the best 15%, the worst 15% and then the middle part of the portfolio. I clearly believe that what you should expect is that for the business that we hold a number of books in 2015, that we've been working on remediating, you should continue to see product set 3 significantly reduced in size and as we've said we would we've taken clear action to exit specific underperforming products and client relationships but remember, we can only do that is those policies come up for renewal with proper notification in accordance with the state laws and regulations. We've also given our underwriters better tools to help them make good judgments in their underwriting decisions. And I think all of those things that should continue to show that product set 3 will decline in size and the loss ratio will improve. Product set 2, the middle part, I think that you'll just continue to see growth and they maintain size of product set 2. And you'll see us continue to improve both the loss ratio and reduce the size of the improved size of product set 2. But we do expect to grow in product set 1. I think that reinsurance is really serving to help us in product set 2 more than anything. And that's the place, what you should understand is really our actions to exit and our actions to remediate that are driving down the volume of product set 3 and you should also expect that we'll continue to disproportionately put our resources to where the growth in product set 1. But I think we'll continue to find ways to help you to have better transparency into the performance of the portfolio using a slide like Slide 14 going forward."

I'm happy to report the tangible progress we're making as we deliver on our strategic plan. Across AIG, we're working hard to execute on a transformation that will lead to improved profitability and will best serve all our stakeholders. As we've been repositioning the company, the support of our brokers, clients and employees has been greatly appreciated and is essential to our success.
In the first quarter, we reported $0.65 of operating earnings per share, including market-related losses of $0.48 largely due to hedge funds. Our market-sensitive assets continue to decline, and Sid will speak to our progress to further reduce these asset exposures. 
We're off to a solid start to the year, and in the quarter, we reduced expenses by 5% and returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders. As you can see on Slide 3 and later in the presentation, our organizational improvements are proceeding on plan, and we're on target to reach our $1.6 billion in gross expense reduction by 2017.
The steady pace of capital return continued throughout the quarter. Our strong capital and leverage ratios, attractive free cash flows and risk management discipline allow us to execute on our plan to return $25 billion of capital to shareholders through 2017. 
We have also provided details on the key drivers of our normalized ROE improvement, including unusual items. It's important to note that normalized ROE may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to discrete tax items as was the case this quarter. Additionally, the seasonality of anticipated catastrophe losses may result in quarterly ROE volatility. These fluctuations should not meaningfully impact full year ROE, and we expect our full year normalized ROE to be within our 8.4% to 8.9% targeted range. 
While we've seen market volatility impact our investments this quarter, the broader macro environment has not altered our focus or the direction of our strategic plans as we -- as was evident in our continued pace of capital return. Today, Rob will speak to the successful execution of our commercial strategy in a competitive property casualty market. Kevin will elaborate on the value of the diversity of our Consumer business and, in particular, the strong earnings growth in Personal Insurance. 
The accomplishments that I'm seeing across the organization are what make me most excited about our future. In my meetings with clients, I found that we are viewed as trusted partners who provide solutions to their most complex risk management needs. We were recently recognized at the Annual RIMS Conferences as the industry's #1 carrier in National Underwriter's Risk Management Choice Awards, a recognition of our industry leadership by our clients. We also improved our competitive position within the group retirement market given our investments in technology, which resulted in greater retention and positive net flows for the first time in 2 years.
Internally, our organizational realignment has eliminated 95% of matrix reporting, which is energizing employees and resulting in faster decision-making. 
Finally, I'd like to mention the news last week of our planned joint venture with Hamilton Re and Two Sigma is consistent with our ability to take advantage of AIG's scale through new initiatives. The joint venture reinforces AIG's commitment to data science and targets the small- to medium-sized enterprise market by combining AIG's expertise in data with Two Sigma's technology platform. 
Before Sid addresses the financials, I'd like to add that we are actively managing our operating and legacy portfolios that we presented on our strategy update call. Our success in managing these 2 portfolios is measured by the ROE improvement of the Operating Portfolio and the reduction in capital retained in our Legacy Portfolio. Under Charlie Shamieh's leadership, the team is focused on execution and is off to a brisk start. We look forward to updating you on his progress in future quarters. We're confident that we're building on the first quarter's accomplishments and moving towards our strategic objectives. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress on our expense initiatives and our active capital management. Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating earnings showed good progress this q",1103,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress on our expense initiatives and our active capital management. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating earnings showed good progress this quarter, with solid underwriting results in both Commercial and Consumer as well as strong expense management. We also reported net favorable reserve development this quarter of approximately $60 million across Commercial and Personal Insurance. 
Looking ahead, while we're only 1 month into the second quarter, our early estimates of losses from earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador, along with the Texas floods, are in a range of $200 million to $300 million, roughly split between our Commercial and Consumer portfolios. Also of note, UGC delivered another strong quarter, driven by improved loss experience and lower expenses. 
Our reported operating tax rate was lower in the first quarter at just over 19%, benefiting from the favorable resolution of certain tax added items in the quarter. We continue to expect our 2016 accrued operating tax rate to be approximately 32%. As a reminder, our valuable deferred tax asset allows us to maximize free cash flow to our parent.
Slide 5 depicts the net investment income trends for interest and dividends and other market-sensitive assets. Interest and dividends on our core investment portfolio has remained very steady at over $3 billion per quarter. Investments that are effectively mark-to-market through earnings contributed to significant volatility in recent quarters and include hedge funds, PICC and ABS/CDO, which were driven by credit spreads. These investments accounted for roughly $870 million of pretax operating losses in the first quarter.
On our January strategy update call, we announced plans to reduce our hedge fund allocation by about half, freeing up $2 billion of capital towards our $25 billion capital return goal by the end of 2017. We kicked off our hedge fund strategy in 2015. As of quarter end, we have submitted notices of redemption for $4.1 billion of our hedge fund portfolio, and as of today, we have received $1.2 billion of proceeds from those redemptions.
Yesterday, we announced the sale of PICC Property Casualty shares for gross proceeds of approximately $1.25 billion that will result in a nonoperating pretax realized gain of nearly $900 million. This transaction will have a positive impact on dividends and tax sharing payments from subsidiaries as well as book value per share ex AOCI and DTA. 
In addition, we monetized $1.7 billion of legacy assets during the first quarter and $3.8 billion over the last 2 quarters. We continue to make progress toward divestiture of UGC with the filing of our S-1, and we are on track to close Advisor Group this quarter. 
With the actions taken today, we are already at the low end of the $5 billion to $7 billion of divestitures that are funding part of our $25 billion capital return target. 
Over the past 4 years, we have reduced our exposure to assets and derivatives that are effectively mark-to-market in earnings by approximately 40%. Future volatility will be reduced by the strategic actions with respect to the hedge funds and Legacy Portfolio that I spoke to.
Turning to Slide 6. We're making good progress on our expense reduction efforts, with total general operating expenses down 5% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the restructuring actions that we took in the latter part of 2015. In addition, we recognized another $188 million of pretax nonoperating restructuring charges in the quarter, which is largely related to the items announced in the second half of 2015. 
As a result of these actions, we expect our annual GOE run rate to decline by approximately $700 million to $800 million on an annualized basis with the larger impact in the second half of 2016. We remain confident in our $1.4 billion net GOE reduction goal by 2017. 
Slide 7 shows the improvement in our normalized ROE from a year ago, which, excluding this quarter's tax benefit, was 8.4%. ROE increased by over 1 point from a year ago due to the nearly $12 billion of capital returned to shareholders in 2015, our focus on expense efficiency and improvements in Personal Insurance underwriting.
Book value per share, ex AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, was essentially flat this quarter at $59.05 per share, as shown on Slide 8, and was negatively impacted by capital markets volatility, including net realized capital losses, which totaled about $700 million after tax in the first quarter. 
Approximately half of those net realized losses were related to noneconomic accounting volatility, resulting from differences in where we report the impact of FX on intercompany liabilities versus the matching available-for-sale investments. The offsetting FX gain on the AFS investments is recorded in AOCI. 
We also realized losses upon the sale of energy positions, which at the end of the quarter represented roughly 5% of our total AFS portfolio. These Q1 items may result in a shortfall to our 2016 book value per share growth target. However, we still expect to achieve double-digit book value per share growth this year. Our ability to reach a 3-year compounded 10% growth in book value per share will, in part, depend on capital markets and macroeconomic conditions.
Slide 9 shows our continued execution against our capital management targets. During the quarter, we deployed about $3.5 billion towards the purchase of approximately 63 million common shares, and we also repurchased 10 million of our outstanding warrants for $173 million. Since quarter end and through May 2, we repurchased an additional 870 million of common shares, which leaves about $3.7 billion unused under the $5 billion authorization that we announced in February. 
During the quarter, we issued $1.5 billion of 5-year senior debt and $1.5 billion of 10-year senior debt. We created incremental economic value for shareholders through the completion of tender offers for approximately $800 million of purchase price of debt, which had a positive NPV. This leaves our financial leverage ratio at the end of the quarter at just shy of 20%, at the low end of our 20% to 25% targeted range that we spoke to on our strategy update call. 
Our RBC and rating agency capital ratios continue to remain within our target. In addition, at quarter end, we had $7.1 billion of parent liquidity. Our balance sheet remains very strong. 
As Peter stated, we look forward to delivering on our strategic plan that we outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress throughout 2016. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Today, I'll begin my remarks on Page 12, which highlights our first quarter and the progress we're making towards our targets. Net premiums written declined 12% after adjusting for foreign exchange. The single largest driver of the decreas",1283,"Thank you, Sid. Today, I'll begin my remarks on Page 12, which highlights our first quarter and the progress we're making towards our targets. Net premiums written declined 12% after adjusting for foreign exchange. The single largest driver of the decrease was the greater use of reinsurance, representing approximately half of the 12% decline. 
Casualty product exits in North America and our remediation efforts also contributed to the decline in the quarter. 
Overall, we expect a decrease of approximately $2.5 billion in net premiums written in 2016, reflecting an increase in our use of reinsurance along with exits from unprofitable lines. This is an increase from our previous $1.5 billion estimate and is consistent with our 4 points of expected accident year loss ratio improvement and an anticipated flat expense ratio. 
We continue to experience new business growth and strong retention in profitable subsegments, and we'll absolutely continue to grow in these areas. Consistent with our vision to be our clients' most valued insurer, we are investing in lines where we offer a compelling value proposition, such as D&O, cyber, M&A, multinational and our large-limit and middle-market property offerings.
Overall, U.S. rates improved almost 1 point in the quarter despite continued rate pressure in the excess and surplus lines of Property business. U.S. Casualty rates increased 3%, which is consistent with what we've seen in the past few quarters, and we expect that trend to continue. 
Rates were modestly positive for Financial Lines in our Specialty businesses in the U.S. I would like to stress that we are thoroughly reviewing granular client retention metrics to differentiate our pricing strategy based on account-by-account profitability. 
Slide 13 shows the continued improvement in Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2011 and the first quarter of 2016, including the effect of prior period development for each accident year, which we previously presented on our strategy call. While the first quarter result of 64.5% included higher-than-expected attritional losses in Property, it represents a 1.7-point improvement over the full year of 2015, and we are on track to reach our 62% exit run rate for 2016. 
In March, we announced a 2-year agreement under which our share of our new and renewed U.S. Casualty business will be ceded to Swiss Re. We do not disclose the details of individual reinsurance agreements, and the Swiss Re deal represents just one of a number of programs we have in place. We extend our thanks to all of our reinsurance partners with whom we are highly aligned for the confidence they have expressed in the continuing improving trend in our portfolio and in our leadership team. Upon expiration of the existing agreements, we expect to have a more profitable book of business and to be well positioned to retain more business or renew our reinsurance agreements under terms that lease as favorable as they are today. 
Collectively, we expect to see approximately $1.5 billion in additional premiums related to quota share reinsurance in 2016 compared to the levels ceded in 2015. The expected 2016 average ceded loss ratio will be at least 5 points higher than 2015, and ceding commissions will continue to cover fully loaded costs for each deal, both individually and in the aggregate. 
The first quarter accident year loss ratio does not reflect the full impact of reinsurance as the benefit will grow each quarter over the next year. We expect that reinsurance will account for close to 2 points of our adjusted accident year loss ratio improvement by the end of 2017. 
On February 2, we formally communicated to our distribution partners that we will no longer offer coverage in 4 specific underperforming portions of our North American casualty and environmental books. By exiting these few highly targeted areas, we have the ability to significantly improve profitability as well as refocus our energy and technical expertise towards industry segments and client partnerships that are mutually beneficial. 
Moving to our risk selection strategy. We achieved improvements in U.S. Casualty and U.S. Property as we continue to optimize our mix of business and accelerate the use of underwriting, pricing and analytic tools. 
With respect to our strategy of sharpening our focus on valued clients, you will recall that in 2015, approximately 83% of our U.S. Casualty clients purchased only 1 or 2 products and that some of those relationships were unprofitable. This represents approximately 15% of total U.S. Casualty premiums, and we successfully remediated the majority of this business as it came up for renewal in the first quarter. 
The top of Slide 14 shows the adjusted accident year loss ratio for each subsegment that made up our $20 billion of net premiums earned in 2015, which falls into 3 product sets: grow, maintain or improve and remediate. The bottom of the page shows the change in size and the accident year loss ratio for each portion of the portfolio for the full year 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
For the first quarter of 2016, we measured size based on net premiums written, which is a leading indicator of our progress since the benefits of our recent actions will emerge in net premiums earned as the year continues. I will highlight 4 key observations for you on this page. 
First, I'm extremely pleased with the portfolio's change in mix of business. The grow and maintain portion of the business has increased from 50% of total premiums in 2015 to 59% of premiums in the first quarter, while the business we are remediating in product set 3 decreased from 15% of the portfolio to 9% over the same time period. 
The second observation is that in addition to reducing the size of product set 3, the accident year loss ratio for this worst-performing portion of the business improved significantly from 91% for the full year 2015 to 86% on an earned basis in the first quarter, driven mostly by the North American casualty and environmental exits.
My third observation is that the improve portion of product set 2 declined from 35% of total premiums in 2015 to 32% of premiums in the first quarter, while we improved the accident year loss ratio on an earned basis by 5 points, from 73% to 68% over that same time period. These changes were primarily the result of our client and risk selection strategy and the expansion of reinsurance. 
Finally, my fourth observation is that our progress will not always be linear due to market conditions, short-tail losses and other issues outside of our control. Product set 1 declined in size from 15% of total premiums in 2015 to 13% of premiums in the first quarter, and the accident year loss ratio increased from 41% to 48% during that time, driven mostly by International Property. 
The accident year loss ratio for product set 1 still remains very strong, and as I mentioned earlier, investing in growth areas is a fundamental part of our strategy. We are deploying a disproportionate amount of our resources to teams focused on product set 1 to anticipate product needs and foster innovation to create value for our clients. 
Our strategy is best characterized as one of focus and pace. We've moved quickly to concentrate our efforts on growing our strongest-performing business and our most valued relationships while continuing to invest in data analytics, innovation and engineering to help our clients better mitigate risk. 
In closing, we took a number of significant actions to improve Commercial's performance for the year. Although there's a lot more work to do, I'm confident that we're headed in the right direction and we're on target with the goals we've communicated. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

This morning, I'll provide an update on the Department of Labor's final rule and discuss the operating performance of our Consumer businesses. 
Beginning with the final Department of Labor fiduciary rule, published on April 8. The initial compliance date is April 10, 2017, with full compliance required by January 1, 2018. We are currently reviewing this final rule to evaluate its full impact on our customers, distribution partners, financial advisers and our business while continuing to prepare for compliance with the rule. 
We remain in active discussions with our distribution partners to be in the best position possible to meet the evolving needs of retirement savers. We plan to continue to offer a broad product portfolio through our diverse distribution network to meet the growing needs of consumers for guaranteed lifetime income and other savings solutions. 
Turning to Retirement results on Slide 16. It was a strong quarter for Retirement sales, with 24% growth from a year ago, led by Fixed Annuities and Retail Mutual Funds. Sales continue to benefit from our multiple product and distribution channel strategy, as reflected in our well-diversified base of assets under management. 
Market volatility during the quarter resulted in a flight to quality and increased investor appetite for Fixed Annuities. While risk-free rates declined, credit spreads were robust, allowing us to provide attractive overall rates while still maintaining our pricing and asset quality disciplines.
Net flows for Retirement this quarter improved both sequentially and year-over-year and notably were positive for each one of our product lines, reflecting the strength of our distribution platform. The positive net flows in Group Retirement reflect our ongoing investments to enhance both our planned sponsor service and participant experience. 
As you can see on Slide 17, we continue to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our base yields will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter. 
In Life, as shown on Slide 18, we saw growth in premiums and deposits of 4% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Mortality trends continue to be in line with our expectations. We saw good growth in U.S. Life sales from the same period last year, reflecting the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of our independent distribution channels. 
We are also making progress in executing on our plans to finance our remaining redundant reserves with a series of reinsurance transactions that will improve the returns in that portfolio and allow for increased distributions to parent. We will provide you with updates on these transactions as they are completed. 
Turning to Slide 19. The first quarter was very strong for Personal with $22 million of pretax operating income. We saw significant improvement in the accident year loss ratio in the U.S., which primarily related to U.S. personal property, which experienced fewer large claims and generated an increase in premiums. 
We also continue to see strong premium growth in our Private Client Group in the U.S. Net premiums written for PCG were up 13% from the same period last year, with 9 consecutive months of double-digit growth. 
We also continue to make progress on the expense front in Personal Insurance, and we are seeing benefits from our strategy to narrow our focus to 15 countries for individual Personal Insurance products while continuing to serve our multinational partners. 
In addition, we are seeing the results of our overall organizational expense initiatives. Japan delivered a meaningful part of the acquisition costs and GOE savings this quarter, and acquisition costs benefited from our efforts to reposition direct marketing in Japan. While we continue to expect that expenses will be the key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments. 
With respect to Japan, we remain focused on a successful execution of the merger, as we have previously reported. 
To close, while we have already experienced some catastrophe and severe loss events, as Sid highlighted, that will impact Personal Insurance operating results in the second quarter, we remain focused on continued execution of our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses. 
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A."

So what I said in my prepared remarks is that we have -- we expect to see $1.5 billion of additional premiums related to quota share in 2016 compared to the 2015 levels, so we already were using quota share in 2015. The increase from all reinsurance transactions, Swiss Re and other, during 2016, we expect to increase the amount that we see by $1.5 billion. So as we write business throughout the course of 2016, a piece of the business that we write in 2016 will attach to this quota share reinsurance agreement. And you should think of it as that premium volume on a net written premium basis will decline, but it won't affect earned premium until those premiums earn in over the course of the next year after the date they have been written. So for example, premiums written on December 31, 2016, will be covered by a reinsurance agreement that was covering the year 2016 on a quota share basis, but those premiums won't be fully earned until December 31, 2017, so you'll feel the full effect of that in our income statement across the -- really, across the -- a year after the premiums have been written.

You'll notice when I commented about rates, I said that Property rates in the U.S. were down in the first quarter, and that's actually been a continuing theme over the course of the last 2 years at least. Our growth in Property has been focused on the highly engineered space. As we mentioned previously, we've increased the number of engineers on our team today to be approximately 700 engineers worldwide. Most of those engineers support our Property business but not solely our Property business. And actually today, we have more engineers than underwriters in the U.S. property market. So when we're growing in Property, what we're doing is transforming our book from being one where we were a capital provider amongst many to instead being a risk management partner with our clients where we're using our engineering capability to reduce the likelihood of a loss in the first place. And so our growth in that area is in the large-limit Property space and in the middle-market Property space where engineering is the backbone of the business that we're writing. We're shrinking in the traditional excess and surplus lines shared in layered Property business."

But ultimately, the business that we're ceding to those reinsurers is improving, our mix of business and ultimately not passing business that is poor business from AIG to our reinsurers, but instead, the reinsurers, I think, find the business that we're ceding attractive for a number of reasons, including the fact that -- many, in many cases, they're holding less capital against the business that -- than we are. And many of our reinsurers also have a lower targeted return level than AIG has. And then of course, I think that the reinsurers really believe in the underwriting actions that we've taken.

So I would say that there is contingency against adverse market environment even baked into our plan, so I do not think that being a SIFI in any way inhibits that $25 billion goal. It's not a binding constraint at all. But I think that the MetLife decision certainly raises the opportunity should it be favorable to consider that down the road. But I repeat that our current designation as a nonbank SIFI does not constrain our objectives as laid out in our strategic update. So we are watching very carefully the appeal process, and we point to the efforts that we made as a company to delever the company, to derisk the company since the crisis. And so I think that any designation by FSOC around nonbank SIFI status should look at the metrics relative to others to show what we have done to delever the company. And so I think that we have great confidence that our plan to improve operating margins, to return capital to shareholders will deliver expansion in ROE in our Operating Portfolio, and thoughtful divestiture of the legacy assets in an orderly way will realize the optimal balance between book value growth and ROE expansion."

And as we've said we would, we've taken clear action to exit specific underperforming products and client relationships, but remember, we can only do that as those policies come up for renewal with proper notification in accordance with the state laws and regulations. We've also given our underwriters better tools to help them make good judgments in their underwriting decisions. And I think all of those things should continue to show that product set 3 will decline in size and the loss ratio will improve. Product set 2, the middle part, I think you'll just continue to see growth in the maintained size of product set 2, and you'll see us continue to improve both the loss ratio and reduce the size of the improved size of product set 2. But we do expect to grow in product set 1. I think that reinsurance is really serving to help us in product set 2 more than anything. And that's the place -- what you should understand is really our actions to exit and our actions to remediate that are driving down the volume of product set 3, and you should also expect that we'll continue to disproportionately put our resources toward the growth in product set 1.

I'm happy to report the tangible progress we're making as we deliver on our strategic plan. Across AIG, we're working hard to execute on a transformation that will lead to improved profitability and will best serve all our stakeholders. As we've been repositioning the company, the support of our brokers, clients and employees has been greatly appreciated and is essential to our success.
In the first quarter, we reported $0.65 of operating earnings per share, including market-related losses of $0.48 largely due to hedge funds. Our market-sensitive assets continue to decline, and Sid will speak to our progress to further reduce these asset exposures. 
We're off to a solid start to the year, and in the quarter, we reduced expenses by 5% and returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders. As you can see on Slide 3 and later in the presentation, our organizational improvements are proceeding on plan, and we're on target to reach our $1.6 billion in gross expense reduction by 2017.
The steady pace of capital return continued throughout the quarter. Our strong capital and leverage ratios, attractive free cash flows and risk management discipline allow us to execute on our plan to return $25 billion of capital to shareholders through 2017. 
We have also provided details on the key drivers of our normalized ROE improvement, including unusual items. It's important to note that normalized ROE may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to discrete tax items as was the case this quarter. Additionally, the seasonality of anticipated catastrophe losses may result in quarterly ROE volatility. These fluctuations should not meaningfully impact full year ROE, and we expect our full year normalized ROE to be within our 8.4% to 8.9% targeted range. 
While we've seen market volatility impact our investments this quarter, the broader macro environment has not altered our focus or the direction of our strategic plans as we -- as was evident in our continued pace of capital return. Today, Rob will speak to the successful execution of our commercial strategy in a competitive property casualty market. Kevin will elaborate on the value of the diversity of our Consumer business and, in particular, the strong earnings growth in Personal Insurance. 
The accomplishments that I'm seeing across the organization are what make me most excited about our future. In my meetings with clients, I found that we are viewed as trusted partners who provide solutions to their most complex risk management needs. We were recently recognized at the Annual RIMS Conferences as the industry's #1 carrier in National Underwriter's Risk Management Choice Awards, a recognition of our industry leadership by our clients. We also improved our competitive position within the group retirement market given our investments in technology, which resulted in greater retention and positive net flows for the first time in 2 years.
Internally, our organizational realignment has eliminated 95% of matrix reporting, which is energizing employees and resulting in faster decision-making. 
Finally, I'd like to mention the news last week of our planned joint venture with Hamilton Re and Two Sigma is consistent with our ability to take advantage of AIG's scale through new initiatives. The joint venture reinforces AIG's commitment to data science and targets the small- to medium-sized enterprise market by combining AIG's expertise in data with Two Sigma's technology platform. 
Before Sid addresses the financials, I'd like to add that we are actively managing our operating and legacy portfolios that we presented on our strategy update call. Our success in managing these 2 portfolios is measured by the ROE improvement of the Operating Portfolio and the reduction in capital retained in our Legacy Portfolio. Under Charlie Shamieh's leadership, the team is focused on execution and is off to a brisk start. We look forward to updating you on his progress in future quarters. We're confident that we're building on the first quarter's accomplishments and moving towards our strategic objectives. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."
250388,330034408,970901,"American International Group, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","American International Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress on our expense initiatives and our active capital management. Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating earnings showed good progress this q",1103,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, progress on our expense initiatives and our active capital management. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating earnings showed good progress this quarter, with solid underwriting results in both Commercial and Consumer as well as strong expense management. We also reported net favorable reserve development this quarter of approximately $60 million across Commercial and Personal Insurance. 
Looking ahead, while we are only 1 month into the second quarter, our early estimates of losses from earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador, along with the Texas floods, are in a range of $200 million to $300 million, roughly split between our Commercial and Consumer portfolios. Also of note, UGC delivered another strong quarter, driven by improved loss experience and lower expenses. 
Our reported operating tax rate was lower in the first quarter at just over 19%, benefiting from the favorable resolution of certain tax audit items in the quarter. We continue to expect our 2016 accrued operating tax rate to be approximately 32%. As a reminder, our valuable deferred tax asset allows us to maximize free cash flow to our parent.
Slide 5 depicts the net investment income trends for interest and dividends and other market-sensitive assets. Interest and dividends on our core investment portfolio has remained very steady at over $3 billion per quarter. Investments that are effectively mark-to-market through earnings contributed to significant volatility in recent quarters and include hedge funds, PICC and ABS/CDOs, which were driven by credit spreads. These investments accounted for roughly $870 million of pretax operating losses in the first quarter.
On our January strategy update call, we announced plans to reduce our hedge fund allocation by about half, freeing up $2 billion of capital towards our $25 billion capital return goal by the end of 2017. We kicked off our hedge fund strategy in 2015. As of quarter end, we have submitted notices of redemption for $4.1 billion of our hedge fund portfolio, and as of today, we have received $1.2 billion of proceeds from those redemptions.
Yesterday, we announced the sale of PICC Property Casualty shares for gross proceeds of approximately $1.25 billion that will result in a nonoperating pretax realized gain of nearly $900 million. This transaction will have a positive impact on dividends and tax-sharing payments from subsidiaries as well as book value per share ex AOCI and DTA. 
In addition, we monetized $1.7 billion of legacy assets during the first quarter and $3.8 billion over the last 2 quarters. We continue to make progress toward divestiture of UGC with the filing of our S-1, and we are on track to close Advisor Group this quarter. 
With the actions taken today, we are already at the low end of the $5 billion to $7 billion of divestitures that are funding part of our $25 billion capital return target. 
Over the past 4 years, we have reduced our exposure to assets and derivatives that are effectively mark-to-market in earnings by approximately 40%. Future volatility will be reduced by the strategic actions with respect to the hedge funds and Legacy Portfolio that I spoke to.
Turning to Slide 6. We're making good progress on our expense reduction efforts, with total general operating expenses down 5% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the restructuring actions that we took in the latter part of 2015. In addition, we recognized another $188 million of pretax nonoperating restructuring charges in the quarter, which is largely related to the items announced in the second half of 2015. 
As a result of these actions, we expect our annual GOE run rate to decline by approximately $700 million to $800 million on an annualized basis with the larger impact in the second half of 2016. We remain confident in our $1.4 billion net GOE reduction goal by 2017. 
Slide 7 shows the improvement in our normalized ROE from a year ago, which, excluding this quarter's tax benefit, was 8.4%. ROE increased by over 1 point from a year ago due to the nearly $12 billion of capital returned to shareholders in 2015, our focus on expense efficiency and improvements in Personal Insurance underwriting.
Book value per share, ex AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, was essentially flat this quarter at $59.05 per share, as shown on Slide 8, and was negatively impacted by capital markets volatility, including net realized capital losses, which totaled about $700 million after tax in the first quarter. 
Approximately half of those net realized losses were related to noneconomic accounting volatility, resulting from differences in where we report the impact of FX on intercompany liabilities versus the matching available-for-sale investments. The offsetting FX gain on the AFS investments is recorded in AOCI. 
We also realized losses upon the sale of energy positions, which at the end of the quarter represented roughly 5% of our total AFS portfolio. These Q1 items may result in a shortfall to our 2016 book value per share growth target. However, we still expect to achieve double-digit book value per share growth this year. Our ability to reach a 3-year compounded 10% growth in book value per share will, in part, depend on capital markets and macroeconomic conditions.
Slide 9 shows our continued execution against our capital management targets. During the quarter, we deployed about $3.5 billion towards the purchase of approximately 63 million common shares, and we also repurchased 10 million of our outstanding warrants for $173 million. Since quarter end and through May 2, we repurchased an additional 870 million of common shares, which leaves about $3.7 billion unused under the $5 billion authorization that we announced in February. 
During the quarter, we issued $1.5 billion of 5-year senior debt and $1.5 billion of 10-year senior debt. We created incremental economic value for shareholders through the completion of tender offers for approximately $800 million of purchase price of debt, which had a positive NPV. This leaves our financial leverage ratio at the end of the quarter at just shy of 20%, at the low end of our 20% to 25% targeted range that we spoke to on our strategy update call. 
Our RBC and rating agency capital ratios continue to remain within our targets. In addition, at quarter end, we had $7.1 billion of parent liquidity. Our balance sheet remains very strong. 
As Peter stated, we look forward to delivering on our strategic plan that we outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress throughout 2016. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."
250388,330034408,970901,"American International Group, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","American International Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sid. Today, I'll begin my remarks on Page 12, which highlights our first quarter and the progress we're making towards our targets. Net premiums written declined 12% after adjusting for foreign exchange. The single largest driver of the decreas",1281,"Thank you, Sid. Today, I'll begin my remarks on Page 12, which highlights our first quarter and the progress we're making towards our targets. Net premiums written declined 12% after adjusting for foreign exchange. The single largest driver of the decrease was the greater use of reinsurance, representing approximately half of the 12% decline. 
Casualty product exits in North America and our remediation efforts also contributed to the decline in the quarter. 
Overall, we expect a decrease of approximately $2.5 billion in net premiums written in 2016, reflecting an increase in our use of reinsurance along with exits from unprofitable lines. This is an increase from our previous $1.5 billion estimate and is consistent with our 4 points of expected accident year loss ratio improvement and an anticipated flat expense ratio. 
We continue to experience new business growth and strong retention in profitable subsegments, and we'll absolutely continue to grow in these areas. Consistent with our vision to be our clients' most valued insurer, we are investing in lines where we offer a compelling value proposition, such as D&O, cyber, M&A, multinational and our large-limit and middle-market property offerings.
Overall, U.S. rates improved almost 1 point in the quarter despite continued rate pressure in the excess and surplus lines of Property business. U.S. Casualty rates increased 3%, which is consistent with what we've seen in the past few quarters, and we expect that trend to continue. 
Rates were modestly positive for Financial Lines in our Specialty businesses in the U.S. I would like to stress that we are thoroughly reviewing granular client retention metrics to differentiate our pricing strategy based on account-by-account profitability. 
Slide 13 shows the continued improvement in Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2011 and the first quarter of 2016, including the effect of prior period development for each accident year, which we previously presented on our strategy call. While the first quarter result of 64.5% included higher-than-expected attritional losses in Property, it represents a 1.7-point improvement over the full year of 2015, and we are on track to reach our 62% exit run rate for 2016. 
In March, we announced a 2-year agreement under which a share of our new and renewal U.S. Casualty business will be ceded to Swiss Re. We do not disclose the details of individual reinsurance agreements, and the Swiss Re deal represents just one of a number of programs we have in place. We extend our thanks to all of our reinsurance partners with whom we are highly aligned for the confidence they have expressed in the continuing improving trend in our portfolio and in our leadership team. Upon expiration of the existing agreements, we expect to have a more profitable book of business and to be well positioned to retain more business or renew our reinsurance agreements under terms that lease as favorable as they are today. 
Collectively, we expect to see approximately $1.5 billion in additional premiums related to quota share reinsurance in 2016 compared to the levels ceded in 2015. The expected 2016 average ceded loss ratio will be at least 5 points higher than 2015, and ceding commissions will continue to cover fully loaded costs for each deal, both individually and in the aggregate. 
The first quarter accident year loss ratio does not reflect the full impact of reinsurance as the benefit will grow each quarter over the next year. We expect that reinsurance will account for close to 2 points of our adjusted accident year loss ratio improvement by the end of 2017. 
On February 2, we formally communicated to our distribution partners that we will no longer offer coverage in 4 specific underperforming portions of our North American casualty and environmental books. By exiting these few highly targeted areas, we have the ability to significantly improve profitability as well as refocus our energy and technical expertise towards industry segments and client partnerships that are mutually beneficial. 
Moving to our risk selection strategy. We achieved improvements in U.S. Casualty and U.S. Property as we continued to optimize our mix of business and accelerate the use of underwriting, pricing and analytic tools. 
With respect to our strategy of sharpening our focus on valued clients, you will recall that in 2015, approximately 83% of our U.S. Casualty clients purchased only 1 or 2 products and that some of those relationships were unprofitable. This represents approximately 15% of total U.S. Casualty premiums, and we successfully remediated the majority of this business as it came up for renewal in the first quarter. 
The top of Slide 14 shows the adjusted accident year loss ratio for each subsegment that made up our $20 billion of net premiums earned in 2015, which falls into 3 product sets: grow, maintain or improve and remediate. The bottom of the page shows the change in size and the accident year loss ratio for each portion of the portfolio for the full year 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
For the first quarter of 2016, we measured size based on net premiums written, which is a leading indicator of our progress since the benefits of our recent actions will emerge in net premiums earned as the year continues. I will highlight 4 key observations for you on this page. 
First, I'm extremely pleased with the portfolio's change in mix of business. The grow-and-maintain portion of the business has increased from 50% of total premiums in 2015 to 59% of premiums in the first quarter, while the business we are remediating in product set 3 decreased from 15% of the portfolio to 9% over the same time period. 
The second observation is that in addition to reducing the size of product set 3, the accident year loss ratio for this worst-performing portion of the business improved significantly from 91% for the full year 2015 to 86% on an earned basis in the first quarter, driven mostly by the North American casualty and environmental exits.
My third observation is that the improved portion of product set 2 declined from 35% of total premiums in 2015 to 32% of premiums in the first quarter, while we improved the accident year loss ratio on an earned basis by 5 points, from 73% to 68% over that same time period. These changes were primarily the result of our client and risk selection strategy and the expansion of reinsurance. 
Finally, my fourth observation is that our progress will not always be linear due to market conditions, short-tail losses and other issues outside of our control. Product set 1 declined in size from 15% of total premiums in 2015 to 13% of premiums in the first quarter, and the accident year loss ratio increased from 41% to 48% during that time, driven mostly by International Property. 
The accident year loss ratio for product set 1 still remains very strong, and as I mentioned earlier, investing in growth areas is a fundamental part of our strategy. We are deploying a disproportionate amount of our resources to teams focused on product set 1 to anticipate product needs and foster innovation to create value for our clients. 
Our strategy is best characterized as one of focus and pace. We've moved quickly to concentrate our efforts on growing our strongest-performing business and our most valued relationships while continuing to invest in data analytics, innovation and engineering to help our clients better mitigate risk. 
In closing, we took a number of significant actions to improve Commercial's performance for the year. Although there's a lot more work to do, I'm confident that we're headed in the right direction and we're on target with the goals we've communicated. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

This morning, I'll provide an update on the Department of Labor's final rule and discuss the operating performance of our Consumer businesses. 
Beginning with the final Department of Labor fiduciary rule, published on April 8. The initial compliance date is April 10, 2017, with full compliance required by January 1, 2018. We are currently reviewing this final rule to evaluate its full impact on our customers, distribution partners, financial advisers and our business while continuing to prepare for compliance with the rule. 
We remain in active discussions with our distribution partners to be in the best position possible to meet the evolving needs of retirement savers. We plan to continue to offer a broad product portfolio through our diverse distribution network to meet the growing needs of consumers for guaranteed lifetime income and other savings solutions. 
Turning to Retirement results on Slide 16. It was a strong quarter for Retirement sales, with 24% growth from a year ago, led by Fixed Annuities and Retail Mutual Funds. Sales continued to benefit from our multiple product and distribution channel strategy, as reflected in our well-diversified base of assets under management. 
Market volatility during the quarter resulted in a flight to quality and increased investor appetite for Fixed Annuities. While risk-free rates declined, credit spreads were robust, allowing us to provide attractive overall rates while still maintaining our pricing and asset quality disciplines.
Net flows for Retirement this quarter improved both sequentially and year-over-year and notably were positive for each one of our product lines, reflecting the strength of our distribution platform. The positive net flows in Group Retirement reflect our ongoing investments to enhance both our planned sponsor service and participant experience. 
As you can see on Slide 17, we continued to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our base yields will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter. 
In Life, as shown on Slide 18, we saw growth in premiums and deposits of 4% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Mortality trends continue to be in line with our expectations. We saw good growth in U.S. Life sales from the same period last year, reflecting the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of our independent distribution channels. 
We are also making progress in executing on our plans to finance our remaining redundant reserves with a series of reinsurance transactions that will improve the returns in that portfolio and allow for increased distributions to parent. We will provide you with updates on these transactions as they are completed. 
Turning to Slide 19. The first quarter was very strong for Personal Insurance with $222 million of pretax operating income. We saw significant improvement in the accident year loss ratio in the U.S., which primarily related to U.S. personal property, which experienced fewer large claims and generated an increase in premiums. 
We also continue to see strong premium growth in our Private Client Group in the U.S. Net premiums written for PCG were up 13% from the same period last year, with 9 consecutive months of double-digit growth. 
We also continue to make progress on the expense front in Personal Insurance, and we are seeing benefits from our strategy to narrow our focus to 15 countries for individual Personal Insurance products while continuing to serve our multinational partners. 
In addition, we are seeing the results of our overall organizational expense initiatives. Japan delivered a meaningful part of the acquisition costs and GOE savings this quarter, and acquisition costs benefited from our efforts to reposition direct marketing in Japan. While we continue to expect that expenses will be the key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments. 
With respect to Japan, we remain focused on a successful execution of the merger, as we have previously reported. 
To close, while we have already experienced some catastrophe and severe loss events, as Sid highlighted, that will impact Personal Insurance operating results in the second quarter, we remain focused on continued execution of our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses. 
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A."

Our progress with respect to the longer-tail lines, Casualty in particular, was better than we had expected. But our progress with respect to shorter-tail lines, Property, was the area that I think that we didn't live up to my expectations.

The increase from all reinsurance transactions, Swiss Re and other, during 2016, we expect to increase the amount that we cede by $1.5 billion. So as we write business throughout the course of 2016, a piece of the business that we write in 2016 will attach to this quota share reinsurance agreement. And you should think of it as that premium volume on a net written premium basis will decline, but it won't affect earned premium until those premiums earn in over the course of the next year after the date they have been written. So for example, premiums written on December 31, 2016, will be covered by a reinsurance agreement that was covering the year 2016 on a quota share basis, but those premiums won't be fully earned until December 31, 2017, so you'll feel the full effect of that in our income statement across the -- really, across the -- a year after the premiums have been written.

You'll notice when I commented about rates, I said that Property rates in the U.S. were down in the first quarter, and that's actually been a continuing theme over the course of the last 2 years at least. Our growth in Property has been focused on the highly engineered space. As we mentioned previously, we've increased the number of engineers on our team today to be approximately 700 engineers worldwide. Most of those engineers support our Property business but not solely our Property business. And actually today, we have more engineers than underwriters in the U.S. property market. So when we're growing in Property, what we're doing is transforming our book from being one where we were a capital provider amongst many to instead being a risk management partner with our clients where we're using our engineering capability to reduce the likelihood of a loss in the first place. And so our growth in that area is in the large-limit Property space and in the middle-market Property space where engineering is the backbone of the business that we're writing. We're shrinking in the traditional excess and surplus lines shared in layered Property business."

But ultimately, the business that we're ceding to those reinsurers is improving, our mix of business and ultimately not passing business that is poor business from AIG to our reinsurers, but instead, the reinsurers, I think, find the business that we're ceding attractive for a number of reasons, including the fact that -- many, in many cases, they're holding less capital against the business that -- than we are. And many of our reinsurers also have a lower targeted return level than AIG has. And then of course, I think that the reinsurers really believe in the underwriting actions that we've taken.

So I would say that there is contingency against adverse market environment even baked into our plan, so I do not think that being a SIFI in any way inhibits that $25 billion goal. It's not a binding constraint at all. But I think that the MetLife decision certainly raises the opportunity should it be favorable to consider that down the road. But I repeat that our current designation as a nonbank SIFI does not constrain our objectives as laid out in our strategic update. So we are watching very carefully the appeal process, and we point to the efforts that we made as a company to delever the company, to derisk the company since the crisis. And so I think that any designation by FSOC around nonbank SIFI status should look at the metrics relative to others to show what we have done to delever the company. And so I think that we have great confidence that our plan to improve operating margins, to return capital to shareholders will deliver expansion in ROE in our Operating Portfolio, and thoughtful divestiture of the legacy assets in an orderly way will realize the optimal balance between book value growth and ROE expansion."

We'll show the best 15%, the worst 15% and then the middle part of the portfolio. I clearly believe that what you should expect is that for the business that we hold on our books in 2015 that we've been working on remediating, you should continue to see product set 3 significantly reduce in size. And as we've said we would, we've taken clear action to exit specific underperforming products and client relationships, but remember, we can only do that as those policies come up for renewal with proper notification in accordance with the state laws and regulations. We've also given our underwriters better tools to help them make good judgments in their underwriting decisions. And I think all of those things should continue to show that product set 3 will decline in size and the loss ratio will improve. Product set 2, the middle part, I think you'll just continue to see growth in the maintained size of product set 2, and you'll see us continue to improve both the loss ratio and reduce the size of the improved size of product set 2. But we do expect to grow in product set 1. I think that reinsurance is really serving to help us in product set 2 more than anything. And that's the place -- what you should understand is really our actions to exit and our actions to remediate that are driving down the volume of product set 3.

This morning, I'll speak briefly to our performance this quarter as well as our outlook and ongoing transformation. AIG's second quarter results showed strong improvement towards all the goals the board and I",513,"Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll speak briefly to our performance this quarter as well as our outlook and ongoing transformation. 
AIG's second quarter results showed strong improvement towards all the goals the board and I announced in January. We executed more quickly and smoothly than expected and our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets is high as our earnings become a more sustainable. 
In the second quarter, we continue to execute and deliver strong operating earnings of $0.98 per share, including a $0.17 charge from the workers' compensation discount which Sid will discuss. Adjusted Commercial Insurance underwriting improved again this quarter, which Rob will speak to. Consumers expense discipline also resulted in increased profitability, particularly in Personal Insurance and Kevin will address this in his remarks. 
Across AIG, we are simplifying the company, accelerating our decision-making and adhering to a consistent management philosophy. We're executing on our objectives of managing our core operating portfolios to increase the return on equity and managing our Legacy Portfolio for capital return. 
As we had previously announced, Charlie Shamieh is leading a team focused on our Legacy Portfolio and is actively moving forward. 
Our managerial discipline across AIG is based on a guiding principle of building a economic value, which is consistently applied throughout the company. We frequently discuss our focus on value over volume when speaking to Commercial underwriting and the value of the business for Consumer businesses. The flexibility we have earned by focusing on expense discipline and growth in segments with sustainable value has allowed us to maintain positive operating leverage, while we have reduced our top line aggressively.
Normalized ROE was 8.8% for both the quarter and the first 6 months of this year. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE and was solidly on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. As a reminder, our third quarter normalized ROE will reflect a higher level of expected catastrophe losses. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, increased 5% in the quarter and we continue to expect to achieve double-digit growth for the full year. 
Our confidence in the future is based on our focus on what we can control. Our active value management framework for capital allocation and product design allows us to navigate through volatile markets. At this time, AIG's consummation to a more efficient and nimble organization is more important than ever. We anticipate and address challenges, such as sustained low interest rates, Brexit and other market forces across our strategies. Sid will follow my remarks with greater transparency on the impact of low interest rate, specifically. 
In the case of Brexit, we believe we're well-positioned given our branch structure. It may be sometime before the requirements associated with Brexit are known and any potential economic impact from Brexit materializes. We're positioning AIG for changing economic, political and regulatory environment and for future earnings and sustainability. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, including notable items. I'll also discuss the impact of the current interest rate environment and close with comments on capital management. 
Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings showed good progress this quarter with strong underwriting results, particularly with respect to the Commercial accident year loss ratio as adjusted and expense discipline across AIG. In addition, UTC delivered another quarter of solid results, driven by improved loss experience and growth in net premiums earned. 
Our year-on-year comparisons were impacted by 4 items of note. First, the workers' compensation discount amounted to a $300 million charge this quarter versus a $400 million benefit. The workers' compensation discount rate adjustments are recorded in earnings, while offsetting changes in fair value of securities backing these liabilities are recorded to AOCI. This results in minimal impact to reported book value. Accordingly, when we report on normalized ROE, we remove this noneconomic change in net reserve discount. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate, which comprised of the U.S. Treasury rates, plus an assumed credit spread, has roughly $100 million to $125 million pretax impact on reported earnings.
The second item was a modest $29 million of overall net unfavorable prior year reserve development compared to a net unfavorable development of $329 million a year ago. Included in the quarter was $109 million strengthening of Florida Worker's Compensation reserves, partially offset by favorable reserve development in Property and Specialty lines. The Florida Worker's Compensation reserve increase was due to recent industry-wide Florida court rulings, which occurred during the quarter. The judgment's created an increased liability for previous years, which made a reserve increase in this segment prudent. AIG has a 5% market share in Florida and an average market share of 8% for the past 10- and 15-year periods. 
The third item was that Q2 was our highest natural catastrophe quarter since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. We had higher CAT losses in the quarter of $414 million compared to the roughly in line level of the $225 million in catastrophe for the prior year. 
The final item was the meaningful change in market sensitive asset returns as shown on Slide 5. Overall, the impact of last year's outsized Q2 returns and our actions to reduce the market sensitive assets resulted in approximately $1 billion decline in mark-to-market income versus a year ago. However, of note in the quarter, these assets contributed just under $300 million to income, which was close to our expectation. Our steps to reduce market exposure will allow for more sustainable and less volatile earnings going forward. Since 2010, our market sensitive assets have declined by over 40% or by $19 billion. 
Turning to Slide 6, we've provided an overview of the impact interest rates may have on our in-force as well as on new business for key portfolios. With respect to the in-force, we have strong discipline around asset liability management led by our Chief Investment Officer, Doug Dachille. We see limited in-force impact on long-tail casualty where assets are slightly longer than liabilities and on variable annuities where in 2014 we made a decision to fully hedge the interest risk on leading benefits, which is accounted for at fair value. 
On Fixed Annuities, approximately 72% of the book is already in guaranteed minimum credit agreements. The sustained low rates may reduce to lenders and we see potential spread compression from declining portfolio yields. We're projecting a 2 to 4 basis point quarterly decline in net spreads. 
Our Life business and Legacy structured settlements, while we're exposed to some potential ALM mismatch on the long end of the curve due to limited investable assets, its impact on earnings in the next few years is modest, although it will grow somewhat over a very long time horizon with reinvestment.
On new business, we maintained a continued focus on pricing, product design and risk management across AIG. We expect some ROE compression in long-tail casualty, however, we continue to push on pricing and risk selection. For our annuity businesses, we expect the primary impact to be a decline in volumes as we frequently reevaluate our products to ensure that we're meeting our return targets. 
Considering both the in-force and new business, we're presenting a scenario to illustrate the potential headwinds to our January 26 dated targets from the current environment. The 2017 average 10-year treasury assumption that was used in our plan was 2.6%. Assuming interest rates are 100 basis points lower than our original 2.6% assumption, we would anticipate a potential 25 to 35 basis point reduction in 2017 normalized ROE based on a decline in normalized pretax operating income of $250 million to $350 million. However, if rates were to move steadily higher from the levels today back to our initial projection, we would not expect this impact to materialize. 
Also, as Peter said, our guiding philosophy is around managing to economic value. Since year-end, we estimate the decline in interest rate and markets has impacted our estimate of intrinsic value by approximately 5%. Despite the challenging interest rate environment, we remain committed our stated targets. We believe that our ability to manage our expense and capital structures we'll discuss where we're ahead plan give us the ability to withstand potential 2017 earnings pressures.
Turning to Slide 7. We've executed against our plan have operating expenses by 11% year-to-date on a constant dollar basis. While the pace of this improvement should slow in the second half of the year, we expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections and new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. 
Slide 8 shows the expansion of our second quarter normalized ROE to 8.8%. This improvement reflected almost $15 billion of capital return to shareholders since the second quarter of 2015, as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results. 
Slide 9 shows a strong growth in the value driven by earnings, realized capital gains, our estimated utilization and accretive share repurchases during the quarter. 
Turning to capital on Slide 10, we continue to execute against our $25 billion capital return target and have returned $7.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first half of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.8 billion towards the purchase of 50 million common shares, and we also repurchased 5 million of our outstanding warrants for $90 million. Since quarter end and through August 2, we repurchased an additional 698 million of common shares. Our remaining authorization stands at approximately $4 billion, including the new $3 billion authorization announced yesterday. Our balance sheet remains very strong with $6.7 billion of parent liquidity, a financial leverage ratio below 20% and RBC and rating agency capital ratios that continue to remain within our targets.
With respect to the key levers funding our capital return target, free cash flow continued to be strong in the second quarter, as shown on Slide 11. We announced that we would reduce our hedge fund allocation by about half, which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. Submitted notices of redemption are $4.2 billion and through the second quarter, proceeds have freed up approximately $400 million in capital in our Life companies, which have come up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments. Additionally, distributions from the life companies during the quarter included $315 million from the sale of AIG Advisor Group. 
We continue to make solid progress on monetizing Legacy assets with $4.3 billion of total free cash flow generated over the last 3 quarters. During the quarter, the holding company recognized $500 million of proceeds largely from the sale of the PICC Group state held at parent to the nonlife companies. We have completed the majority of the encumbered asset dispositions or transferred outlined in our January 26 strategic plan as of the end of the second quarter. Charlie Shamieh and his team are focused on the disposition process going forward for many of the insurance liabilities in Legacy, which we have ticked off for several portfolios. It is important to note that some of the Legacy insurance portfolios will have more extended time frames for exit. We'll provide further disclosure at year-end with our modular segment reporting for Legacy and provide additional information on a timely basis as we close any material transactions that are in progress. 
As Peter stated, we're focused on continued execution of our strategic plan that we first outlined in January and provide you with additional disclosure as we progressed through 2016. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Commercial had a strong second quarter despite the backdrop of a generally soft market. Today, I'll discuss how the execution of our strategic plan is improving Commercial's mix of business and creating a leaner, more focused and profitable organization. We're committed to making economic-based decisions, while we remain true to our vision of being our clients' most value insurer.
Turning to Slide 13. Commercial's adjusted action loss year ratio 62.4% improved 4.2 points from the prior year quarter with 3.4 points related to the strategic actions we announced in January and 0.8 points attributable to a lower level of severe losses. We reduced second quarter net premium writings by 20% after adjusting for foreign exchange as part of reshaping of the portfolio. About half of the change was driven by increasing our use of reinsurance, the targeted exits we communicated in the first quarter and market headwinds from lower rates. The vast majority of the other half was attributable to underwriting actions in performing poorer performing subsegments of Casualty and Property. These actions included addressing unprofitable single or 2-product client relationships and micro-segmentation and re-underwriting using enhanced analytics tools. As always, we make underwriting decisions initially on a product basis and then on a client-by-client basis taking a holistic view across each client relationship. We've placed the priority on limiting disruption for our clients and broker partners and preserving the strength of our valued multi-line client relationships. Retention for our major clients remain very healthy at about 94% on a year-to-date basis.
Our objective is to deploy our capital in higher performing subsegments where we earn our target rate of return. The market is practicing less restraint and we've taken advantage of the opportunity to shed underperforming and highly commoditized businesses, while having the flexibility to retain more attractive risk with the same clients. As a result of the pace of our actions and underwriting discipline, we're updating our 2016 full year estimates to reflect managing net premiums written down by a total of approximately $3 billion in 2016 as we seek to optimize our portfolio.
Globally, rates were down about 1 point, reflecting competitive international conditions, while overall rates in the U.S. were about flat. U.S. Casualty rates continued their positive trend increasing over 4.5 points and rates were up 2 points in our Specialty businesses. Partially offsetting those increases, we continue to observe pressure in the excess and surplus lines Property business and we saw more aggressive pricing in Financial Lines where rates decreased about 2%.
I'm pleased to say that during the first half of 2016, we recorded double-digit growth in several lines where we are a market leader and also a compelling value proposition, including M&A, middle-market property, cyber and credit lines. In addition, multinational programs increased by approximately 9%, demonstrating our enduring advantage in this important client segment and we continue to experience growth in large limit Property. We're placing emphasis on investing in analytics and engineering capabilities to offer our clients unique data-driven insights that go beyond traditional risk transfer capabilities. 
Switching gears to expenses. I'm happy to share that our GOE ratio improved 1.2 points in the quarter as a result of AIG's expense initiatives. We expect that expenses will continue to decline, although at a more modest pace in the second half of the year. The GOE ratio will likely trend slightly upward from its current level as the impact of lower written premiums earn in during the remainder of 2016 and 2017. With that said, we're proud that the improvements in our loss resort are not expected to be significantly offset by deterioration of our expense ratio. 
Slide 14 shows the continued improvement in Commercial's adjusted exit loss ratio between 2011 and the second quarter of 2016, including the effect of 2012 through 2015 prior period development in each accident year. The second quarter resulted 62.4%, represents a 3.8 point improvement over the full year of 2015, reflecting the impact of our strategic initiatives to improve the loss ratio. Our team is doing a terrific job executing against our plan and we received excellent support from our clients and broker partners of value of a strong AIG standing by their side. 
We remain confident that we will reach our previously announced 62% exit run rate for 2016. As we've stated in the past, we do not expect our progress to be linear, notwithstanding this quarter's performance in the low level of severe losses, our results are subject to volatility, particularly in Property. Late in the quarter, we put in place a focused reinsurance agreements for classes of business that have generated the greatest volatility in our International Property business. We're also pleased that we've been able to avoid several recent notable losses in Property as a result of our engineering and risk selection capability. These actions should dampen the volatility we have experience, but we will continue to have a degree of exposure to risk that are difficult to predict. 
Slide 15 is the same slide we provided last quarter updated to show the change in our business mix and adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2015 and the first half of the 2016 using 3 business strategy groupings: Grow, maintain or improve and remediate. I'll highlight 4 points.
First, the business we want to grow and maintain has increased from half of our premiums in 2015 to 60% to premiums through the first half of 2016. The weighted average adjusted accident year loss ratio was an attractive 56% through the first 6 months of 2016, which is broadly in line with the full year 2015 results of 54%. During the quarter, we continue to focus on growing these highly profitable areas of the business and investing in clients.
Second, the business we're remediating decreased from 15% of the portfolio in 2015 to 9% through the first 6 months of the year and the accident year loss ratio has improved from 91% in 2015 to 84% over that time. Our improvements is the results of the exits we announced in the first quarter and the fact that we've not been writing new business that falls in this worst-performing group. 
Third, the business that we're seeking to improve declined from 35% of premiums in 2015 to 31% of premiums in the first half of 2016. While the accident year loss ratio improved 6 points from 73% to 67% over the time. our client and risk selection strategies and expansion of reinsurance were the primary drivers of those changes.
Finally, collectively business that we're remediating and the business that we're improving decline from half of the portfolio in 2015 to 40% for the first 6 months of 2016, while the weighted average accident year loss ratio improved by 7 points from 79% to 72% over that time. As you can see from the slides, we've achieved significant improvements in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by truly transforming our portfolio. 
In closing, the second quarter was marked by focus on our strongest performing businesses and most valued client relationships, while we continue to execute our strategic actions. The results are a testament to the commitment and pace with which we're implementing our plan which provides me with the confidence that we will achieve the targets we have communicated. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."
250388,369550300,1022771,"American International Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","American International Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, Consumer Insurance pretty solid results for the quarter on an overall basis, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and",933,"Thank you, Rob and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, Consumer Insurance pretty solid results for the quarter on an overall basis, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Before specifically addressing the results, I would like to briefly provide some context. We are pleased that the benefits from a number of our strategic initiatives are possibly emerging in our results. For example, our focused strategy in Personal Insurance and investments we have been making in Japan have lowered our overall expense ratio, while producing profitable premium growth in select areas, including our high net worth client group business. 
In Group Retirement, the investments we've made to enhance both our sponsor service and participant experience are starting to pay off in both our acquisition and retention activities. For our U.S. Life business, we are realizing meaningful cost benefits from the consolidation of numerous policy administration and field compensation systems into modern common platforms. 
Realizing these types of benefits from our strategic initiatives is particularly important as our businesses face various challenges associated with the economic and regulatory environment. In particular, industry variable annuity sales are being pressured due to volatile equity markets and uncertainty about the deal by fiduciary rule. We are confident we will be prepared in time for implementation of the DOL rule and we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners as they determine their chosen paths for implementation, which we will in turn support.
The combination of our leading market positions across annuities product lines and our multichannel distribution network positions us well to respond to various market conditions and the regulatory landscape. Also, recent actions we have taken in our U.S. Retirement and Life proprietary distribution channels make us more nimble with respect to changing market conditions. 
With the completion of the sale of AIG Advisor Group during the quarter, going forward, nearly 100% of our retail variable annuity sales will be from third-party independent distribution. Separately, in January of this year, we substantially reduced our Life career solution channel. Independent distribution accounted for 80% of our U.S. Life sales year-to-date. At this time, our main proprietary distribution channels are our valid financial advisers who play a key role in serving our Group Retirement plan sponsors and participants in our direct-to-consumer business, AIG Direct.
Increasing our focus on independent distribution reduces our fixed cost burden and enables us to change emphasis on product sales according to opportunity as we maintain pricing discipline. Across our business, we are constantly looking for new opportunities to reduce costs and variable expenses. 
Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to Retirement on Slide 17, we saw 6% growth in Retirement sales from a year ago. Growth was led by Fixed Annuities, Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement, while variable sales declined reflecting industry challenges. 
Fixed Annuities sales rose significantly from the low levels in the prior year quarter, although sales and net flows declined sequentially reflecting lower interest rates during the quarter as well as a more competitive marketing environment. We continue to maintain our fixed annuity pricing and asset quality disciplines.
Group Retirement benefited from higher deposits and lower surrenders resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition anticipates remains robust. 
While variable annuity sales and net flows haven't impacted uncertainty surrounding the DOL real and market volatility, we are maintaining our pricing and credit discipline to navigate these uncertainties. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solution to meet our clients' needs. 
As you can see on Slide 18, we continue to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported days yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond attrition and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward and as Sid mentioned, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.
Turning to Slide 19, Life saw growth in premiums and deposits of 5% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Operating comparisons reflected more favorable mortality experience. U.S. Life sales showed good growth from the same period last year, particularly in Term Life. Our positive sales trends in Life reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of independent distribution.
We are also making progress in transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves. We will provide you with updates on these transactions as they are completed. 
Turning to Slide 20. I'm happy to report that personal insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvement reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses, including direct marketing costs as well as an early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. While we continue to expect that expenses will be the key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan. With respect to Japan, we remain focused on delivering current results, while preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger as previously reported. 
To close, I'm pleased with the progress we're making against our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan. 
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up for Q&A."

So first of all, let me just refer you back to Page 15 of our presentation and let me make a quick observation for you. In total, through the first 6 months of the year, our premiums have declined by approximately $1.9 billion. And what you can see is that because the left-hand side of this chart, product set 1 and product set 2A, have stayed they've increased proportionately dollar amount-wise, very close to flat on the first 6 months of 2016 versus first 6 months of 2015 basis. So what you can see is that almost all that decline in premium volume has come from product set 2b and product set 3, which is the improved and remediate buckets of our business. The weighted average loss ratio of the business that is no longer being written out of products set 2b and product set 3 was approximately 90%. So you're talking about literally having not written business that ran at a loss ratio of 90% last year and now the business we're still right thing in product set 2b and product set 3 have a weighted average loss ratio of about 72%. So I got to say that we truly reduced the amount of writing in those lines of bus. And what you can see as we did that without significantly disrupting the business we wanted to grow and maintain in product set 1 and product set 2B. I would generally say to you we continue to be focused on remediating and improving that right-hand side of the page.

With that said, we see opportunities on a kind of selective basis to the remediate even faster some of the business that was in product set 3 in the business that was in product set 2 in North America, partly because the market has been just pretty aggressive. And if the market is aggressive and we have an opportunity without disrupting the broader relationships to remediate, to improve faster in North America, we're happy to do it. I think historically Property in the U.S. is a very important part of this story. As I mentioned in my opening comments, Property rates are down in the U.S  in the excess and surplus lines of Property business. And so we have, in fact, reduced the amount of writings that we're doing in at the E&S Property space. And we will continue to be very thoughtful about the Property business we do we're focused on our highly into headlines in middle market and large limit where we think we have a sustainable competitive advantage, and we're we think our engineering, but it is can help reduce the likelihood of a loss in the first place for our clients."

We've got the best team in this business and we will absolutely pursue opportunities to write Casualty business where we think we can get the proper pricing and where we think we can deliver value for our clients. With respect to Property, let me make 3 key observations for you. The first thing I want to say you step over the past few years, you'll see that we've been very actively managing our P&L to make sure that we manage the amount of exposure that we have to catastrophes. We've done that by reducing some of our risk, for example, in the Gulf Coast here in the United States and being willing to take exposures around the world where we think that's a long the efficient frontier, there's probably better opportunity between the risk-reward trade-off for pricing and risk. The second thing that I would observe for you is that we've really done a lot of work to build our engineering capabilities and Property, as you know, and the growth that you see in Property is coming very much through our middle-market and our large limit highly engineered Property space where we really think we have a competitive advantage and we're we think we have the ability to change our loss ratio in a positive way. And the third point that I would make is that's absolutely, we believe that reinsurance provides an opportunity for us here. As I mentioned in my comments, we did take advantage in the second quarter of the opportunity to use of reinsurance it a strategic manner to a REIT is at the level of volatility associated with a severe losses coming from the Property book. We entered into that agreement at the end of the second quarter, so we think that we'll see much more the benefit from that moving forward in the rest of 2016 and into 2017."

When you look at Page 9 of the financial supplement and you're trying to make sure that you can sort of reconcile that thought, just remember that any of the GOE that we put the loss adjustment is effectively deferred and amortized in like a DAC type of concept. And so therefore, you need to be thinking about what is the effect in the adjusted loss ratio on an amortized basis. And so 3/10 of 1 point is the right answer for you."

Let me give you this as maybe in a way to observe this for you. One, just remember that if our, I said this in my opening comments, if our total premium decline was 20% in the quarter after foreign exchange, about half of that came from reinsurance and our exits and market headwind. So you could dissect that piece a little bit further and let me help you. I commented already that rates, so the market headrooms from rates was about 1%. I commented that, that would then leave you with 90% of the decline associated with reinsurance and exits. If you thought about the exits, about $500 million worth of business is what we've exited, which is pretty small, it's about 2.5% of the $20 billion of premium that we wrote last year. So you might think of the benefit from exits as being something like, let's call it, 2 to 3 points. And so if you said, he explains 10% through reinsurance exits and market headwind, I think it's pretty fair to say that you probably got about 6 points of your reduction in premium coming from reinsurance. And so that's the effect that it had on the reinsurance. And then, as you want to know what effect it had on the loss ratio just from our most of that happened in product set 2B and product set 3, but product set 2B, so you can see the loss ratio on dispersion chart that we show on Page 15."

That chart has 80 individual dots, each of those dots is a module. And our ability to grow some and shrink others is indicative of what we're doing throughout the organization as we segment our business by products, by geography, by customer segment, by distribution channel and make differentiated managerial decisions to allocate capital where we're being properly rewarded, where we have long-term competitive advantage and pulling back and even exiting where we don't. And the information technology to be able to do that in ever more precise ways and the ability to not be overly swayed by the past, but have better predictive analytics about the future, about lost trends and customer demand is what we're talking about. We clearly recognize the need to illustrate that through more transparency and I hope you find what we're doing to show modularity and action within the Commercial book helpful in anticipating where else would apply the same managerial discipline. And we -- as we have promised in January, we'll be talking about modular results at the sort of high level of 9 subsegments of AIG by the end of this year with full capital allocation and ROE in those segment. But that is really still at the very high altitude compared to what is our day job to use your language we're doing to make AIG and reshape it into our clients' most valued insurer, which is the focus where we have the greatest relevance to our target client segments."

We regularly review our forecasted remain confident in our commitments on capital returns. As I look at where we are today, a little more color on the funding walk that we previously shared with you. First, Legacy asset monetizations have been ahead of where we initially projected, so we feel positive about that. And then secondly, thing going forward, it would expect them to exceeded the $5 billion to $7 billion funding target from dispositions given where we are you today at this particular time. That said, given how close we monitor this, there are always some period-to-period changes in our funding projections. So on dividends and tax-sharing payments, we remain roughly in line with our projections and they'll have some availability with market conditions and statutory capital. Our leverage remains in line so it remains a very healthy under 20%. Hedge fund redemptions are on schedule, and there, the proceeds are market-dependent, of course.

This morning, I'll speak briefly to our performance this quarter as well as our outlook and ongoing transformation. 
AIG's second quarter results show strong improvement towards all the goals the board and I announced in January. We've executed more quickly and smoothly than expected, and our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets is high as our earnings become more sustainable. 
In the second quarter, we continued to execute and delivered strong operating earnings of $0.98 per share, including a $0.17 charge from the workers' compensation discount, which Sid will discuss. Adjusted Commercial Insurance underwriting improved again this quarter, which Rob will speak to. Consumer's expense discipline also resulted in increased profitability, particularly in Personal Insurance, and Kevin will address this in his remarks. 
Across AIG, we are simplifying the company, accelerating our decision-making and adhering to a consistent management philosophy. We're executing on our objectives of managing our core operating portfolios to increase return on equity and managing our Legacy Portfolio for capital return. 
As we had previously announced, Charlie Shamieh is leading a team focused on our Legacy Portfolio and is actively moving forward. 
Our managerial discipline across AIG is based on a guiding principle of building economic value, which is consistently applied throughout the company. We frequently discuss our focus on value over volume when speaking to Commercial underwriting and the value of new business for Consumer businesses. The flexibility we have earned by focusing on expense discipline and growth in segments with sustainable value has allowed us to maintain positive operating leverage, while we have reduced our top line aggressively.
Normalized ROE was 8.8% for both the quarter and the first 6 months of this year. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE and was solidly on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. As a reminder, our third quarter normalized ROE will reflect a higher level of expected catastrophe losses. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, increased 5% in the quarter and we continue to expect to achieve double-digit growth for the full year. 
Our confidence in the future is based on our focus on what we can control. Our active value management framework for capital allocation and product design allows us to navigate through volatile markets. At this time, AIG's consummation to a more efficient and nimble organization is more important than ever. We anticipate and address challenges such as sustained low interest rates, Brexit and other market forces across our strategies. Sid will follow my remarks with greater transparency on the impact of low interest rates specifically. 
In the case of Brexit, we believe we're well positioned given our branch structure. It may be sometime before the requirements associated with Brexit are known and any potential economic impact from Brexit materializes. We're positioning AIG for changing economic, political and regulatory environments and for future earnings sustainability. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating earnings showed good progress this quarter with strong underwriting results, particularly with respect to the Commercial accident year loss ratio as adjusted and expense discipline across AIG. In addition, UGC delivered another quarter of solid results, driven by improved loss experience and growth in net premiums earned. 
Our year-on-year comparisons were impacted by 4 items of note. First, the workers' compensation discount amounted to a $300 million charge this quarter versus a $400 million benefit. The workers' compensation discount rate adjustments are recorded in earnings, while offsetting changes in the fair value of securities backing these liabilities are recorded to AOCI. This results in minimal impact to reported book value. Accordingly, when we report on normalized ROE, we remove this noneconomic change in net reserve discount. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate, which is comprised of the U.S. Treasury rate plus an assumed credit spread, has roughly $100 million to $125 million pretax impact on reported earnings.
The second item was a modest $29 million of overall net unfavorable prior year reserve development compared to a net unfavorable development of $329 million a year ago. Included in the quarter was $109 million strengthening of Florida workers' compensation reserves, partially offset by favorable reserve development in Property and Specialty lines. The Florida workers' compensation reserve increase was due to recent industry-wide Florida court rulings, which occurred during the quarter. The judgment's created an increased liability for previous years, which made a reserve increase in this segment prudent. AIG has a 5% market share in Florida and an average market share of 8% for the past 10- and 15-year periods. 
The third item was that Q2 was our highest natural catastrophe quarter since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. We had higher CAT losses in the quarter of $414 million compared to the roughly in line level of the $225 million in catastrophes for the prior year. 
The final item was the meaningful change in market-sensitive asset returns as shown on Slide 5. Overall, the impact of last year's outsized Q2 returns and our actions to reduce market-sensitive assets resulted in approximately $1 billion decline in mark-to-market income versus a year ago. However, of note in the quarter, these assets contributed just under $300 million to income, which was close to our expectations. Our steps to reduce market exposure will allow for more sustainable and less volatile earnings going forward. Since 2010, our market-sensitive assets have declined by over 40% or by $19 billion. 
Turning to Slide 6. We've provided an overview of the impact interest rates may have on our in-force as well as on new business for key portfolios. With respect to the in-force, we have a strong discipline around asset liability management led by our Chief Investment Officer, Doug Dachille. We see limited in-force impact on long-tail casualty, where assets are slightly longer than liabilities and on variable annuities, where in 2014 we made a decision to fully hedge the interest rate risk on living benefits, which is accounted for at fair value. 
On Fixed Annuities, approximately 72% of the book is already at guaranteed minimum crediting rates. The sustained low rates may reduce to lenders and we see potential spread compression from declining portfolio yields. We're projecting a 2 to 4 basis point quarterly decline in net spreads. 
For our Life business and legacy structured settlements, while we're exposed to some potential ALM mismatch on the long end of the curve due to limited investable assets, its impact on earnings in the next few years is modest, although it will grow somewhat over a very long time horizon with reinvestment.
On new business, we maintained a continued focus on pricing, product design and risk management across AIG. We expect some ROE compression in long-tail casualty. However, we continue to push on pricing and risk selection. For our annuity businesses, we expect the primary impact to be a decline in volumes as we frequently reevaluate our products to ensure that we're meeting our return targets. 
Considering both the in-force and new business, we're presenting a scenario to illustrate the potential headwinds to our January 26 stated targets from the current environment. The 2017 average 10-year treasury rate assumption that was used in our plan was 2.6%. Assuming interest rates are 100 basis points lower than our original 2.6% assumption, we would anticipate a potential 25 to 35 basis point reduction in 2017 normalized ROE based on a decline in normalized pretax operating income of $250 million to $350 million. However, if rates were to move steadily higher from the levels today back to our initial projection, we would not expect this impact to materialize. 
Also, as Peter said, our guiding philosophy is around managing to economic value. Since year-end, we estimate the decline in interest rate and markets has impacted our estimate of intrinsic value by approximately 5%. Despite the challenging interest rate environment, we remain committed our stated targets. We believe that our ability to manage our expense and capital structures we will discuss where we are ahead plan give us the ability to withstand potential 2017 earnings pressures.
Turning to Slide 7. We've executed against our plan and have reduced operating expenses by 11% year-to-date on a constant dollar basis. While the pace of this improvement should slow in the second half of the year, we expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections and new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. 
Slide 8 shows the expansion of our second quarter normalized ROE to 8.8%. This improvement reflected almost $15 billion of capital return to shareholders since the second quarter of 2015, as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results. 
Slide 9 shows a strong growth in book value, driven by earnings, realized capital gains, our estimated DTA utilization and accretive share repurchases during the quarter. 
Turning to capital on Slide 10. We continue to execute against our $25 billion capital return target and have returned $7.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first half of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.8 billion towards the purchase of 50 million common shares, and we also repurchased 5 million of our outstanding warrants for $90 million. Since quarter end and through August 2, we repurchased an additional $698 million of common shares. Our remaining authorization stands at approximately $4 billion, including the new $3 billion authorization announced yesterday. Our balance sheet remains very strong with $6.7 billion of parent liquidity, a financial leverage ratio below 20% and RBC and rating agency capital ratios that continue to remain within our targets.
With respect to the key levers funding our capital return target, free cash flow continued to be strong in the second quarter, as shown on Slide 11. We announced that we would reduce our hedge fund allocation by about half, which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. Submitted notices of redemption are $4.2 billion, and through the second quarter, proceeds have freed up approximately $400 million in capital in our life companies, which have caught up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments. Additionally, distributions from the life companies during the quarter included $315 million from the sale of AIG Advisor Group. 
We continue to make solid progress on monetizing legacy assets with $4.3 billion of total free cash flow generated over the last 3 quarters. During the quarter, the holding company recognized $500 million of proceeds, largely from the sale of the PICC Group stake held at parent to the nonlife companies. We have completed the majority of encumbered asset dispositions or transferred outlined in our January 26 strategic plan as of the end of the second quarter. Charlie Shamieh and his team are focused on the disposition process going forward for many of the insurance liabilities in Legacy, which we have kicked off for several portfolios. It is important to note that some of the legacy insurance portfolios will have more extended time frames for exit. We'll provide further disclosure at year-end with our modular segment reporting for Legacy and provide additional information on a timely basis as we close any material transactions that are in progress. 
As Peter stated, we're focused on continued execution of our strategic plan that we first outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress throughout 2016. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Commercial had a strong second quarter despite the backdrop of a generally soft market. Today, I'll discuss how the execution of our strategic plan is improving Commercial's mix of business and creating a leaner, more focused and profitable organization. We're committed to making economic-based decisions, while we remain true to our vision of being our clients' most valued insurer.
Turning to Slide 13. Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio of 62.4% improved 4.2 points from the prior year quarter with 3.4 points related to the strategic actions we announced in January and 0.8 points attributable to a lower level of severe losses. We reduced second quarter net premium writings by 20% after adjusting for foreign exchange as part of reshaping of the portfolio. About half of the change was driven by increasing our use of reinsurance, the targeted exits we communicated in the first quarter and market headwinds from lower rates. The vast majority of the other half was attributable to underwriting actions and poorer performing subsegments of Casualty and Property. These actions included addressing unprofitable single or 2-product client relationships and micro-segmentation and re-underwriting of risks using enhanced analytic tools. As always, we make underwriting decisions initially on a product basis and then on a client-by-client basis, taking a holistic view across each client relationship. We've placed the priority on limiting disruption for our clients and broker partners and preserving the strength of our valued multiline client relationships. Retention for our major clients remain very healthy at about 94% on a year-to-date basis.
Our objective is to deploy our capital in higher-performing subsegments where we earn our target rate of return. The market is practicing less restraint and we've taken advantage of the opportunity to shed underperforming and highly commoditized businesses, while having the flexibility to retain more attractive risks with the same clients. As a result of the pace of our actions and underwriting discipline, we're updating our 2016 full year estimates to reflect us managing net premiums written down by a total of approximately $3 billion in 2016 as we seek to optimize our portfolio.
Globally, rates were down about 1 point, reflecting competitive international conditions, while overall rates in the U.S. were about flat. U.S. Casualty rates continued their positive trend increasing over 4.5 points and rates were up 2 points in our Specialty businesses. Partially offsetting those increases, we continue to observe pressure in the excess and surplus lines Property business and we saw more aggressive pricing in Financial Lines where rates decreased about 2%.
I'm pleased to say that during the first half of 2016, we recorded double-digit growth in several lines where we are a market leader and offer a compelling value proposition including M&A, middle-market property, cyber and credit lines. In addition, multinational programs increased by approximately 9%, demonstrating our enduring advantage in this important client segment, and we continue to experience growth in large limit property. We're placing emphasis on investing in analytics and engineering capabilities to offer our clients unique data-driven insights that go beyond traditional risk transfer capabilities. 
Switching gears to expenses. I'm happy to share that our GOE ratio improved 1.2 points in the quarter as a result of AIG's expense initiatives. We expected expenses will continue to decline, although at a more modest pace in the second half of the year. The GOE ratio will likely trend slightly upward from its current level as the impact of our lower written premiums earn in during the remainder of 2016 and 2017. With that said, we're proud that the improvements in our loss ratio are not expected to be significantly offset by deterioration of our expense ratio. 
Slide 14 shows the continued improvement in Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2011 and the second quarter of 2016, including the effect of 2012 through 2015 prior period development in each accident year. The second quarter result of 62.4% represents a 3.8 point improvement over the full year of 2015, reflecting the impact of our strategic initiatives to improve the loss ratio. Our team is doing a terrific job executing against our plan, and we received excellent support from our clients and broker partners who recognize the value of a strong AIG standing by their side. 
We remain confident that we will reach our previously announced 62% exit run rate target for 2016. As we've stated in the past, we do not expect our progress to be linear, notwithstanding this quarter's performance in the low level of severe losses, our results are subject to volatility, particularly in Property. Late in the quarter, we put in place a focused reinsurance agreement for classes of business that have generated the greatest volatility in our international Property business. We're also pleased that we've been able to avoid several recent notable losses in Property as a result of our engineering and risk selection capabilities. These actions should dampen the past volatility we've experienced, but we will continue to have a degree of exposure to risks that are difficult to predict. 
Slide 15 is the same slide we provided last quarter, updated to show the change in our business mix and adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2015 and the first half of the 2016 using 3 business strategy groupings: grow, maintain or improve and remediate. I'll highlight 4 points.
First, the business we want to grow and maintain has increased from half of our premiums in 2015 to 60% to premiums through the first half of 2016. The weighted average adjusted accident year loss ratio was an attractive 56% through the first 6 months of 2016, which is broadly in line with the full year 2015 result of 54%. During the quarter, we continued to focus on growing these highly profitable areas of the business and investing in its clients.
Second, the business we're remediating decreased from 15% of the portfolio in 2015 to 9% through the first 6 months of the year and the accident year loss ratio has improved from 91% in 2015 to 84% over that time. Our improvements are the result of the exits we announced in the first quarter and the fact that we've not been writing new business that falls in this worst-performing group. 
Third, the business that we're seeking to improve declined from 35% of premiums in 2015 to 31% of premiums in the first half of 2016, while the accident year loss ratio improved 6 points from 73% to 67% over the time. Our client and risk selection strategies and expansion of reinsurance were the primary drivers of those changes.
Finally, collectively, the business that we're remediating and the business that we're improving declined from half of the portfolio in 2015 to 40% for the first 6 months of 2016, while the weighted average accident year loss ratio improved by 7 points from 79% to 72% over that time. As you can see from the slides, we've achieved significant improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by truly transforming our portfolio. 
In closing, the second quarter was marked by focus on our strongest performing businesses and most valued client relationships, while we continue to execute our strategic actions. The results are a testament to the commitment and pace with which we're implementing our plan, which provides me with the confidence that we will achieve the targets we've communicated. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."
250388,369550300,1023203,"American International Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","American International Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, Consumer Insurance pretty solid results for the quarter on an overall basis, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life an",937,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, Consumer Insurance pretty solid results for the quarter on an overall basis, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Before specifically addressing the results, I would like to briefly provide some context. We are pleased that the benefits from a number of our strategic initiatives are positively emerging in our results. For example, our focused strategy in Personal Insurance and investments we have been making in Japan have lowered our overall expense ratio while producing profitable premium growth in select areas, including our high-net-worth client group business. 
In Group Retirement, the investments we've made to enhance both our plan sponsor service and participant experience are starting to pay off in both our acquisition and retention activities. For our U.S. Life business, we are realizing meaningful cost benefits from the consolidation of numerous policy administration and field compensation systems into modern common platforms. 
Realizing these types of benefits from our strategic initiatives is particularly important as our businesses face various challenges associated with the economic and regulatory environment. In particular, industry variable annuity sales are being pressured due to volatile equity markets and uncertainty about the DOL fiduciary rule. We are confident we will be prepared in time for implementation of the DOL rule, and we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners as they determine their chosen paths for implementation, which we will in turn support.
The combination of our leading market positions across annuity product lines and our multichannel distribution network positions us well to respond to various market conditions and the regulatory landscapes. Also, recent actions we have taken in our U.S. retirement and life proprietary distribution channels make us more nimble with respect to changing market conditions. 
With the completion of the sale of AIG Advisor Group during the quarter, going forward, nearly 100% of our retail variable annuity sales will be from third-party independent distribution. Separately, in January of this year, we substantially reduced our Life career distribution channel. Independent distribution accounted for 80% of our U.S. Life sales year-to-date. At this time, our main proprietary distribution channels are our valid financial advisers who play a key role in serving our Group Retirement plan sponsors and participants in our direct-to-consumer business, AIG Direct.
Increasing our focus on independent distribution reduces our fixed cost burden and enables us to change emphasis on product sales according to opportunity as we maintain pricing discipline. Across our businesses, we are constantly looking for new opportunities to reduce costs and variabilize expenses. 
Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to Retirement on Slide 17, we saw 6% growth in Retirement sales from a year ago. Growth was led by Fixed Annuities, Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement, while variable annuity sales declined, reflecting industry challenges. 
Fixed Annuities sales rose significantly from the low levels in the prior year quarter, although sales and net flows declined sequentially, reflecting lower interest rates during the quarter as well as a more competitive market environment. We continue to maintain our fixed annuity pricing and asset quality disciplines.
Group Retirement benefited from higher deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust. 
While variable annuity sales and net flows have been impacted by the uncertainties surrounding the DOL rule and market volatility, we are maintaining our pricing and product discipline to navigate these uncertainties. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs. 
As you can see on Slide 18, we continued to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, and as Sid mentioned, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Life saw growth in premiums and deposits of 5% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Operating comparisons reflected more favorable mortality experience. U.S. Life sales showed good growth from the same period last year, particularly in term life. Our positive sales trends in Life reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of independent distribution.
We are also making progress in transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves. We will provide you with updates on these transactions as they are completed. 
Turning to Slide 20. I'm happy to report that Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvement reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses, including direct marketing costs as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. While we continue to expect that expenses will be the key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan. With respect to Japan, we remain focused on delivering current results, while preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger as previously reported. 
To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan. 
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A."

So first of all, let me just refer you back to Page 15 of our presentation and let me make a quick observation for you. In total, through the first 6 months of the year, our premiums had declined by approximately $1.9 billion. And what you can see is that because the left-hand side of this chart, product set 1 and product set 2A, have stayed, they've increased proportionately, but dollar amount-wise, it's very close to flat on a first 6 months of 2016 versus first 6 months of 2015 basis. So what you can see is that almost all of our decline in premium volume has come from product set 2B and product set 3, which is the improved and remediate buckets of our business. The weighted average loss ratio of the business that is no longer being written out of product set 2B and product set 3 was approximately 90%. So you're talking about literally having not written business that ran at a loss ratio of 90% last year and now the business we're still writing in product set 2B and product set 3 have a weighted average loss ratio of about 72%. So I give you that to say that we've truly reduced the amount of writing in those lines of business. And what you can see is we did that without significantly disrupting the business we wanted to grow and maintain in product set 1 and product set 2B. I would generally say to you we continue to be focused on remediating and improving that right-hand side of the page. And our real objective would be how much more can we improve that without disrupting the business we want to grow in with the business we want to maintain. The last observation that I'll make for you here is that our primary emphasis is on maintaining our multi-line client relationships. And the percentages that you see here on Page 15 are probably, generally speaking, in line with what you might expect us to continue to work toward for the full year 2016."

So if I look at the year-over-year improvement on Commercial P&C, looks like you actually had more coming from international instead of North American Commercial. Now I've been thinking that the story of pruning the underperforming casualty plus the impact of reinsurance should be concentrated on the North American side. I'm not sure if I have that right, but that's been my assumption up until now. And if that's so, does that suggest that international is running ahead of plan and North America is more in line? Or can you shed some light on that?"

And what you can see is that the business in North America was what -- was our primary target when it came to reinsurance. And so when we did our reinsurance agreements that I described in the first quarter, those reinsurance agreements are really focused around North American Casualty business. We continue to see, broadly speaking, our international business as attractive and are continuing to try to grow in most lines, in particular, in our multi-line -- multinational business. With that said, we see opportunities on a kind of selective basis to remediate even faster some of the business that was in product set 3 and the business that was in product set 2 in North America, partly because the market's been just pretty aggressive. And if the market is aggressive and we have an opportunity without disrupting the broader relationships to remediate, to improve faster in North America, we're happy to do it. I think surely Property in the U.S. is a very important part of this story. As I mentioned in my opening comments, Property rates are down in the U.S., in the excess and surplus lines Property business. And so we have, in fact, reduced the amount of writings that we're doing in the E&S property space. And we will continue to be very thoughtful about the Property business we do write.

I have -- I can't resist to take a quick moment to say -- to put a plug in for our Casualty team. We've got the best Casualty team in this business and we will absolutely pursue opportunities to write Casualty business where we think we can get the proper pricing and where we think we can deliver value for our clients. With respect to Property, let me make 3 key observations for you. The first thing I want to say is that over the past few years, you'll see that we've been very actively managing our P&L to make sure that we manage the amount of exposure that we have to catastrophes. We've done that by reducing some of our risk, for example, in the Gulf Coast here in the United States and being willing to take exposures around the world where we think that along the efficient frontier, there's probably better opportunity between the risk reward tradeoff for pricing and risk. The second thing that I would observe for you is that we've really done a lot of work to build our engineering capabilities in Property, as you know. And the growth that you see in Property is coming very much through our middle market and our large-limit highly engineered Property space where we really think we have a competitive advantage and where we think we have the ability to change our loss ratio in a positive way. And the third point that I would make is that, absolutely, we believe that reinsurance provides an opportunity for us here. As I mentioned in my comments, we did take advantage in the second quarter of the opportunity to use reinsurance in a strategic manner to reduce the level of volatility associated with severe losses coming from the Property book. We entered into that agreement at the end of the second quarter, so we think that we'll see much more the benefit from that moving forward in the rest of 2016 and into 2017."

The first thing I would say to you is I know that you should walk away understanding this, that about 0.3 points of the improvement in our adjusted accident year loss ratio comes from loss adjustment expenses. When you look at Page 9 of the financial supplement and you're trying to make sure that you can sort of reconcile that thought, just remember that any of the GOE that we put in the loss adjustment expenses is effectively deferred and amortized in like a DAC type of concept. And so therefore, you need to be thinking about what is the effect in the adjusted loss ratio on an amortized basis. And so 0.3 points is the right answer for you."

Let me give you this as maybe a way to observe this for you. One, just remember that if our, I said this in my opening comments, if our total premium decline was 20% in the quarter after foreign exchange, about half of that came from reinsurance and our exits and market headwinds. So you could dissect that piece a little bit further and let me help you. I commented already that rates -- so the market headwinds from rates was about 1%. I commented that, that would then leave you with 9% of the decline associated with reinsurance and exits. If you thought about the exits, about $500 million worth of business is what we've exited, which is pretty small. It's about 2.5% of the $20 billion of premium that we wrote last year. So you might think of the benefit from exits as being something like, let's call it, 2 to 3 points. And so if you said, hey, he explains 10% through reinsurance exits and market headwinds, I think it's pretty fair to say that you probably got about 6 points of your reduction in premium coming from reinsurance. And so that's the effect that it had on the reinsurance. And then, as you want to know what effect it had on the loss ratio, just remember most of that happened in product set 2B and product set 3, but product set 2B, so you can see the loss ratio on the dispersion chart that we show on Page 15."

That chart has 80 individual dots. Each of those dots is a module. And our ability to grow some and shrink others is indicative of what we're doing throughout the organization as we segment our business by product, by geography, by customer segment, by distribution channel and make differentiated managerial decisions to allocate capital where we're being properly rewarded, where we have long-term competitive advantage and pulling back and even exiting where we don't. And the information technology to be able to do that in ever more precise ways and the ability to not be overly swayed by the past but have better predictive analytics about the future, about lost trends and customer demand is what we're talking about. We clearly recognize the need to illustrate that through more transparency and I hope you find what we're doing to show modularity and action within the Commercial book helpful in anticipating where else would applying the same managerial discipline. And we -- as we have promised in January, we'll be talking about modular results at the sort of high level of 9 subsegments of AIG by the end of this year with full capital allocation and ROEs of those segments.

That said, given how close we monitor this, there are always some period-to-period changes in our funding projections. So on dividends and tax-sharing payments, we remain roughly in line with our projections and they'll have some variability with market conditions and statutory capital. Our leverage remains in line so it remains a very healthy under 20%. Hedge fund redemptions are on schedule, and there, the proceeds are market dependent, of course. And then, finally, with respect to both Life reinsurance and UGC, on UGC, there's an S-1 out of there so I'm limited on what I can say. I believe we're on track towards our separation.

This morning, I'll speak briefly to our performance this quarter as well as our outlook and ongoing transformation. AIG's second quarter results show strong improvement towards all the goals the board and I announced in January. We've executed more quickly and smoothly than expected, and our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets is high as our earnings become more sustainable. 
In the second quarter, we continued to execute and delivered strong operating earnings of $0.98 per share, including a $0.17 charge from the workers' compensation discount, which Sid will discuss. Adjusted Commercial Insurance underwriting improved again this quarter, which Rob will speak to. Consumers' expense discipline also resulted in increased profitability, particularly in Personal Insurance, and Kevin will address this in his remarks. 
Across AIG, we are simplifying the company, accelerating our decision-making and adhering to a consistent management philosophy. We're executing on our objectives of managing our core operating portfolios to increase return on equity and managing our Legacy Portfolio for capital return.  As we had previously announced, Charlie Shamieh is leading a team focused on our Legacy Portfolio and is actively moving forward. 
Our managerial discipline across AIG is based on a guiding principle of building economic value, which is consistently applied throughout the company. We frequently discuss our focus on value over volume when speaking to Commercial underwriting and the value of new business for Consumer businesses. The flexibility we have earned by focusing on expense discipline and growth in segments with sustainable value has allowed us to maintain positive operating leverage, while we have reduced our top line aggressively.
Normalized ROE was 8.8% for both the quarter and the first 6 months of this year. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE and was solidly on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. As a reminder, our third quarter normalized ROE will reflect a higher level of expected catastrophe losses.  Book value per share, excluding AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, increased 5% in the quarter and we continue to expect to achieve double-digit growth for the full year. 
Our confidence in the future is based on our focus on what we can control. Our active value management framework for capital allocation and product design allows us to navigate through volatile markets. At this time, AIG's transformation to a more efficient and nimble organization is more important than ever. We anticipate and address challenges such as sustained low interest rates, Brexit and other market forces across our strategies. Sid will follow my remarks with greater transparency on the impact of low interest rates specifically.  In the case of Brexit, we believe we're well positioned given our branch structure. It may be sometime before the requirements associated with Brexit are known and any potential economic impact from Brexit materializes. We're positioning AIG for changing economic, political and regulatory environments and for future earnings sustainability. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, including notable items. I'll also discuss the impact of the current interest rate environment and close with comments on capital management. 
Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating earnings showed good progress this quarter with strong underwriting results, particularly with respect to the Commercial accident year loss ratio as adjusted and expense discipline across AIG. In addition, UGC delivered another quarter of solid results, driven by improved loss experience and growth in net premiums earned. 
Our year-on-year comparisons were impacted by 4 items of note. First, the workers' compensation discount amounted to a $300 million charge this quarter versus a $400 million benefit. The workers' compensation discount rate adjustments are recorded in earnings, while offsetting changes in the fair value of securities backing these liabilities are recorded to AOCI. This results in minimal impact to reported book value. Accordingly, when we report on normalized ROE, we remove this noneconomic change in net reserve discount. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate, which is comprised of the U.S. Treasury rate plus an assumed credit spread, has roughly $100 million to $125 million pretax impact on reported earnings.
The second item was a modest $29 million of overall net unfavorable prior year reserve development compared to a net unfavorable development of $329 million a year ago. Included in the quarter was $109 million strengthening of Florida workers' compensation reserves, partially offset by favorable reserve development in Property and Specialty lines. The Florida workers' compensation reserve increase was due to recent industry-wide Florida court rulings, which occurred during the quarter. The judgments created an increased liability for previous years, which made a reserve increase in this segment prudent. AIG has a 5% market share in Florida and an average market share of 8% for the past 10- and 15-year periods.  The third item was that Q2 was our highest natural catastrophe quarter since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. We had higher CAT losses in the quarter of $414 million compared to the roughly in line level of the $225 million in catastrophes for the prior year. 
The final item was the meaningful change in market-sensitive asset returns as shown on Slide 5. Overall, the impact of last year's outsized Q2 returns and our actions to reduce market-sensitive assets resulted in approximately $1 billion decline in mark-to-market income versus a year ago. However, of note in the quarter, these assets contributed just under $300 million to income, which was close to our expectation. Our steps to reduce market exposure will allow for more sustainable and less volatile earnings going forward. Since 2010, our market-sensitive assets have declined by over 40% or by $19 billion. 
Turning to Slide 6. We've provided an overview of the impact interest rates may have on our in-force as well as on new business for key portfolios. With respect to the in-force, we have a strong discipline around asset liability management led by our Chief Investment Officer, Doug Dachille. We see limited in-force impact on long-tail casualty, where assets are slightly longer than liabilities and on variable annuities, where in 2014 we made a decision to fully hedge the interest rate risk on living benefits, which is accounted for at fair value. 
On Fixed Annuities, approximately 72% of the book is already at guaranteed minimum crediting rates. The sustained low rates may reduce to lenders and we see potential spread compression from declining portfolio yields. We're projecting a 2 to 4 basis point quarterly decline in net spreads.  For our Life business and legacy structured settlements, while we're exposed to some potential ALM mismatch on the long end of the curve due to limited investable assets, its impact on earnings in the next few years is modest, although it will grow somewhat over a very long time horizon with reinvestment.
On new business, we maintained a continued focus on pricing, product design and risk management across AIG. We expect some ROE compression in long-tail casualty. However, we continue to push on pricing and risk selection. For our annuity businesses, we expect the primary impact to be a decline in volumes as we frequently reevaluate our products to ensure that we're meeting our return targets. 
Considering both the in-force and new business, we're presenting a scenario to illustrate the potential headwinds to our January 26 stated targets from the current environment. The 2017 average 10-year treasury rate assumption that was used in our plan was 2.6%. Assuming interest rates are 100 basis points lower than our original 2.6% assumption, we would anticipate a potential 25 to 35 basis point reduction in 2017 normalized ROE based on a decline in normalized pretax operating income of $250 million to $350 million. However, if rates were to move steadily higher from the levels today back to our initial projection, we would not expect this impact to materialize. 
Also, as Peter said, our guiding philosophy is around managing to economic value. Since year-end, we estimate the decline in interest rate and markets has impacted our estimate of intrinsic value by approximately 5%. Despite the challenging interest rate environment, we remain committed our stated targets. We believe that our ability to manage our expense and capital structures we will discuss where we are ahead plan give us the ability to withstand potential 2017 earnings pressures.
Turning to Slide 7. We've executed against our plan and have reduced operating expenses by 11% year-to-date on a constant dollar basis. While the pace of this improvement should slow in the second half of the year, we expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections of new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. 
Slide 8 shows the expansion of our second quarter normalized ROE to 8.8%. This improvement reflected almost $15 billion of capital return to shareholders since the second quarter of 2015, as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results. 
Slide 9 shows a strong growth in book value, driven by earnings, realized capital gains, our estimated DTA utilization and accretive share repurchases during the quarter. 
Turning to capital on Slide 10. We continue to execute against our $25 billion capital return target and have returned $7.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first half of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.8 billion towards the purchase of 50 million common shares, and we also repurchased 5 million of our outstanding warrants for $90 million. Since quarter end and through August 2, we repurchased an additional $698 million of common shares. Our remaining authorization stands at approximately $4 billion, including the new $3 billion authorization announced yesterday. Our balance sheet remains very strong with $6.7 billion of parent liquidity, a financial leverage ratio below 20% and RBC and rating agency capital ratios that continue to remain within our targets.
With respect to the key levers funding our capital return target, free cash flow continued to be strong in the second quarter, as shown on Slide 11. We announced that we would reduce our hedge fund allocation by about half, which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. Submitted notices of redemption are $4.2 billion, and through the second quarter, proceeds have freed up approximately $400 million in capital in our life companies, which have caught up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments. Additionally, distributions from the life companies during the quarter included $315 million from the sale of AIG Advisor Group. 
We continue to make solid progress on monetizing legacy assets, with $4.3 billion of total free cash flow generated over the last 3 quarters. During the quarter, the holding company recognized $500 million of proceeds, largely from the sale of the PICC Group stake held at parent to the nonlife companies. We have completed the majority of encumbered asset dispositions or transferred outlined in our January 26 strategic plan as of the end of the second quarter. Charlie Shamieh and his team are focused on the disposition process going forward for many of the insurance liabilities in Legacy, which we have kicked off for several portfolios. It is important to note that some of the legacy insurance portfolios will have more extended time frames for exit. We'll provide further disclosure at year-end with our modular segment reporting for Legacy and provide additional information on a timely basis as we close any material transactions that are in progress.  As Peter stated, we're focused on continued execution of our strategic plan that we first outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress throughout 2016. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Commercial had a strong second quarter despite the backdrop of a generally soft market. Today, I'll discuss how the execution of our strategic plan is improving Commercial's mix of business and creating a leaner, more focused and profitable organization. We're committed to making economic-based decisions, while we remain true to our vision of being our clients' most valued insurer.
Turning to Slide 13. Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio of 62.4% improved 4.2 points from the prior year quarter with 3.4 points related to the strategic actions we announced in January and 0.8 points attributable to a lower level of severe losses. We reduced second quarter net premium writings by 20% after adjusting for foreign exchange as part of reshaping of the portfolio. About half of the change was driven by increasing our use of reinsurance, the targeted exits we communicated in the first quarter and market headwinds from lower rates. The vast majority of the other half was attributable to underwriting actions and poorer performing subsegments of Casualty and Property. These actions included addressing unprofitable single or 2-product client relationships and micro-segmentation and re-underwriting of risks using enhanced analytic tools. As always, we make underwriting decisions initially on a product basis and then on a client-by-client basis, taking a holistic view across each client relationship. We've placed the priority on limiting disruption for our clients and broker partners and preserving the strength of our valued multiline client relationships. Retention for our major clients remains very healthy at about 94% on a year-to-date basis.
Our objective is to deploy our capital in higher-performing subsegments where we earn our target rate of return. The market is practicing less restraint and we've taken advantage of the opportunity to shed underperforming and highly commoditized businesses, while having the flexibility to retain more attractive risks with the same clients. As a result of the pace of our actions and underwriting discipline, we're updating our 2016 full year estimates to reflect us managing net premiums written down by a total of approximately $3 billion in 2016 as we seek to optimize our portfolio.
Globally, rates were down about 1 point, reflecting competitive international conditions, while overall rates in the U.S. were about flat. U.S. Casualty rates continued their positive trend, increasing over 4.5 points and rates were up 2 points in our Specialty businesses. Partially offsetting those increases, we continued to observe pressure in the excess and surplus lines Property business and we saw more aggressive pricing in Financial Lines where rates decreased about 2%.
I'm pleased to say that during the first half of 2016, we recorded double-digit growth in several lines where we are a market leader and offer a compelling value proposition including M&A, middle-market property, cyber and credit lines. In addition, multinational programs increased by approximately 9%, demonstrating our enduring advantage in this important client segment, and we continue to experience growth in large limit property. We're placing emphasis on investing in analytics and engineering capabilities to offer our clients unique data-driven insights that go beyond traditional risk transfer capabilities. 
Switching gears to expenses. I'm happy to share that our GOE ratio improved 1.2 points in the quarter as a result of AIG's expense initiatives. We expected expenses will continue to decline, although at a more modest pace in the second half of the year. The GOE ratio will likely trend slightly upward from its current level as the impact of our lower written premiums earn in during the remainder of 2016 and 2017. With that said, we're proud that the improvements in our loss ratio are not expected to be significantly offset by deterioration of our expense ratio. 
Slide 14 shows the continued improvement in Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2011 and the second quarter of 2016, including the effect of 2012 through 2015 prior period development in each accident year. The second quarter result of 62.4% represents a 3.8 point improvement over the full year of 2015, reflecting the impact of our strategic initiatives to improve the loss ratio. Our team is doing a terrific job executing against our plan, and we received excellent support from our clients and broker partners who recognize the value of a strong AIG standing by their side. 
We remain confident that we will reach our previously announced 62% exit run rate target for 2016. As we've stated in the past, we do not expect our progress to be linear, notwithstanding this quarter's performance in the low level of severe losses, our results are subject to volatility, particularly in Property. Late in the quarter, we put in place a focused reinsurance agreement for classes of business that have generated the greatest volatility in our international Property business. We're also pleased that we've been able to avoid several recent notable losses in Property as a result of our engineering and risk selection capabilities. These actions should dampen the past volatility we've experienced, but we will continue to have a degree of exposure to risks that are difficult to predict. 
Slide 15 is the same slide we provided last quarter, updated to show the change in our business mix and adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2015 and the first half of the 2016 using 3 business strategy groupings: grow, maintain or improve and remediate. I'll highlight 4 points. First, the business we want to grow and maintain has increased from half of our premiums in 2015 to 60% to premiums through the first half of 2016. The weighted average adjusted accident year loss ratio was an attractive 56% through the first 6 months of 2016, which is broadly in line with the full year 2015 result of 54%. During the quarter, we continued to focus on growing these highly profitable areas of the business and investing in its clients.
Second, the business we're remediating decreased from 15% of the portfolio in 2015 to 9% through the first 6 months of the year and the accident year loss ratio has improved from 91% in 2015 to 84% over that time. Our improvements are the result of the exits we announced in the first quarter and the fact that we've not been writing new business that falls in this worst-performing group. 
Third, the business that we're seeking to improve declined from 35% of premiums in 2015 to 31% of premiums in the first half of 2016, while the accident year loss ratio improved 6 points from 73% to 67% over the time. Our client and risk selection strategies and expansion of reinsurance were the primary drivers of those changes.
Finally, collectively, the business that we're remediating and the business that we're improving declined from half of the portfolio in 2015 to 40% for the first 6 months of 2016, while the weighted average accident year loss ratio improved by 7 points from 79% to 72% over that time. As you can see from the slides, we've achieved significant improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by truly transforming our portfolio. 
In closing, the second quarter was marked by focus on our strongest performing businesses and most valued client relationships, while we continued to execute our strategic actions. The results are a testament to the commitment and pace with which we're implementing our plan, which provides me with the confidence that we will achieve the targets we've communicated. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, Consumer Insurance pretty solid results for the quarter on an overall basis, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Before specifically addressing the results, I would like to briefly provide some context. We are pleased that the benefits from a number of our strategic initiatives are positively emerging in our results. For example, our focused strategy in Personal Insurance and investments we have been making in Japan have lowered our overall expense ratio while producing profitable premium growth in select areas, including our high-net-worth client group business. 
In Group Retirement, the investments we've made to enhance both our plan sponsor service and participant experience are starting to pay off in both our acquisition and retention activities. For our U.S. Life business, we are realizing meaningful cost benefits from the consolidation of numerous policy administration and field compensation systems into modern common platforms. 
Realizing these types of benefits from our strategic initiatives is particularly important as our businesses face various challenges associated with the economic and regulatory environment. In particular, industry variable annuity sales are being pressured due to volatile equity markets and uncertainty about the DOL fiduciary rule. We are confident we will be prepared in time for implementation of the DOL rule, and we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners as they determine their chosen paths for implementation, which we will in turn support.
The combination of our leading market positions across annuity product lines and our multichannel distribution network positions us well to respond to various market conditions and the regulatory landscapes. Also, recent actions we have taken in our U.S. retirement and life proprietary distribution channels make us more nimble with respect to changing market conditions. With the completion of the sale of AIG Advisor Group during the quarter, going forward, nearly 100% of our retail variable annuity sales will be from third-party independent distribution. 
Separately, in January of this year, we substantially reduced our Life career distribution channel. Independent distribution accounted for 80% of our U.S. Life sales year-to-date. At this time, our main proprietary distribution channels are our valid financial advisers who play a key role in serving our Group Retirement plan sponsors and participants in our direct-to-consumer business, AIG Direct. Increasing our focus on independent distribution reduces our fixed cost burden and enables us to change emphasis on product sales according to opportunity as we maintain pricing discipline. Across our businesses, we are constantly looking for new opportunities to reduce costs and variabilize expenses. 
Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to Retirement on Slide 17, we saw 6% growth in Retirement sales from a year ago. Growth was led by Fixed Annuities, Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement, while variable annuity sales declined, reflecting industry challenges.  Fixed Annuities sales rose significantly from the low levels in the prior year quarter, although sales and net flows declined sequentially, reflecting lower interest rates during the quarter as well as a more competitive market environment. We continue to maintain our fixed annuity pricing and asset quality disciplines.
Group Retirement benefited from higher deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust.  While variable annuity sales and net flows have been impacted by the uncertainties surrounding the DOL rule and market volatility, we are maintaining our pricing and product discipline to navigate these uncertainties. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs. 
As you can see on Slide 18, we continue to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, and as Sid mentioned, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Life saw growth in premiums and deposits of 5% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Operating comparisons reflected more favorable mortality experience. U.S. Life sales showed good growth from the same period last year, particularly in term life. Our positive sales trends in Life reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of independent distribution. We are also making progress in transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves. We will provide you with updates on these transactions as they are completed. 
Turning to Slide 20. I'm happy to report that Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvement reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses, including direct marketing costs as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. While we continue to expect that expenses will be the key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan. With respect to Japan, we remain focused on delivering current results, while preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger as previously reported. 
To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan. 
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A."

So first of all, let me just refer you back to Page 15 of our presentation and let me make a quick observation for you. In total, through the first 6 months of the year, our premium declined by approximately $1.9 billion. And what you can see is that because the left-hand side of this chart, product set 1 and product set 2A, have stayed, they've increased proportionately, but dollar amount-wise, is very close to flat on a first 6 months of 2016 versus first 6 months of 2015 basis. So what you can see is that almost all of our decline in premium volume has come from product set 2B and product set 3, which is the improved and remediate buckets of our business. The weighted average loss ratio of the business that is no longer being written out of product set 2B and product set 3 was approximately 90%. So you're talking about literally having not written business that ran at a loss ratio of 90% last year and now the business we're still writing in product set 2B and product set 3 have a weighted average loss ratio of about 72%. So I give you that to say that we've truly reduced the amount of writing in those lines of business. And what you can see is we did that without significantly disrupting the business we wanted to grow and maintain in product set 1 and product set 2B. I would generally say to you we continue to be focused on remediating and improving that right-hand side of the page. And our real objective would be how much more can we improve that without disrupting the business we want to grow in with the business we want to maintain. The last observation that I'll make for you here is that our primary emphasis is on maintaining our multi-line client relationships. And the percentages that you see here on Page 15 are probably, generally speaking, in line with what you might expect us to continue to work toward for the full year 2016."

So if I look at the year-over-year improvement on Commercial P&C, looks like you actually had more coming from international instead of North American Commercial. Now I've been thinking that the story of pruning the underperforming casualty plus the impact of reinsurance should be concentrated on the North American side. I'm not sure if I have that right, but that's been my assumption up until now. And if that's so, does that suggest that international is running ahead of plan and North America is more in line? Or can you shed some light on that?"

And what you can see is that the business in North America was what -- was our primary target when it came to reinsurance. And so when we did our reinsurance agreements that I described in the first quarter, those reinsurance agreements really focused around North American Casualty business. We continue to see, broadly speaking, our international business as attractive and are continuing to try to grow in most lines, in particular, in our multi-line -- multinational business. With that said, we see opportunities on a kind of selective basis to remediate even faster some of the business that was in product set 3 and the business that was in product set 2 in North America, partly because the market's been just pretty aggressive. And if the market is aggressive and we have an opportunity without disrupting the broader relationships to remediate, to improve faster in North America, we're happy to do it. I think surely Property in the U.S. is a very important part of this story. As I mentioned in my opening comments, Property rates are down in the U.S., in the excess and surplus lines Property business. And so we have, in fact, reduced the amount of writings that we're doing in the E&S property space. And we will continue to be very thoughtful about the Property business we do write. We're focused on our highly engineered lines in middle markets and large limits where we think we have a sustainable competitive advantage and where we think our engineering capabilities can help reduce the likelihood of a loss in the first place for our clients."

We've got the best Casualty team in this business and we will absolutely pursue opportunities to write Casualty business where we think we can get the proper pricing and where we think we can deliver value for our clients. With respect to Property, let me make 3 key observations for you. The first thing I want to say is that over the past few years, you'll see that we've been very actively managing our P&L to make sure that we manage the amount of exposure that we have to catastrophes. We've done that by reducing some of our risk, for example, in the Gulf Coast here in the United States and being willing to take exposures around the world where we think that along the efficient frontier, there's probably better opportunity between the risk reward tradeoff for pricing and risk. The second thing that I would observe for you is that we've really done a lot of work to build our engineering capabilities in Property, as you know. And the growth that you see in Property is coming very much through our middle market and our large-limit highly engineered Property space where we really think we have a competitive advantage and where we think we have the ability to change our loss ratio in a positive way. And the third point that I would make is that, absolutely, we believe that reinsurance provides an opportunity for us here. As I mentioned in my comments, we did take advantage in the second quarter of the opportunity to use reinsurance in a strategic manner to reduce the level of volatility associated with severe losses coming from the Property book. We entered into that agreement at the end of the second quarter, so we think that we'll see much more the benefit from that moving forward in the rest of 2016 and into 2017."

When you look at Page 9 of the financial supplement and you're trying to make sure that you can sort of reconcile that thought, just remember that any of the GOE that we put in the loss adjustment expenses is effectively deferred and amortized in like a DAC type of concept. And so therefore, you need to be thinking about what is the effect in the adjusted loss ratio on an amortized basis. And so 0.3 points is the right answer for you."

One, just remember that if our, I said this in my opening comments, if our total premium decline was 20% in the quarter after foreign exchange, about half of that came from reinsurance and our exits and market headwinds. So you could dissect that piece a little bit further and let me help you. I commented already that rates -- so the market headwinds from rates was about 1%. I commented that, that would then leave you with 9% of the decline associated with reinsurance and exits. If you thought about the exits, about $500 million worth of business is what we've exited, which is pretty small. It's about 2.5% of the $20 billion of premium that we wrote last year. So you might think of the benefit from exits as being something like, let's call it, 2 to 3 points. And so if you said, hey, he explains 10% through reinsurance exits and market headwinds, I think it's pretty fair to say that you probably got about 6 points of your reduction in premium coming from reinsurance. And so that's the effect that it had on the reinsurance.

That chart has 80 individual dots. Each of those dots is a module. And our ability to grow some and shrink others is indicative of what we're doing throughout the organization as we segment our business by product, by geography, by customer segment, by distribution channel and make differentiated managerial decisions to allocate capital where we're being properly rewarded, where we have long-term competitive advantage and pulling back and even exiting where we don't. And the information technology to be able to do that in ever more precise ways and the ability to not be overly swayed by the past but have better predictive analytics about the future, about lost trends and customer demand is what we're talking about. We clearly recognize the need to illustrate that through more transparency and I hope you find what we're doing to show modularity and action within the Commercial book helpful in anticipating where else would applying the same managerial discipline. And we -- as we have promised in January, we'll be talking about modular results at the sort of high level of 9 subsegments of AIG by the end of this year with full capital allocation and ROEs of those segments.

That said, given how close we monitor this, there are always some period-to-period changes in our funding projections. So on dividends and tax-sharing payments, we remain roughly in line with our projections and they'll have some variability with market conditions and statutory capital. Our leverage remains in line so it remains a very healthy under 20%. Hedge fund redemptions are on schedule, and there, the proceeds are market dependent, of course.

This morning, I'll speak briefly to our performance this quarter as well as our outlook and ongoing transformation. AIG's second quarter results show strong improvement towards all the goals the board and I announced in January. We've executed more quickly and smoothly than expected, and our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets is high as our earnings become more sustainable. 
In the second quarter, we continued to execute and delivered strong operating earnings of $0.98 per share, including a $0.17 charge from the workers' compensation discount, which Sid will discuss. Adjusted Commercial Insurance underwriting improved again this quarter, which Rob will speak to. Consumers' expense discipline also resulted in increased profitability, particularly in Personal Insurance, and Kevin will address this in his remarks. 
Across AIG, we are simplifying the company, accelerating our decision-making and adhering to a consistent management philosophy. We're executing on our objectives of managing our core operating portfolios to increase return on equity and managing our Legacy Portfolio for capital return. As we had previously announced, Charlie Shamieh is leading a team focused on our Legacy Portfolio and is actively moving forward. 
Our managerial discipline across AIG is based on a guiding principle of building economic value, which is consistently applied throughout the company. We frequently discuss our focus on value over volume when speaking to Commercial underwriting and the value of new business for Consumer businesses. The flexibility we have earned by focusing on expense discipline and growth in segments with sustainable value has allowed us to maintain positive operating leverage, while we have reduced our top line aggressively.
Normalized ROE was 8.8% for both the quarter and the first 6 months of this year. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE and was solidly on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. As a reminder, our third quarter normalized ROE will reflect a higher level of expected catastrophe losses. Book value per share, excluding AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, increased 5% in the quarter and we continue to expect to achieve double-digit growth for the full year. 
Our confidence in the future is based on our focus on what we can control. Our active value management framework for capital allocation and product design allows us to navigate through volatile markets. At this time, AIG's transformation to a more efficient and nimble organization is more important than ever. We anticipate and address challenges such as sustained low interest rates, Brexit and other market forces across our strategies. Sid will follow my remarks with greater transparency on the impact of low interest rates specifically. In the case of Brexit, we believe we're well positioned given our branch structure. It may be sometime before the requirements associated with Brexit are known and any potential economic impact from Brexit materializes. We're positioning AIG for changing economic, political and regulatory environments and for future earnings sustainability. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning, I'll speak to our quarterly financial results, including notable items.

Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating earnings showed good progress this quarter with strong underwriting results, particularly with respect to the Commercial accident year loss ratio as adjusted and expense discipline across AIG. In addition, UGC delivered another quarter of solid results, driven by improved loss experience and growth in net premiums earned. 
Our year-on-year comparisons were impacted by 4 items of note. First, the workers' compensation discount amounted to a $300 million charge this quarter versus a $400 million benefit. The workers' compensation discount rate adjustments are recorded in earnings, while offsetting changes in the fair value of securities backing these liabilities are recorded to AOCI. This results in minimal impact to reported book value. Accordingly, when we report on normalized ROE, we remove this noneconomic change in net reserve discount. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate, which is comprised of the U.S. Treasury rate plus an assumed credit spread, has roughly $100 million to $125 million pretax impact on reported earnings.
The second item was a modest $29 million of overall net unfavorable prior year reserve development compared to a net unfavorable development of $329 million a year ago. Included in the quarter was $109 million strengthening of Florida workers' compensation reserves, partially offset by favorable reserve development in Property and Specialty lines. The Florida workers' compensation reserve increase was due to recent industry-wide Florida court rulings, which occurred during the quarter. The judgments created an increased liability for previous years, which made a reserve increase in this segment prudent. AIG has a 5% market share in Florida and an average market share of 8% for the past 10- and 15-year periods. The third item was that Q2 was our highest natural catastrophe quarter since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. We had higher CAT losses in the quarter of $414 million compared to the roughly in line level of the $225 million in catastrophes for the prior year. 
The final item was the meaningful change in market-sensitive asset returns as shown on Slide 5. Overall, the impact of last year's outsized Q2 returns and our actions to reduce market-sensitive assets resulted in approximately $1 billion decline in mark-to-market income versus a year ago. However, of note in the quarter, these assets contributed just under $300 million to income, which was close to our expectation. Our steps to reduce market exposure will allow for more sustainable and less volatile earnings going forward. Since 2010, our market-sensitive assets have declined by over 40% or by $19 billion. 
Turning to Slide 6. We've provided an overview of the impact interest rates may have on our in-force as well as on new business for key portfolios. With respect to the in-force, we have a strong discipline around asset liability management led by our Chief Investment Officer, Doug Dachille. We see limited in-force impact on long-tail casualty, where assets are slightly longer than liabilities and on variable annuities, where in 2014 we made a decision to fully hedge the interest rate risk on living benefits, which is accounted for at fair value. 
On Fixed Annuities, approximately 72% of the book is already at guaranteed minimum crediting rates. The sustained low rates may reduce to lenders and we see potential spread compression from declining portfolio yields. We're projecting a 2 to 4 basis point quarterly decline in net spreads. For our Life business and legacy structured settlements, while we're exposed to some potential ALM mismatch on the long end of the curve due to limited investable assets, its impact on earnings in the next few years is modest, although it will grow somewhat over a very long time horizon with reinvestment.
On new business, we maintained a continued focus on pricing, product design and risk management across AIG. We expect some ROE compression in long-tail casualty. However, we continue to push on pricing and risk selection. For our annuity businesses, we expect the primary impact to be a decline in volumes as we frequently reevaluate our products to ensure that we're meeting our return targets. 
Considering both the in-force and new business, we're presenting a scenario to illustrate the potential headwinds to our January 26 stated targets from the current environment. The 2017 average 10-year treasury rate assumption that was used in our plan was 2.6%. Assuming interest rates are 100 basis points lower than our original 2.6% assumption, we would anticipate a potential 25 to 35 basis point reduction in 2017 normalized ROE based on a decline in normalized pretax operating income of $250 million to $350 million. However, if rates were to move steadily higher from the levels today back to our initial projection, we would not expect this impact to materialize. 
Also, as Peter said, our guiding philosophy is around managing to economic value. Since year-end, we estimate the decline in interest rate and markets has impacted our estimate of intrinsic value by approximately 5%. Despite the challenging interest rate environment, we remain committed our stated targets. We believe that our ability to manage our expense and capital structures we will discuss where we are ahead plan give us the ability to withstand potential 2017 earnings pressures.
Turning to Slide 7. We've executed against our plan and have reduced operating expenses by 11% year-to-date on a constant dollar basis. While the pace of this improvement should slow in the second half of the year, we expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections of new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. 
Slide 8 shows the expansion of our second quarter normalized ROE to 8.8%. This improvement reflected almost $15 billion of capital return to shareholders since the second quarter of 2015, as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results. 
Slide 9 shows a strong growth in book value, driven by earnings, realized capital gains, our estimated DTA utilization and accretive share repurchases during the quarter. 
Turning to capital on Slide 10. We continue to execute against our $25 billion capital return target and have returned $7.2 billion of capital to shareholders in the first half of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.8 billion towards the purchase of 50 million common shares, and we also repurchased 5 million of our outstanding warrants for $90 million. Since quarter end and through August 2, we repurchased an additional $698 million of common shares. Our remaining authorization stands at approximately $4 billion, including the new $3 billion authorization announced yesterday. Our balance sheet remains very strong with $6.7 billion of parent liquidity, a financial leverage ratio below 20% and RBC and rating agency capital ratios that continue to remain within our targets.
With respect to the key levers funding our capital return target, free cash flow continued to be strong in the second quarter, as shown on Slide 11. We announced that we would reduce our hedge fund allocation by about half, which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. Submitted notices of redemption are $4.2 billion, and through the second quarter, proceeds have freed up approximately $400 million in capital in our life companies, which have caught up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments. Additionally, distributions from the life companies during the quarter included $315 million from the sale of AIG Advisor Group. 
We continue to make solid progress on monetizing legacy assets, with $4.3 billion of total free cash flow generated over the last 3 quarters. During the quarter, the holding company recognized $500 million of proceeds, largely from the sale of the PICC Group stake held at parent to the nonlife companies. We have completed the majority of encumbered asset dispositions or transferred outlined in our January 26 strategic plan as of the end of the second quarter. Charlie Shamieh and his team are focused on the disposition process going forward for many of the insurance liabilities in Legacy, which we have kicked off for several portfolios. It is important to note that some of the legacy insurance portfolios will have more extended time frames for exit. We'll provide further disclosure at year-end with our modular segment reporting for Legacy and provide additional information on a timely basis as we close any material transactions that are in progress. As Peter stated, we're focused on continued execution of our strategic plan that we first outlined in January and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress throughout 2016. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

Commercial had a strong second quarter despite the backdrop of a generally soft market. Today, I'll discuss how the execution of our strategic plan is improving Commercial's mix of business and creating a leaner, more focused and profitable organization. We're committed to making economic-based decisions, while we remain true to our vision of being our clients' most valued insurer.
Turning to Slide 13. Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio of 62.4% improved 4.2 points from the prior year quarter with 3.4 points related to the strategic actions we announced in January and 0.8 points attributable to a lower level of severe losses. We reduced second quarter net premium writings by 20% after adjusting for foreign exchange as part of reshaping of the portfolio. About half of the change was driven by increasing our use of reinsurance, the targeted exits we communicated in the first quarter and market headwinds from lower rates. The vast majority of the other half was attributable to underwriting actions and poorer performing subsegments of Casualty and Property. These actions included addressing unprofitable single or 2-product client relationships and micro-segmentation and re-underwriting of risks using enhanced analytic tools. As always, we make underwriting decisions initially on a product basis and then on a client-by-client basis, taking a holistic view across each client relationship. We've placed the priority on limiting disruption for our clients and broker partners and preserving the strength of our valued multiline client relationships. Retention for our major clients remains very healthy at about 94% on a year-to-date basis.
Our objective is to deploy our capital in higher-performing subsegments where we earn our target rate of return. The market is practicing less restraint and we've taken advantage of the opportunity to shed underperforming and highly commoditized businesses, while having the flexibility to retain more attractive risks with the same clients. As a result of the pace of our actions and underwriting discipline, we're updating our 2016 full year estimates to reflect us managing net premiums written down by a total of approximately $3 billion in 2016 as we seek to optimize our portfolio.
Globally, rates were down about 1 point, reflecting competitive international conditions, while overall rates in the U.S. were about flat. U.S. Casualty rates continued their positive trend, increasing over 4.5 points and rates were up 2 points in our Specialty businesses. Partially offsetting those increases, we continued to observe pressure in the excess and surplus lines Property business and we saw more aggressive pricing in Financial Lines where rates decreased about 2%.
I'm pleased to say that during the first half of 2016, we recorded double-digit growth in several lines where we are a market leader and offer a compelling value proposition including M&A, middle-market property, cyber and credit lines. In addition, multinational programs increased by approximately 9%, demonstrating our enduring advantage in this important client segment, and we continue to experience growth in large limit property. We're placing emphasis on investing in analytics and engineering capabilities to offer our clients unique data-driven insights that go beyond traditional risk transfer capabilities. 
Switching gears to expenses. I'm happy to share that our GOE ratio improved 1.2 points in the quarter as a result of AIG's expense initiatives. We expected expenses will continue to decline, although at a more modest pace in the second half of the year. The GOE ratio will likely trend slightly upward from its current level as the impact of our lower written premiums earn in during the remainder of 2016 and 2017. With that said, we're proud that the improvements in our loss ratio are not expected to be significantly offset by deterioration of our expense ratio. 
Slide 14 shows the continued improvement in Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2011 and the second quarter of 2016, including the effect of 2012 through 2015 prior period development in each accident year. The second quarter result of 62.4% represents a 3.8 point improvement over the full year of 2015, reflecting the impact of our strategic initiatives to improve the loss ratio. Our team is doing a terrific job executing against our plan, and we received excellent support from our clients and broker partners who recognize the value of a strong AIG standing by their side. 
We remain confident that we will reach our previously announced 62% exit run rate target for 2016. As we've stated in the past, we do not expect our progress to be linear, notwithstanding this quarter's performance in the low level of severe losses, our results are subject to volatility, particularly in Property. Late in the quarter, we put in place a focused reinsurance agreement for classes of business that have generated the greatest volatility in our international Property business. We're also pleased that we've been able to avoid several recent notable losses in Property as a result of our engineering and risk selection capabilities. These actions should dampen the past volatility we've experienced, but we will continue to have a degree of exposure to risks that are difficult to predict. 
Slide 15 is the same slide we provided last quarter, updated to show the change in our business mix and adjusted accident year loss ratio between 2015 and the first half of the 2016 using 3 business strategy groupings: grow, maintain or improve and remediate. I'll highlight 4 points. First, the business we want to grow and maintain has increased from half of our premiums in 2015 to 60% to premiums through the first half of 2016. The weighted average adjusted accident year loss ratio was an attractive 56% through the first 6 months of 2016, which is broadly in line with the full year 2015 result of 54%. During the quarter, we continued to focus on growing these highly profitable areas of the business and investing in its clients.
Second, the business we're remediating decreased from 15% of the portfolio in 2015 to 9% through the first 6 months of the year and the accident year loss ratio has improved from 91% in 2015 to 84% over that time. Our improvements are the result of the exits we announced in the first quarter and the fact that we've not been writing new business that falls in this worst-performing group. 
Third, the business that we're seeking to improve declined from 35% of premiums in 2015 to 31% of premiums in the first half of 2016, while the accident year loss ratio improved 6 points from 73% to 67% over the time. Our client and risk selection strategies and expansion of reinsurance were the primary drivers of those changes.
Finally, collectively, the business that we're remediating and the business that we're improving declined from half of the portfolio in 2015 to 40% for the first 6 months of 2016, while the weighted average accident year loss ratio improved by 7 points from 79% to 72% over that time. As you can see from the slides, we've achieved significant improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by truly transforming our portfolio. 
In closing, the second quarter was marked by focus on our strongest performing businesses and most valued client relationships, while we continued to execute our strategic actions. The results are a testament to the commitment and pace with which we're implementing our plan, which provides me with the confidence that we will achieve the targets we've communicated. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."
250388,369550300,1024422,"American International Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","American International Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, Consumer Insurance pretty solid results for the quarter on an overall basis, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life an",937,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, Consumer Insurance pretty solid results for the quarter on an overall basis, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Before specifically addressing the results, I would like to briefly provide some context. We are pleased that the benefits from a number of our strategic initiatives are positively emerging in our results. For example, our focused strategy in Personal Insurance and investments we have been making in Japan have lowered our overall expense ratio while producing profitable premium growth in select areas, including our high-net-worth client group business. 
In Group Retirement, the investments we've made to enhance both our plan sponsor service and participant experience are starting to pay off in both our acquisition and retention activities. For our U.S. Life business, we are realizing meaningful cost benefits from the consolidation of numerous policy administration and field compensation systems into modern common platforms. 
Realizing these types of benefits from our strategic initiatives is particularly important as our businesses face various challenges associated with the economic and regulatory environment. In particular, industry variable annuity sales are being pressured due to volatile equity markets and uncertainty about the DOL fiduciary rule. We are confident we will be prepared in time for implementation of the DOL rule, and we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners as they determine their chosen paths for implementation, which we will in turn support.
The combination of our leading market positions across annuity product lines and our multichannel distribution network positions us well to respond to various market conditions and the regulatory landscapes. Also, recent actions we have taken in our U.S. retirement and life proprietary distribution channels make us more nimble with respect to changing market conditions. With the completion of the sale of AIG Advisor Group during the quarter, going forward, nearly 100% of our retail variable annuity sales will be from third-party independent distribution. 
Separately, in January of this year, we substantially reduced our Life career distribution channel. Independent distribution accounted for 80% of our U.S. Life sales year-to-date. At this time, our main proprietary distribution channels are our valid financial advisers who play a key role in serving our Group Retirement plan sponsors and participants in our direct-to-consumer business, AIG Direct. Increasing our focus on independent distribution reduces our fixed cost burden and enables us to change emphasis on product sales according to opportunity as we maintain pricing discipline. Across our businesses, we are constantly looking for new opportunities to reduce costs and variabilize expenses. 
Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to Retirement on Slide 17, we saw 6% growth in Retirement sales from a year ago. Growth was led by Fixed Annuities, Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement, while variable annuity sales declined, reflecting industry challenges. Fixed Annuities sales rose significantly from the low levels in the prior year quarter, although sales and net flows declined sequentially, reflecting lower interest rates during the quarter as well as a more competitive market environment. We continue to maintain our fixed annuity pricing and asset quality disciplines.
Group Retirement benefited from higher deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust. While variable annuity sales and net flows have been impacted by the uncertainties surrounding the DOL rule and market volatility, we are maintaining our pricing and product discipline to navigate these uncertainties. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs. 
As you can see on Slide 18, we continue to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, and as Sid mentioned, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Life saw growth in premiums and deposits of 5% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Operating comparisons reflected more favorable mortality experience. U.S. Life sales showed good growth from the same period last year, particularly in term life. Our positive sales trends in Life reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of independent distribution. We are also making progress in transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves. We will provide you with updates on these transactions as they are completed. 
Turning to Slide 20. I'm happy to report that Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvement reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses, including direct marketing costs as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. While we continue to expect that expenses will be the key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan. With respect to Japan, we remain focused on delivering current results, while preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger as previously reported. 
To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan.

So first of all, let me just refer you back to Page 15 of our presentation and let me make a quick observation for you. In total, through the first 6 months of the year, our premium declined by approximately $1.9 billion. And what you can see is that because the left-hand side of this chart, product set 1 and product set 2A, have stayed, they've increased proportionately, but dollar amount-wise, is very close to flat on a first 6 months of 2016 versus first 6 months of 2015 basis. So what you can see is that almost all of our decline in premium volume has come from product set 2B and product set 3, which is the improved and remediate buckets of our business. The weighted average loss ratio of the business that is no longer being written out of product set 2B and product set 3 was approximately 90%. So you're talking about literally having not written business that ran at a loss ratio of 90% last year and now the business we're still writing in product set 2B and product set 3 have a weighted average loss ratio of about 72%. So I give you that to say that we've truly reduced the amount of writing in those lines of business. And what you can see is we did that without significantly disrupting the business we wanted to grow and maintain in product set 1 and product set 2B. I would generally say to you we continue to be focused on remediating and improving that right-hand side of the page. And our real objective would be how much more can we improve that without disrupting the business we want to grow in with the business we want to maintain. The last observation that I'll make for you here is that our primary emphasis is on maintaining our multi-line client relationships.

So if I look at the year-over-year improvement on Commercial P&C, looks like you actually had more coming from international instead of North American Commercial. Now I've been thinking that the story of pruning the underperforming casualty plus the impact of reinsurance should be concentrated on the North American side. I'm not sure if I have that right, but that's been my assumption up until now. And if that's so, does that suggest that international is running ahead of plan and North America is more in line? Or can you shed some light on that?"

And what you can see is that the business in North America was what -- was our primary target when it came to reinsurance. And so when we did our reinsurance agreements that I described in the first quarter, those reinsurance agreements really focused around North American Casualty business. We continue to see, broadly speaking, our international business as attractive and are continuing to try to grow in most lines, in particular, in our multi-line -- multinational business. With that said, we see opportunities on a kind of selective basis to remediate even faster some of the business that was in product set 3 and the business that was in product set 2 in North America, partly because the market's been just pretty aggressive. And if the market is aggressive and we have an opportunity without disrupting the broader relationships to remediate, to improve faster in North America, we're happy to do it. I think surely Property in the U.S. is a very important part of this story. As I mentioned in my opening comments, Property rates are down in the U.S., in the excess and surplus lines Property business. And so we have, in fact, reduced the amount of writings that we're doing in the E&S property space. And we will continue to be very thoughtful about the Property business we do write.

I have -- I can't resist to take a quick moment to say -- to put a plug in for our Casualty team. We've got the best Casualty team in this business and we will absolutely pursue opportunities to write Casualty business where we think we can get the proper pricing and where we think we can deliver value for our clients. With respect to Property, let me make 3 key observations for you. The first thing I want to say is that over the past few years, you'll see that we've been very actively managing our P&L to make sure that we manage the amount of exposure that we have to catastrophes. We've done that by reducing some of our risk, for example, in the Gulf Coast here in the United States and being willing to take exposures around the world where we think that along the efficient frontier, there's probably better opportunity between the risk reward tradeoff for pricing and risk. The second thing that I would observe for you is that we've really done a lot of work to build our engineering capabilities in Property, as you know. And the growth that you see in Property is coming very much through our middle market and our large-limit highly engineered Property space where we really think we have a competitive advantage and where we think we have the ability to change our loss ratio in a positive way. And the third point that I would make is that, absolutely, we believe that reinsurance provides an opportunity for us here. As I mentioned in my comments, we did take advantage in the second quarter of the opportunity to use reinsurance in a strategic manner to reduce the level of volatility associated with severe losses coming from the Property book. We entered into that agreement at the end of the second quarter, so we think that we'll see much more the benefit from that moving forward in the rest of 2016 and into 2017."

The first thing I would say to you is I know that you should walk away understanding this, that about 0.3 points of the improvement in our adjusted accident year loss ratio comes from loss adjustment expenses. When you look at Page 9 of the financial supplement and you're trying to make sure that you can sort of reconcile that thought, just remember that any of the GOE that we put in the loss adjustment expenses is effectively deferred and amortized in like a DAC type of concept. And so therefore, you need to be thinking about what is the effect in the adjusted loss ratio on an amortized basis. And so 0.3 points is the right answer for you."

Let me give you this as maybe a way to observe this for you. One, just remember that if our, I said this in my opening comments, if our total premium decline was 20% in the quarter after foreign exchange, about half of that came from reinsurance and our exits and market headwinds. So you could dissect that piece a little bit further and let me help you. I commented already that rates -- so the market headwinds from rates was about 1%. I commented that, that would then leave you with 9% of the decline associated with reinsurance and exits. If you thought about the exits, about $500 million worth of business is what we've exited, which is pretty small. It's about 2.5% of the $20 billion of premium that we wrote last year. So you might think of the benefit from exits as being something like, let's call it, 2 to 3 points. And so if you said, hey, he explains 10% through reinsurance exits and market headwinds, I think it's pretty fair to say that you probably got about 6 points of your reduction in premium coming from reinsurance. And so that's the effect that it had on the reinsurance. And then, if you want to know what effect it had on the loss ratio, just remember most of that happened in product set 2B and product set 3, but product set 2B, so you can see the loss ratio on the dispersion chart that we show on Page 15."

That chart has 80 individual dots. Each of those dots is a module. And our ability to grow some and shrink others is indicative of what we're doing throughout the organization as we segment our business by product, by geography, by customer segment, by distribution channel and make differentiated managerial decisions to allocate capital where we're being properly rewarded, where we have long-term competitive advantage and pulling back and even exiting where we don't. And the information technology to be able to do that in ever more precise ways and the ability to not be overly swayed by the past but have better predictive analytics about the future, about lost trends and customer demand is what we're talking about. We clearly recognize the need to illustrate that through more transparency and I hope you find what we're doing to show modularity and action within the Commercial book helpful in anticipating where else would applying the same managerial discipline. And we -- as we have promised in January, we'll be talking about modular results at the sort of high level of 9 subsegments of AIG by the end of this year with full capital allocation and ROEs of those segments.

That said, given how close we monitor this, there are always some period-to-period changes in our funding projections. So on dividends and tax-sharing payments, we remain roughly in line with our projections and they'll have some variability with market conditions and statutory capital. Our leverage remains in line so it remains a very healthy under 20%. Hedge fund redemptions are on schedule, and there, the proceeds are market dependent, of course.

I'm pleased with our progress this quarter and the continued execution of our strategic plan. We reported third quarter operating EPS of $1 a share, a solid result despite volatility from our review of our longevity assumptions and certain segments of our Commercial business.
I'm pleased that we've maintained our strong position in our Life and Retirement segments and delivered another strong quarter in Personal Insurance. I remain highly focused on the continued improvement of our commercial underwriting and believe we're taking appropriate actions. Sid and Rob will talk to the specifics of our reserves and underwriting strategy in their remarks.
Since the second quarter, we announced or completed 5 strategic and complex transactions. These actions are increasing the sustainability of AIG's earnings and are reshaping the company. During our January strategy update, we discussed our focus on targeting geographies and segments with critical mass and expertise while improving our multinational capabilities. The Fairfax transaction is the most recent example of executing on this strategy. The transaction required for the extraordinary effort of our employees across 2 continents, 12 countries and require the close and timely coordination with over 20 different regulators. The transaction is expected to consolidate our network partners and reinforce our commitment to servicing our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions, without the need for bricks and mortar in every location.
As we committed to you in January, we are narrowing our focus on those countries where we have opportunities to improve our ROE. We're also highly focused on disruption in the market and our future growth opportunities. During the third quarter, we announced the launch of our technology driven solution to serve the USD 80 billion small to middle market. AIG, Hamilton Insurance and Two Sigma joined together to form Attune. Attune will partner with retail and wholesale intermediaries and offer small businesses a broader and more flexible range of products through a technology-enabled platform. Through the combination of Hamilton's small business expertise, AIG's scale, extensive data and long-standing distribution network and Two Sigma's technology and data science capabilities, Attune can offer a powerful, disruptive solution to the small business market.
In addition to our actions to simplify AIG, our expense discipline continued this quarter. Through the 9 months, we are ahead of our 6% planned reduction with a 10% decline in operating GOE, excluding any foreign exchange affect and the impact of the sale of the AIG Advisor Group. We expect expense reductions to extend into 2017 and remain ahead of plan as a result of actions taken across the company.
The normalized return on equity was 7.1% for the quarter and 8.3% for the 9 months. Third quarter normalized return on equity reflects our seasonally high expected third quarter CAT losses. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE, and we're on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. We will provide greater insights into our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day.
We continue to shape the company to deliver more sustainable, higher-quality earnings and remain focused on meeting our 2-year strategic objectives. Our results and the strength of our relationships with customers and partners in the industry are positive indications of our progress and the foundation we're building for the long-term success of AIG.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings improved from the same per",1165,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.
Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings improved from the same period last year, with the decline in the commercial accident year loss ratio as adjusted, expense discipline across AIG and improved alternative investment returns all meaningfully contributed to the improvement in performance. Looking ahead while we're only 1 month into the fourth quarter, our early estimate of losses from Hurricane Matthew is about $250 million, roughly 2/3 of which relates to commercial and 1/3 relates to consumer.
Operating results also reflected 2 adverse impacts of note. First, we took a loss recognition charge of $622 million related to longevity experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a legacy block of structured settlements under it in pre 2010. This legacy block accounted for over 80% of the $622 million charge. As we told you on our January 26 strategy update, these assets and liabilities will be reported in the Legacy Portfolio when we release our fourth quarter recaps and results.
Shifting to our Operating Portfolio actuarial updates, we recorded net charges totaling $24 million. We recorded a benefit of $238 million for our operating consumer life and retirement business due largely to fixed annuity surrender options, partially offset by increasing reserves for universal life and secondary guarantees. Offsetting this, we recorded $262 million of total prior year adverse reserve development net of premium adjustments, which largely related to our U.S. program business within specialty. Rob will comment further on this review and the underwriting actions we've taken on our U.S. program book.
During the quarter, we announced the sale of UGC to Arch Capital Group and have included an overview of the transaction on Slide 6. AIG will retain the attractive economics associated with our 50% quota share reinsurance agreement on business written by UGC and are reporting earnings in commercial insurance. This quota share covers business written during the 2014 to 2016 accident years and we expect average annual pretax earnings from the quota share will be approximately $150 million for 2017 and '18 will decline thereafter. The remaining operating results of UGC, which is held for sale on the balance sheet, are being reported in corporate and other up to the closing date. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter ideally or early in the first quarter.
We expect to receive $2.2 billion in cash proceeds at closing, an additional $250 million pre-closing dividend, as well as approximately 9% of Arch's common shares. In addition as part of the transaction, UGC's tax attribute deferred tax assets remained with AIG. Note this quarter, we also began reporting Institutional Markets results in corporate and other as the vast majority of this business will be reported in legacy beginning in the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 shows recent strategic transactions and their estimated impact on our 2017 results. Although this modest earnings impact from these transactions, each transaction is accretive to our overall ROE. Rob and Kevin will speak to the strategic rationale for the commercial and consumer transactions. 
Consistent with our capital plan, we completed a life reinsurance transaction late in the third quarter that resulted in the distribution of approximately $1 billion of excess statutory capital from our U.S. life company to AIG's parent. This is our first completed life reinsurance transaction towards our goal of freeing up $4 billion to $5 billion of capital by the end of 2017. We remain focused and confident on executing on the additional life reinsurance transactions. The earnings impact from this transaction will be reported in next quarter's new legacy module as it's largely related to legacy whole Life and universal Life business.
Turning to Slide 8, as Peter stated, we're head of plan and expenses as we continue to expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our production projections of new business to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. We took additional pretax restructuring charges of $210 million during the quarter related to our ongoing efficiency program, which we expect will generate an additional $400 million of run rate expense savings. We expect to exceed our 2-year expense reduction target.
Slide 9 details the 120 basis point expansion in normalized ROE for the quarter. This improvement reflects the at the return of capital to shareholders, as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results and reflects our seasonally high CAT loss expectation of the quarter, which is greater than reported 3Q CAT losses. Our year-to-date normalized ROE is 8.3% and we continue to expect to achieve a full year normalized ROE target of at least 8.4%.
Slide 10 shows the drivers of book value per share x AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, which grew 1% during the quarter and 5% year-to-date reflecting operating earnings and accretive share repurchases.
Turning to capital on Slide 11, we continue to execute against a capital return target and we are confident we are on track to meet our target. We returned $9.8 million of capital to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.3 billion towards the repurchase of almost 40 million common shares. Since quarter end and through November 2, we repurchased an additional $946 million of common shares, leaving about $1.4 billion unused under the current authorization plus an additional $3 billion from the new authorization that we just announced.
Our balance sheet and free cash flow remains very strong, and as you can see on the Slide 12, parent liquidity at quarter end was $8.6 billion, above our targeted range of $6 billion to $8 billion and reflects the timing of insurance company dividends received late in the quarter.
In addition to the life reinsurance transaction, we also monetize $900 million of legacy assets during the quarter or $5.2 billion over the last 4 quarters. These proceeds are partially funded capital return to shareholders. And they're considering announced not closed transactions and expect to well exceed the $5 billion to $7 billion funding target of divestitures that we have lined in our January 26 strategic update.
We also announced that we reduced our hedge fund allocation by about half which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. We have reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which just freed up approximately $800 million of capital in our life companies, which has come up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments.
As Peter stated, we're focused on the continued execution of our strategic plan and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress at our upcoming Investor Day. Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

During the third quarter, we remain focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing",1137,"Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we remain focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing both the adjusted accident year loss ratio and expense ratio and this quarter we saw improvement in both. We will have quarterly variability mutual benefit of the accident year combined ratio but we expect the net result will continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 14. The adjusted accident year loss ratio declined 1.9 points during the third quarter, reflecting continued improvement in U.S. Casualty. The UGC quota share agreement contributed to the improvement over prior year by 0.4 points in the third quarter or 0.3 points year-to-date.
Moving to expenses, the 1.9. expense ratio improvement exceeded the prior year quarter despite lower net premiums earned. We expect expenses to continue to decline, but similar to the loss ratio, the expense ratio will fluctuate around a downward trend line. Globally, rates were down less than 1 point, with a marginal increase in the U.S. and more aggressive competition internationally. In the U.S., casualty rates increased 3.5 points, representing the fourth consecutive quarter with rate increases in excess of 3 points and specialty rates increased 2.5 points. Partially offsetting those increases was continued pressure in property of approximately 4 points, driven primarily by excess and surplus lines. In certain segments, we're seeing fewer high-quality new business opportunities and therefore have maintained our discipline as we deploy our capital where we will meet or exceed our targeted rate of return. We're pleased that we continue to grow in our focused growth segments year-to-date despite competitive market conditions.
In prioritizing our valued multiline client relationships, retention from major clients have remained consistent with prior levels at 94%. As an example, multinational global policies grew 8%, reflecting our multiyear investment to provide world-class solutions for clients across the globe. As Peter mentioned, an important part of the Fairfax transaction is Fairfax will act as our strategic network partner to serve multinational clients in all 12 countries included in the deal. This follows a similar transaction completed with Grupo ASA in Central America last year, and signifies an enhanced strategy to better serve our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions through what we consider to be the best combination of owned operations and strong strategic partners in the industry.
Turning to third quarter calendar year results. CAT losses were better than our annual average loss expectation but higher than prior year. And as Sid mentioned, the U.S. programs business resulted in a commercial and net reserves strengthening about $306 million. Our U.S. programs business consists of $1.1 billion of annual net premiums written spanning across 108 program segments and 41 program administrators. This business is written via managing general agents but predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises, and third-party administrators handle over half of the claims activity. Prior year development was driven by higher than expected loss emergence in the most recent calendar year from a subset of these programs.
We've now completed a detailed segmentation of the entire programs book as part of a broader, more holistic assessment of the business we transact with managing general agents. Through the review, we identified programs which we can grow, improve remediate or terminate based on our profitability criteria and we terminated 16 program segments with net premium segments written totaling approximately $200 million as a result.
We estimate approximately 80% of the programs business reserve charge relates to programs where we've initiated termination or we're in the process of remediating. The purpose of evaluating our managing general agent relationships has been to determine where we wish to focus our resources, reposition the relationships and better align incentives. The sale of our interest in Ascot and MSM, which we announced earlier this quarter, are examples of ROE-accretive repositioning where we will opportunistically partner with these franchises that with highly specialized expertise and diversification benefits to create a greater long-term value for AIG.
Now turning to Slide 15. The year-to-date adjusted accident year loss ratio of 64.1 improved 2.1 points from the full year 2015 excluding the UGC quota share benefit. The remainder of my comments will exclude the benefit to provide an apples-to-apples comparison of our performance to the strategic targets we set in January. While the chart of the top right side of the page demonstrates the quarter-to-quarter variability of losses, I am pleased to be the overall improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio trendline. Our ability to manage expenses, combined with the loss ratio improvement, resulted in reduced accident year combined ratio improvement of 3.1 points. This quarter, we experienced more pronounced volatility in our short tail lines which adversely impacted commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio by approximately 2 points. 1 point was attributable to increase the current accident year losses following our review of the U.S. programs business and the other point was related to higher property attritional losses. Although third quarter severe losses was significantly lower than prior year, property and attritional loss ratio was the second highest results over the past 12 quarters due to the claims frequency that was greater than the norm. 
During the past several years, we've made several significant changes to structurally improve the quality of our property portfolio, including our shift from excess and surplus lines to highly engineered risks and the expansion of our user reinsuring. However, as we've said in the past, we do not expect our path to be linear.
We believe accepting a reasonable degree of variability in quarterly results is the right business decision, and we have the ability to course correct as business and market conditions change. Given our actions in the first 9 months of the year, we're continuing to target the run rate adjusted accident year loss ratio reduction of 4 points, recognizing as we saw this quarter for those with respect product for till property losses, our results are subject of volatility. We remain committed to target of 6-point run rate accident year loss ratio by the end of 2017.
As shown on Slide 16, we continue to make strategic progress in optimizing our portfolio to reduce the adjusted accident year loss ratio. Overall, we're pleased with the pace of improvement in our mix of business written through the first 9 months of the year which will earn in over future periods.
In closing, although we may some headwinds this quarter, and part of the progress our team has made improving our portfolio, managing expenses and proactively seeking out value-enhance opportunities. Reflecting our -- reflected on our work over the past 10 months, I am confident in this team's ability to execute our strategy. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our consumer insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portf",1054,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our consumer insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of retirement, life and Personal Insurance businesses. Importantly, each of our businesses is executing on our strategic priority and are focused on value creation that I will discuss.
First, let me make a few introductory comments. In retirement, I am proud to say that our strong diversification has made AIG the largest provider of annuities in the U.S. in the first half of the year. While we hold the top 5 sales ranking in each of variable index and fixed annuities, and we are the only company to hold the top 5 sales ranking in more than any one of these lines, our focus is on value over volume, and we continue to maintain vigorous pricing discipline facilitated by our lack of dependence on any one product.
In Personal Insurance, we continue to execute on our focused strategy. We are on track to meet our target state of 15 individual and 35 group countries by the end of 2017. And the most recent announcement with Fairfax Financial is a further key step to achieving our goal. The benefits from these actions are beginning to emerge and will continue to evolve over the coming years. Most importantly, we are preserving our ability to serve are multinational customers and covered employee covered individuals through our strategic network partners.
In U.S. Personal Insurance, our Private Client Group is implementing a market competitive end-to-end platform to build on the double-digit growth that we've been generating, which will further improve the customer and distributor experience and create operational efficiencies through automation and self-servicing.
In Japan, we remain focused on transforming the business, delivering improved results, executing on our customer value proposition, all while we are preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger. During the quarter, J.D. Power Auto Consumer Satisfaction Survey awarded Fuji Fire and Marine with the #1 ranking in shopping [ph] satisfaction and AIU with the #1 ranking in relationship satisfaction in the market. We also now averaged over 20,000 independent Japanese agents using our new technology front-end platform on a daily basis.
Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to retirement on Slide 18, in the quarter, we saw a lower retirement sales from a year ago, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in variable annuity sales from the uncertainty caused by the DOL fiduciary rule and market volatility. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs. We have been proactive in updating our variable annuity product features and taking pricing actions to maintain our returns in the continuing low interest rate environment. With respect to the DOL rule, we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners and are confident that we will be prepared to support them on their broad spectrum of chosen paths for implementation.
Fixed annuity sales and net flows declined reflecting our ongoing fixed annuity pricing discipline in the current investment rate and credit spread environment. Maintaining our fixed annuity pricing and asset quality focus remains a priority as we seek value over volume.
Group Retirement benefited from strong deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust. We do expect to see more plan conversions in the fourth quarter, which is standard for the defined contribution market, including both large plan acquisitions and large case group surrenders.
As you can see on Slide 19, we continue to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.
Turning to Slide 20. Growth in international life sales drove an increase in premiums and deposits of 10% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Growth in U.S. life sales reflects our focus on term life, where we are again a top 5 term writer and also #1 in direct term sales in the first 6 months of the year. Change in our product mix demonstrates our commitment to the value of new business as we have increased our focus on products without long-duration interest rate guarantees. Our positive sales trends at life also reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of our independent distribution network.
Operating comparisons for life benefited from continuing favorable mortality experience, expense management and improved investment returns. We also continue to make progress in the transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves.
As Sid mentioned, we completed our first life reinsurance transaction during the quarter. This was an extremely large and complex transaction and I would like to Charlie Shamieh and the whole exude team for their discipline and focus throughout the transaction process. I'm confident that, supported by this team, we will continue to meet our targets for the remaining lecture reinsurance transactions.
Turning to Slide 21, Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvement reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses including direct marketing costs as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. We did see a higher number of large but not severe losses in the quarter than a year ago. However, the accident year loss ratio as adjusted was only slightly above our expectation. Expenses continue to be a key lever to future margin excess expansion in Personal Insurance. But as I have said, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan.
To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our consumer businesses, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plans. Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up to Q&A."

I think that the way you're segmenting the business is not the way we run the business. And so we try to make very clear in our January strategy update forward-looking segmentation to help you think about valuation in an adequate profitability as you put in 2 broad segments, legacy and operating. And within the operating, that helps you estimate what our sustainable ROE will be and hence, what kind of multiple on earnings you think we might deserve. And in the legacy, I think it's very clear that sizable chunk of equity is -- about 1/4 of the company's equity at the beginning of this year had a very soft, optimal return, about 3% return on equity. And therefore, as you get to understand the legacy better, you figure out what kind of discount to the current book value you need to sort of anchor your valuation from. So I'm feeling really good right now about the returns on the aggregate of all of our operating businesses on a forward-looking basis. And I think the big question mark is how quickly and how big a discount to book value we can divest or reinsure the legacy book. And I think getting into the subsegments as you have, I don't think it's a practical way -- when we're looking at divestitures, it's very focused on the legacy and focused on the most efficient way to cleanse the earnings picture with those substandard returns so that we can focus our energy on a sustainable return on the operating business. So I think that's the way we look at it. And I don't know if there's any detailed comments on the segments that either Rob or Kevin would like to make."

I'll just make a couple of quick thoughts. First of all, as it relates to the adjusted accident year loss ratio in commercial, as just restate I'm absolutely confident that we're making the important changes that we've got to make to deliver on our commitment to improve the loss ratio by 6 points. And I probably would point to 4 quick observations. First, we'd absolutely demonstrated willingness to reduce our premium rating as we retain a business that we think is important for us to remain focused on our valued client segments. We've been doing this very consistently throughout the year. You can see that our premium volume is the first 9 must of the year is down 16%, including, of course, the effect of reinsurance. The second point that I'd make is that as we show on Page 16 of the presentation, the accident year loss ratio dispersion chart showed that we're driving improvements in the mix of business in a very material way. And to put this in context for you, the remediated and proved portions of our portfolio have declined by 1/3 on a dollar basis from $7.5 billion of premiums in the first 9 months of 2015 to $5.1 billion of premium in the first 9 months of 2016, showing that where we're reducing premium is in the remediated and proved portions of the portfolio. Actually in the grow and maintain portions of the portfolio, product set 1 and product set 2a, our premium volume is approximately flat. It's down just about 2%.

I think across the board in Personal Insurance, we've actually enjoyed quite strong margin expansion, including in North America. And in fact, registered combined ratio has improved from 95.9 last year to 92.4 this year, which you may be seeing, however, in the loss ratio is that in the third quarter, once we have quite a bit of consistency quarter-to-quarter, there is a little bit of volatility. We did have a number of losses that are large, over $2 million, but not quite at the severe level in the third quarter. Whereas in the first 2 quarters, there was really an absence of those. So year-to-date, frankly, we are pretty much where we had expected to be in terms of the loss ratio. Consistent with what we've done in the rest of Personal Insurance in the North American portfolio, we have worked hard on remediating certain areas of the business, including particularly the warranty, which process is now complete. And we're seeing quite strong growth in all of type of client group business, which is one of our leading businesses. So we're quite comfortable with the direction we're going in PI, including the very strong North American franchise."

First of all, I think the main message on Page 16 is that we're driving our improvement by improving the mix of business. So if you look at product set 1 and 2 while I would love to retain my loss ratio as low as possible, overall, the loss ratio has increased by 3 points overall for products 1 and 2, from 54% in 2015 to 57% for the first 9 months of 2016. So you've got to actual market conditions, which will be whatever the rate changes are in the market. So it's a -- view as you might imagine pretty competitive in that space. And second, whenever we do an update to our reserves, we don't wait to make changes to our loss mix. And so to the extent that we have updated our reserve reviews, we've already reflected an increase in our loss products 1 and 2 where those reserve reviews have been completed. I would note that in product set 2b and 3, where the loss ratio has come down from 79% down to 73% over the first 9 months of the year, the main observation I'd drive for you there is that's not because anybody gave me lower loss sets.

With respect to the shorter tail lines of business, as you commented, there was [indiscernible] a better result in severe losses. I also want to point you to the fact that we did announce earlier this year that we purchased a reinsurance program designed to limit some of that volatility in severe losses. And had you applied that treating that reinsurance program to 2015, you would have a lower level of severe losses even in 2015 using the reinsurance program that we put in place this year.

As it relates to casualty, we've had much better results. The casualty result is more than 3 points better in the third quarter of 2016 than it was in the third quarter of 2015.

I guess what I would say it's within the transaction that Sid talked about earlier in his comments, so there's a couple of transactions that will impact the Commercial business. They include the Ascot transaction, the NSM transaction and the Fairfax transaction that we described. And those transactions will reduce our net written premiums in the vicinity of $700 million in 2017. And then I'd say the other thing that will be sort of an environmental factor for us with premium growth is that when we announced our plan last year in the first quarter on January 26, we were not able to impact the very important to January 1 renewals in Europe in particular. And many of the renewals that we would've had in the first quarter here in the U.S., in North America, where we really do our heavy negotiation of that well in advance of the renewal date. So I'd say after we get past the first quarter, I -- that our premium absent the 3 transactions that I described, it'd be relatively flat, maybe modest growth. But in the first quarter, especially thinking about the January 1 renewals and the fact that we're continuing to make sure we're using our risk selection tools to the best of our ability, we will have some reduction in premium in the first quarter. I think -- in total, it's probably accurate to say something like, including the 3 transactions, about a $1 billion reduction in premium in 2017, is probably a fair benchmark."

I'm pleased with our progress this quarter and the continued execution of our strategic plan. We reported third quarter operating EPS of $1 a share, a solid result despite volatility from our review of our longevity assumptions and certain segments of our Commercial business.
I'm pleased that we maintained our strong position in our Life and Retirement segments and delivered another strong quarter in Personal Insurance. I remain highly focused on the continued improvement of our commercial underwriting and believe we're taking appropriate actions. Sid and Rob will speak to the specifics of our reserves and underwriting strategy in their remarks.
Since the second quarter, we announced or completed 5 strategic and complex transactions. These actions are increasing the sustainability of AIG's earnings and are reshaping the company. During our January strategy update, we discussed our focus on targeting geographies and segments with critical mass and expertise while improving our multinational capabilities. The Fairfax transaction is the most recent example of executing on this strategy. The transaction requires the extraordinary effort of our employees across 2 continents, 12 countries, and require the close and timely coordination with over 20 different regulators. The transaction is expected to consolidate our network partners and reinforce our commitment to servicing our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions, without the need for bricks and mortar in every location.
As we committed to you in January, we are narrowing our focus on those countries where we have opportunities to improve our ROE. We're also highly focused on disruption in the market and our future growth opportunities. During the third quarter, we announced the launch of our technology driven solution to serve the USD 80 billion small to middle market. AIG, Hamilton Insurance and Two Sigma joined together to form Attune. Attune will partner with retail and wholesale intermediaries and offer small businesses a broader, a more flexible range of products through a technology-enabled platform. Through the combination of Hamilton's small business expertise, AIG's scale, extensive data and long-standing distribution network and Two Sigma's technology and data science capabilities, Attune can offer a powerful, disruptive solution to the small business market.
In addition to our actions to simplify AIG, our expense discipline continued this quarter. Through the 9 months, we are ahead of our 6% planned reduction with a 10% decline in operating GOE, excluding any foreign exchange affect and the impact of the sale of the AIG Advisor Group. We expect expense reductions to extend into 2017 and remain ahead of plan as a result of actions taken across the company.
The normalized return on equity was 7.1% for the quarter and 8.3% for the 9 months. Third quarter normalized return on equity reflects our seasonally high expected third quarter CAT losses. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE, and we're on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. We will provide greater insights into our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day.
We continue to shape the company to deliver more sustainable, higher-quality earnings and remain focused on meeting our 2-year strategic objectives. Our results and the strength of our relationships with customers and partners in the industry are positive indications of our progress and the foundation we're building for the long-term success of AIG.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings improved from the same per",1162,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.
Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings improved from the same period last year, as the decline in the commercial accident year loss ratio is adjusted, expense discipline across AIG and improved alternative investment returns all meaningfully contributed to the improvement in performance. Looking ahead while we're only 1 month into the fourth quarter, our early estimate of losses from Hurricane Matthew is about $250 million, roughly 2/3 of which relates to Commercial and 1/3 relates to Consumer.
Operating results also reflected 2 adverse impacts of note. First, we took a loss recognition charge of $622 million related to longevity experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a legacy block of structured settlements underwritten pre-2010. This legacy block accounted for over 80% of the $622 million charge. As we told you on our January 26 strategy update, these assets and liabilities will be reported in the Legacy Portfolio when we release our fourth quarter recaps and results.
Shifting to our Operating Portfolio actuarial updates, we recorded net charges totaling $24 million. We recorded a benefit of $238 million for our operating consumer life and retirement businesses due largely to Fixed Annuity surrender assumptions, partially offset by increasing reserves for universal life and secondary guarantees. Offsetting this, we recorded $262 million of total prior-year adverse reserve development net of premium adjustments, which largely related to our U.S. program business within Specialty. Rob will comment further on this review and the underwriting actions we've taken on our U.S. program book.
During the quarter, we announced the sale of UGC to Arch Capital Group and have included an overview of the transaction on Slide 6. AIG will retain the attractive economics associated with our 50% quota share reinsurance agreement on business written by UGC and are reporting earnings in Commercial Insurance. This quota share covers business written during the 2014 to 2016 accident years, and we expect average annual pretax earnings from the quota share will be approximately $150 million for 2017 and '18 and will decline thereafter. The remaining operating results of UGC, which is held for sale on the balance sheet, are being reported in corporate and other up to the closing date. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter ideally or early in the first quarter.
We expect to receive $2.2 billion in cash proceeds at closing, an additional $250 million pre-closing dividend, as well as approximately 9% of Arch's common shares. In addition as part of the transaction, UGC's tax attribute deferred tax assets remain with AIG. Note, this quarter we also began reporting Institutional Markets results in corporate and other as the vast majority of this business will be reported in Legacy beginning in the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 shows recent strategic transactions and their estimated impact on our 2017 results. While there's some modest earnings impact from these transactions, each transaction is accretive to our overall ROE. Rob and Kevin will speak to the strategic rationale for the Commercial and Consumer transactions.
Consistent with our capital plan, we completed a life reinsurance transaction late in the third quarter that resulted in the distribution of approximately $1 billion of excess statutory capital from our U.S. life companies to AIG parent. This is our first completed life reinsurance transaction towards our goal of freeing up $4 billion to $5 billion of capital by the end of 2017. We remain focused and confident on executing on the additional life reinsurance transactions. The earnings impact from this transaction will be reported in next quarter's new Legacy module as it's largely related to Legacy whole life and universal life business.
Turning to Slide 8, as Peter stated, we're ahead of plan on expenses and continue to expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections of new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. We took additional pretax restructuring charges of $210 million during the quarter relating to our ongoing efficiency program, which we expect will generate an additional $400 million of run rate expense savings. We expect to exceed our 2-year expense reduction target.
Slide 9 details the 120 basis point expansion in normalized ROE for the quarter. This improvement reflected the active return of capital to shareholders as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results and reflects our seasonally high CAT loss expectation in the quarter, which is greater than reported 3Q CAT losses. Our year-to-date normalized ROE is 8.3% and we continue to expect to achieve our full year normalized ROE target of at least 8.4%.
Slide 10 shows the drivers of book value per share x AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, which grew 1% during the quarter and 5% year-to-date, reflecting operating earnings and accretive share repurchases.
Turning to capital on Slide 11. We continue to execute against our capital return target and we are confident we are on track to meet our target. We returned $9.8 million of capital to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.3 billion towards the repurchase of almost 40 million common shares. Since quarter end and through November 2, we repurchased an additional $946 million of common shares, leaving about $1.4 billion unused under the current authorization plus an additional $3 billion from the new authorization that we just announced.
Our balance sheet and free cash flow remains very strong, and as you can see on the Slide 12, parent liquidity at quarter end was $8.6 billion, above our targeted range of $6 billion to $8 billion and reflects the timing of insurance company dividends received late in the quarter.
In addition to the life reinsurance transactions, we also monetized $900 million of Legacy assets during the quarter for $5.2 billion over the last 4 quarters. These proceeds are partially funded capital return to shareholders. And when considering announced but not closed transactions, we expect to well exceed the $5 billion to $7 billion funding target from divestitures that we have lined in our January 26 strategic update.
We also announced that we reduced our hedge fund allocation by about half which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. We have reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which has freed up approximately $800 million of capital in our life companies, which has come up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments.
As Peter stated, we're focused on the continued execution of our strategic plan and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress at our upcoming Investor Day.
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

During the third quarter, we remain focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing both the adjusted accident year loss ratio and expense ratio and this quarter, we saw improvement in both. We will have quarterly variability in each component of the adjusted accident year combined ratio but we expect the net result will continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 14. The adjusted accident year loss ratio declined 1.9 points during the third quarter, reflecting continued improvement in U.S. Casualty. The UGC quota share agreement contributed to the improvement over prior year by 0.4 points in the third quarter or 0.3 points year-to-date.
Moving to expenses, the 1.9. expense ratio improvement exceeded the prior year quarter despite lower net premiums earned. We expect expenses to continue to decline, but similar to the loss ratio, the expense ratio will fluctuate around a downward trend lining. Globally, rates were down less than 1 point, with a marginal increase in the U.S. and more aggressive competition internationally. In the U.S., Casualty rates increased 3.5 points, representing the fourth consecutive quarter with rate increases in excess of 3 points and Specialty rates increased 2.5 points. Partially offsetting those increases was continued pressure in Property of approximately 4 points, driven primarily by excess and surplus lines. In certain segments, we're seeing fewer high-quality new business opportunities and therefore have maintained our discipline as we deploy our capital where we will meet or exceed our targeted rate of return. We're pleased that we continue to grow in our focused growth segments year-to-date despite competitive market conditions.
In prioritizing our valued multiline client relationships, retention from major clients has remained consistent with prior levels at 94%. As an example, multinational global policies grew 8%, reflecting our multiyear investment to provide world-class solutions for clients across the globe. As Peter mentioned, an important part of the Fairfax transaction is Fairfax will act as our strategic network partner to serve multinational clients in all 12 countries included in the deal. This follows a similar transaction completed with Grupo ASSA in Central America last year, and signifies an enhanced strategy to better serve our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions through what we consider to be the best combination of owned operations and strong strategic partners in the industry.
Turning to third quarter calendar year results. CAT losses were better than our average annual loss expectation but higher than prior year. And as Sid mentioned, the U.S. programs business resulted in a Commercial net reserves strengthening of $306 million. Our U.S. programs business consists of $1.1 billion of annual net premiums written spanning across 108 program segments and 41 program administrators. This business is written via managing general agents for predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises, and third-party administrators handle over half of the claims activity. Prior year development was driven by higher-than-expected loss emergence in the most recent calendar year from a subset of these programs.
We've now completed a detailed segmentation of the entire programs book as part of a broader, more holistic assessment of the business we transact with managing general agents. Through the review, we identified the programs we're seeking to grow, improve, remediate or terminate based on our profitability criteria, and we terminated 16 program segments with net premiums written totaling approximately $200 million as a result.
We estimate approximately 80% of the programs business reserve charge relates to programs where we've initiated termination or we're in the process of remediating. The purpose of evaluating our managing general agent relationships has been to determine where we wish to focus our resources, reposition relationships and better align incentives. The sale of our interest in Ascot and NSM, which we announced earlier this quarter, are examples of ROE-accretive repositioning where we will opportunistically partner with these franchises that bring highly specialized expertise and diversification benefits to create a greater long-term value for AIG.
Now turning to Slide 15. The year-to-date adjusted accident year loss ratio of 64.1 improved 2.1 points from the full year 2015, excluding the UGC quota share benefit. The remainder of my comments will exclude the benefit to provide an apples-to-apples comparison of our performance to the strategic targets we set in January. While the chart at the top right side of the page demonstrates the quarter-to-quarter variability of losses, I'm pleased with the overall improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio trend line. Our ability to manage expenses, combined with the loss ratio improvement, resulted in an adjusted accident year combined ratio improvement of 3.1 points.
This quarter, we experienced more pronounced volatility in our short-tail lines, which adversely impacted Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio by approximately 2 points. 1 point was attributable to increase in the current accident year loss picks following our review of the U.S. programs business, and the other point was related to higher property attritional losses. Although third quarter severe losses were significantly lower than prior year, Property's attritional loss ratio was the second highest result over the past 12 quarters due to the claims frequency that was greater than the norm. During the past several years, we've made several significant changes to structurally improve the quality of our Property portfolio, including our shift from excess and surplus lines to highly engineered risks and the expansion of our use reinsurance. However, as we've said in the past, we do not expect our path to be linear.
We believe accepting a reasonable degree of variability in quarterly results is the right business decision, and we have the ability to course-correct as business and market conditions change. Given our actions in the first 9 months of the year, we're continuing to target a run rate adjusted accident year loss ratio reduction of 4 points, recognizing as we saw this quarter with respect to short tail property losses, our results are subject of volatility. We remain committed to our target of a 6-point run rate reduction in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by the end of 2017.
As shown on Slide 16, we continue to make significant progress in optimizing our portfolio to reduce the adjusted accident year loss ratio. Overall, we're pleased with the pace of improvement in our mix of business written through the first 9 months of the year which will earn-in over future periods.
In closing, although we faced some headwinds this quarter, I'm proud of the progress our team has made, improving our portfolio, managing expenses and proactively seeking out value-enhancing opportunities. Reflecting our work -- reflected on our work over the past 10 months, I am confident in this team's ability to execute our strategy.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our Consumer Insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portf",1053,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our Consumer Insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Importantly, each of our businesses is executing on our strategic priority and are focused on value creation as I will discuss.
First, let me make a few introductory comments. In Retirement, I am proud to say that our strong diversification has made AIG the largest provider of annuities in the U.S. in the first half of the year. While we hold a top 5 sales ranking in each of variable index and Fixed Annuities, and we are the only company to hold a top 5 sales ranking in more than any one of these lines, our focus is on value over volume, and we continue to maintain vigorous pricing discipline facilitated by our lack of dependence on any one product.
In Personal Insurance, we continue to execute on our focused strategy. We are on track to meet our target state of 15 individual and 35 group countries by the end of 2017. And the most recent announcement with Fairfax Financial is a further key step to achieving our goal. The benefits from these actions are beginning to emerge and will continue to evolve over the coming years. Most importantly, we are preserving our ability to serve are multinational customers and covered employee individuals through our strategic network partners.
In U.S. Personal Insurance, our Private Client Group is implementing a market competitive end-to-end platform to build on the double-digit growth that we've been generating, which will further improve the customer and distributor experience and create operational efficiencies through automation and self-servicing.
In Japan, we remain focused on transforming the business, delivering improved results, executing on our customer value proposition, all while we are preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger. During the quarter, J.D. Power Auto Consumer Satisfaction Survey awarded Fuji Fire and Marine with the #1 ranking in shopping satisfaction and AIU with the #1 ranking in relationship satisfaction in the market. We also now average over 20,000 independent Japanese agents using our new technology front-end platform on a daily basis.
Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to retirement on Slide 18, in the quarter, we saw lower retirement sales from a year ago, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in variable annuity sales from the uncertainty caused by the DOL fiduciary rule and market volatility. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs. We have been proactive in updating our variable annuity product features and taking pricing actions to maintain our returns in the continuing low interest rate environment. With respect to the DOL rule, we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners and are confident that we will be prepared to support them on their broad spectrum of chosen paths for implementation.
Fixed Annuity sales and net flows declined reflecting our ongoing Fixed Annuity pricing discipline in the current investment rate and credit spread environment. Maintaining our Fixed Annuity pricing and asset quality focus remains a priority as we seek value over volume.
Group Retirement benefited from strong deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust. We do expect to see more plan conversions in the fourth quarter, which is standard for the defined contribution market, including both large plan acquisitions and large case group surrenders.
As you can see on Slide 19, we continued to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.
Turning to Slide 20. Growth in International Life sales drove an increase in premiums and deposits of 10% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Growth in U.S. life sales reflects our focus on term Life, where we are again a top 5 term writer and also #1 in direct term sales in the first 6 months of the year. Change in our product mix demonstrates our commitment to the value of new business as we have increased our focus on products without long duration interest rate guarantees. Our positive sales trends at Life also reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of our independent distribution network. Operating comparisons for Life benefited from continuing favorable mortality experience, expense management and improved investment returns. We also continued to make progress in the transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves.
As Sid mentioned, we completed our first Life reinsurance transaction during the quarter. This was an extremely large and complex transaction and I would like to thank Charlie Shamieh and the whole Legacy team for their discipline and focus throughout the transaction process. I am confident that supported by this team, we will continue to meet our targets for the remaining Life reinsurance transactions.
Turning to Slide 21, Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvements reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses, including direct marketing costs, as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. We did see a higher number of large but not severe losses in the quarter than a year ago. However, the accident year loss ratio as adjusted was only slightly above our expectation. Expenses continue to be a key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance. But as I have said, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan.
To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan.
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up to Q&A."

And so in the -- in 2016, this is one of the areas where we focused. And consistent with the actions you've already seen us take this year, the fact that we terminated 16 programs is very consistent with the actions we took with respect to our environmental pollution and legal liability business in the U.S. and Canada earlier this year and the buffer, trucking, where we believe that a business is not a business that will add value to AIG, we have proved that we're willing to just step away from it. I'll let Sid comment about the reserves."

I think that the way you're segmenting the business is not the way we run the business. And so we tried to make very clear in our January strategy update our forward-looking segmentation to help you sort of think about valuation an adequate profitability, as you put it, in 2 broad segments, Legacy and Operating. And within the Operating, that helps you estimate what our sustainable ROE will be and hence, what kind of multiple on earnings you think we might deserve. And in the Legacy, I think it's very clear that sizable chunk of equity is -- about 1/4 of the company's equity at the beginning of this year had a very suboptimal return, about 3% return on equity. And therefore, as you get to understand the legacy better, you figure out what kind of discount to the current book value you need to sort of anchor your valuation from. So I'm feeling really good right now about the returns on the aggregate of all of our operating businesses on a forward-looking basis. And I think the big question mark is how quickly and how big a discount to book value we can divest or reinsure the Legacy book. And I think getting into the subsegments, as you have, I don't think is a practical way -- when we're looking at divestitures, it's very focused on the Legacy and focused on the most efficient way to cleanse the earnings picture with those substandard returns so that we can focus our energy on a sustainable return on the operating business. So I think that's the way we look at it. And I don't know whether any detailed comments on the segments that either Rob or Kevin would like to make."

First of all, as it relates to the adjusted accident year loss ratio in Commercial, I'll just restate, I'm absolutely confident that we're making the important changes that we've got to make to deliver on our commitment to improve the loss ratio by 6 points. And I probably would point to 4 quick observations. First, we've absolutely demonstrated the willingness to reduce our premium writings as we retain the business that we think is important for us to remain focused on our valued client segment. We've been doing this very consistently throughout the year. You can see that our premium volume in the first 9 months of the year is down 16%, including of course the effect of reinsurance. The second point that I'd make is that as we show on Page 16 of the presentation, the accident year loss ratio dispersion chart showed that we're driving improvements in the mix of business in a very material way. And to put this in context for you, the remediate and improve portions of our portfolio have declined by 1/3 on a dollar basis, from $7.5 billion of premiums in the first 9 months of 2015 to $5.1 billion of premium in the first 9 months of 2016, showing that we're -- where we're reducing premium is in the remediate and improve portions of the portfolio. Actually as they grow and maintain portions of the portfolio, product set 1 and product set 2a, our premium volume is approximately flat. It's down just about 2%. I'm going to turn to Kevin for anything, sort of."

I think across the board in Personal Insurance, we've actually enjoyed quite strong margin expansion, including in North America. And in fact, our adjusted combined ratio has improved, from 95.9 last year, it's 92.4 this year. What you may be seeing, however, in the loss ratio is that in the third quarter, once we have quite a bit of consistency quarter-to-quarter, there is a little bit of volatility. We did have a number of losses that were large, over $2 million, but not quite at the severe level, in the third quarter. Whereas in the first 2 quarters, there were really an absence of those. So year-to-date, frankly, we are pretty much where we had expected to be in terms of the loss ratio. Consistent with what we've done in the rest of Personal Insurance in the North American portfolio, we have worked hard on remediating certain areas of the business, including particularly the warranty, which process is now complete. And we're seeing quite a strong growth in our Private Client Group business, which is one of our leading businesses. So we're quite comfortable with the direction we're going in PI, including the very strong North American franchise."

So you've got to actual market conditions, which will be whatever the rate changes are in the market. So it's a pretty -- as you might imagine, it would be pretty competitive in that space. And second, whenever we do an update to our reserves, we don't wait to make changes to our loss picks. And so to the extent that we have updated our reserve reviews, we've already reflected an increase in our loss picks product set 1 and 2 where those reserve reviews have been completed. I would note that in product set 2b and 3, where the loss ratio has come down from 79% down to 73% over the first 9 months of the year, the main observation I'd drive for you there is that's not because anybody gave me lower loss picks.

And so the offsetting aspects of earnings dilution through buybacks and redeployment of that capital into other lines of business is also, in our view, going to improve the quality of earnings to a less cyclical mix. There are many other ways we can obtain exposure to the U.S. housing market on the left-hand side of our balance sheet, which can more than make up for any kind of risk-adjusted earnings that we give up by the sale of UGC."

So we are simply improving the underlying underwriting performance of the longer tail lines of business. With respect to the shorter tail lines of business, as you commented, there was a better result in severe losses. I also want to point you to the fact that we did announce earlier this year that we purchased a reinsurance program designed to limit some of that volatility in severe losses. And had you applied that treating, that reinsurance program to 2015, you would have a lower level of severe losses even in 2015 using the reinsurance program that we've put in place this year. So I think that, for sure, there are improvements in the underwriting in the long-tail lines. And while there are some volatility in the short-tail lines, we have in fact made improvements in underwriting and have purchased reinsurance in a different way."

So there's a couple of transactions that will impact the Commercial business. They include the Ascot transaction, the NSM transaction and the Fairfax transaction that we described. And those transactions will reduce our net written premiums in the vicinity of $700 million in 2017. And then I'd say the other thing that would be sort of an environmental factor for us with premium growth is that when we announced our plan last year in the first quarter, on January 26, we were not able to impact the very important January 1 renewals, in Europe in particular, and many of the renewals that we would have had in the first quarter here in the U.S., in North America, where we really do our heavy negotiation of that well in advance of the renewal date. So I'd say after we get past the first quarter, I expect our premiums, absent the 3 transactions that I described, to be relatively flat, maybe modest growth. But in the first quarter, especially thinking about the January 1 renewals and the fact that we're continuing to make sure we're using our risk selection tools to the best of our ability, we will have some reduction in premium in the first quarter. I think it's fairly -- in total, it's probably accurate to say something like, including the 3 transactions, about a $1 billion reduction in premium in 2017 is probably about a fair benchmark for you."

I'm pleased with our progress this quarter and the continued execution of our strategic plan. We reported third quarter operating EPS of $1 a share, a solid result despite volatility from our review of our longevity assumptions and certain segments of our Commercial business.
I'm pleased that we maintained our strong position in our Life and Retirement segments and delivered another strong quarter in Personal Insurance. I remain highly focused on the continued improvement of our commercial underwriting and believe we're taking appropriate actions. Sid and Rob will speak to the specifics of our reserves and underwriting strategy in their remarks.
Since the second quarter, we announced or completed 5 strategic and complex transactions. These actions are increasing the sustainability of AIG's earnings and are reshaping the company. During our January strategy update, we discussed our focus on targeting geographies and segments with critical mass and expertise while improving our multinational capabilities. The Fairfax transaction is the most recent example of executing on this strategy. The transaction requires the extraordinary effort of our employees across 2 continents, 12 countries, and require the close and timely coordination with over 20 different regulators. The transaction is expected to consolidate our network partners and reinforce our commitment to servicing our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions, without the need for bricks and mortar in every location.
As we committed to you in January, we are narrowing our focus on those countries where we have opportunities to improve our ROE. We're also highly focused on disruption in the market and our future growth opportunities. During the third quarter, we announced the launch of our technology driven solution to serve the USD 80 billion small to middle market. AIG, Hamilton Insurance and Two Sigma joined together to form Attune. Attune will partner with retail and wholesale intermediaries and offer small businesses a broader, a more flexible range of products through a technology-enabled platform. Through the combination of Hamilton's small business expertise, AIG's scale, extensive data and long-standing distribution network and Two Sigma's technology and data science capabilities, Attune can offer a powerful, disruptive solution to the small business market.
In addition to our actions to simplify AIG, our expense discipline continued this quarter. Through the 9 months, we are ahead of our 6% planned reduction with a 10% decline in operating GOE, excluding any foreign exchange affect and the impact of the sale of the AIG Advisor Group. We expect expense reductions to extend into 2017 and remain ahead of plan as a result of actions taken across the company.
The normalized return on equity was 7.1% for the quarter and 8.3% for the 9 months. Third quarter normalized return on equity reflects our seasonally high expected third quarter CAT losses. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE, and we're on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. We will provide greater insights into our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day.
We continue to shape the company to deliver more sustainable, higher-quality earnings and remain focused on meeting our 2-year strategic objectives. Our results and the strength of our relationships with customers and partners in the industry are positive indications of our progress and the foundation we're building for the long-term success of AIG.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings improved from the same per",1162,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.
Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings improved from the same period last year, as the decline in the commercial accident year loss ratio is adjusted, expense discipline across AIG and improved alternative investment returns all meaningfully contributed to the improvement in performance. Looking ahead while we're only 1 month into the fourth quarter, our early estimate of losses from Hurricane Matthew is about $250 million, roughly 2/3 of which relates to Commercial and 1/3 relates to Consumer.
Operating results also reflected 2 adverse impacts of note. First, we took a loss recognition charge of $622 million related to longevity experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a legacy block of structured settlements underwritten pre-2010. This legacy block accounted for over 80% of the $622 million charge. As we told you on our January 26 strategy update, these assets and liabilities will be reported in the Legacy Portfolio when we release our fourth quarter recaps and results.
Shifting to our Operating Portfolio actuarial updates, we recorded net charges totaling $24 million. We recorded a benefit of $238 million for our operating consumer life and retirement businesses due largely to Fixed Annuity surrender assumptions, partially offset by increasing reserves for universal life and secondary guarantees. Offsetting this, we recorded $262 million of total prior-year adverse reserve development net of premium adjustments, which largely related to our U.S. program business within Specialty. Rob will comment further on this review and the underwriting actions we've taken on our U.S. program book.
During the quarter, we announced the sale of UGC to Arch Capital Group and have included an overview of the transaction on Slide 6. AIG will retain the attractive economics associated with our 50% quota share reinsurance agreement on business written by UGC and are reporting earnings in Commercial Insurance. This quota share covers business written during the 2014 to 2016 accident years, and we expect average annual pretax earnings from the quota share will be approximately $150 million for 2017 and '18 and will decline thereafter. The remaining operating results of UGC, which is held for sale on the balance sheet, are being reported in corporate and other up to the closing date. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter ideally or early in the first quarter.
We expect to receive $2.2 billion in cash proceeds at closing, an additional $250 million pre-closing dividend, as well as approximately 9% of Arch's common shares. In addition as part of the transaction, UGC's tax attribute deferred tax assets remain with AIG. Note, this quarter we also began reporting Institutional Markets results in corporate and other as the vast majority of this business will be reported in Legacy beginning in the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 shows recent strategic transactions and their estimated impact on our 2017 results. While there's some modest earnings impact from these transactions, each transaction is accretive to our overall ROE. Rob and Kevin will speak to the strategic rationale for the Commercial and Consumer transactions.
Consistent with our capital plan, we completed a life reinsurance transaction late in the third quarter that resulted in the distribution of approximately $1 billion of excess statutory capital from our U.S. life companies to AIG parent. This is our first completed life reinsurance transaction towards our goal of freeing up $4 billion to $5 billion of capital by the end of 2017. We remain focused and confident on executing on the additional life reinsurance transactions. The earnings impact from this transaction will be reported in next quarter's new Legacy module as it's largely related to Legacy whole life and universal life business.
Turning to Slide 8, as Peter stated, we're ahead of plan on expenses and continue to expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections of new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. We took additional pretax restructuring charges of $210 million during the quarter relating to our ongoing efficiency program, which we expect will generate an additional $400 million of run rate expense savings. We expect to exceed our 2-year expense reduction target.
Slide 9 details the 120 basis point expansion in normalized ROE for the quarter. This improvement reflected the active return of capital to shareholders as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results and reflects our seasonally high CAT loss expectation in the quarter, which is greater than reported 3Q CAT losses. Our year-to-date normalized ROE is 8.3% and we continue to expect to achieve our full year normalized ROE target of at least 8.4%.
Slide 10 shows the drivers of book value per share x AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, which grew 1% during the quarter and 5% year-to-date, reflecting operating earnings and accretive share repurchases.
Turning to capital on Slide 11. We continue to execute against our capital return target and we are confident we are on track to meet our target. We returned $9.8 million of capital to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.3 billion towards the repurchase of almost 40 million common shares. Since quarter end and through November 2, we repurchased an additional $946 million of common shares, leaving about $1.4 billion unused under the current authorization plus an additional $3 billion from the new authorization that we just announced.
Our balance sheet and free cash flow remains very strong, and as you can see on the Slide 12, parent liquidity at quarter end was $8.6 billion, above our targeted range of $6 billion to $8 billion and reflects the timing of insurance company dividends received late in the quarter.
In addition to the life reinsurance transactions, we also monetized $900 million of Legacy assets during the quarter for $5.2 billion over the last 4 quarters. These proceeds are partially funded capital return to shareholders. And when considering announced but not closed transactions, we expect to well exceed the $5 billion to $7 billion funding target from divestitures that we have lined in our January 26 strategic update.
We also announced that we reduced our hedge fund allocation by about half which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. We have reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which has freed up approximately $800 million of capital in our life companies, which has come up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments.
As Peter stated, we're focused on the continued execution of our strategic plan and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress at our upcoming Investor Day.
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

During the third quarter, we remain focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing",1138,"Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we remain focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing both the adjusted accident year loss ratio and expense ratio and this quarter, we saw improvement in both. We will have quarterly variability in each component of the adjusted accident year combined ratio but we expect the net result will continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 14. The adjusted accident year loss ratio declined 1.9 points during the third quarter, reflecting continued improvement in U.S. Casualty. The UGC quota share agreement contributed to the improvement over prior year by 0.4 points in the third quarter or 0.3 points year-to-date.
Moving to expenses, the 1.9. expense ratio improvement exceeded the prior year quarter despite lower net premiums earned. We expect expenses to continue to decline, but similar to the loss ratio, the expense ratio will fluctuate around a downward trend lining. Globally, rates were down less than 1 point, with a marginal increase in the U.S. and more aggressive competition internationally. In the U.S., Casualty rates increased 3.5 points, representing the fourth consecutive quarter with rate increases in excess of 3 points and Specialty rates increased 2.5 points. Partially offsetting those increases was continued pressure in Property of approximately 4 points, driven primarily by excess and surplus lines. In certain segments, we're seeing fewer high-quality new business opportunities and therefore have maintained our discipline as we deploy our capital where we will meet or exceed our targeted rate of return. We're pleased that we continue to grow in our focused growth segments year-to-date despite competitive market conditions.
In prioritizing our valued multiline client relationships, retention from major clients has remained consistent with prior levels at 94%. As an example, multinational global policies grew 8%, reflecting our multiyear investment to provide world-class solutions for clients across the globe. As Peter mentioned, an important part of the Fairfax transaction is Fairfax will act as our strategic network partner to serve multinational clients in all 12 countries included in the deal. This follows a similar transaction completed with Grupo ASSA in Central America last year, and signifies an enhanced strategy to better serve our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions through what we consider to be the best combination of owned operations and strong strategic partners in the industry.
Turning to third quarter calendar year results. CAT losses were better than our average annual loss expectation but higher than prior year. And as Sid mentioned, the U.S. programs business resulted in a Commercial net reserves strengthening of $306 million. Our U.S. programs business consists of $1.1 billion of annual net premiums written spanning across 108 program segments and 41 program administrators. This business is written via managing general agents for predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises, and third-party administrators handle over half of the claims activity. Prior year development was driven by higher-than-expected loss emergence in the most recent calendar year from a subset of these programs.
We've now completed a detailed segmentation of the entire programs book as part of a broader, more holistic assessment of the business we transact with managing general agents. Through the review, we identified the programs we're seeking to grow, improve, remediate or terminate based on our profitability criteria, and we terminated 16 program segments with net premiums written totaling approximately $200 million as a result.
We estimate approximately 80% of the programs business reserve charge relates to programs where we've initiated termination or we're in the process of remediating. The purpose of evaluating our managing general agent relationships has been to determine where we wish to focus our resources, reposition relationships and better align incentives. The sale of our interest in Ascot and NSM, which we announced earlier this quarter, are examples of ROE-accretive repositioning where we will opportunistically partner with these franchises that bring highly specialized expertise and diversification benefits to create a greater long-term value for AIG.
Now turning to Slide 15. The year-to-date adjusted accident year loss ratio of 64.1 improved 2.1 points from the full year 2015, excluding the UGC quota share benefit. The remainder of my comments will exclude the benefit to provide an apples-to-apples comparison of our performance to the strategic targets we set in January. While the chart at the top right side of the page demonstrates the quarter-to-quarter variability of losses, I'm pleased with the overall improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio trend line. Our ability to manage expenses, combined with the loss ratio improvement, resulted in an adjusted accident year combined ratio improvement of 3.1 points.
This quarter, we experienced more pronounced volatility in our short-tail lines, which adversely impacted Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio by approximately 2 points. 1 point was attributable to increase in the current accident year loss picks following our review of the U.S. programs business, and the other point was related to higher property attritional losses. Although third quarter severe losses were significantly lower than prior year, Property's attritional loss ratio was the second highest result over the past 12 quarters due to the claims frequency that was greater than the norm. During the past several years, we've made several significant changes to structurally improve the quality of our Property portfolio, including our shift from excess and surplus lines to highly engineered risks and the expansion of our use reinsurance. However, as we've said in the past, we do not expect our path to be linear.
We believe accepting a reasonable degree of variability in quarterly results is the right business decision, and we have the ability to course-correct as business and market conditions change. Given our actions in the first 9 months of the year, we're continuing to target a run rate adjusted accident year loss ratio reduction of 4 points, recognizing as we saw this quarter with respect to short tail property losses, our results are subject of volatility. We remain committed to our target of a 6-point run rate reduction in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by the end of 2017.
As shown on Slide 16, we continue to make significant progress in optimizing our portfolio to reduce the adjusted accident year loss ratio. Overall, we're pleased with the pace of improvement in our mix of business written through the first 9 months of the year which will earn-in over future periods.
In closing, although we faced some headwinds this quarter, I'm proud of the progress our team has made, improving our portfolio, managing expenses and proactively seeking out value-enhancing opportunities. Reflecting our work -- reflected on our work over the past 10 months, I am confident in this team's ability to execute our strategy.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our Consumer Insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portf",1053,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our Consumer Insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Importantly, each of our businesses is executing on our strategic priority and are focused on value creation as I will discuss.
First, let me make a few introductory comments. In Retirement, I am proud to say that our strong diversification has made AIG the largest provider of annuities in the U.S. in the first half of the year. While we hold a top 5 sales ranking in each of variable index and Fixed Annuities, and we are the only company to hold a top 5 sales ranking in more than any one of these lines, our focus is on value over volume, and we continue to maintain vigorous pricing discipline facilitated by our lack of dependence on any one product.
In Personal Insurance, we continue to execute on our focused strategy. We are on track to meet our target state of 15 individual and 35 group countries by the end of 2017. And the most recent announcement with Fairfax Financial is a further key step to achieving our goal. The benefits from these actions are beginning to emerge and will continue to evolve over the coming years. Most importantly, we are preserving our ability to serve are multinational customers and covered employee individuals through our strategic network partners.
In U.S. Personal Insurance, our Private Client Group is implementing a market competitive end-to-end platform to build on the double-digit growth that we've been generating, which will further improve the customer and distributor experience and create operational efficiencies through automation and self-servicing.
In Japan, we remain focused on transforming the business, delivering improved results, executing on our customer value proposition, all while we are preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger. During the quarter, J.D. Power Auto Consumer Satisfaction Survey awarded Fuji Fire and Marine with the #1 ranking in shopping satisfaction and AIU with the #1 ranking in relationship satisfaction in the market. We also now average over 20,000 independent Japanese agents using our new technology front-end platform on a daily basis.
Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to retirement on Slide 18, in the quarter, we saw lower retirement sales from a year ago, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in variable annuity sales from the uncertainty caused by the DOL fiduciary rule and market volatility. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs. We have been proactive in updating our variable annuity product features and taking pricing actions to maintain our returns in the continuing low interest rate environment. With respect to the DOL rule, we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners and are confident that we will be prepared to support them on their broad spectrum of chosen paths for implementation.
Fixed Annuity sales and net flows declined reflecting our ongoing Fixed Annuity pricing discipline in the current investment rate and credit spread environment. Maintaining our Fixed Annuity pricing and asset quality focus remains a priority as we seek value over volume.
Group Retirement benefited from strong deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust. We do expect to see more plan conversions in the fourth quarter, which is standard for the defined contribution market, including both large plan acquisitions and large case group surrenders.
As you can see on Slide 19, we continued to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.
Turning to Slide 20. Growth in International Life sales drove an increase in premiums and deposits of 10% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Growth in U.S. life sales reflects our focus on term Life, where we are again a top 5 term writer and also #1 in direct term sales in the first 6 months of the year. Change in our product mix demonstrates our commitment to the value of new business as we have increased our focus on products without long duration interest rate guarantees. Our positive sales trends at Life also reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of our independent distribution network. Operating comparisons for Life benefited from continuing favorable mortality experience, expense management and improved investment returns. We also continued to make progress in the transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves.
As Sid mentioned, we completed our first Life reinsurance transaction during the quarter. This was an extremely large and complex transaction and I would like to thank Charlie Shamieh and the whole Legacy team for their discipline and focus throughout the transaction process. I am confident that supported by this team, we will continue to meet our targets for the remaining Life reinsurance transactions.
Turning to Slide 21, Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvements reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses, including direct marketing costs, as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. We did see a higher number of large but not severe losses in the quarter than a year ago. However, the accident year loss ratio as adjusted was only slightly above our expectation. Expenses continue to be a key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance. But as I have said, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan.
To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan.
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up to Q&A."

But from an underwriting perspective, the way we'll drive our 6-point improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio is by digging deeper into all elements of the commercial portfolio focused on the value over volume exercise. And so in the -- in 2016, this is one of the areas where we focused. And consistent with the actions you've already seen us take this year, the fact that we terminated 16 programs is very consistent with the actions we took with respect to our environmental pollution and legal liability business in the U.S. and Canada earlier this year and the buffer, trucking, where we believe that a business is not a business that will add value to AIG, we have proved that we're willing to just step away from it. I'll let Sid comment about the reserves."

I think that the way you're segmenting the business is not the way we run the business. And so we tried to make very clear in our January strategy update our forward-looking segmentation to help you sort of think about valuation an adequate profitability, as you put it, in 2 broad segments, Legacy and Operating. And within the Operating, that helps you estimate what our sustainable ROE will be and hence, what kind of multiple on earnings you think we might deserve. And in the Legacy, I think it's very clear that sizable chunk of equity is -- about 1/4 of the company's equity at the beginning of this year had a very suboptimal return, about 3% return on equity. And therefore, as you get to understand the legacy better, you figure out what kind of discount to the current book value you need to sort of anchor your valuation from. So I'm feeling really good right now about the returns on the aggregate of all of our operating businesses on a forward-looking basis. And I think the big question mark is how quickly and how big a discount to book value we can divest or reinsure the Legacy book. And I think getting into the subsegments, as you have, I don't think is a practical way -- when we're looking at divestitures, it's very focused on the Legacy and focused on the most efficient way to cleanse the earnings picture with those substandard returns so that we can focus our energy on a sustainable return on the operating business. So I think that's the way we look at it. And I don't know whether any detailed comments on the segments that either Rob or Kevin would like to make."

I'll just make a couple of quick thoughts. First of all, as it relates to the adjusted accident year loss ratio in Commercial, I'll just restate, I'm absolutely confident that we're making the important changes that we've got to make to deliver on our commitment to improve the loss ratio by 6 points. And I probably would point to 4 quick observations. First, we've absolutely demonstrated the willingness to reduce our premium writings as we retain the business that we think is important for us to remain focused on our valued client segment. We've been doing this very consistently throughout the year. You can see that our premium volume in the first 9 months of the year is down 16%, including of course the effect of reinsurance. The second point that I'd make is that as we show on Page 16 of the presentation, the accident year loss ratio dispersion chart showed that we're driving improvements in the mix of business in a very material way. And to put this in context for you, the remediate and improve portions of our portfolio have declined by 1/3 on a dollar basis, from $7.5 billion of premiums in the first 9 months of 2015 to $5.1 billion of premium in the first 9 months of 2016, showing that we're -- where we're reducing premium is in the remediate and improve portions of the portfolio. Actually as they grow and maintain portions of the portfolio, product set 1 and product set 2a, our premium volume is approximately flat. It's down just about 2%. I'm going to turn to Kevin for anything, sort of."

I think across the board in Personal Insurance, we've actually enjoyed quite strong margin expansion, including in North America. And in fact, our adjusted combined ratio has improved, from 95.9 last year, it's 92.4 this year. What you may be seeing, however, in the loss ratio is that in the third quarter, once we have quite a bit of consistency quarter-to-quarter, there is a little bit of volatility. We did have a number of losses that were large, over $2 million, but not quite at the severe level, in the third quarter. Whereas in the first 2 quarters, there were really an absence of those. So year-to-date, frankly, we are pretty much where we had expected to be in terms of the loss ratio. Consistent with what we've done in the rest of Personal Insurance in the North American portfolio, we have worked hard on remediating certain areas of the business, including particularly the warranty, which process is now complete. And we're seeing quite a strong growth in our Private Client Group business, which is one of our leading businesses.

So you've got to actual market conditions, which will be whatever the rate changes are in the market. So it's a pretty -- as you might imagine, it would be pretty competitive in that space. And second, whenever we do an update to our reserves, we don't wait to make changes to our loss picks. And so to the extent that we have updated our reserve reviews, we've already reflected an increase in our loss picks product set 1 and 2 where those reserve reviews have been completed. I would note that in product set 2b and 3, where the loss ratio has come down from 79% down to 73% over the first 9 months of the year, the main observation I'd drive for you there is that's not because anybody gave me lower loss picks.

So we are simply improving the underlying underwriting performance of the longer tail lines of business. With respect to the shorter tail lines of business, as you commented, there was a better result in severe losses. I also want to point you to the fact that we did announce earlier this year that we purchased a reinsurance program designed to limit some of that volatility in severe losses. And had you applied that treating, that reinsurance program to 2015, you would have a lower level of severe losses even in 2015 using the reinsurance program that we've put in place this year.

So there's a couple of transactions that will impact the Commercial business. They include the Ascot transaction, the NSM transaction and the Fairfax transaction that we described. And those transactions will reduce our net written premiums in the vicinity of $700 million in 2017. And then I'd say the other thing that would be sort of an environmental factor for us with premium growth is that when we announced our plan last year in the first quarter, on January 26, we were not able to impact the very important January 1 renewals, in Europe in particular, and many of the renewals that we would have had in the first quarter here in the U.S., in North America, where we really do our heavy negotiation of that well in advance of the renewal date. So I'd say after we get past the first quarter, I expect our premiums, absent the 3 transactions that I described, to be relatively flat, maybe modest growth. But in the first quarter, especially thinking about the January 1 renewals and the fact that we're continuing to make sure we're using our risk selection tools to the best of our ability, we will have some reduction in premium in the first quarter. I think it's fairly -- in total, it's probably accurate to say something like, including the 3 transactions, about a $1 billion reduction in premium in 2017 is probably about a fair benchmark for you."

I'm pleased with our progress this quarter and the continued execution of our strategic plan. We reported third quarter operating EPS of $1 a share, a solid result despite volatility from our review of our longevity assumptions and certain segments of our Commercial business.
I'm pleased that we maintained our strong position in our Life and Retirement segments and delivered another strong quarter in Personal Insurance. I remain highly focused on the continued improvement of our commercial underwriting and believe we're taking appropriate actions. Sid and Rob will speak to the specifics of our reserves and underwriting strategy in their remarks.
Since the second quarter, we announced or completed 5 strategic and complex transactions. These actions are increasing the sustainability of AIG's earnings and are reshaping the company. During our January strategy update, we discussed our focus on targeting geographies and segments with critical mass and expertise while improving our multinational capabilities. The Fairfax transaction is the most recent example of executing on this strategy. The transaction requires the extraordinary effort of our employees across 2 continents, 12 countries, and require the close and timely coordination with over 20 different regulators. The transaction is expected to consolidate our network partners and reinforce our commitment to servicing our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions, without the need for bricks and mortar in every location.
As we committed to you in January, we are narrowing our focus on those countries where we have opportunities to improve our ROE. We're also highly focused on disruption in the market and our future growth opportunities. During the third quarter, we announced the launch of our technology driven solution to serve the USD 80 billion small to middle market. AIG, Hamilton Insurance and Two Sigma joined together to form Attune. Attune will partner with retail and wholesale intermediaries and offer small businesses a broader, a more flexible range of products through a technology-enabled platform. Through the combination of Hamilton's small business expertise, AIG's scale, extensive data and long-standing distribution network and Two Sigma's technology and data science capabilities, Attune can offer a powerful, disruptive solution to the small business market.
In addition to our actions to simplify AIG, our expense discipline continued this quarter. Through the 9 months, we are ahead of our 6% planned reduction with a 10% decline in operating GOE, excluding any foreign exchange affect and the impact of the sale of the AIG Advisor Group. We expect expense reductions to extend into 2017 and remain ahead of plan as a result of actions taken across the company.
The normalized return on equity was 7.1% for the quarter and 8.3% for the 9 months. Third quarter normalized return on equity reflects our seasonally high expected third quarter CAT losses. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE, and we're on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. We will provide greater insights into our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day.
We continue to shape the company to deliver more sustainable, higher-quality earnings and remain focused on meeting our 2-year strategic objectives. Our results and the strength of our relationships with customers and partners in the industry are positive indications of our progress and the foundation we're building for the long-term success of AIG.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.
Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings improved from the same period last year, as the decline in the commercial accident year loss ratio is adjusted, expense discipline across AIG and improved alternative investment returns all meaningfully contributed to the improvement in performance. Looking ahead while we're only 1 month into the fourth quarter, our early estimate of losses from Hurricane Matthew is about $250 million, roughly 2/3 of which relates to Commercial and 1/3 relates to Consumer.
Operating results also reflected 2 adverse impacts of note. First, we took a loss recognition charge of $622 million related to longevity experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a legacy block of structured settlements underwritten pre-2010. This legacy block accounted for over 80% of the $622 million charge. As we told you on our January 26 strategy update, these assets and liabilities will be reported in the Legacy Portfolio when we release our fourth quarter recaps and results.
Shifting to our Operating Portfolio actuarial updates, we recorded net charges totaling $24 million. We recorded a benefit of $238 million for our operating consumer life and retirement businesses due largely to Fixed Annuity surrender assumptions, partially offset by increasing reserves for universal life and secondary guarantees. Offsetting this, we recorded $262 million of total prior-year adverse reserve development net of premium adjustments, which largely related to our U.S. program business within Specialty. Rob will comment further on this review and the underwriting actions we've taken on our U.S. program book.
During the quarter, we announced the sale of UGC to Arch Capital Group and have included an overview of the transaction on Slide 6. AIG will retain the attractive economics associated with our 50% quota share reinsurance agreement on business written by UGC and are reporting earnings in Commercial Insurance. This quota share covers business written during the 2014 to 2016 accident years, and we expect average annual pretax earnings from the quota share will be approximately $150 million for 2017 and '18 and will decline thereafter. The remaining operating results of UGC, which is held for sale on the balance sheet, are being reported in corporate and other up to the closing date. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter ideally or early in the first quarter.
We expect to receive $2.2 billion in cash proceeds at closing, an additional $250 million pre-closing dividend, as well as approximately 9% of Arch's common shares. In addition as part of the transaction, UGC's tax attribute deferred tax assets remain with AIG. Note, this quarter we also began reporting Institutional Markets results in corporate and other as the vast majority of this business will be reported in Legacy beginning in the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 shows recent strategic transactions and their estimated impact on our 2017 results. While there's some modest earnings impact from these transactions, each transaction is accretive to our overall ROE. Rob and Kevin will speak to the strategic rationale for the Commercial and Consumer transactions.
Consistent with our capital plan, we completed a life reinsurance transaction late in the third quarter that resulted in the distribution of approximately $1 billion of excess statutory capital from our U.S. life companies to AIG parent. This is our first completed life reinsurance transaction towards our goal of freeing up $4 billion to $5 billion of capital by the end of 2017. We remain focused and confident on executing on the additional life reinsurance transactions. The earnings impact from this transaction will be reported in next quarter's new Legacy module as it's largely related to Legacy whole life and universal life business.
Turning to Slide 8, as Peter stated, we're ahead of plan on expenses and continue to expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections of new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. We took additional pretax restructuring charges of $210 million during the quarter relating to our ongoing efficiency program, which we expect will generate an additional $400 million of run rate expense savings. We expect to exceed our 2-year expense reduction target.
Slide 9 details the 120 basis point expansion in normalized ROE for the quarter. This improvement reflected the active return of capital to shareholders as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results and reflects our seasonally high CAT loss expectation in the quarter, which is greater than reported 3Q CAT losses. Our year-to-date normalized ROE is 8.3% and we continue to expect to achieve our full year normalized ROE target of at least 8.4%.
Slide 10 shows the drivers of book value per share x AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, which grew 1% during the quarter and 5% year-to-date, reflecting operating earnings and accretive share repurchases.
Turning to capital on Slide 11. We continue to execute against our capital return target and we are confident we are on track to meet our target. We returned $9.8 million of capital to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.3 billion towards the repurchase of almost 40 million common shares. Since quarter end and through November 2, we repurchased an additional $946 million of common shares, leaving about $1.4 billion unused under the current authorization plus an additional $3 billion from the new authorization that we just announced.
Our balance sheet and free cash flow remains very strong, and as you can see on the Slide 12, parent liquidity at quarter end was $8.6 billion, above our targeted range of $6 billion to $8 billion and reflects the timing of insurance company dividends received late in the quarter.
In addition to the life reinsurance transactions, we also monetized $900 million of Legacy assets during the quarter for $5.2 billion over the last 4 quarters. These proceeds are partially funded capital return to shareholders. And when considering announced but not closed transactions, we expect to well exceed the $5 billion to $7 billion funding target from divestitures that we have lined in our January 26 strategic update.
We also announced that we reduced our hedge fund allocation by about half which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. We have reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which has freed up approximately $800 million of capital in our life companies, which has come up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments.
As Peter stated, we're focused on the continued execution of our strategic plan and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress at our upcoming Investor Day.
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

During the third quarter, we remain focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing",1138,"Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we remain focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing both the adjusted accident year loss ratio and expense ratio and this quarter, we saw improvement in both. We will have quarterly variability in each component of the adjusted accident year combined ratio but we expect the net result will continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 14. The adjusted accident year loss ratio declined 1.9 points during the third quarter, reflecting continued improvement in U.S. Casualty. The UGC quota share agreement contributed to the improvement over prior year by 0.4 points in the third quarter or 0.3 points year-to-date.
Moving to expenses, the 1.9. expense ratio improvement exceeded the prior year quarter despite lower net premiums earned. We expect expenses to continue to decline, but similar to the loss ratio, the expense ratio will fluctuate around a downward trend lining. Globally, rates were down less than 1 point, with a marginal increase in the U.S. and more aggressive competition internationally. In the U.S., Casualty rates increased 3.5 points, representing the fourth consecutive quarter with rate increases in excess of 3 points and Specialty rates increased 2.5 points. Partially offsetting those increases was continued pressure in Property of approximately 4 points, driven primarily by excess and surplus lines. In certain segments, we're seeing fewer high-quality new business opportunities and therefore have maintained our discipline as we deploy our capital where we will meet or exceed our targeted rate of return. We're pleased that we continue to grow in our focused growth segments year-to-date despite competitive market conditions.
In prioritizing our valued multiline client relationships, retention from major clients has remained consistent with prior levels at 94%. As an example, multinational global policies grew 8%, reflecting our multiyear investment to provide world-class solutions for clients across the globe. As Peter mentioned, an important part of the Fairfax transaction is Fairfax will act as our strategic network partner to serve multinational clients in all 12 countries included in the deal. This follows a similar transaction completed with Grupo ASSA in Central America last year, and signifies an enhanced strategy to better serve our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions through what we consider to be the best combination of owned operations and strong strategic partners in the industry.
Turning to third quarter calendar year results. CAT losses were better than our average annual loss expectation but higher than prior year. And as Sid mentioned, the U.S. programs business resulted in a Commercial net reserves strengthening of $306 million. Our U.S. programs business consists of $1.1 billion of annual net premiums written spanning across 108 program segments and 41 program administrators. This business is written via managing general agents for predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises, and third-party administrators handle over half of the claims activity. Prior year development was driven by higher-than-expected loss emergence in the most recent calendar year from a subset of these programs.
We've now completed a detailed segmentation of the entire programs book as part of a broader, more holistic assessment of the business we transact with managing general agents. Through the review, we identified the programs we're seeking to grow, improve, remediate or terminate based on our profitability criteria, and we terminated 16 program segments with net premiums written totaling approximately $200 million as a result.
We estimate approximately 80% of the programs business reserve charge relates to programs where we've initiated termination or we're in the process of remediating. The purpose of evaluating our managing general agent relationships has been to determine where we wish to focus our resources, reposition relationships and better align incentives. The sale of our interest in Ascot and NSM, which we announced earlier this quarter, are examples of ROE-accretive repositioning where we will opportunistically partner with these franchises that bring highly specialized expertise and diversification benefits to create a greater long-term value for AIG.
Now turning to Slide 15. The year-to-date adjusted accident year loss ratio of 64.1 improved 2.1 points from the full year 2015, excluding the UGC quota share benefit. The remainder of my comments will exclude the benefit to provide an apples-to-apples comparison of our performance to the strategic targets we set in January. While the chart at the top right side of the page demonstrates the quarter-to-quarter variability of losses, I'm pleased with the overall improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio trend line. Our ability to manage expenses, combined with the loss ratio improvement, resulted in an adjusted accident year combined ratio improvement of 3.1 points.
This quarter, we experienced more pronounced volatility in our short-tail lines, which adversely impacted Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio by approximately 2 points. 1 point was attributable to increase in the current accident year loss picks following our review of the U.S. programs business, and the other point was related to higher property attritional losses. Although third quarter severe losses were significantly lower than prior year, Property's attritional loss ratio was the second highest result over the past 12 quarters due to the claims frequency that was greater than the norm. During the past several years, we've made several significant changes to structurally improve the quality of our Property portfolio, including our shift from excess and surplus lines to highly engineered risks and the expansion of our use reinsurance. However, as we've said in the past, we do not expect our path to be linear.
We believe accepting a reasonable degree of variability in quarterly results is the right business decision, and we have the ability to course-correct as business and market conditions change. Given our actions in the first 9 months of the year, we're continuing to target a run rate adjusted accident year loss ratio reduction of 4 points, recognizing as we saw this quarter with respect to short tail property losses, our results are subject of volatility. We remain committed to our target of a 6-point run rate reduction in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by the end of 2017.
As shown on Slide 16, we continue to make significant progress in optimizing our portfolio to reduce the adjusted accident year loss ratio. Overall, we're pleased with the pace of improvement in our mix of business written through the first 9 months of the year which will earn-in over future periods.
In closing, although we faced some headwinds this quarter, I'm proud of the progress our team has made, improving our portfolio, managing expenses and proactively seeking out value-enhancing opportunities. Reflecting our work -- reflected on our work over the past 10 months, I am confident in this team's ability to execute our strategy.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our Consumer Insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portf",1052,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our Consumer Insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Importantly, each of our businesses is executing on our strategic priorities and are focused on value creation as I will discuss.
First, let me make a few introductory comments. In Retirement, I am proud to say that our strong diversification has made AIG the largest provider of annuities in the U.S. in the first half of the year. While we hold a top 5 sales ranking in each of variable index and Fixed Annuities, and we are the only company to hold a top 5 sales ranking in more than any one of these lines, our focus is on value over volume, and we continue to maintain vigorous pricing discipline facilitated by our lack of dependence on any one product.
In Personal Insurance, we continue to execute on our focused strategy. We are on track to meet our target state of 15 individual and 35 group countries by the end of 2017. And the most recent announcement with Fairfax Financial is a further key step to achieving our goal. The benefits from these actions are beginning to emerge and will continue to evolve over the coming years. Most importantly, we are preserving our ability to serve are multinational customers and covered individuals through our strategic network partners.
In U.S. Personal Insurance, our Private Client Group is implementing a market competitive end-to-end platform to build on the double-digit growth that we've been generating, which will further improve the customer and distributor experience and create operational efficiencies through automation and self-servicing.
In Japan, we remain focused on transforming the business, delivering improved results, executing on our customer value proposition, all while we are preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger. During the quarter, J.D. Power Auto Consumer Satisfaction Survey awarded Fuji Fire and Marine with the #1 ranking in shopping satisfaction and AIU with the #1 ranking in relationship satisfaction in the market. We also now average over 20,000 independent Japanese agents using our new technology front-end platform on a daily basis.
Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to retirement on Slide 18, in the quarter, we saw lower retirement sales from a year ago, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in variable annuity sales from the uncertainty caused by the DOL fiduciary rule and market volatility. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs. We have been proactive in updating our variable annuity product features and taking pricing actions to maintain our returns in the continuing low interest rate environment. With respect to the DOL rule, we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners and are confident that we will be prepared to support them on their broad spectrum of chosen paths for implementation.
Fixed Annuity sales and net flows declined reflecting our ongoing Fixed Annuity pricing discipline in the current investment rate and credit spread environment. Maintaining our Fixed Annuity pricing and asset quality focus remains a priority as we seek value over volume.
Group Retirement benefited from strong deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust. We do expect to see more plan conversions in the fourth quarter, which is standard for the defined contribution market, including both large plan acquisitions and large case group surrenders.
As you can see on Slide 19, we continued to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.
Turning to Slide 20. Growth in International Life sales drove an increase in premiums and deposits of 10% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Growth in U.S. life sales reflects our focus on term Life, where we are again a top 5 term writer and also #1 in direct term sales in the first 6 months of the year. Change in our product mix demonstrates our commitment to the value of new business as we have increased our focus on products without long duration interest rate guarantees. Our positive sales trends at Life also reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of our independent distribution network. Operating comparisons for Life benefited from continuing favorable mortality experience, expense management and improved investment returns. We also continued to make progress in the transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves.
As Sid mentioned, we completed our first Life reinsurance transaction during the quarter. This was an extremely large and complex transaction and I would like to thank Charlie Shamieh and the whole Legacy team for their discipline and focus throughout the transaction process. I am confident that supported by this team, we will continue to meet our targets for the remaining Life reinsurance transactions.
Turning to Slide 21, Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvements reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses, including direct marketing costs, as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. We did see a higher number of large but not severe losses in the quarter than a year ago. However, the accident year loss ratio as adjusted was only slightly above our expectation. Expenses continue to be a key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance. But as I have said, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan.
To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan.
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up to Q&A."

And so in the -- in 2016, this is one of the areas where we focused. And consistent with the actions you've already seen us take this year, the fact that we terminated 16 programs is very consistent with the actions we took with respect to our environmental pollution and legal liability business in the U.S. and Canada earlier this year and the buffer, trucking, where we believe that a business is not a business that will add value to AIG, we have proved that we're willing to just step away from it. I'll let Sid comment about the reserves."

I think that the way you're segmenting the business is not the way we run the business. And so we tried to make very clear in our January strategy update our forward-looking segmentation to help you sort of think about valuation an adequate profitability, as you put it, in 2 broad segments, Legacy and Operating. And within the Operating, that helps you estimate what our sustainable ROE will be and hence, what kind of multiple on earnings you think we might deserve. And in the Legacy, I think it's very clear that sizable chunk of equity is -- about 1/4 of the company's equity at the beginning of this year had a very suboptimal return, about 3% return on equity. And therefore, as you get to understand the legacy better, you figure out what kind of discount to the current book value you need to sort of anchor your valuation from. So I'm feeling really good right now about the returns on the aggregate of all of our operating businesses on a forward-looking basis. And I think the big question mark is how quickly and how big a discount to book value we can divest or reinsure the Legacy book. And I think getting into the subsegments, as you have, I don't think is a practical way -- when we're looking at divestitures, it's very focused on the Legacy and focused on the most efficient way to cleanse the earnings picture with those substandard returns so that we can focus our energy on a sustainable return on the operating business. So I think that's the way we look at it. And I don't know whether any detailed comments on the segments that either Rob or Kevin would like to make."

I'll just make a couple of quick thoughts. First of all, as it relates to the adjusted accident year loss ratio in Commercial, I'll just restate, I'm absolutely confident that we're making the important changes that we've got to make to deliver on our commitment to improve the loss ratio by 6 points. And I probably would point to 4 quick observations. First, we've absolutely demonstrated the willingness to reduce our premium writings as we retain the business that we think is important for us to remain focused on our valued client segment. We've been doing this very consistently throughout the year. You can see that our premium volume in the first 9 months of the year is down 16%, including of course the effect of reinsurance. The second point that I'd make is that as we show on Page 16 of the presentation, the accident year loss ratio dispersion chart showed that we're driving improvements in the mix of business in a very material way. And to put this in context for you, the remediate and improve portions of our portfolio have declined by 1/3 on a dollar basis, from $7.5 billion of premiums in the first 9 months of 2015 to $5.1 billion of premium in the first 9 months of 2016, showing that we're -- where we're reducing premium is in the remediate and improve portions of the portfolio. Actually as they grow and maintain portions of the portfolio, product set 1 and product set 2a, our premium volume is approximately flat. It's down just about 2%. I'm going to turn to Kevin for anything, sort of."

I think across the board in Personal Insurance, we've actually enjoyed quite strong margin expansion, including in North America. And in fact, our adjusted combined ratio has improved, from 95.9 last year, it's 92.4 this year. What you may be seeing, however, in the loss ratio is that in the third quarter, once we have quite a bit of consistency quarter-to-quarter, there is a little bit of volatility. We did have a number of losses that were large, over $2 million, but not quite at the severe level, in the third quarter. Whereas in the first 2 quarters, there were really an absence of those. So year-to-date, frankly, we are pretty much where we had expected to be in terms of the loss ratio. Consistent with what we've done in the rest of Personal Insurance in the North American portfolio, we have worked hard on remediating certain areas of the business, including particularly the warranty, which process is now complete. And we're seeing quite a strong growth in our Private Client Group business, which is one of our leading businesses.

First of all, I think the main message on Page 16 is that we're driving our improvement by improving the mix of business. So if you look at product set 1 and 2, while I would love to retain my loss ratio as low as possible, overall, the loss ratio has increased by 3 points, overall for product set 1 and 2, from 54% in 2015 to 57% for the first 9 months of 2016. So you've got to actual market conditions, which will be whatever the rate changes are in the market. So it's a pretty -- as you might imagine, it would be pretty competitive in that space. And second, whenever we do an update to our reserves, we don't wait to make changes to our loss picks. And so to the extent that we have updated our reserve reviews, we've already reflected an increase in our loss picks for product set 1 and 2 where those reserve reviews have been completed. I would note that in product set 2b and 3, where the loss ratio has come down from 79% down to 73% over the first 9 months of the year, the main observation I'd drive for you there is that's not because anybody gave me lower loss picks. That's being driven by the fact that we've really fundamentally changed the mix of business and been able to cut out some very poor performing parts of the portfolio."

So we are simply improving the underwriting performance of the longer tail lines of business. With respect to the shorter tail lines of business, as you commented, there was a better result in severe losses. I also want to point you to the fact that we did announce earlier this year that we purchased a reinsurance program designed to limit some of that volatility in severe losses. And had you applied that treating, that reinsurance program to 2015, you would have a lower level of severe losses even in 2015 using the reinsurance program that we've put in place this year. So I think that, for sure, there are improvements in the underwriting in the long-tail lines.

And I'd say that in the first 2 quarters of this year, they were pretty grumpy and they would complain about the changes. In the third quarter, a number of notable clients came to me and said that the changes we've made have been a net improvement in the service quality. We have a hungrier, more focused set of leaders that are more empowered to respond to clients' needs, and they are equipped with better technology than they have before to be responsive. And so I'm very pleased with the -- as the overall -- obviously in a company that services 1 million claims a month, there will always be some that go awry, and they obviously get more attention than others. But in overall terms, I'm actually very pleased on this particular point, and that's a core part of our strategy going forward, where we can focus our energy on service levels on the clients that need us most and so that we can be -- we can be all things to all people in all countries, and that's a core part of our strategy."

So there's a couple of transactions that will impact the Commercial business. They include the Ascot transaction, the NSM transaction and the Fairfax transaction that we described. And those transactions will reduce our net written premiums in the vicinity of $700 million in 2017. And then I'd say the other thing that would be sort of an environmental factor for us with premium growth is that when we announced our plan last year in the first quarter, on January 26, we were not able to impact the very important January 1 renewals, in Europe in particular, and many of the renewals that we would have had in the first quarter here in the U.S., in North America, where we really do our heavy negotiation of that well in advance of the renewal date. So I'd say after we get past the first quarter, I expect our premiums, absent the 3 transactions that I described, to be relatively flat, maybe modest growth. But in the first quarter, especially thinking about the January 1 renewals and the fact that we're continuing to make sure we're using our risk selection tools to the best of our ability, we will have some reduction in premium in the first quarter. I think it's fairly -- in total, it's probably accurate to say something like, including the 3 transactions, about a $1 billion reduction in premium in 2017 is probably about a fair benchmark for you."

I'm pleased with our progress this quarter and the continued execution of our strategic plan. We reported third quarter operating EPS of $1 a share, a solid result despite volatility from our review of our longevity assumptions and certain segments of our Commercial business.
I'm pleased that we maintained our strong position in our Life and Retirement segments and delivered another strong quarter in Personal Insurance. I remain highly focused on the continued improvement of our commercial underwriting and believe we're taking appropriate actions. Sid and Rob will speak to the specifics of our reserves and underwriting strategy in their remarks.
Since the second quarter, we announced or completed 5 strategic and complex transactions. These actions are increasing the sustainability of AIG's earnings and are reshaping the company. During our January strategy update, we discussed our focus on targeting geographies and segments with critical mass and expertise while improving our multinational capabilities. The Fairfax transaction is the most recent example of executing on this strategy. The transaction requires the extraordinary effort of our employees across 2 continents, 12 countries, and require the close and timely coordination with over 20 different regulators. The transaction is expected to consolidate our network partners and reinforce our commitment to servicing our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions, without the need for bricks and mortar in every location.
As we committed to you in January, we are narrowing our focus on those countries where we have opportunities to improve our ROE. We're also highly focused on disruption in the market and our future growth opportunities. During the third quarter, we announced the launch of our technology driven solution to serve the USD 80 billion small to middle market. AIG, Hamilton Insurance and Two Sigma joined together to form Attune. Attune will partner with retail and wholesale intermediaries and offer small businesses a broader, a more flexible range of products through a technology-enabled platform. Through the combination of Hamilton's small business expertise, AIG's scale, extensive data and long-standing distribution network and Two Sigma's technology and data science capabilities, Attune can offer a powerful, disruptive solution to the small business market.
In addition to our actions to simplify AIG, our expense discipline continued this quarter. Through the 9 months, we are ahead of our 6% planned reduction with a 10% decline in operating GOE, excluding any foreign exchange affect and the impact of the sale of the AIG Advisor Group. We expect expense reductions to extend into 2017 and remain ahead of plan as a result of actions taken across the company.
The normalized return on equity was 7.1% for the quarter and 8.3% for the 9 months. Third quarter normalized return on equity reflects our seasonally high expected third quarter CAT losses. Our operating improvements and return of capital will continue to positively impact ROE, and we're on track to deliver full year normalized ROE in our targeted range of 8.4% to 8.9%. We will provide greater insights into our confidence in reaching our 2017 financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day.
We continue to shape the company to deliver more sustainable, higher-quality earnings and remain focused on meeting our 2-year strategic objectives. Our results and the strength of our relationships with customers and partners in the industry are positive indications of our progress and the foundation we're building for the long-term success of AIG.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sid."

This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings improved from the same per",1162,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll speak to our quarterly financial results including noteworthy items, strategic transactions and capital management.
Turning to Slide 4, our core operating earnings improved from the same period last year, as the decline in the commercial accident year loss ratio is adjusted, expense discipline across AIG and improved alternative investment returns all meaningfully contributed to the improvement in performance. Looking ahead while we're only 1 month into the fourth quarter, our early estimate of losses from Hurricane Matthew is about $250 million, roughly 2/3 of which relates to Commercial and 1/3 relates to Consumer.
Operating results also reflected 2 adverse impacts of note. First, we took a loss recognition charge of $622 million related to longevity experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a legacy block of structured settlements underwritten pre-2010. This legacy block accounted for over 80% of the $622 million charge. As we told you on our January 26 strategy update, these assets and liabilities will be reported in the Legacy Portfolio when we release our fourth quarter recaps and results.
Shifting to our Operating Portfolio actuarial updates, we recorded net charges totaling $24 million. We recorded a benefit of $238 million for our operating consumer life and retirement businesses due largely to Fixed Annuity surrender assumptions, partially offset by increasing reserves for universal life and secondary guarantees. Offsetting this, we recorded $262 million of total prior-year adverse reserve development net of premium adjustments, which largely related to our U.S. program business within Specialty. Rob will comment further on this review and the underwriting actions we've taken on our U.S. program book.
During the quarter, we announced the sale of UGC to Arch Capital Group and have included an overview of the transaction on Slide 6. AIG will retain the attractive economics associated with our 50% quota share reinsurance agreement on business written by UGC and are reporting earnings in Commercial Insurance. This quota share covers business written during the 2014 to 2016 accident years, and we expect average annual pretax earnings from the quota share will be approximately $150 million for 2017 and '18 and will decline thereafter. The remaining operating results of UGC, which is held for sale on the balance sheet, are being reported in corporate and other up to the closing date. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter ideally or early in the first quarter.
We expect to receive $2.2 billion in cash proceeds at closing, an additional $250 million pre-closing dividend as well as approximately 9% of Arch's common shares. In addition as part of the transaction, UGC's tax attribute deferred tax assets remain with AIG. Note, this quarter we also began reporting Institutional Markets results in corporate and other as the vast majority of this business will be reported in Legacy beginning in the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 shows recent strategic transactions and their estimated impact on our 2017 results. While there's some modest earnings impact from these transactions, each transaction is accretive to our overall ROE. Rob and Kevin will speak to the strategic rationale for the Commercial and Consumer transactions.
Consistent with our capital plan, we completed a life reinsurance transaction late in the third quarter that resulted in the distribution of approximately $1 billion of excess statutory capital from our U.S. life companies to AIG parent. This is our first completed life reinsurance transaction towards our goal of freeing up $4 billion to $5 billion of capital by the end of 2017. We remain focused and confident on executing on the additional life reinsurance transactions. The earnings impact from this transaction will be reported in next quarter's new Legacy module as it's largely related to Legacy whole life and universal life business.
Turning to Slide 8, as Peter stated, we're ahead of plan on expenses and continue to expect to exceed the 6% targeted GOE decline for the full year. Our expense reduction targets are carefully aligned against our projections of new business volumes to meet our objective of improving operating leverage. We took additional pretax restructuring charges of $210 million during the quarter relating to our ongoing efficiency program, which we expect will generate an additional $400 million of run rate expense savings. We expect to exceed our 2-year expense reduction target.
Slide 9 details the 120 basis point expansion in normalized ROE for the quarter. This improvement reflected the active return of capital to shareholders as well as continued improvement in normalized operating results and reflects our seasonally high CAT loss expectation in the quarter, which is greater than reported 3Q CAT losses. Our year-to-date normalized ROE is 8.3% and we continue to expect to achieve our full year normalized ROE target of at least 8.4%.
Slide 10 shows the drivers of book value per share x AOCI and DTA and including dividend growth, which grew 1% during the quarter and 5% year-to-date, reflecting operating earnings and accretive share repurchases.
Turning to capital on Slide 11. We continue to execute against our capital return target and we are confident we are on track to meet our target. We returned $9.8 million of capital to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year. During the quarter, we deployed about $2.3 billion towards the repurchase of almost 40 million common shares. Since quarter end and through November 2, we repurchased an additional $946 million of common shares, leaving about $1.4 billion unused under the current authorization plus an additional $3 billion from the new authorization that we just announced.
Our balance sheet and free cash flow remains very strong, and as you can see on the Slide 12, parent liquidity at quarter end was $8.6 billion, above our targeted range of $6 billion to $8 billion and reflects the timing of insurance company dividends received late in the quarter.
In addition to the life reinsurance transactions, we also monetized $900 million of Legacy assets during the quarter for $5.2 billion over the last 4 quarters. These proceeds are partially funded capital return to shareholders. And when considering announced but not closed transactions, we expect to well exceed the $5 billion to $7 billion funding target from divestitures that we have lined in our January 26 strategic update.
We also announced that we reduced our hedge fund allocation by about half which we expect would free up $2 billion of capital towards our capital return target by the end of 2017. We have reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which has freed up approximately $800 million of capital in our life companies, which has come up to the holding company in the form of dividend payments.
As Peter stated, we're focused on the continued execution of our strategic plan and providing you with additional disclosure as we progress at our upcoming Investor Day.
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob."

During the third quarter, we remain focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing",1138,"Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we remain focused on our strategy to improve underwriting results and create a stronger, more valuable Commercial Insurance business. Our strategy recognizes the importance of managing both the adjusted accident year loss ratio and expense ratio and this quarter, we saw improvement in both. We will have quarterly variability in each component of the adjusted accident year combined ratio but we expect the net result will continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 14. The adjusted accident year loss ratio declined 1.9 points during the third quarter, reflecting continued improvement in U.S. Casualty. The UGC quota share agreement contributed to the improvement over prior year by 0.4 points in the third quarter or 0.3 points year-to-date.
Moving to expenses, the 1.9. Expense ratio improvement exceeded the prior year quarter despite lower net premiums earned. We expect expenses to continue to decline, but similar to the loss ratio, the expense ratio will fluctuate around a downward trend lining. Globally, rates were down less than 1 point, with a marginal increase in the U.S. and more aggressive competition internationally. In the U.S., Casualty rates increased 3.5 points, representing the fourth consecutive quarter with rate increases in excess of 3 points and Specialty rates increased 2.5 points. Partially offsetting those increases was continued pressure in Property of approximately 4 points, driven primarily by excess and surplus lines. In certain segments, we're seeing fewer high-quality new business opportunities and therefore have maintained our discipline as we deploy our capital where we will meet or exceed our targeted rate of return. We're pleased that we continue to grow in our focused growth segments year-to-date despite competitive market conditions.
In prioritizing our valued multiline client relationships, retention from major clients has remained consistent with prior levels at 94%. As an example, multinational global policies grew 8%, reflecting our multiyear investment to provide world-class solutions for clients across the globe. As Peter mentioned, an important part of the Fairfax transaction is Fairfax will act as our strategic network partner to serve multinational clients in all 12 countries included in the deal. This follows a similar transaction completed with Grupo ASSA in Central America last year, and signifies an enhanced strategy to better serve our multinational clients in over 200 countries and jurisdictions through what we consider to be the best combination of owned operations and strong strategic partners in the industry.
Turning to third quarter calendar year results. CAT losses were better than our average annual loss expectation but higher than prior year. And as Sid mentioned, the U.S. programs business resulted in a Commercial net reserves strengthening of $306 million. Our U.S. programs business consists of $1.1 billion of annual net premiums written spanning across 108 program segments and 41 program administrators. This business is written via managing general agents for predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises, and third-party administrators handle over half of the claims activity. Prior year development was driven by higher-than-expected loss emergence in the most recent calendar year from a subset of these programs.
We've now completed a detailed segmentation of the entire programs book as part of a broader, more holistic assessment of the business we transact with managing general agents. Through the review, we identified the programs we're seeking to grow, improve, remediate or terminate based on our profitability criteria, and we terminated 16 program segments with net premiums written totaling approximately $200 million as a result.
We estimate approximately 80% of the programs business reserve charge relates to programs where we've initiated termination or we're in the process of remediating. The purpose of evaluating our managing general agent relationships has been to determine where we wish to focus our resources, reposition relationships and better align incentives. The sale of our interest in Ascot and NSM, which we announced earlier this quarter, are examples of ROE-accretive repositioning where we will opportunistically partner with these franchises that bring highly specialized expertise and diversification benefits to create a greater long-term value for AIG.
Now turning to Slide 15. The year-to-date adjusted accident year loss ratio of 64.1 improved 2.1 points from the full year 2015, excluding the UGC quota share benefit. The remainder of my comments will exclude the benefit to provide an apples-to-apples comparison of our performance to the strategic targets we set in January. While the chart at the top right side of the page demonstrates the quarter-to-quarter variability of losses, I'm pleased with the overall improvement in the adjusted accident year loss ratio trend line. Our ability to manage expenses, combined with the loss ratio improvement, resulted in an adjusted accident year combined ratio improvement of 3.1 points.
This quarter, we experienced more pronounced volatility in our short-tail lines, which adversely impacted Commercial's adjusted accident year loss ratio by approximately 2 points. 1 point was attributable to increase in the current accident year loss picks following our review of the U.S. programs business, and the other point was related to higher property attritional losses. Although third quarter severe losses were significantly lower than prior year, Property's attritional loss ratio was the second highest result over the past 12 quarters due to the claims frequency that was greater than the norm. During the past several years, we've made several significant changes to structurally improve the quality of our Property portfolio, including our shift from excess and surplus lines to highly engineered risks and the expansion of our use reinsurance. However, as we've said in the past, we do not expect our path to be linear.
We believe accepting a reasonable degree of variability in quarterly results is the right business decision, and we have the ability to course-correct as business and market conditions change. Given our actions in the first 9 months of the year, we're continuing to target a run rate adjusted accident year loss ratio reduction of 4 points, recognizing as we saw this quarter with respect to short tail property losses, our results are subject of volatility. We remain committed to our target of a 6-point run rate reduction in the adjusted accident year loss ratio by the end of 2017.
As shown on Slide 16, we continue to make significant progress in optimizing our portfolio to reduce the adjusted accident year loss ratio. Overall, we're pleased with the pace of improvement in our mix of business written through the first 9 months of the year which will earn-in over future periods.
In closing, although we faced some headwinds this quarter, I'm proud of the progress our team has made, improving our portfolio, managing expenses and proactively seeking out value-enhancing opportunities. Reflecting our work -- reflected on our work over the past 10 months, I am confident in this team's ability to execute our strategy.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin."

Despite a challenging economic and regulatory environment, I'm pleased to report that each of our Consumer Insurance businesses performed well during the quarter, reflecting the benefits of our diversified portfolio of Retirement, Life and Personal Insurance businesses. Importantly, each of our businesses is executing on our strategic priorities and are focused on value creation as I will discuss.
First, let me make a few introductory comments. In Retirement, I am proud to say that our strong diversification has made AIG the largest provider of annuities in the U.S. in the first half of the year. While we hold a top 5 sales ranking in each of variable index and Fixed Annuities, and we are the only company to hold a top 5 sales ranking in more than any one of these lines, our focus is on value over volume, and we continue to maintain vigorous pricing discipline facilitated by our lack of dependence on any one product.
In Personal Insurance, we continue to execute on our focused strategy. We are on track to meet our target state of 15 individual and 35 group countries by the end of 2017. And the most recent announcement with Fairfax Financial is a further key step to achieving our goal. The benefits from these actions are beginning to emerge and will continue to evolve over the coming years. Most importantly, we are preserving our ability to serve are multinational customers and covered individuals through our strategic network partners.
In U.S. Personal Insurance, our Private Client Group is implementing a market competitive end-to-end platform to build on the double-digit growth that we've been generating, which will further improve the customer and distributor experience and create operational efficiencies through automation and self-servicing.
In Japan, we remain focused on transforming the business, delivering improved results, executing on our customer value proposition, all while we are preparing for the successful execution of the legal merger. During the quarter, J.D. Power Auto Consumer Satisfaction Survey awarded Fuji Fire and Marine with the #1 ranking in shopping satisfaction and AIU with the #1 ranking in relationship satisfaction in the market. We also now average over 20,000 independent Japanese agents using our new technology front-end platform on a daily basis.
Now I will briefly discuss the results for the quarter. Turning to retirement on Slide 18, in the quarter, we saw lower retirement sales from a year ago, reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in variable annuity sales from the uncertainty caused by the DOL fiduciary rule and market volatility. These challenges validate our strategy of offering a broad portfolio of product solutions to meet our clients' needs. We have been proactive in updating our variable annuity product features and taking pricing actions to maintain our returns in the continuing low interest rate environment. With respect to the DOL rule, we remain in active discussions with our distribution partners and are confident that we will be prepared to support them on their broad spectrum of chosen paths for implementation.
Fixed Annuity sales and net flows declined reflecting our ongoing Fixed Annuity pricing discipline in the current investment rate and credit spread environment. Maintaining our Fixed Annuity pricing and asset quality focus remains a priority as we seek value over volume.
Group Retirement benefited from strong deposits and lower surrenders, resulting in improved net flows. While these results reflect the investments we've made in the business, including our client-focused technology platform, competition in this space remains robust. We do expect to see more plan conversions in the fourth quarter, which is standard for the defined contribution market, including both large plan acquisitions and large case group surrenders.
As you can see on Slide 19, we continued to maintain our discipline in managing crediting rates and net spreads. Trends in the quarterly reported base yields and spreads are impacted by volatility associated with bond accretion and commercial loan prepayment income. Looking forward, absent significant changes in the overall rate environment, we continue to expect our net spreads will decline by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter.
Turning to Slide 20. Growth in International Life sales drove an increase in premiums and deposits of 10% from the same period last year on a constant dollar basis. Growth in U.S. life sales reflects our focus on term Life, where we are again a top 5 term writer and also #1 in direct term sales in the first 6 months of the year. Change in our product mix demonstrates our commitment to the value of new business as we have increased our focus on products without long duration interest rate guarantees. Our positive sales trends at Life also reflect the evolution of our distribution strategy and further development of our independent distribution network. Operating comparisons for Life benefited from continuing favorable mortality experience, expense management and improved investment returns. We also continued to make progress in the transactions supporting our previously announced plans to reinsure our remaining redundant reserves.
As Sid mentioned, we completed our first Life reinsurance transaction during the quarter. This was an extremely large and complex transaction and I would like to thank Charlie Shamieh and the whole Legacy team for their discipline and focus throughout the transaction process. I am confident that supported by this team, we will continue to meet our targets for the remaining Life reinsurance transactions.
Turning to Slide 21, Personal Insurance reported another strong quarter of operating performance. The operating improvements reflected our strategic actions to reduce expenses, including direct marketing costs as well as early emergence of operating benefits from investments in Japan and other select markets. We did see a higher number of large but not severe losses in the quarter than a year ago. However, the accident year loss ratio as adjusted was only slightly above our expectation. Expenses continue to be a key lever to future margin expansion in Personal Insurance. But as I have said, progress will not be linear quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of our ongoing investments, including in Japan.
To close, I'm pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic priorities across all of our Consumer businesses, and we remain focused on continuing to execute on our plan.
Now I would like to turn it back to Liz to open up to Q&A."

I think that the way you're segmenting the business is not the way we run the business. And so we tried to make very clear in our January strategy update our forward-looking segmentation to help you sort of think about valuation an adequate profitability, as you put it, in 2 broad segments, Legacy and Operating. And within the Operating, that helps you estimate what our sustainable ROE will be and hence, what kind of multiple on earnings you think we might deserve. And in the Legacy, I think it's very clear that sizable chunk of equity is -- about 1/4 of the company's equity at the beginning of this year had a very suboptimal return, about 3% return on equity. And therefore, as you get to understand the legacy better, you figure out what kind of discount to the current book value you need to sort of anchor your valuation from. So I'm feeling really good right now about the returns on the aggregate of all of our operating businesses on a forward-looking basis. And I think the big question mark is how quickly and how big a discount to book value we can divest or reinsure the Legacy book. And I think getting into the subsegments, as you have, I don't think is a practical way -- when we're looking at divestitures, it's very focused on the Legacy and focused on the most efficient way to cleanse the earnings picture with those substandard returns so that we can focus our energy on a sustainable return on the operating business. So I think that's the way we look at it. And I don't know whether any detailed comments on the segments that either Rob or Kevin would like to make."

I'll just make a couple of quick thoughts. First of all, as it relates to the adjusted accident year loss ratio in Commercial, I'll just restate, I'm absolutely confident that we're making the important changes that we've got to make to deliver on our commitment to improve the loss ratio by 6 points. And I probably would point to 4 quick observations. First, we've absolutely demonstrated the willingness to reduce our premium writings as we retain the business that we think is important for us to remain focused on our valued client segment. We've been doing this very consistently throughout the year. You can see that our premium volume in the first 9 months of the year is down 16%, including of course the effect of reinsurance. The second point that I'd make is that as we show on Page 16 of the presentation, the accident year loss ratio dispersion chart showed that we're driving improvements in the mix of business in a very material way. And to put this in context for you, the remediate and improve portions of our portfolio have declined by 1/3 on a dollar basis, from $7.5 billion of premiums in the first 9 months of 2015 to $5.1 billion of premium in the first 9 months of 2016, showing that we're -- where we're reducing premium is in the remediate and improve portions of the portfolio. Actually as they grow and maintain portions of the portfolio, product set 1 and product set 2a, our premium volume is approximately flat. It's down just about 2%. I'm going to turn to Kevin for anything, sort of."

I think across the board in Personal Insurance, we've actually enjoyed quite strong margin expansion, including in North America. And in fact, our adjusted combined ratio has improved, from 95.9 last year, it's 92.4 this year. What you may be seeing, however, in the loss ratio is that in the third quarter, once we have quite a bit of consistency quarter-to-quarter, there is a little bit of volatility. We did have a number of losses that were large, over $2 million, but not quite at the severe level, in the third quarter. Whereas in the first 2 quarters, there were really an absence of those. So year-to-date, frankly, we are pretty much where we had expected to be in terms of the loss ratio. Consistent with what we've done in the rest of Personal Insurance in the North American portfolio, we have worked hard on remediating certain areas of the business, including particularly the warranty, which process is now complete. And we're seeing quite a strong growth in our Private Client Group business, which is one of our leading businesses.

So you've got to actual market conditions, which will be whatever the rate changes are in the market. So it's a pretty -- as you might imagine, it would be pretty competitive in that space. And second, whenever we do an update to our reserves, we don't wait to make changes to our loss picks. And so to the extent that we have updated our reserve reviews, we've already reflected an increase in our loss picks for product set 1 and 2 where those reserve reviews have been completed. I would note that in product set 2b and 3, where the loss ratio has come down from 79% down to 73% over the first 9 months of the year, the main observation I'd drive for you there is that's not because anybody gave me lower loss picks.

So we are simply improving the underwriting performance of the longer tail lines of business. With respect to the shorter tail lines of business, as you commented, there was a better result in severe losses. I also want to point you to the fact that we did announce earlier this year that we purchased a reinsurance program designed to limit some of that volatility in severe losses. And had you applied that treating, that reinsurance program to 2015, you would have a lower level of severe losses even in 2015 using the reinsurance program that we've put in place this year. So I think that, for sure, there are improvements in the underwriting in the long-tail lines.

As it relates to Casualty, we've had much better results. The Casualty result is more than 3 points better in the third quarter of 2016 than it was in the third quarter of 2015.

So there's a couple of transactions that will impact the Commercial business. They include the Ascot transaction, the NSM transaction and the Fairfax transaction that we described. And those transactions will reduce our net written premiums in the vicinity of $700 million in 2017. And then I'd say the other thing that would be sort of an environmental factor for us with premium growth is that when we announced our plan last year in the first quarter, on January 26, we were not able to impact the very important January 1 renewals, in Europe in particular, and many of the renewals that we would have had in the first quarter here in the U.S., in North America, where we really do our heavy negotiation of that well in advance of the renewal date. So I'd say after we get past the first quarter, I expect our premiums, absent the 3 transactions that I described, to be relatively flat, maybe modest growth. But in the first quarter, especially thinking about the January 1 renewals and the fact that we're continuing to make sure we're using our risk selection tools to the best of our ability, we will have some reduction in premium in the first quarter. I think it's fairly -- in total, it's probably accurate to say something like, including the 3 transactions, about a $1 billion reduction in premium in 2017 is probably about a fair benchmark for you."
