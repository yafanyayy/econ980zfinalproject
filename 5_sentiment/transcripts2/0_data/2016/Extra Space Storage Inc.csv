For the fourth quarter, same-store revenue growth was 9.3%. NOI growth was 11.9%. Year-end occupancy was 92.9%, and FFO as adjusted grew 28%. This marks 21 consecutive quarters of double-digit increases. 
We delivered these exceptional same-store operating results while expanding our physical real estate and digital real estate footprints by 24%. In 2015, we added 259 stores to our platform, and our year-end EXR-branded store count was 1,347. 
For the year, we closed on $1.8 billion in acquisitions. Seller expectations are high, and we expect pricing to remain competitive in 2016. However, we are finding accretive acquisitions, including off-market transactions, and we are off to a solid start in 2016.

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.87 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including cost associated with acquisitions and noncash interest, FFO was $0.38 per share for the quarter. This was below our Q4 guidance due to additional transaction-related costs. 
We paid $16 million in SmartStop transactional costs, $8 million for SmartStop's investment bankers and $8 million in severance expenses. These costs were expensed on our books rather than on SmartStop. In essence, we paid SmartStop's transactional cost with SmartStop's working capital. These costs were included in our original purchase price estimates and had no effect on the transaction on a net-net basis. 
For the year, FFO as adjusted was $3.13 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including acquisition and noncash interest costs, FFO was $2.58 per share. 
Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers, increased occupancy and lower discounts. Our top-performing markets were California, Colorado and Florida. Our worst-performing markets still grew at 4% to 5%, and our platform continues to maximize results. 
We had a busy quarter on the acquisition front, adding 131 stores for $1.4 billion. The majority of these stores were part of the SmartStop acquisition, which are performing in line with our underwriting expectations. 
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2016. Our new same-store pool will increase by 61 properties for a total of 564. We expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by approximately 50 basis points. 
For 2016, our acquisition guidance of $600 million refers only to our same-store -- or only to our wholly-owned same stores -- our wholly-owned stores. The impact of our JV acquisition is captured in our equity and earnings. 
Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.65 to $3.73 per share. 2016 FFO guidance is $3.57 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate-of-occupancy acquisitions. Our guidance also includes 2015 acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they are performing at a portfolio average, they should produce an additional $0.10 per share. 
I'll now turn the time back to Spencer for some closing remarks."

You have some Internet specials, things like that. So you also need to look at what our achieved rate is versus street rates, but overall they continue to grow.

There's a lot of inquiry to try and put it into the last 90 days or last 6 months, I think, would not be fair. I will just say that we are frequently getting calls, as I'm sure the other major operators are, saying, ""Hey, I'd like to participate with you. Can we do something together?""

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.87 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest, FFO was $0.38 per share for the quarter. This was below our Q4 guidance due to additional transaction-related costs. 
We paid $16 million in SmartStop transactional cost, $8 million for SmartStop's investment bankers and $8 million in severance expenses. These costs were expensed on our books rather than on SmartStop's. In essence, we paid SmartStop's transactional costs with SmartStop's working capital. These costs were included in our original purchase price estimates and had no effect on the transaction on a net-net basis. 
For the year, FFO as adjusted was $3.13 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including acquisition and noncash interest costs, FFO was $2.58 per share.
Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers, increased occupancy and lower discounts. Our top-performing markets were California, Colorado and Florida. Our worst-performing markets still grew at 4% to 5%, and our platform continues to maximize results.
We had a busy quarter on the acquisition front, adding 131 stores for $1.4 billion. The majority of these stores were part of the SmartStop acquisition, which are performing in line with our underwriting expectations.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2016. Our new same-store pool will increase by 61 properties for a total of 564. We expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by approximately 50 basis points.
For 2016, our acquisition guidance of $600 million refers only to our same-store -- or only to our wholly-owned same stores -- our wholly-owned stores. The impact of our JV acquisition is captured in our equity and earnings.
Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.65 to $3.73 per share. 2016 FFO guidance is $3.57 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate-of-occupancy acquisitions. Our guidance also includes 2015 acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they are performing at a portfolio average, they should produce an additional $0.10 per share.

We paid $16 million in SmartStop transactional cost, $8 million for SmartStop's investment bankers and $8 million in severance expenses. These costs were expensed on our books rather than on SmartStop's. In essence, we paid SmartStop's transactional costs with SmartStop's working capital. These costs were included in our original purchase price estimates and had no effect on the transaction on a net-net basis. 
For the year, FFO as adjusted was $3.13 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including acquisition and noncash interest costs, FFO was $2.58 per share.
Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers, increased occupancy and lower discounts. Our top-performing markets were California, Colorado and Florida. Our worst-performing markets still grew at 4% to 5%, and our platform continues to maximize results.
We had a busy quarter on the acquisition front, adding 131 stores for $1.4 billion. The majority of these stores were part of the SmartStop acquisition, which are performing in line with our underwriting expectations.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2016. Our new same-store pool will increase by 61 properties for a total of 564. We expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by approximately 50 basis points.
For 2016, our acquisition guidance of $600 million refers only to our same-store -- or only to our wholly-owned same stores -- our wholly-owned stores. The impact of our JV acquisition is captured in our equity and earnings.
Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.65 to $3.73 per share. 2016 FFO guidance is $3.57 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate-of-occupancy acquisitions. Our guidance also includes 2015 acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they are performing at a portfolio average, they should produce an additional $0.10 per share.
I'll now turn the time back to Spencer for some closing remarks."

However, in 2015, increases in occupancy and reductions in discounts contributed approximately 300 basis points to revenue. This year, we expect occupancy gains of approximately 100 basis points and little to no additional benefit from discount reductions.
I congratulate our team on the significant growth and the strong performance in 2015. It has resulted in Extra Space being included in the S&P 500. We are pleased to be recognized as a top-tier REIT and a member of this fine group of companies.

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.87 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest, FFO was $0.38 per share for the quarter. This was below our Q4 guidance due to additional transaction-related costs. 
We paid $16 million in SmartStop transactional cost, $8 million for SmartStop's investment bankers and $8 million in severance expenses. These costs were expensed on our books rather than on SmartStop's. In essence, we paid SmartStop's transactional costs with SmartStop's working capital. These costs were included in our original purchase price estimates and had no effect on the transaction on a net-net basis. 
For the year, FFO as adjusted was $3.13 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including acquisition and noncash interest costs, FFO was $2.58 per share.
Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers, increased occupancy and lower discounts. Our top-performing markets were California, Colorado and Florida. Our worst-performing markets still grew at 4% to 5%, and our platform continues to maximize results.
We had a busy quarter on the acquisition front, adding 131 stores for $1.4 billion. The majority of these stores were part of the SmartStop acquisition, which are performing in line with our underwriting expectations.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2016. Our new same-store pool will increase by 61 properties for a total of 564. We expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by approximately 50 basis points.
For 2016, our acquisition guidance of $600 million refers only to our same-store -- or only to our wholly-owned same stores -- our wholly-owned stores. The impact of our JV acquisition is captured in our equity and earnings.
Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.65 to $3.73 per share. 2016 FFO guidance is $3.57 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate-of-occupancy acquisitions. Our guidance also includes 2015 acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they are performing at a portfolio average, they should produce an additional $0.10 per share.

Mild winter helped moderate expenses leading to NOI growth of 12.3%. We ended the quarter at 92.8% occupancy, the highest in our company's history at this time of year. We acquired 25 stores during the quarter, 6 of which were through an off-market transaction where we bought out a partner. Pricing remains competitive and seller expectations are high but we continue to find some accretive acquisitions in the open market and through our managed asset pipeline. We ended the quarter with 1,371 Extra Space branded stores. 
Per share, FFO as adjusted grew 25% year-over-year. This is on top of 21% growth the previous year, resulting in FFO growth of over 50% in 2 years. Our multifaceted strategy to increase shareholder value has 5 components. First, operating performance. 12.3% NOI growth is outstanding by any measure and for any asset class. Second, accretive acquisitions. We have strategically purchased $4 billion since 2012. Third, joint ventures. They have and will continue to produce an outsized return on dollars invested. Fourth, third-party management. Our program, the nation's largest, provide significant economies of scale and off-market acquisition opportunities. And fifth, an optimized balance sheet. These 5 components have enabled us to produce 22 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth.

The beat was the result of better-than-expected property level performance. Including costs associated with acquisitions, noncash interest expense and a $4 million legal expense, FFO was $0.79 per share for the quarter.
Our same-store revenue growth was primarily driven by higher rates to new and existing customers and increased occupancy. Our 2016 same-store pool increased to 564 stores. The change in the same-store pool positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points. Our top-performing markets included Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Tampa saint Pete. All of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. Our slowest markets included Chicago, Memphis and Washington, D.C.  Baltimore, all of which still grew revenue at 3% plus.
In addition to the strong performance of our same-store pool, our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop performed ahead of our underwriting. Our platform continues to maximize results. 
Year-to-date, we have $520 million [ph] closed or under contract, all of which are wholly-owned acquisitions. In addition, we have $191 million in joint venture acquisitions where we will invest $50 million in 2016. 
Based on our solid first quarter results, we have increased our full-year guidance. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be between $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be between $3.59 and $3.66 per share. Guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate-of-occupancy stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they're performing on our portfolio average, these acquisitions should produce an additional $0.10 per share.

Mild winter helped moderate expenses, leading to NOI growth of 12.3%. We ended the quarter at 92.8% occupancy, the highest in our company's history at this time of year. We acquired 25 stores during the quarter, 6 of which were through an off-market transaction, where we bought out a partner. Pricing remains competitive and seller expectations are high, but we continue to find some accretive acquisitions in the open market and through our managed asset pipeline. We ended the quarter with 1,371 Extra Space branded stores. 
Per share, FFO as adjusted grew 25% year-over-year. This is on top of 21% growth the previous year, resulting in FFO growth of over 50% in 2 years. Our multifaceted strategy to increase shareholder value has 5 components. First, operating performance. 12.3% NOI growth is outstanding by any measure and for any asset class. Second, accretive acquisitions. We have strategically purchased $4 billion since 2012. Third, joint ventures. They have and will continue to produce an outsized return on dollars invested. Fourth, third-party management. Our program, the nation's largest, provides significant economies of scale and off-market acquisition opportunities. And fifth, an optimized balance sheet. These 5 components have enabled us to produce 22 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth.

The beat was the result of better-than-expected property level performance. Including costs associated with acquisitions, noncash interest expense and a $4 million legal expense, FFO was $0.79 per share for the quarter.
Our same-store revenue growth was primarily driven by higher rates to new and existing customers and increased occupancy. Our 2016 same-store pool increased to 564 stores. The change in the same-store pool positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points. Our top-performing markets included Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Tampa/St. Pete. All of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. Our slowest markets included Chicago, Memphis and Washington, D.C. Baltimore, all of which still grew revenue at 3-plus percent.
In addition to the strong performance of our same-store pool, our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop performed ahead of our underwriting. Our platform continues to maximize results. 
Year-to-date, we have $520 million closed or under contract, all of which are wholly-owned acquisitions. In addition, we have $191 million in joint venture acquisitions where we will invest $50 million in 2016. 
Based on our solid first quarter results, we have increased our full year guidance. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be between $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be between $3.59 and $3.66 per share. Guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate-of-occupancy stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they're performing at our portfolio average, these acquisitions should produce an additional $0.10 per share. 
I'll now turn the time back to Spencer."

Mild winter helped moderate expenses, leading to NOI growth of 12.3%. We ended the quarter at 92.8% occupancy, the highest in our company's history at this time of year. We acquired 25 stores during the quarter, 6 of which were through an off-market transaction, where we bought out a partner. Pricing remains competitive and seller expectations are high, but we continue to find some accretive acquisitions in the open market and through our managed asset pipeline. We ended the quarter with 1,371 Extra Space branded stores. 
Per share, FFO as adjusted grew 25% year-over-year. This is on top of 21% growth the previous year, resulting in FFO growth of over 50% in 2 years. Our multifaceted strategy to increase shareholder value has 5 components. First, operating performance. 12.3% NOI growth is outstanding by any measure and for any asset class. Second, accretive acquisitions. We have strategically purchased $4 billion since 2012. Third, joint ventures. They have and will continue to produce an outsized return on dollars invested. Fourth, third-party management. Our program, the nation's largest, provides significant economies of scale and off-market acquisition opportunities. And fifth, an optimized balance sheet. These 5 components have enabled us to produce 22 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth.

The beat was the result of better-than-expected property level performance. Including costs associated with acquisitions, noncash interest expense and a $4 million legal expense, FFO was $0.79 per share for the quarter.
Our same-store revenue growth was primarily driven by higher rates to new and existing customers and increased occupancy. Our 2016 same-store pool increased to 564 stores. The change in the same-store pool positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points. Our top-performing markets included Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Tampa/St. Pete. All of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. Our slowest markets included Chicago, Memphis and Washington, D.C. Baltimore, all of which still grew revenue at 3-plus percent.
In addition to the strong performance of our same-store pool, our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop performed ahead of our underwriting. Our platform continues to maximize results. 
Year-to-date, we have $520 million closed or under contract, all of which are wholly-owned acquisitions. In addition, we have $191 million in joint venture acquisitions where we will invest $50 million in 2016. 
Based on our solid first quarter results, we have increased our full year guidance. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be between $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be between $3.59 and $3.66 per share. Guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate-of-occupancy stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they're performing at our portfolio average, these acquisitions should produce an additional $0.10 per share. 
I'll now turn the time back to Spencer."

Mild winter helped moderate expenses, leading to NOI growth of 12.3%. We ended the quarter at 92.8% occupancy, the highest in our company's history at this time of year. We acquired 25 stores during the quarter, 6 of which were through an off-market transaction, where we bought out a partner. Pricing remains competitive and seller expectations are high, but we continue to find some accretive acquisitions in the open market and through our managed asset pipeline. We ended the quarter with 1,371 Extra Space branded stores. 
Per share, FFO as adjusted grew 25% year-over-year. This is on top of 21% growth the previous year, resulting in FFO growth of over 50% in 2 years. Our multifaceted strategy to increase shareholder value has 5 components. First, operating performance. 12.3% NOI growth is outstanding by any measure and for any asset class. Second, accretive acquisitions. We have strategically purchased $4 billion since 2012. Third, joint ventures. They have and will continue to produce an outsized return on dollars invested. Fourth, third-party management. Our program, the nation's largest, provides significant economies of scale and off-market acquisition opportunities. And fifth, an optimized balance sheet. These 5 components have enabled us to produce 22 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth.

The beat was the result of better-than-expected property level performance. Including costs associated with acquisitions, noncash interest expense and a $4 million legal expense, FFO was $0.79 per share for the quarter.
Our same-store revenue growth was primarily driven by higher rates to new and existing customers and increased occupancy. Our 2016 same-store pool increased to 564 stores. The change in the same-store pool positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points. Our top-performing markets included Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Tampa/St. Pete. All of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. Our slowest markets included Chicago, Memphis and Washington, D.C. Baltimore, all of which still grew revenue at 3-plus percent.
In addition to the strong performance of our same-store pool, our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop performed ahead of our underwriting. Our platform continues to maximize results. 
Year-to-date, we have $520 million closed or under contract, all of which are wholly-owned acquisitions. In addition, we have $191 million in joint venture acquisitions where we will invest $50 million in 2016. 
Based on our solid first quarter results, we have increased our full year guidance. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be between $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be between $3.59 and $3.66 per share. Guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 certificate-of-occupancy stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. Once they're performing at our portfolio average, these acquisitions should produce an additional $0.10 per share. 
I'll now turn the time back to Spencer."

So we're looking for those accretive acquisitions, the opportunities that makes sense geographically and economically. And when they do, we're going to act. But quality spans the spectrum."

We produced same-store revenue growth of 7.6%, primarily from rate. Expenses increased 3.1%, which led to NOI growth of 9.4%. Quarter-end occupancy was very strong at 94.4%. FFO per share as adjusted grew more than 25% year-over-year. This exceptional growth is the result of solid operating performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. These growth components have produced 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth and enabled a second quarter dividend increase of 32%. 
Year-to-date, we have closed over $0.5 billion in wholly-owned acquisitions, bringing the total property count to 1,412 Extra Space branded stores. Marketed acquisitions continue to be as competitive as we have ever seen. We continue to be disciplined and only transacts at levels that are beneficial for our shareholders. 
We've been particularly successful sourcing off-market transactions through our joint ventures, third party and other relationships. We believe that the 630 Extra Space branded stores, which are not wholly-owned, will continue to provide outsized acquisition opportunities. 
I'd now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.94 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest expense, FFO was $0.91 per share for the quarter. 
Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance, which assumed minimal benefit from occupancy and discounts. The change in our same-store pool from 2015 to 2016 positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points for the quarter. 
Our top-performing markets included Atlanta, Tampa/St. Pete and most of the state of California, all of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. The slowest markets were Chicago, Denver, Memphis and Washington, D.C., each of which still had positive revenue growth. 
Our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop, are performing in line with our estimates and lease-up times on our CofO deals are significantly faster than underwriting and our historical norms. Year-to-date, we have closed or have under contract to close $547 million of wholly-owned acquisitions. In addition, we have $248 million in joint venture acquisitions closed or under contract. 
Our investment in these JVs will be $81 million this year. All of these acquisitions are expected to close in 2016. During the quarter, we restructured 2 of our joint ventures to realize the value of our promote. The promote was exchanged for additional ownership in the joint ventures, increasing our equity position by over $40 million. 
At this time, we reaffirm our full year guidance. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be $3.59 to $3.66 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average, we expect outsized NOI growth. 
I will now turn the time back to Spencer."

There's more action, there's more supply, which is why if you go to one of my prior questions, it doesn't matter if 700 properties are 800 properties are being built or 1,000 properties are being built. What matters is if those properties are both right across the street or next door or within 1 or 2 miles of your property that you're currently operating. As I indicated over 2.5-year period, we only identified 45 properties in our entire portfolio within a 3-mile ring. Smedes, if you think about a 3-mile ring in one of the boroughs of New York or downtown San Francisco, your trade area isn't 3 miles. We were generous on the 45 property count. The trade area might be a mile or less in a dense metropolitan area. And if you think about 46 properties that we have identified that are permitted and/or in some stage of construction to come out of the ground in 2016 or 2017, also within that 3-mile ring, yes, there is competition. Properties are being built. The question is when will we feel the impact? And today, the impact has been localized to a few specific markets, and there are many markets where it's not felt at all. So we're going to have to wait and see how it plays out but yes, there is supply, and it's coming the question is when will be the impact be felt system-wide?"

And when we talk about the 700 properties being built in the United States at this time, you have to recognize there are 14 states we don't even do business in, and that's my earlier comment. It really doesn't matter what the number is. It just matters what the number of properties are that are being built within your competitive trade ring, whether it's 1 mile, 2-mile, 3 miles, and I don't know how as an industry at this point, we provide something that all analysts can triangulate on, but I think each of the individual public companies have generally been guided towards what's coming up out of the ground that is within the trade area.

They don't necessarily pass each other in the hall as one is moving out, and the next one is moving in, and that comes from a lot of factor, whether it's demand or whether that's our reservation policy at the time, where we allow someone to reserve a unit for maybe 7 days or 14 days depending on the occupancy of that unit.

FFO per share as adjusted grew more than 25% year-over-year. This exceptional growth is the result of solid operating performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. These growth components have produced 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth and enabled a second quarter dividend increase of 32%. 
Year-to-date, we have closed over $0.5 billion in wholly-owned acquisitions, bringing the total property count to 1,412 Extra Space branded stores. Marketed acquisitions continue to be as competitive as we have ever seen. We continue to be disciplined and only transact at levels that are beneficial for our shareholders.

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.94 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest expense, FFO was $0.91 per share for the quarter. 
Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance, which assumed minimal benefit from occupancy and discounts. The change in our same-store pool from 2015 to 2016 positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points for the quarter. 
Our top-performing markets included Atlanta, Tampa/St. Pete and most of the state of California, all of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. The slowest markets were Chicago, Denver, Memphis and Washington, D.C., each of which still had positive revenue growth. 
Our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop, are performing in line with our estimates and lease-up times on our CofO deals are significantly faster than underwriting and our historical norms. Year-to-date, we have closed or have under contract to close $547 million of wholly-owned acquisitions. In addition, we have $248 million in joint venture acquisitions closed or under contract. 
Our investment in these JVs will be $81 million this year. All of these acquisitions are expected to close in 2016. During the quarter, we restructured 2 of our joint ventures to realize the value of our promote. The promote was exchanged for additional ownership in the joint ventures, increasing our equity position by over $40 million. 
At this time, we reaffirm our full year guidance. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be $3.59 to $3.66 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average, we expect outsized NOI growth.

For Extra Space, during that same 10-year period, it's been 6.7%. The fact that we just posted 9.4% ought to tell you that even with some moderation, we're still way above any historical norm. And I don't see us falling off a cliff by any stretch. Storage, if you go back to 1998 when I started with the company, was used by about 6% of the U.S. population. Today, that number is more than 9% of U.S. population. One of the questions is does that top out at 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%? I don't know. But I think that at the end of the day, we're in a really good position to maximize revenue. And as I tried to state in my closing comments, look, NOI is only one contributor to our overall FFO performance. You'll get joint ventures, the most successful acquisition program in the industry.

So for us, we're going to continue to use a multipronged approach to growing this company. And I've talked about several growth levers that we're employing to make sure that we deliver the industry's best result."

We produced same-store revenue growth of 7.6%, primarily from rate. Expenses increased 3.1%, which led to NOI growth of 9.4%. Quarter-end occupancy was very strong at 94.4%. FFO per share as adjusted grew more than 25% year-over-year. This exceptional growth is the result of solid operating performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. These growth components have produced 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth and enabled a second quarter dividend increase of 32%. 
Year-to-date, we have closed over $0.5 billion in wholly-owned acquisitions, bringing the total property count to 1,412 Extra Space branded stores. Marketed acquisitions continue to be as competitive as we have ever seen. We continue to be disciplined and only transact at levels that are beneficial for our shareholders. 
We've been particularly successful sourcing off-market transactions through our joint ventures, third-party and other relationships. We believe that the 630 Extra Space branded stores, which are not wholly-owned, will continue to provide outsized acquisition opportunities.

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.94 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest expense, FFO was $0.91 per share for the quarter. 
Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance, which assumed minimal benefit from occupancy and discounts. The change in our same-store pool from 2015 to 2016 positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points for the quarter. 
Our top-performing markets included Atlanta, Tampa/St. Pete and most of the state of California, all of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. The slowest markets were Chicago, Denver, Memphis and Washington, D.C., each of which still had positive revenue growth. 
Our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop, are performing in line with our estimates and lease-up times on our CofO deals are significantly faster than underwriting and our historical norms. Year-to-date, we have closed or have under contract to close $547 million of wholly-owned acquisitions. In addition, we have $248 million in joint venture acquisitions closed or under contract. 
Our investment in these JVs will be $81 million this year. All of these acquisitions are expected to close in 2016. During the quarter, we restructured 2 of our joint ventures to realize the value of our promote. The promote was exchanged for additional ownership in the joint ventures, increasing our equity position by over $40 million. 
At this time, we reaffirm our full year guidance. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be $3.59 to $3.66 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average, we expect outsized NOI growth.

And I don't see us falling off a cliff by any stretch. Storage, if you go back to 1998 when I started with the company, was used by about 6% of the U.S. population. Today, that number is more than 9% of U.S. population. One of the questions is does that top out at 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%? I don't know. But I think that at the end of the day, we're in a really good position to maximize revenue. And as I tried to state in my closing comments, look, NOI is only one contributor to our overall FFO performance. You look at joint ventures, the most successful acquisition program in the industry. And all of the other elements that I enumerated, which I'm not going to repeat, they all contribute to what we're trying to do, and that's grow FFO. And we've got multiple levers that we're pulling to produce the industry's best FFO growth year in and year out."

We produced same-store revenue growth of 7.6%, primarily from rate. Expenses increased 3.1%, which led to NOI growth of 9.4%. Quarter-end occupancy was very strong at 94.4%. FFO per share as adjusted grew more than 25% year-over-year. This exceptional growth is the result of solid operating performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. These growth components have produced 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit FFO growth and enabled a second quarter dividend increase of 32%. 
Year-to-date, we have closed over $0.5 billion in wholly-owned acquisitions, bringing the total property count to 1,412 Extra Space branded stores. Marketed acquisitions continue to be as competitive as we have ever seen. We continue to be disciplined and only transact at levels that are beneficial for our shareholders. 
We've been particularly successful sourcing off-market transactions through our joint ventures, third-party and other relationships. We believe that the 630 Extra Space branded stores, which are not wholly-owned, will continue to provide outsized acquisition opportunities. 
I'd now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.94 per share, meeting the high end of our guidance. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest expense, FFO was $0.91 per share for the quarter. 
Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance, which assumed minimal benefit from occupancy and discounts. The change in our same-store pool from 2015 to 2016 positively impacted our revenue growth by 30 basis points for the quarter. 
Our top-performing markets included Atlanta, Tampa/St. Pete and most of the state of California, all of which experienced double-digit revenue growth. The slowest markets were Chicago, Denver, Memphis and Washington, D.C., each of which still had positive revenue growth. 
Our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop, are performing in line with our estimates and lease-up times on our CofO deals are significantly faster than underwriting and our historical norms. Year-to-date, we have closed or have under contract to close $547 million of wholly-owned acquisitions. In addition, we have $248 million in joint venture acquisitions closed or under contract. 
Our investment in these JVs will be $81 million this year. All of these acquisitions are expected to close in 2016. During the quarter, we restructured 2 of our joint ventures to realize the value of our promote. The promote was exchanged for additional ownership in the joint ventures, increasing our equity position by over $40 million. 
At this time, we reaffirm our full year guidance. FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $3.71 to $3.78 per share. FFO is estimated to be $3.59 to $3.66 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes 2015 and 2016 acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average, we expect outsized NOI growth. 
I will now turn the time back to Spencer."

As you look at our revenue management algorithm, which has 56 different inputs, the whole philosophical underpinning is not about rate or occupancy.

It has been great to meet with many of you face to face since we announced Spencer's retirement, and I look forward to getting to know you better through future interactions. 
It was another strong quarter for Extra Space. FFO per share as adjusted grew 26% year-over-year. This growth was the result of more than solid operating performance. It was also fueled by accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these levers to continue to grow shareholder value. 
Operationally, we continue to push rates to new and existing customers in the quarter and experienced average street rate of growth of approximately 7%, similar to 2015. This growth was partially offset by an increase in bad debt and discounts, which resulted in same-store revenue growth of 6.1%. 
Discounts, while still very low from our historical measure, are up from an all-time low in 2015. Expenses increased only 1.4%, which led to NOI growth of 7.8%. Quarter-end occupancy was strong at 93%. 
Year-to-date, we have acquired $825 million in wholly-owned stores. With very few exceptions, these acquisitions were not broadly marketed but came from our JV, managed and other relationships. The largest of the off-market transactions closed on September 16, when we purchased Prudential's majority interest in 23 stores for $238 million. 
Concurrently, we sold our minority interest to Prudential and the remaining 42 stores in the joint venture for $35 million. We will continue to manage these stores. 
In addition, we are under agreement with a JV partner to purchase its majority interest in 11 stores for approximately $153 million. We plan to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, which will result in wholly-owned acquisitions of $1 billion in 2016.
We also expect to close $255 million in CofO acquisitions in 2016. $90 million of these will be wholly owned and the remainder will be in joint ventures, with our investment in these ventures totaling $53 million. Our JV strategy and our CofO program are working and are creating value year in and year out. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.02 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest expense, FFO was $1 per share for the quarter. The beat was primarily the result of stronger-than-anticipated performance from our 2015 acquisitions, specifically SmartStop. We also benefited from the collection of $1 million in business interruption insurance proceeds. 
As Joe mentioned, our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance, which assume no benefit from occupancy and a headwind from discounts in the second half of 2016. We continue to have solid revenue and NOI growth throughout our diversified portfolio.
Our top-performing markets in the quarter included Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and Tampa [ph], with revenue growth in the high single-digit. The slowest markets were Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston and Memphis. With the exception of Denver, which represents about 1% of our revenue, all of our markets showed positive revenue growth year-over-year.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed a $1.15 billion unsecured credit facility. The facility consists of a $500 million revolving line of credit; a 5-year, $430 million term loan; and a 7-year, $220 million term loan. The credit facility has an accordion feature that allows us to increase total capacity to $1.5 billion. 
At closing, we drew $300 million on the 5-year tranche and paid off and terminated 3 of our 4 bilateral revolving lines of credit. The 5- and 7-year tranches have delayed draw features. We will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt.
This unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goal is to have access to multiple types of capital to ladder [ph] these and to maintain financial stability. This credit facility helps accomplish all of these goals.
Due to the outperformance of our 2015 acquisitions, we are increasing our annual FFO guidance. FFO as adjusted is now estimated to be $3.78 to $3.80 per share. FFO is now estimated to be $3.63 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average, we expect outsized NOI growth. 
I will now turn the time back to Spencer."

I've enjoyed working with each of you, and I am grateful for the relationships and friendships that have been developed over the years. 
Going forward, I will continue to be actively involved as a member of the board, and I will remain the company's largest individual shareholder. My interests are perfectly aligned with those of our shareholders. 
Thinking back 7.5 years ago when I took over as CEO, it wasn't about my predecessor, Ken Woolley, and today, it isn't about Spencer Kirk. It's always been about our competent and capable executive team, which has an average tenure of 14 years. I'm 100% comfortable that Joe Margolis is the right person at the right time to lead this very strong team. Our unique structure and our ability to execute a clear business strategy has allowed us to be among the fastest-growing REITs in the nation. None of that changes with this transition. 
Over the last 5 years, we have profitably acquired over $5 billion of real estate. These acquisitions alone would constitute one of the largest storage companies in the nation. When you combine that kind of external growth with the industry's best operating platform, which just delivered its 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit FFO growth, Extra Space is well positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth for years to come. 
With that, let's turn it over to Jeff to start the Q&A."

We've done 5 transactions with 4 different joint ventures, all managed by Prudential. Each venture is run by a different portfolio manager, has a different strategy, and the catalyst for the transaction in each case was different. In some case, we had an unsolicited offer for a property that we didn't want to sell. That started the discussion. In another case, the portfolio manager wanted to change up his geographical diversification and wanted to sell a bunch of properties, primarily in California. From our standpoint though, the similarity in each venture was that we had an embedded promote in the venture that we could not get to without any capital transaction. So we restructured -- earlier this year, we restructured 2 of the accounts without a capital transaction and realized over $40 million in promote. And then in the purchases we've done from the 2 single client accounts, the sales proceeds to the venture would be sufficient to satisfy the accrued preferred return, pay down some capital and put us in a position going forward where we will be cash flow promoted in the ventures."

That's a very healthy report card in the word of REITs by any measure. Extra Space has done a little bit better than that. We have averaged about 6.7% over that 10-plus year period and the last quarter we just reported was 7.8%. We're still way above the historical norm, and you can pull out some of occupancy and other things that might be inflating some of those numbers, but my personal opinion is not only today but going forward, storage will be amongst the best, if not the best performing asset class.

It has been great to meet with many of you face to face since we announced Spencer's retirement, and I look forward to getting to know you better through future interactions. 
It was another strong quarter for Extra Space. FFO per share as adjusted grew 26% year-over-year. This growth was the result of more than solid operating performance. It was also fueled by accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these levers to continue to grow shareholder value. 
Operationally, we continue to push rates to new and existing customers in the quarter and experienced average street rate of growth of approximately 7%, similar to 2015. This growth was partially offset by an increase in bad debt and discounts, which resulted in same-store revenue growth of 6.1%. 
Discounts, while still very low from our historical measure, are up from an all-time low in 2015. Expenses increased only 1.4%, which led to NOI growth of 7.8%. Quarter-end occupancy was strong at 93%. 
Year-to-date, we have acquired $825 million in wholly-owned stores. With very few exceptions, these acquisitions were not broadly marketed but came from our JV, managed and other relationships. The largest of the off-market transactions closed on September 16, when we purchased Prudential's majority interest in 23 stores for $238 million. 
Concurrently, we sold our minority interest to Prudential and the remaining 42 stores in the joint venture for $35 million. We will continue to manage these stores. 
In addition, we are under agreement with a JV partner to purchase its majority interest in 11 stores for approximately $153 million. We plan to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, which will result in wholly-owned acquisitions of $1 billion in 2016.
We also expect to close $255 million in CofO acquisitions in 2016. $90 million of these will be wholly owned and the remainder will be in joint ventures, with our investment in these ventures totaling $53 million. Our JV strategy and our CofO program are working and are creating value year in and year out. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.02 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest expense, FFO was $1 per share for the quarter. The beat was primarily the result of stronger-than-anticipated performance from our 2015 acquisitions, specifically SmartStop. We also benefited from the collection of $1 million in business interruption insurance proceeds. 
As Joe mentioned, our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance, which assume no benefit from occupancy and a headwind from discounts in the second half of 2016. We continue to have solid revenue and NOI growth throughout our diversified portfolio.
Our top-performing markets in the quarter included Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and Tampa/St. Pete, with revenue growth in the high single-digit. The slowest markets were Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston and Memphis. With the exception of Denver, which represents about 1% of our revenue, all of our markets showed positive revenue growth year-over-year.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed a $1.15 billion unsecured credit facility. The facility consists of a $500 million revolving line of credit; a 5-year, $430 million term loan; and a 7-year, $220 million term loan. The credit facility has an accordion feature that allows us to increase total capacity to $1.5 billion. 
At closing, we drew $300 million on the 5-year tranche and paid off and terminated 3 of our 4 bilateral revolving lines of credit. The 5- and 7-year tranches have delayed draw features. We will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt.
This unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goal is to have access to multiple types of capital to ladder these and to maintain financial stability. This credit facility helps accomplish all of these goals.
Due to the outperformance of our 2015 acquisitions, we are increasing our annual FFO guidance. FFO as adjusted is now estimated to be $3.78 to $3.80 per share. FFO is now estimated to be $3.63 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average, we expect outsized NOI growth. 
I will now turn the time back to Spencer."

I've enjoyed working with each of you, and I am grateful for the relationships and friendships that have been developed over the years. 
Going forward, I will continue to be actively involved as a member of the board, and I will remain the company's largest individual shareholder. My interests are perfectly aligned with those of our shareholders. 
Thinking back 7.5 years ago when I took over as CEO, it wasn't about my predecessor, Ken Woolley, and today, it isn't about Spencer Kirk. It's always been about our competent and capable executive team, which has an average tenure of 14 years. I'm 100% comfortable that Joe Margolis is the right person at the right time to lead this very strong team. Our unique structure and our ability to execute a clear business strategy has allowed us to be among the fastest-growing REITs in the nation. None of that changes with this transition. 
Over the last 5 years, we have profitably acquired over $5 billion of real estate. These acquisitions alone would constitute one of the largest storage companies in the nation. When you combine that kind of external growth with the industry's best operating platform, which just delivered its 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit FFO growth, Extra Space is well positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth for years to come.

We've done 5 transactions with 4 different joint ventures, all managed by Prudential. Each venture is run by a different portfolio manager, has a different strategy, and the catalyst for the transaction in each case was different. In some case, we had an unsolicited offer for a property that we didn't want to sell. That started the discussion. In another case, the portfolio manager wanted to change up his geographical diversification and wanted to sell a bunch of properties, primarily in California. From our standpoint though, the similarity in each venture was that we had an embedded promote in the venture that we could not get to without any capital transaction. So we restructured -- earlier this year, we restructured 2 of the accounts without a capital transaction and realized over $40 million in promote. And then in the purchases we've done from the 2 single client accounts, the sales proceeds to the venture would be sufficient to satisfy the accrued preferred return, pay down some capital and put us in a position going forward where we will be cash flow promoted in the ventures."

That's a very healthy report card in the world of REITs by any measure. Extra Space has done a little bit better than that. We have averaged about 6.7% over that 10-plus year period. And the last quarter we just reported was 7.8%. We're still way above the historical norm. And you can pull out some of the occupancy and other things that might be inflating some of those numbers, but my personal opinion is, not only today but going forward, storage will be amongst the best, if not the best performing asset class. So yes, we've seen some deceleration. I'm personally a little surprised at the negativity, but I have a high degree of confidence that storage, and Extra Space, in particular, are going to put up excellent results by any measure in the world of REITs. And I don't think any of that changes. So reverting to maybe more normal historical trends, it's still impressive."

It has been great to meet with many of you face to face since we announced Spencer's retirement, and I look forward to getting to know you better through future interactions. 
It was another strong quarter for Extra Space. FFO per share as adjusted grew 26% year-over-year. This growth was the result of more than solid operating performance. It was also fueled by accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these levers to continue to grow shareholder value. 
Operationally, we continue to push rates to new and existing customers in the quarter and experienced average street rate of growth of approximately 7%, similar to 2015. This growth was partially offset by an increase in bad debt and discounts, which resulted in same-store revenue growth of 6.1%. 
Discounts, while still very low from an historical measure, are up from an all-time low in 2015. Expenses increased only 1.4%, which led to NOI growth of 7.8%. Quarter-end occupancy was strong at 93%. 
Year-to-date, we have acquired $825 million in wholly-owned stores. With very few exceptions, these acquisitions were not broadly marketed but came from our JV, managed and other relationships. The largest of the off-market transactions closed on September 16, when we purchased Prudential's majority interest in 23 stores for $238 million. 
Concurrently, we sold our minority interest to Prudential in the remaining 42 stores in the joint venture for $35 million. We will continue to manage these stores. 
In addition, we are under agreement with a JV partner to purchase its majority interest in 11 stores for approximately $153 million. We plan to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, which will result in wholly-owned acquisitions of $1 billion in 2016.
We also expect to close $255 million in CofO acquisitions in 2016. $90 million of these will be wholly owned and the remainder will be in joint ventures, with our investment in these ventures totaling $53 million. Our JV strategy and our CofO program are working and are creating value year in and year out. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.02 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest expense, FFO was $1 per share for the quarter. The beat was primarily the result of stronger-than-anticipated performance from our 2015 acquisitions, specifically SmartStop. We also benefited from the collection of $1 million in business interruption insurance proceeds. 
As Joe mentioned, our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance, which assume no benefit from occupancy and a headwind from discounts in the second half of 2016. We continue to have solid revenue and NOI growth throughout our diversified portfolio.
Our top-performing markets in the quarter included Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and Tampa/St. Pete, with revenue growth in the high single-digits. The slowest markets were Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston and Memphis. With the exception of Denver, which represents about 1% of our revenue, all of our markets showed positive revenue growth year-over-year.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed a $1.15 billion unsecured credit facility. The facility consists of a $500 million revolving line of credit; a 5-year, $430 million term loan; and a 7-year, $220 million term loan. The credit facility has an accordion feature that allows us to increase total capacity to $1.5 billion. 
At closing, we drew $300 million on a 5-year tranche and paid off and terminated 3 of our 4 bilateral revolving lines of credit. The 5- and 7-year tranches have delayed draw features. We will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt.
This unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goal is to have access to multiple types of capital to ladder maturities and to maintain financial stability. This credit facility helps accomplish all of these goals.
Due to the outperformance of our 2015 acquisitions, we are increasing our annual FFO guidance. FFO as adjusted is now estimated to be $3.78 to $3.80 per share. FFO is now estimated to be $3.63 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average, we expect outsized NOI growth. 
I will now turn the time back to Spencer."

Going forward, I will continue to be actively involved as a member of the board, and I will remain the company's largest individual shareholder. My interests are perfectly aligned with those of our shareholders. 
Thinking back 7.5 years ago when I took over as CEO, it wasn't about my predecessor, Ken Woolley, and today, it isn't about Spencer Kirk. It's always been about our competent and capable executive team, which has an average tenure of 14 years. I am 100% comfortable that Joe Margolis is the right person at the right time to lead this very strong team. Our unique structure and our ability to execute a clear business strategy has allowed us to be among the fastest-growing REITs in the nation. None of that changes with this transition. 
Over the last 5 years, we have profitably acquired over $5 billion of real estate. These acquisitions alone would constitute one of the largest storage companies in the nation. When you combine that kind of external growth with the industry's best operating platform, which just delivered its 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit FFO growth, Extra Space is well positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth for years to come.

Last year was the kind of bottom where you -- as a percentage of revenues, if you take discounts divided by revenues, you were around 3%. Current year, they've ticked up slightly from there, but they're going to tick up for a couple of things. One is the fact our rates are up; and then the second thing that affects discounts, obviously, is how many rentals you're during that month. With rentals being down slightly, that helps. With rates being up, that hurts. And then in addition, we are offering slightly more discounts right now to try to compensate a little bit for our drop in occupancy. We entered the quarter about 40 basis points below where we were last year. We would like to pick up a little bit of that going into the slow season here."

We've done 5 transactions with 4 different joint ventures, all managed by Prudential. Each venture is run by a different portfolio manager, has a different strategy, and the catalyst for the transaction in each case was different. In some case, we had an unsolicited offer for a property that we didn't want to sell. That started the discussion. In another case, the portfolio manager wanted to change up his geographical diversification and wanted to sell a bunch of properties, primarily in California. From our standpoint though, the similarity in each venture was that we had an embedded promote in the venture that we could not get to without a capital transaction. So we restructured -- earlier this year, we restructured 2 of the accounts without a capital transaction and realized over $40 million in promote. And then in the purchases we've done from the 2 single client accounts, the sales proceeds to the venture will be sufficient to satisfy the accrued preferred return, pay down some capital and put us in a position going forward where we will be cash flow promoted in the ventures."

The assets we buy from a joint venture partner that we've managed, we have already maximized performance, there's less upside in those assets, but there's also less risk. We know them inside and out, we know exactly what the performance is, there's already branded. So those are kind of our safest, lowest returning assets. The CofO deals where we're taking full lease-up risk -- construction risk, and we have the period of dilution that Scott mentioned, those are higher returning type deals in return for taking that lease-up risk. And then the deals we buy on market, they span the globe. There's deals -- our first-year cap rate on acquired deals range from 2.7% to 8%. So that just tells you how much juice there is or lease-up or value is -- adders in those deals. So those could be anywhere along the spectrum."

That's a very healthy report card in the world of REITs by any measure. Extra Space has done a little bit better than that. We have averaged about 6.7% over that 10-plus year period. And the last quarter we just reported was 7.8%. We're still way above the historical norm. And you can pull out some of the occupancy and other things that might be inflating some of those numbers, but my personal opinion is, not only today but going forward, storage will be amongst the best, if not the best performing asset class. So yes, we've seen some deceleration. I'm personally a little surprised at the negativity, but I have a high degree of confidence that storage, and Extra Space, in particular, are going to put up excellent results by any measure in the world of REITs.

It was another strong quarter for Extra Space. FFO per share as adjusted grew 26% year-over-year. This growth was the result of more than solid operating performance. It was also fueled by accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these levers to continue to grow shareholder value. 
Operationally, we continue to push rates to new and existing customers in the quarter and experienced average street rate of growth of approximately 7%, similar to 2015. This growth was partially offset by an increase in bad debt and discounts, which resulted in same-store revenue growth of 6.1%. 
Discounts, while still very low from an historical measure, are up from an all-time low in 2015. Expenses increased only 1.4%, which led to NOI growth of 7.8%. Quarter-end occupancy was strong at 93%. 
Year-to-date, we have acquired $825 million in wholly-owned stores. With very few exceptions, these acquisitions were not broadly marketed but came from our JV, managed and other relationships. The largest of the off-market transactions closed on September 16, when we purchased Prudential's majority interest in 23 stores for $238 million. 
Concurrently, we sold our minority interest to Prudential in the remaining 42 stores in the joint venture for $35 million. We will continue to manage these stores. 
In addition, we are under agreement with a JV partner to purchase its majority interest in 11 stores for approximately $153 million. We plan to close this transaction in the fourth quarter, which will result in wholly-owned acquisitions of $1 billion in 2016.
We also expect to close $255 million in CofO acquisitions in 2016. $90 million of these will be wholly owned and the remainder will be in joint ventures, with our investment in these ventures totaling $53 million. Our JV strategy and our CofO program are working and are creating value year in and year out. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.02 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. Including costs associated with acquisitions and noncash interest expense, FFO was $1 per share for the quarter. The beat was primarily the result of stronger-than-anticipated performance from our 2015 acquisitions, specifically SmartStop. We also benefited from the collection of $1 million in business interruption insurance proceeds. 
As Joe mentioned, our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers. This is consistent with our guidance, which assume no benefit from occupancy and a headwind from discounts in the second half of 2016. We continue to have solid revenue and NOI growth throughout our diversified portfolio.
Our top-performing markets in the quarter included Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and Tampa/St. Pete, with revenue growth in the high single-digits. The slowest markets were Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston and Memphis. With the exception of Denver, which represents about 1% of our revenue, all of our markets showed positive revenue growth year-over-year.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed a $1.15 billion unsecured credit facility. The facility consists of a $500 million revolving line of credit; a 5-year, $430 million term loan; and a 7-year, $220 million term loan. The credit facility has an accordion feature that allows us to increase total capacity to $1.5 billion. 
At closing, we drew $300 million on a 5-year tranche and paid off and terminated 3 of our 4 bilateral revolving lines of credit. The 5- and 7-year tranches have delayed draw features. We will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt.
This unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goal is to have access to multiple types of capital to ladder maturities and to maintain financial stability. This credit facility helps accomplish all of these goals.
Due to the outperformance of our 2015 acquisitions, we are increasing our annual FFO guidance. FFO as adjusted is now estimated to be $3.78 to $3.80 per share. FFO is now estimated to be $3.63 to $3.65 per share. This guidance includes $0.05 of dilution from our 2015 and 2016 CofO stores. It also includes acquisitions that, as anticipated, will require time to be brought up to our performance standards. As these properties move towards our portfolio average, we expect outsized NOI growth. 
I will now turn the time back to Spencer."

I've enjoyed working with each of you, and I am grateful for the relationships and friendships that have been developed over the years. 
Going forward, I will continue to be actively involved as a member of the board, and I will remain the company's largest individual shareholder. My interests are perfectly aligned with those of our shareholders. 
Thinking back 7.5 years ago when I took over as CEO, it wasn't about my predecessor, Ken Woolley, and today, it isn't about Spencer Kirk. It's always been about our competent and capable executive team, which has an average tenure of 14 years. I am 100% comfortable that Joe Margolis is the right person at the right time to lead this very strong team. Our unique structure and our ability to execute a clear business strategy has allowed us to be among the fastest-growing REITs in the nation. None of that changes with this transition. 
Over the last 5 years, we have profitably acquired over $5 billion of real estate. These acquisitions alone would constitute one of the largest storage companies in the nation. When you combine that kind of external growth with the industry's best operating platform, which just delivered its 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit FFO growth, Extra Space is well positioned to continue to deliver outsized growth for years to come. 
With that, let's turn it over to Jeff to start the Q&A."

We've done 5 transactions with 4 different joint ventures, all managed by Prudential. Each venture is run by a different portfolio manager, has a different strategy, and the catalyst for the transaction in each case was different. In some case, we had an unsolicited offer for a property that we didn't want to sell. That started the discussion. In another case, the portfolio manager wanted to change up his geographical diversification and wanted to sell a bunch of properties, primarily in California. From our standpoint though, the similarity in each venture was that we had an embedded promote in the venture that we could not get to without a capital transaction. So we restructured -- earlier this year, we restructured 2 of the accounts without a capital transaction and realized over $40 million in promote. And then in the purchases we've done from the 2 single client accounts, the sales proceeds to the venture will be sufficient to satisfy the accrued preferred return, pay down some capital and put us in a position going forward where we will be cash flow promoted in the ventures."

I mean, the last couple of years, we've seen 4% to 6%. We expect that again next year. We hope to be able to grow less than inflation in some of the other areas by some of the things we're doing. So hopefully, that will offset some of it. But in terms of marketing, hopefully, as we grow, we will start to experience some of the size and scale benefit. So we hope to keep that somewhere near inflationary also."

I know you're a nimble borrower on a secured basis, but now on an apples-to-apples basis, you think that will adjust your cost of debt down? That's part one. And then part two is do you think that helps your valuation in the stock as you guys kind of move towards a more, I'd say, modern-era REIT?"

And if you look back over the last 10-plus years, it's hard to get an exact read on this because you got some occupancy gains and other things mixed in there. But some numbers that I've used in the past for the 10-year average for this group, the storage sector, operators specifically, the NOI growth has been about 5.3%. That's a very healthy report card in the world of REITs by any measure. Extra Space has done a little bit better than that. We have averaged about 6.7% over that 10-plus year period. And the last quarter we just reported was 7.8%. We're still way above the historical norm. And you can pull out some of the occupancy and other things that might be inflating some of those numbers, but my personal opinion is, not only today but going forward, storage will be amongst the best, if not the best performing asset class. So yes, we've seen some deceleration. I'm personally a little surprised at the negativity, but I have a high degree of confidence that storage, and Extra Space, in particular, are going to put up excellent results by any measure in the world of REITs. And I don't think any of that changes. So reverting to maybe more normal historical trends, it's still impressive."
