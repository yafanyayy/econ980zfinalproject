Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. As you have already seen from our release earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year results to $0.87 per sh",1512,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. 
As you have already seen from our release earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year results to $0.87 per share, a 6% increase from the prior year. This marks the sixth consecutive year of growth in operating earnings per share. These results are driven by the strategic investments we have made in talent, products and services. Throughout 2015, we continue to move the company forward by organically growing loans and deposits, strengthening fee businesses, implementing technology enhancements and furthering cross-sell efforts. 
As always, we continue to evaluate the best ways to serve our customers and improve operating efficiency. 
As such, on November 1, we closed on the sale of our payroll services business to the company's current payroll software licensor and entered into a long-term referral agreement. The sale provides customers high-quality payroll solutions at comparable costs and minimal transition impact. 
Also during the quarter, we strengthened our consumer credit card offering by entering into a new partnership with Elan Financial Services, a subsidiary of U.S. Bank. This arrangement provides consumers with full suite of MasterCard branded products, with valuable reward options as well as access to enhance payment technology. This is an exciting opportunity to meet the ongoing needs of our customers while generating additional revenue for the company. 
Now I'd like to discuss our results in further detail. I will speak to our full year performance, which can be seen on Slides 2 through 8. And consistent with past January calls, I will also outline our goals for 2016. David will follow to go over the fourth quarter results. 
Our 2015 performance reflects ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Record full year operating earnings of $263 million increased over 7% from the prior year. The continued successful execution of our business strategies is demonstrated by a strong annual loan and deposit growth of 7% and 9%, respectively, as well as sustained excellent quality across all of our portfolios. 
Operating results were driven by revenue growth of 3%, reflecting improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income. 
Despite net interest margin compression of 21 basis points, net interest income grew 2%, primarily driven by continued loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio. These improvements were partially offset by runoff in the acquired loan portfolio and modestly higher deposit costs. 
The net interest margin continued to be impacted by the new business yields remaining lower than the total portfolio yield. However, it's worth noting that the pace of the net interest margin decline moderated during the course of the year and was flat from the third to fourth quarter. 
Noninterest income, excluding nonoperating gains in both years, increased 4%, primarily due to higher commercial banking lending fees and a continued success of our customer interest rate swap business. 
Noninterest expenses increased 2%. Nonoperating expenses increased $3.4 million, which is mainly attributable to higher branch closing costs. 
In 2015, we closed 18 branches compared to 8 in the prior year as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel. 
Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 54 branches, which is -- excuse me, were mostly traditional branches. During the same time period, we opened 25 branches, of which 16 are more cost-efficient in-store locations. 
In-store branches also provide us the unique opportunity to engage with the 3.3 million shoppers who visit Connecticut and New York Stop & Shop location each week. 
From an operating perspective, expenses increased less than 2%, primarily due to higher costs related to compensation and benefits as well as professional and outside services. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance this year and our ability to sustain momentum we have built in recent years. 
On Slide 9, we included a snapshot of last year's goals compared to actual results. As you can see, we were in line with all of our goals with the exception of the operating expenses, which were slightly above the expected range. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs going forward, notwithstanding the continued impact of higher regulatory compliance costs as well as our ongoing commitment to strategically invest in the company to create value for both customers and shareholders. 
I wanted to take a moment on Slide 10 to reflect some of the significant progress we have made moving the company forward over the past 5 years, particularly in light of the operating environment. 
We have been consistent in our approach, building the franchise for the long term. Over this time, we have remained committed to investing strategically to further grow the franchise in our expanded footprint as well as deepen our presence across all of our heritage markets. 
We have also never wavered from our approach to relationship banking, which customers recognize as an important differentiator. Our expenses suite of products is comparable to that of the larger banks and our focus on exceptional customer service at the local level has uniquely positioned us in the Northeast corridor. 
Accordingly, our balance sheet has experienced annual loan growth of over 10% since 2010. Importantly, this growth has more than offset the significant net interest margin compression. 
As a result, net interest income, excluding accretion, has increased at an annual rate of over 7% during the period. 
Additionally, over the past 5 years, we have strengthened our fee-based businesses as evidenced by 4% annual growth in noninterest income despite industry headwinds. 
Building on this progress continues to be an important area of focus in order to further diversify revenues. 
Finally, we look at the totality of our customer relationships from not only loan and fee income perspectives, but also deposits. Deposits are a large component of profitability. As such, we have emphasized deposit gathering across the organization and have made it clear that the process are an integral part of customer relationships. Success of these efforts is demonstrated by the annual growth of organic deposits of well over 7% since 2010, with particularly strong results last year. 
Turning to Slide 11, you can see how our approach to building the franchise has favorably impacted profitability. 
Over the past 5 years, full year operating earnings per share has increased from $0.34 to $0.87, a compound annual growth rate of over 20%. This increase was primarily driven by our ability to grow earning assets, both organically and through acquisitions, which enabled us to more than offset the negative impacts of the extended low interest rate environment on net interest margin. 
Given our unique position in the market, which will drive continued increases in earning assets and our commitment to further strengthen fee-based businesses, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent quality earnings growth for shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 12. Before discussing our goals for the new year, I wanted to mention a reporting change in the coming year. Beginning with first quarter 2016 results, we will no longer classify expenses related to ordinary and recurring [ph] branch closures and severance as nonoperating. We believe this decision will help simplify our financial disclosures. 
In order to provide a better understanding of our underlying performance and trends, we will continue to highlight items of significance that we consider nonrecurring or infrequent in nature, which impacts GAAP results. 
With this reporting change impacting our expense goal in line, let me outline our goals for full year 2016. 
First goal is to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 6% to 8%. Secondly, our continued emphasis on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in the 4% to 6% range. This assumes no growth in brokered deposits. 
The next goal is for net interest income to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. Embedded in this goal in the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of 1 25 basis point rate increase in mid-2016. 
We expect noninterest income levels after adjusting for the gain on the sale of the company's payroll services business to be consistent year-over-year. 
Total expenses for the year are expected to be in the range of $865 million to $885 million as compared to 2015 total expenses of $861 million. 
Range includes expenses related to 7 planned branch openings, of which 6 are in-store branches. We will maintain excellent credit quality with the provision in the range of $40 million to $50 million. 
Finally, we will maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that tangible common equity tangible assets will finish the year in the range of 7% to 7.2%. 
In addition, as we have mentioned in previous calls, we expect to issue preferred in the second half of the year. We look forward to executing on the opportunities we have created to achieve these goals. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail."

With respect to our fourth quarter performance, please turn to Slide 13 for an overview. 
Operating earnings increased 3% from the prior year quarter to $67 million. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $0.22, consistent year-over-year. 
I will discuss the other results shown on this overview on subsequent slides. 
On Slide 14, we provide the detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter. 
Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio as well as strong loan growth increased net interest income by $2.7 [ph] million and $2.2 million, respectively. 
Net interest income also benefited from slightly lower deposit costs. 
On Slide 15, net interest margin of 2.87% was consistent with the third quarter. This marks the first time net interest margin has not declined on a linked quarter basis since the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio increased the margin by 1 basis point, while new loan volume unfavorably impacted margin by a basis point as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. 
Turning to Slide 16. As we discussed previously, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest in terms of loan originations and the fourth quarter of 2015 continued this trend. 
The loan portfolio grew $739 million or 11% annualized from the third quarter, marking the 21st consecutive quarter of growth. 
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $784 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $685 million from the third quarter as growth was broadly diversified. 
C&I contributed $207 million of total originated growth while commercial real estate and equipment financing added $260 million and $145 million, respectively. 
Within C&I, the mortgage warehouse quarter end balance was $963 million, up $124 million from September 30 as balances were aided by trade-related purchase related, which have since subsided. 
Retail contributed $99 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by residential mortgage growth of $86 million. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 
The consumer portfolio has $13 million of originated growth, its largest quarterly increase in over a year. 
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $45 million this quarter compared to $59 [ph] million in the third quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $797 million. 
Slide 17 shows the change in deposits by segment from the third quarter. Total deposits increased $137 million or 2% on an annualized basis. 
As planned, we reduced brokered deposits by nearly $100 million during the quarter. As such, organic deposit growth was $232 [ph] million or 4% annualized. 
Retail grew $251 [ph] million or 5% annualized in the quarter compared to $114 [ph] million reduction in commercial. 
Excluding the reduction in brokered deposits, retail grew $345 million or 8% annualized. 
In commercial, the seasonality of our municipal business had a negative impact on deposits of $170 [ph] million during the fourth quarter. 
It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits came down 1 basis point in the quarter. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our progress gathering deposits. 
As we maintain emphasis on franchise wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, we should continue to see further growth. 
On Slide 18, we take a closer look at the change in noninterest income, which, excluding the $9.2 million gain from the sale of the payroll services business, declined $3 million to 3% from the third [ph] quarter. 
As we expected, insurance revenues lowered net interest income by $1.6 million due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals. 
In addition, lower bank service charges, primarily due to 3 fewer business days in the fourth quarter and lower commercial banking fees, negatively impacted noninterest income by $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. 
On Slide 19, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Nonoperating expenses increased $3.7 million, reflecting lease buyouts on branches that was previously closed as well as severance-related costs. 
From an operating perspective, expenses improved nearly $1 million from the third quarter due to a decrease in compensation and benefits. 
Expenses were also favorably impacted by lower regulatory assessments of $2.4 million as a result of a credit received for overpayment of the FDIC assessments in prior quarters. 
A primary offset to these improvements was a $900,000 increase in professional and outside services. 
Similar to previous quarters this year, the increase is primarily related to costs associated with a number of initiatives focusing on enhancing our product offerings and processes. 
Fourth quarter operating expenses were modestly higher than the $211 million we guided to on October's call as a result of higher-than-expected incentives as well as the timing of costs related to health care, a single REO property and professional and outside services. 
As we have discussed before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance. 
As a reminder, payroll taxes for 401(k) matches and winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly based on historical experience, expenses are expected to be approximately $5 million higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter total expenses of $217 [ph] million. 
The next slide displays our efficiency ratio improvement in the fourth quarter compared to recent quarters. 
As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important focus of the company. 
Slide 21 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 66 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 88 basis points in the fourth quarter 2014. 
Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years. 
As shown on Slide 22, operating return on average assets decreased slightly, but remained generally consistent with recent quarters. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the interest rate environment. 
Our return on average tangible equity was 10.2% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 30 basis points on a linked quarter basis, but an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. 
As we continue to focus on improving profitability, we expect to see further progress in this metric over time. 
Turning to Slide 23. Capital levels of the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. 
Finally, on Slide 25, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. 
As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive and well-positioned for rising interest rates as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. 
At year-end, 42% of the loan portfolio was either 1 month LIBOR or time-based, up from 38% a year ago as 56% of originations in 2015 were floating rate loans. 
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

So we were starting to watch what was going on in the commodity space. Didn't think we have anything like what we're experienced in the last couple of weeks. But we decided it's probably prudent to put a little more leverage on the balance sheet. From a mix of securities, we're not doing anything different than what we've done in the past. So there was a small reduction in short CMO paper, but the growth, that was replaced and then the additional growth was primarily in 15-year pass-throughs and then we added to our municipal securities book as well.

And in the last 3 weeks, obviously, there's been a lot of fear about China and oil prices, et cetera. It still doesn't feel to me like that cautious optimism needs to change. Our companies -- our customers and the companies that we do business with and have continued to make progress and operated at a profitable level, consumers have deleveraged. If you look at our numbers around that problem loans and the like and the demand side, things are pretty good. So we're concerned about certainly the noise right now and concerned about what is doing to the yield curve, et cetera. But I'd say we're cautiously optimistic of the U.S. economy and the Northeast corridor is going to continue to move forward at a similar pace to where we've been. We certainly appreciate the regulatory concerns about commercial real estate. And I would say that the largest piece of that is concerned about rate staying as low as they've been for as long and what that's done to cap rates and valuations. But when we look at our portfolio and the performance of it, we feel very, very good about the consistency in our approach to underwriting over time and including right up until today and the performance of credits have been very strong. Our nonperformer, our lower delinquency, our charge-offs and commercial real estate is slight modest. And we believe we it will continue to be that way. So a lot of discipline in our underwriting. I hope that the message is from the regulators will take some of the more competitive counters that we sometime get with customers off the table. I hope it's slowed some people down that are being a little too aggressive. We'll see."

We have a leap year this year, so just rate -- rates not changing, you would have this year about a 3 basis point decline in the margin. That will be offset with the action by the Fed last month. So at this point, with the uncertainties around the steepness of the yield curve, I would expect that for the full year, we would be right about the middle of the guidance that we're giving and I would think around a fairly steady margin over the course of the year similar to what you saw in 2015. If you go back and look at the quarters in '15, we were down, I believe, 9 basis points from first to second quarter down 1 second to third and then flat in the third and fourth. And so we've really seen a flattening out of the margin on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So aside from a little noise in this quarter from day count negative, Fed tightening last month to positive, we will have roughly a fairly flat margin over the course of the year."

We appreciate everyone joining us today.As you have already seen from our release earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year results to $0.87 per sha",1505,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.
As you have already seen from our release earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year results to $0.87 per share, a 6% increase from the prior year. This marks the sixth consecutive year of growth in operating earnings per share. These results are driven by the strategic investments we have made in talent, products and services. Throughout 2015, we continue to move the company forward by organically growing loans and deposits, strengthening fee businesses, implementing technology enhancements and furthering cross-sell efforts.
As always, we continue to evaluate the best ways to serve our customers and improve operating efficiency. 
As such, on November 1, we closed on the sale of our payroll services business to the company's current payroll software licensor and entered into a long-term referral agreement. The sale provides customers high-quality payroll solutions at comparable costs and minimal transition impact.
Also during the quarter, we strengthened our consumer credit card offering by entering into a new partnership with Elan Financial Services, a subsidiary of U.S. Bank. This arrangement provides consumers a full suite of MasterCard branded products, with valuable reward options as well as access to enhance payment technology. This is an exciting opportunity to meet the ongoing needs of our customers while generating additional revenue for the company.
Now I'd like to discuss our results in further detail. I will speak to our full year performance, which can be seen on Slides 2 through 8. And consistent with past January calls, I will also outline our goals for 2016. David will follow to go over the fourth quarter results.
Our 2015 performance reflects ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Record full year operating earnings of $263 million increased over 7% from the prior year. The continued successful execution of our business strategies is demonstrated by a strong annual loan and deposit growth of 7% and 9%, respectively, as well as sustained excellent asset quality across all of our portfolios.
Operating results were driven by revenue growth of 3%, reflecting improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income.
Despite net interest margin compression of 21 basis points, net interest income grew 2%, primarily driven by continued loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio. These improvements were partially offset by runoff in the acquired loan portfolio and modestly higher deposit costs.
The net interest margin continued to be impacted by new business yields remaining lower than the total portfolio yield. However, it's worth noting that the pace of the net interest margin decline moderated during the course of the year and was flat from the third to fourth quarter.
Noninterest income, excluding nonoperating gains in both years, increased 4%, primarily due to higher commercial banking lending fees and a continued success of our customer interest rate swap business.
Noninterest expenses increased 2%. Nonoperating expenses increased $3.4 million, which is mainly attributable to higher branch closing costs.
In 2015, we closed 18 branches compared to 8 in the prior year as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 54 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same time period, we opened 25 branches, of which 16 are more cost-efficient in-store locations.
In-store branches also provide us the unique opportunity to engage with the 3.3 million shoppers who visit Connecticut and New York Stop & Shop location each week.
From an operating perspective, expenses increased less than 2%, primarily due to higher costs related to compensation and benefits as well as professional and outside services. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance this year and our ability to sustain momentum we have built in recent years.
On Slide 9, we included a snapshot of last year's goals compared to actual results. As you can see, we were in line with all of our goals with the exception of the operating expenses, which were slightly above the expected range. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs going forward, notwithstanding the continued impact of higher regulatory compliance costs as well as our ongoing commitment to strategically invest in the company to create value for both customers and shareholders.
I wanted to take a moment on Slide 10 to reflect on the significant progress we have made moving the company forward over the past 5 years, particularly in light of the operating environment.
We have been consistent in our approach, building the franchise for the long term. Over this time, we have remained committed to investing strategically to further grow the franchise in our expanded footprint as well as deepen our presence across all of our heritage markets.
We have also never wavered from our approach to relationship banking, which customers recognize as an important differentiator. Our extensive suite of products is comparable to that of the larger banks, and our focus on exceptional customer service at the local level has uniquely positioned us in the Northeast corridor.
Accordingly, our balance sheet has experienced annual loan growth of over 10% since 2010. Importantly, this growth has more than offset significant net interest margin compression.
As a result, net interest income, excluding accretion, has increased at an annual rate of over 7% during the period.
Additionally, over the past 5 years, we have strengthened our fee-based businesses as evidenced by 4% annual growth in noninterest income despite industry headwinds.
Building on this progress continues to be an important area of focus in order to further diversify revenues.
Finally, we look at the totality of our customer relationships from not only loan and fee income perspectives but also deposits. Deposits are a large component of profitability. As such, we have emphasized deposit gathering across the organization and have made it clear that the process are an integral part of customer relationships. Success of these efforts is demonstrated by the annual growth of organic deposits of well over 7% since 2010, with particularly strong results last year.
Turning to Slide 11, you can see how our approach to building the franchise has favorably impacted profitability.
Over the past 5 years, full year operating earnings per share has increased from $0.34 to $0.87, a compound annual growth rate of over 20%. This increase was primarily driven by our ability to grow earning assets, both organically and through acquisitions, which enabled us to more than offset the negative impacts of the extended low interest rate environment on net interest margin.
Given our unique position in the market, which will drive continued increases in earning assets and our commitment to further strengthen fee-based businesses, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent quality earnings growth for shareholders.
Turning to Slide 12. Before discussing our goals for the new year, I wanted to mention a reporting change in the coming year. Beginning with first quarter 2016 results, we will no longer classify expenses related to ordinary and recurring branch closures and severance as nonoperating. We believe this decision will help simplify our financial disclosures.
In order to provide a better understanding of underlying performance and trends, we will continue to highlight items of significance that we consider nonrecurring or infrequent in nature, which impact GAAP results.
With this reporting change impacting our expense goal in mind, let me outline our goals for full year 2016.
First goal is to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 6% to 8%. Secondly, our continued emphasis on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in the 4% to 6% range. This assumes no growth in brokered deposits.
The next goal is for net interest income to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of 125 basis point rate increase in mid-2016.
We expect noninterest income levels after adjusting for the gain on the sale of the company's payroll services business to be consistent year-over-year.
Total expenses for the year are expected to be in the range of $865 million to $885 million as compared to 2015 total expenses of $861 million.
The range includes expenses related to 7 planned branch openings, of which 6 are in-store branches. We will maintain excellent credit quality with the provision in the range of $40 million to $50 million.
Finally, we will maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that tangible common equity to tangible assets will finish the year in the range of 7% to 7.2%.
In addition, as we have mentioned in previous calls, we expect to issue preferred in the second half of the year. We look forward to executing on the opportunities we have created to achieve these goals. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail."

On a per share basis, operating earnings were $0.22, consistent year-ov",1210,"Thank you, Jack.
With respect to our fourth quarter performance, please turn to Slide 13 for an overview.
Operating earnings increased 3% from the prior year quarter to $67 million. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $0.22, consistent year-over-year.
I will discuss the other results shown on this overview on subsequent slides.
On Slide 14, we provide the detail behind the linked-quarter increase in net interest income of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter.
Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio as well as strong loan growth increased net interest income by $2.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
Net interest income also benefited from slightly lower deposit costs.
On Slide 15, net interest margin of 2.87% was consistent with the third quarter. This marks the first time net interest margin has not declined on a linked-quarter basis since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio increased the margin by 1 basis point, while new loan volume unfavorably impacted margin by a basis point as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.
Turning to Slide 16. As we discussed previously, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest in terms of loan originations, and the fourth quarter of 2015 continued this trend.
The loan portfolio grew $739 million or 11% annualized from the third quarter, marking the 21st consecutive quarter of growth.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $784 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $685 million from the third quarter as growth was broadly diversified.
C&I contributed $207 million of total originated growth while commercial real estate and equipment financing added $260 million and $145 million, respectively.
Within C&I, the mortgage warehouse quarter-end balance was $963 million, up $124 million from September 30 as balances were aided by trade-related purchase delays which have since subsided.
Retail contributed $99 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by residential mortgage growth of $86 million. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages.
The consumer portfolio has $13 million of originated growth, its largest quarterly increase in over a year.
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $45 million this quarter compared to $59 million in the third quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $797 million.
Slide 17 shows the change in deposits by segment from the third quarter. Total deposits increased $137 million or 2% on an annualized basis.
As planned, we reduced brokered deposits by nearly $100 million during the quarter. As such, organic deposit growth was $232 million or 4% annualized.
Retail grew $251 million or 5% annualized in the quarter compared to $114 million reduction in commercial.
Excluding the reduction in brokered deposits, retail grew $345 million or 8% annualized.
In commercial, the seasonality of our municipal business had a negative impact on deposits of $170 million during the fourth quarter.
It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits came down 1 basis point in the quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased with our progress gathering deposits.
As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit-gathering efforts, we should continue to see further growth.
On Slide 18, we take a closer look at the change in noninterest income, which, excluding the $9.2 million gain from the sale of the payroll services business, declined $3 million to 3% from the third quarter.
As expected, insurance revenues lowered noninterest income by $1.6 million due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals.
In addition, lower bank service charges, primarily due to 3 fewer business days in the fourth quarter, and lower commercial banking fees, negatively impacted noninterest income by $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
On Slide 19, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Nonoperating expenses increased $3.7 million, reflecting lease buyouts on branches that was previously closed as well as severance-related costs.
From an operating perspective, expenses improved nearly $1 million from the third quarter due to a decrease in compensation and benefits.
Expenses were also favorably impacted by lower regulatory assessments of $2.4 million as a result of a credit received for overpayment of FDIC assessments in prior quarters.
A primary offset to these improvements was a $900,000 increase in professional and outside services.
Similar to previous quarters this year, the increase is primarily related to costs associated with a number of initiatives focusing on enhancing our product offerings and processes.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were modestly higher than the $211 million we guided to on October's call as a result of higher-than-expected incentives as well as the timing of costs related to health care, a single REO property and professional and outside services.
As we have discussed before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance.
As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly based on historical experience, expenses are expected to be approximately $5 million higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter total expenses of $217 million.
The next slide displays our efficiency ratio improvement in the fourth quarter compared to recent quarters.
As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important focus of the company.
Slide 21 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 66 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 88 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years.
As shown on Slide 22, operating return on average assets decreased slightly but remained generally consistent with recent quarters. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the interest rate environment.
Our return on average tangible equity was 10.2% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 30 basis points on a linked-quarter basis but an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.
As we continue to focus on improving profitability, we expect to see further progress in this metric over time.
Turning to Slide 23. Capital levels of the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management.
Finally, on Slide 24, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist.
As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive and well positioned for rising interest rates as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans.
At year-end, 42% of the loan portfolio was either 1 month LIBOR or prime-based, up from 38% a year ago as 56% of originations in 2015 were floating rate loans.
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

So we were starting to watch what was going on in the commodity space. Didn't think we'd have anything like what we experienced in the last couple of weeks. But we decided it was probably prudent to put a little more leverage on the balance sheet. From a mix of securities, we're not doing anything different than what we've done in the past. So there was a small reduction in short CMO paper, but the growth -- that was replaced and then the additional growth was primarily in 15-year pass-throughs. And then we added to our municipal securities book as well. But that's been our strategy for the last couple of years from an asset selection perspective.

And in the last 3 weeks, obviously, there's been a lot of fear about China and oil prices, et cetera. It still doesn't feel to me like that cautious optimism needs to change. Our companies -- our customers and the companies that we do business have continued to make progress and operated at a profitable level, consumers have deleveraged. If you look at our numbers around problem loans and the like and the demand side, things are pretty good. So we're concerned about certainly the noise right now and concerned about what it's doing to the yield curve, et cetera. But I'd say we're cautiously optimistic of the U.S. economy and the Northeast economy is going to continue to move forward at a similar pace to where we've been. We certainly appreciate the regulatory concerns about commercial real estate. And I would say that the largest piece of that is concerned about rate staying as low as they've been for as long and what that's done to cap rates and valuations. But when we look at our portfolio and the performance of it, we feel very, very good about the consistency in our approach to underwriting over time and including right up until today, and the performance of credits have been very strong. Our nonperformers, our delinquency, our charge-offs in commercial real estate is quite modest. And we believe it will continue to be that way. So a lot of discipline in our underwriting. I hope that the messages from the regulators will take some of the more competitive counters that we sometime get with customers off the table. I hope it slows some people down that are being a little too aggressive. We'll see."

So at this point, with the uncertainties around the steepness of the yield curve, I would expect that for the full year, we would be right about the middle of the guidance that we're giving, and I would think around a fairly steady margin over the course of the year similar to what you saw in 2015. If you go back and look at the quarters in '15, we were down, I believe, 9 basis points from first to second quarter, down 1 second to third and then flat in the third and fourth. And so we've really seen a flattening out of the margin on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So aside from a little noise in this quarter from day count negative, Fed tightening last month positive, we will have roughly a fairly flat margin over the course of the year."

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.As you have already seen from our release earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year results to $0.87 per sha",1506,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.
As you have already seen from our release earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year results to $0.87 per share, a 6% increase from the prior year. This marks the sixth consecutive year of growth in operating earnings per share. These results are driven by the strategic investments we have made in talent, products and services. Throughout 2015, we continue to move the company forward by organically growing loans and deposits, strengthening fee businesses, implementing technology enhancements and furthering cross-sell efforts.
As always, we continue to evaluate the best ways to serve our customers and improve operating efficiency. 
As such, on November 1, we closed on the sale of our payroll services business to the company's current payroll software licensor and entered into a long-term referral agreement. The sale provides customers high-quality payroll solutions at comparable costs and minimal transition impact.
Also during the quarter, we strengthened our consumer credit card offering by entering into a new partnership with Elan Financial Services, a subsidiary of U.S. Bank. This arrangement provides consumers to a full suite of MasterCard branded products, with valuable reward options as well as access to enhanced payment technology. This is an exciting opportunity to meet the ongoing needs of our customers while generating additional revenue for the company.
Now I'd like to discuss our results in further detail. I will speak to our full year performance, which can be seen on Slides 2 through 8. And consistent with past January calls, I will also outline our goals for 2016. David will follow to go over the fourth quarter results.
Our 2015 performance reflects ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Record full year operating earnings of $263 million increased over 7% from the prior year. The continued successful execution of our business strategies is demonstrated by a strong annual loan and deposit growth of 7% and 9%, respectively, as well as sustained excellent asset quality across all of our portfolios.
Operating results were driven by revenue growth of 3%, reflecting improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income.
Despite net interest margin compression of 21 basis points, net interest income grew 2%, primarily driven by continued loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio. These improvements were partially offset by runoff in the acquired loan portfolio and modestly higher deposit costs.
The net interest margin continued to be impacted by new business yields remaining lower than the total portfolio yield. However, it's worth noting that the pace of the net interest margin decline moderated during the course of the year and was flat from the third to fourth quarter.
Noninterest income, excluding nonoperating gains in both years, increased 4%, primarily due to higher commercial banking lending fees and a continued success of our customer interest rate swap business.
Noninterest expenses increased 2%. Nonoperating expenses increased $3.4 million, which is mainly attributable to higher branch closing costs.
In 2015, we closed 18 branches compared to 8 in the prior year as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 54 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same time period, we opened 25 branches, of which 16 are more cost-efficient in-store locations.
In-store branches also provide us the unique opportunity to engage with the 3.3 million shoppers who visit Connecticut and New York Stop & Shop locations each week.
From an operating perspective, expenses increased less than 2%, primarily due to higher costs related to compensation and benefits as well as professional and outside services. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance this year and our ability to sustain momentum we have built in recent years.
On Slide 9, we included a snapshot of last year's goals compared to actual results. As you can see, we were in line with all of our goals with the exception of the operating expenses, which were slightly above the expected range. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs going forward, notwithstanding the continued impact of higher regulatory compliance costs as well as our ongoing commitment to strategically invest in the company to create value for both customers and shareholders.
I wanted to take a moment on Slide 10 to reflect on the significant progress we have made moving the company forward over the past 5 years, particularly in light of the operating environment.
We have been consistent in our approach, building the franchise for the long term. Over this time, we have remained committed to investing strategically to further grow the franchise in our expanded footprint as well as deepen our presence across all of our heritage markets.
We have also never wavered from our approach to relationship banking, which customers recognize as an important differentiator. Our extensive suite of products is comparable to that of the larger banks, and our focus on exceptional customer service at the local level has uniquely positioned us in the Northeast corridor.
Accordingly, our balance sheet has experienced annual loan growth of over 10% since 2010. Importantly, this growth has more than offset significant net interest margin compression.
As a result, net interest income, excluding accretion, has increased at an annual rate of over 7% during the period.
Additionally, over the past 5 years, we have strengthened our fee-based businesses as evidenced by 4% annual growth in noninterest income despite industry headwinds.
Building on this progress continues to be an important area of focus in order to further diversify revenues.
Finally, we look at the totality of our customer relationships from not only loan and fee income perspectives but also deposits. Deposits are a large component of profitability. As such, we have emphasized deposit gathering across the organization and have made it clear that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships. Success of these efforts is demonstrated by the annual growth of organic deposits of well over 7% since 2010, with particularly strong results last year.
Turning to Slide 11, you can see how our approach to building the franchise has favorably impacted profitability.
Over the past 5 years, full year operating earnings per share has increased from $0.34 to $0.87, a compound annual growth rate of over 20%. This increase was primarily driven by our ability to grow earning assets, both organically and through acquisitions, which enabled us to more than offset the negative impacts of the extended low interest rate environment on net interest margin.
Given our unique position in the market, which will drive continued increases in earning assets and our commitment to further strengthen fee-based businesses, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent quality earnings growth for shareholders.
Turning to Slide 12. Before discussing our goals for the new year, I wanted to mention a reporting change in the coming year. Beginning with first quarter 2016 results, we will no longer classify expenses related to ordinary and recurring branch closures and severance as nonoperating. We believe this decision will help simplify our financial disclosures.
In order to provide a better understanding of underlying performance and trends, we will continue to highlight items of significance that we consider nonrecurring or infrequent in nature, which impact GAAP results.
With this reporting change impacting our expense total in mind, let me outline our goals for full year 2016.
First goal is to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 6% to 8%. Secondly, our continued emphasis on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in the 4% to 6% range. This assumes no growth in brokered deposits.
The next goal is for net interest income to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of one 25 basis point rate increase in mid-2016.
We expect noninterest income levels after adjusting for the gain on the sale of the company's payroll services business to be consistent year-over-year.
Total expenses for the year are expected to be in the range of $865 million to $885 million as compared to 2015 total expenses of $861 million.
The range includes expenses related to 7 planned branch openings, of which 6 are in-store branches. We will maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of $40 million to $50 million.
Finally, we will maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that tangible common equity to tangible assets will finish the year in the range of 7% to 7.2%.
In addition, as we have mentioned on previous calls, we expect to issue preferred in the second half of the year. We look forward to executing on the opportunities we have created to achieve these goals. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail."

With respect to our fourth quarter performance, please turn to Slide 13 for an overview.
Operating earnings increased 3% from the prior year quarter to $67 million. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $0.22, consistent year-over-year.
I will discuss the other results shown on this overview on subsequent slides.
On Slide 14, we provide the detail behind the linked-quarter increase in net interest income of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter.
Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio as well as strong loan growth increased net interest income by $2.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
Net interest income also benefited from slightly lower deposit costs.
On Slide 15, net interest margin of 2.87% was consistent with the third quarter. This marks the first time net interest margin has not declined on a linked-quarter basis since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio increased the margin by 1 basis point, while new loan volume unfavorably impacted margin by 1 basis point as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.
Turning to Slide 16. As we discussed previously, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest in terms of loan originations, and the fourth quarter of 2015 continued this trend.
The loan portfolio grew $739 million or 11% annualized from the third quarter, marking the 21st consecutive quarter of growth.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $784 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $685 million from the third quarter as growth was broadly diversified.
C&I contributed $207 million of total originated growth while commercial real estate and equipment financing added $260 million and $145 million, respectively.
Within C&I, the mortgage warehouse quarter-end balance was $963 million, up $124 million from September 30, as balances were aided by TRID-related purchase delays, which have since subsided.
Retail contributed $99 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by residential mortgage growth of $86 million. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages.
The consumer portfolio had $13 million of originated growth, its largest quarterly increase in over a year.
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $45 million this quarter compared to $59 million in the third quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $797 million.
Slide 17 shows the change in deposits by segment from the third quarter. Total deposits increased $137 million or 2% on an annualized basis.
As planned, we reduced brokered deposits by nearly $100 million during the quarter. As such, organic deposit growth was $232 million or 4% annualized.
Retail grew $251 million or 5% annualized in the quarter compared to $114 million reduction in commercial.
Excluding the reduction in brokered deposits, retail grew $345 million or 8% annualized.
In commercial, the seasonality in our municipal business had a negative impact on deposits of $170 million during the fourth quarter.
It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits came down 1 basis point in the quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased with our progress gathering deposits.
As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit-gathering efforts, we should continue to see further growth.
On Slide 18, we take a closer look at the change in noninterest income, which, excluding the $9.2 million gain from the sale of the payroll services business, declined $3 million, or 3% from the third quarter.
As expected, insurance revenues lowered noninterest income by $1.6 million due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals.
In addition, lower bank service charges, primarily due to 3 fewer business days in the fourth quarter, and lower commercial banking fees, negatively impacted noninterest income by $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
On Slide 19, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Nonoperating expenses increased $3.7 million, reflecting lease buyouts on branches that was previously closed as well as severance-related costs.
From an operating perspective, expenses improved nearly $1 million from the third quarter due to a decrease in compensation and benefits.
Expenses were also favorably impacted by lower regulatory assessments of $2.4 million as a result of a credit received for overpayment of FDIC assessments in prior quarters.
A primary offset to these improvements was a $900,000 increase in professional and outside services.
Similar to previous quarters this year, the increase is primarily related to costs associated with a number of initiatives focusing on enhancing our product offerings and processes.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were modestly higher than the $211 million we guided to on October's call as a result of higher-than-expected incentives as well as the timing of costs related to health care, a single REO property and professional and outside services.
As we have discussed before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance.
As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly based on historical experience, expenses are expected to be approximately $5 million higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter total expenses of $217 million.
The next slide displays our efficiency ratio improvement in the fourth quarter compared to recent quarters.
As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important focus of the company.
Slide 21 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO, at 66 basis points, remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 88 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years.
As shown on Slide 22, operating return on average assets decreased slightly but remained generally consistent with recent quarters. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the interest rate environment.
Our return on average tangible equity was 10.2% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 30 basis points on a linked-quarter basis but an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.
As we continue to focus on improving profitability, we expect to see further progress in this metric over time.
Turning to Slide 23. Capital levels of the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management.
Finally, on Slide 24, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist.
As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive and well positioned for rising interest rates as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans.
At year-end, 42% of the loan portfolio was either 1-month LIBOR or prime-based, up from 38% a year ago as 56% of originations in 2015 were floating rate loans.
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

So we were starting to watch what was going on in the commodity space. Didn't think we'd have anything like what we're experiencing in the last couple of weeks. But we decided it was probably prudent to put a little more leverage on the balance sheet. From a mix of securities, we're not doing anything different than what we've done in the past. So there was a small reduction in short CMO paper, but the growth -- that was replaced and then the additional growth was primarily in 15-year pass-throughs. And then we added to our municipal securities book as well. But that's been our strategy for the last couple of years from an asset selection perspective.

Our companies -- our customers and the companies that we do business with have continued to make progress and operated at a profitable level. Consumers have deleveraged, if you look at our numbers around problem loans and the like and the demand side, things are pretty good. So we're concerned about certainly the noise right now and concerned about what it's doing to the yield curve, et cetera. But I'd say we're cautiously optimistic that the U.S. economy and the Northeast economy is going to continue to move forward at a similar pace to where we've been. We certainly appreciate the regulatory concerns about commercial real estate. I would say that the largest piece of that is concerned about rates staying as low as they've been for as long and what that's done to cap rates and valuations. But when we look at our portfolio and the performance of it, we feel very, very good about the consistency in our approach to underwriting over time and including right up until today, and the performance of the credits have been very strong. Our nonperformers, our delinquency, our charge-off in commercial real estate is quite modest. And we believe it will continue to be that way. So a lot of discipline in our underwriting. I hope that the messages from the regulators will take some of the more competitive counters that we sometime get with customers off the table, I hope it slows some people down that are being a little too aggressive.

So at this point, with the uncertainties around the steepness of the yield curve, I would expect that for the full year, we would be right about the middle of the guidance that we're giving, and I would think around a fairly steady margin over the course of the year, similar to what you saw in 2015. If you go back and look at the quarters, in '15, we were down, I believe, 9 basis points from first to second quarter, down 1 second to third and then flat in the third and fourth. And so we've really seen a flattening out of the margin on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So aside from a little noise in this quarter from day count negative, Fed tightening last month, a positive, we will have roughly a fairly flat margin over the course of the year."

Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.As you have already seen from our release earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year results to $0.87 per sha",1506,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.
As you have already seen from our release earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year results to $0.87 per share, a 6% increase from the prior year. This marks the sixth consecutive year of growth in operating earnings per share. These results are driven by the strategic investments we have made in talent, products and services. Throughout 2015, we continue to move the company forward by organically growing loans and deposits, strengthening fee businesses, implementing technology enhancements and furthering cross-sell efforts.
As always, we continue to evaluate the best ways to serve our customers and improve operating efficiency. 
As such, on November 1, we closed on the sale of our payroll services business to the company's current payroll software licensor and entered into a long-term referral agreement. The sale provides customers high-quality payroll solutions at comparable costs and minimal transition impact.
Also during the quarter, we strengthened our consumer credit card offering by entering into a new partnership with Elan Financial Services, a subsidiary of U.S. Bank. This arrangement provides consumers with a full suite of MasterCard branded products, with valuable reward options as well as access to enhanced payment technology. This is an exciting opportunity to meet the ongoing needs of our customers while generating additional revenue for the company.
Now I'd like to discuss our results in further detail. I will speak to our full year performance, which can be seen on Slides 2 through 8. And consistent with past January calls, I will also outline our goals for 2016. David will follow to go over the fourth quarter results.
Our 2015 performance reflects ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Record full year operating earnings of $263 million increased over 7% from the prior year. The continued successful execution of our business strategies is demonstrated by a strong annual loan and deposit growth of 7% and 9%, respectively, as well as sustained excellent asset quality across all of our portfolios.
Operating results were driven by revenue growth of 3%, reflecting improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income.
Despite net interest margin compression of 21 basis points, net interest income grew 2%, primarily driven by continued loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio. These improvements were partially offset by runoff in the acquired loan portfolio and modestly higher deposit costs.
The net interest margin continued to be impacted by new business yields remaining lower than the total portfolio yield. However, it's worth noting that the pace of the net interest margin decline moderated during the course of the year and was flat from the third to fourth quarter.
Noninterest income, excluding nonoperating gains in both years, increased 4%, primarily due to higher commercial banking lending fees and a continued success of our customer interest rate swap business.
Noninterest expenses increased 2%. Nonoperating expenses increased $3.4 million, which is mainly attributable to higher branch closing costs.
In 2015, we closed 18 branches compared to 8 in the prior year as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 54 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same time period, we opened 25 branches, of which 16 are more cost-efficient in-store locations.
In-store branches also provide us the unique opportunity to engage with the 3.3 million shoppers who visit Connecticut and New York Stop & Shop locations each week.
From an operating perspective, expenses increased less than 2%, primarily due to higher costs related to compensation and benefits as well as professional and outside services. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance this year and our ability to sustain momentum we have built in recent years.
On Slide 9, we included a snapshot of last year's goals compared to actual results. As you can see, we were in line with all of our goals with the exception of the operating expenses, which were slightly above the expected range. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs going forward, notwithstanding the continued impact of higher regulatory compliance costs as well as our ongoing commitment to strategically invest in the company to create value for both customers and shareholders.
I wanted to take a moment on Slide 10 to reflect on the significant progress we have made moving the company forward over the past 5 years, particularly in light of the operating environment.
We have been consistent in our approach, building the franchise for the long term. Over this time, we have remained committed to investing strategically to further grow the franchise in our expanded footprint as well as deepen our presence across all of our heritage markets.
We have also never wavered from our approach to relationship banking, which customers recognize as an important differentiator. Our extensive suite of products is comparable to that of the larger banks, and our focus on exceptional customer service at the local level has uniquely positioned us in the Northeast corridor.
Accordingly, our balance sheet has experienced annual loan growth of over 10% since 2010. Importantly, this growth has more than offset significant net interest margin compression.
As a result, net interest income, excluding accretion, has increased at an annual rate of over 7% during the period.
Additionally, over the past 5 years, we have strengthened our fee-based businesses as evidenced by 4% annual growth in noninterest income despite industry headwinds.
Building on this progress continues to be an important area of focus in order to further diversify revenues.
Finally, we look at the totality of our customer relationships from not only loan and fee income perspectives but also deposits. Deposits are a large component of profitability. As such, we have emphasized deposit gathering across the organization and have made it clear that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships. Success of these efforts is demonstrated by the annual growth of organic deposits of well over 7% since 2010, with particularly strong results last year.
Turning to Slide 11, you can see how our approach to building the franchise has favorably impacted profitability.
Over the past 5 years, full year operating earnings per share has increased from $0.34 to $0.87, a compound annual growth rate of over 20%. This increase was primarily driven by our ability to grow earning assets, both organically and through acquisitions, which enabled us to more than offset the negative impacts of the extended low interest rate environment on net interest margin.
Given our unique position in the market, which will drive continued increases in earning assets and our commitment to further strengthen fee-based businesses, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent quality earnings growth for shareholders.
Turning to Slide 12. Before discussing our goals for the new year, I wanted to mention a reporting change in the coming year. Beginning with first quarter 2016 results, we will no longer classify expenses related to ordinary and recurring branch closures and severance as nonoperating. We believe this decision will help simplify our financial disclosures.
In order to provide a better understanding of underlying performance and trends, we will continue to highlight items of significance that we consider nonrecurring or infrequent in nature, which impact GAAP results.
With this reporting change impacting our expense total in mind, let me outline our goals for full year 2016.
First goal is to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 6% to 8%. Secondly, our continued emphasis on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in the 4% to 6% range. This assumes no growth in brokered deposits.
The next goal is for net interest income to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of one 25 basis point rate increase in mid-2016.
We expect noninterest income levels after adjusting for the gain on the sale of the company's payroll services business to be consistent year-over-year.
Total expenses for the year are expected to be in the range of $865 million to $885 million as compared to 2015 total expenses of $861 million.
The range includes expenses related to 7 planned branch openings, of which 6 are in-store branches. We will maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of $40 million to $50 million.
Finally, we will maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that tangible common equity to tangible assets will finish the year in the range of 7% to 7.2%.
In addition, as we have mentioned on previous calls, we expect to issue preferred in the second half of the year. We look forward to executing on the opportunities we have created to achieve these goals. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail."

With respect to our fourth quarter performance, please turn to Slide 13 for an overview.
Operating earnings increased 3% from the prior year quarter to $67 million. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $0.22, consistent year-over-year.
I will discuss the other results shown on this overview on subsequent slides.
On Slide 14, we provide the detail behind the linked-quarter increase in net interest income of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter.
Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio as well as strong loan growth increased net interest income by $2.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
Net interest income also benefited from slightly lower deposit costs.
On Slide 15, net interest margin of 2.87% was consistent with the third quarter. This marks the first time net interest margin has not declined on a linked-quarter basis since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio increased the margin by 1 basis point, while new loan volume unfavorably impacted margin by 1 basis point as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.
Turning to Slide 16. As we discussed previously, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest in terms of loan originations, and the fourth quarter of 2015 continued this trend.
The loan portfolio grew $739 million or 11% annualized from the third quarter, marking the 21st consecutive quarter of growth.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $784 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $685 million from the third quarter as growth was broadly diversified.
C&I contributed $207 million of total originated growth while commercial real estate and equipment financing added $260 million and $145 million, respectively.
Within C&I, the mortgage warehouse quarter-end balance was $963 million, up $124 million from September 30, as balances were aided by TRID-related purchase delays, which have since subsided.
Retail contributed $99 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by residential mortgage growth of $86 million. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages.
The consumer portfolio had $13 million of originated growth, its largest quarterly increase in over a year.
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $45 million this quarter compared to $59 million in the third quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $797 million.
Slide 17 shows the change in deposits by segment from the third quarter. Total deposits increased $137 million or 2% on an annualized basis.
As planned, we reduced brokered deposits by nearly $100 million during the quarter. As such, organic deposit growth was $232 million or 4% annualized.
Retail grew $251 million or 5% annualized in the quarter compared to $114 million reduction in commercial.
Excluding the reduction in brokered deposits, retail grew $345 million or 8% annualized.
In commercial, the seasonality in our municipal business had a negative impact on deposits of $170 million during the fourth quarter.
It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits came down 1 basis point in the quarter.
Overall, we are very pleased with our progress gathering deposits.
As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit-gathering efforts, we should continue to see further growth.
On Slide 18, we take a closer look at the change in noninterest income, which, excluding the $9.2 million gain from the sale of the payroll services business, declined $3 million, or 3% from the third quarter.
As expected, insurance revenues lowered noninterest income by $1.6 million due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals.
In addition, lower bank service charges, primarily due to 3 fewer business days in the fourth quarter, and lower commercial banking fees, negatively impacted noninterest income by $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
On Slide 19, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Nonoperating expenses increased $3.7 million, reflecting lease buyouts on branches that was previously closed as well as severance-related costs.
From an operating perspective, expenses improved nearly $1 million from the third quarter due to a decrease in compensation and benefits.
Expenses were also favorably impacted by lower regulatory assessments of $2.4 million as a result of a credit received for overpayment of FDIC assessments in prior quarters.
A primary offset to these improvements was a $900,000 increase in professional and outside services.
Similar to previous quarters this year, the increase is primarily related to costs associated with a number of initiatives focusing on enhancing our product offerings and processes.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were modestly higher than the $211 million we guided to on October's call as a result of higher-than-expected incentives as well as the timing of costs related to health care, a single REO property and professional and outside services.
As we have discussed before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance.
As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly based on historical experience, expenses are expected to be approximately $5 million higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter total expenses of $217 million.
The next slide displays our efficiency ratio improvement in the fourth quarter compared to recent quarters.
As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important focus of the company.
Slide 21 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO, at 66 basis points, remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 88 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years.
As shown on Slide 22, operating return on average assets decreased slightly but remained generally consistent with recent quarters. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the interest rate environment.
Our return on average tangible equity was 10.2% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 30 basis points on a linked-quarter basis but an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.
As we continue to focus on improving profitability, we expect to see further progress in this metric over time.
Turning to Slide 23. Capital levels of the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management.
Finally, on Slide 24, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist.
As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive and well positioned for rising interest rates as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans.
At year-end, 42% of the loan portfolio was either 1 month LIBOR or prime-based, up from 38% a year ago as 56% of originations in 2015 were floating rate loans.
Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

So interesting how it impacts different parts of our footprint. But the Boston folks are very optimistic about it over time ago. When we look at Connecticut, Fairfield County, naturally, it's a big disappointment to lose that headquarters. From our -- if we look at our portfolio, we have a very modest amount of personal loans, residential loans to the GE employees. And when you really stop and think about it, some of those mortgages are 20 years old and some are 10 years old and some are a couple of years old. So when you think about it from an impact of the portfolios and the bank deposits, et cetera, it's not going to be significant. Over time, I think depending on how many people -- they're talking about 200 people going from Connecticut.

But also what we did in the fourth quarter was really, in our view, in response to what we thought was a developing weakness in the economy. So we were starting to watch what was going on in the commodity space. Didn't think we'd have anything like what were experienced in the last couple of weeks. But we decided it was probably prudent to put a little more leverage on the balance sheet. From a mix of securities, we're not doing anything different than what we've done in the past. So there was a small reduction in short CMO paper, but the growth -- that was replaced and then the additional growth was primarily in 15-year pass-throughs. And then we added to our municipal securities book as well. But that's been our strategy for the last couple of years from an asset selection perspective. So really, just what changed was a little bit of a growing sense that a little more fixed rate assets on the books was appropriate."

And in the last 3 weeks, obviously, there's been a lot of fear about China and oil prices, et cetera. It still doesn't feel to me like that cautious optimism needs to change. Our companies -- our customers and the companies that we do business with have continued to make progress and operated at a profitable level. Consumers have deleveraged, if you look at our numbers around problem loans and the like and the demand side, things are pretty good. So we're concerned about certainly the noise right now and concerned about what it's doing to the yield curve, et cetera. But I'd say we're cautiously optimistic that the U.S. economy and the Northeast economy is going to continue to move forward at a similar pace to where we've been. We certainly appreciate the regulatory concerns about commercial real estate. I would say that the largest piece of that is concerned about rates staying as low as they've been for as long and what that's done to cap rates and valuations. But when we look at our portfolio and the performance of it, we feel very, very good about the consistency in our approach to underwriting over time and including right up until today, and the performance of the credits have been very strong. Our nonperformers, our delinquency, our charge-off in commercial real estate is quite modest. And we believe it will continue to be that way. So a lot of discipline in our underwriting. I hope that the messages from the regulators will take some of the more competitive counters that we sometime get with customers off the table, I hope it slows some people down that are being a little too aggressive.

We have a leap year this year, so just rate -- rates not changing, you would have this year about a 3 basis point decline in the margin. That will be offset with the action by the Fed last month. So at this point, with the uncertainties around the steepness of the yield curve, I would expect that for the full year, we would be right about the middle of the guidance that we're giving, and I would think around a fairly steady margin over the course of the year, similar to what you saw in 2015. If you go back and look at the quarters, in '15, we were down, I believe, 9 basis points from first to second quarter, down 1 second to third and then flat in the third and fourth. And so we've really seen a flattening out of the margin on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So aside from a little noise in this quarter from day count negative, Fed tightening last month, a positive, we will have roughly a fairly flat margin over the course of the year."

Good morning. Appreciate everyone joining us today. Turning to the overview of the first quarter on Slide 2. Our performance this quarter reflects our continued focus on further improving profitability while moving the company forward",360,"Thank you, Andrew. Good morning. Appreciate everyone joining us today. 
Turning to the overview of the first quarter on Slide 2. Our performance this quarter reflects our continued focus on further improving profitability while moving the company forward with a long-term view. Net income of $63 million or $0.21 per share represents a 6% increase from the prior year quarter or 5% increase on a per share basis. On a linked-quarter basis, net income was down from $71 million or $0.23 per share. However, as a reminder, fourth quarter net income included a net after-tax gain of $6 million or $0.02 per share, resulting from the sale of the company's payroll services business. Revenues increased 2% from the prior year quarter and were essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis when adjusted for the gains on sale of the payroll business. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth and higher average balances in the securities portfolio, while noninterest income was negatively impacted primarily by lower bank service charges and commercial banking lending fees. 
Total expenses were generally consistent on both at linked-quarter basis and compared to the prior year quarter. As we have discussed before, we remain committed to our proactive expense management approach to tightly control costs while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance. Period end loans grew for the 22nd consecutive quarter, although the 1% annualized growth rate is a slower pace than in recent periods as the first quarter is typically a seasonally slower period for loan growth. Residential mortgage results remained strong, with growth of 11% annualized, while commercial loan balances were slightly lower from year-end. However, on a quarterly average basis, commercial loans grew more than 4% annualized. Given deposits are a large component of profitability and integral part of customer relationships, we are pleased with our continued success growing deposits as evidenced by the 11% annualized growth in organic deposits since year-end. As we maintain emphasis on franchise wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, we should continue to see further broad-based growth. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter in more detail."
295774,329048797,960852,"People's United Financial Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, we provide the detail behind the linked quarter increase and net interest income for the fourth quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth as well as our decision to increase the size of the securitie",1274,"Thank you, Jack. 
On Slide 3, we provide the detail behind the linked quarter increase and net interest income for the fourth quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth as well as our decision to increase the size of the securities portfolio in recent periods, in light of the prolonged low interest rate environment. Even with this increase, the securities portfolio, as a percentage of total assets, remains low relative to peers at 17%. These benefits to net interest income were partially offset by an increase in borrowing costs and the impact of one less calendar day in the first quarter. 
On Slide 4, we display the drivers behind the decline in net interest margin of 4 basis points from the fourth quarter to 283. New loan volume favorably impacted the margin by 3 basis points as new business yields were higher than the total loan portfolio yield. One less calendar day in the first quarter, a lower securities portfolio yield and higher borrowing costs each negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points. The lower securities portfolio yield was driven in large part by a reduction in the dividend rate paid on Federal Reserve Bank stock. 
Turning to Slide 5. The loan portfolio grew $100 million or 1% annualized from the fourth quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $132 million. Retail contributed $133 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by strong residential mortgage growth of $154 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio decreased $1 million from the fourth quarter. Commercial real estate and equipment financing contributed total originated growth of $27 million and $5 million, respectively, while C&I originated balances declined by $33 million. Within C&I, the mortgage warehouse quarter end balance was $965 million, up $2 million from year-end. We experienced acquired loan run off of $32 million this quarter compared to $45 million in the fourth quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $764 million. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the fourth quarter. Total deposits increased $688 million or 10% on an annualized basis. We reduced brokered deposits by $33 million during the quarter. Therefore, organic deposit growth was $721 million or 11% annualized. Commercial and retail grew deposits by $494 million and $194 million, respectively. In commercial, the seasonality of our municipal business had a favorable impact on deposits of $333 million during the first quarter. Just as a reminder, the first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposit growth. It is also worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 98% at March 31 and our cost of deposits were consistent with the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at noninterest income, which declined $2 million or 2% compared to the fourth quarter when adjusting for the $9.2 million gain on the sale of the payroll services business. Insurance revenues increased noninterest income by $1.8 million, primarily due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals. In addition, lower bank service charges and volume-related commercial banking lending fees negatively impacted noninterest income by $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Total expenses of $217.3 million were flat with the fourth quarter, but better than the first quarter expectations we set forth at year-end. Included in fourth quarter total expenses was $2.5 million of write-downs of banking house assets related to lease buyouts of previously closed branches. We did not have any write-downs of banking house assets in the first quarter despite the closure of one branch. Total expenses in the first quarter were impacted by higher compensation and benefits, which increased $2.1 million from the fourth quarter as we saw the traditionally higher first quarter payroll-related and benefit costs. In addition, expenses related to regulatory assessments and occupancy and equipment were up $900,000 and $500,000, respectively. The primary offset to these increases was a $500,000 improvement in costs pertaining to outside and professional services. As you will recall, on our conference call in January, we guided the first quarter expenses of approximately $222 million. Actual first quarter results were better than expectations due to lower costs related to volume-driven incentives, health care as well as seasonal expenses, given the mild winter in the Northeast. 
The next slide displays our efficiency ratio over recent quarters. As you are aware, beginning with the results this quarter, we are no longer classifying expenses related to ordinary and reoccurring branch closures in severances nonoperating. In prior periods, these expenses were excluded from our efficiency ratio calculation. For comparability purposes, we have included on this slide what the metric would have been in prior periods with the inclusion of these expenses. While the efficiency ratio is higher due to the reporting change, overall trends are generally consistent. Continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important focus of the company. 
Slide 10 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 68 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 80 basis points in the first quarter of 2015. As you may have noticed in our recently filed proxy statement, we have adjusted the composition of our peer group for 2016 to account for significant changes in the competitive landscape among financial institutions, including completed or recently announced acquisitions. For a list of companies in our revised peer group, please see Page 17 of the presentation. Net charge-offs for the quarter remains at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years. 
As shown on Slide 11, return on average assets decreased from recent quarters and continues to be impacted by the interest rate environment. Our return on average tangible equity was 9.4% for the first quarter, a decrease of 130 basis points on a linked-quarter basis, but an improvement of 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. As we continue to focus on improving profitability, we expect to see progress in this metric over time. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. The tangible equity ratio improved 10 basis points from year-end to 730, primarily as a result of an improvement in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio. Capital ratios at the bank also improved from year-end due to an equity contribution from the holding company in order to create a more cost-effective capital structure. 
Finally, on Slide 13, we display our interest risk profile for both parallel rate changes as well as yield curve twist. As you can see, we remained asset sensitive and well-positioned for rising interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel rate shock scenario. Our short end asset sensitivity is slightly lower than at year-end and as long end rates came down in the first quarter, we became more susceptible to lower long end rates as evidenced by the down 100 basis point yield curve twist scenario. 
Now with that, I'll pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

As we have mentioned before, we remain committed to making investments that create value for both customers and shareholders. As such, we are pleased to announce today the acquisition of Eagle Insurance Group, a full-service agency and customer-focused commercial insurance broker based in eastern Massachusetts. The acquisition deepens the company's presence in the region as well as expands our already strong relationship and expertise in commercial lines. 
Additionally, we continue to strategically invest in talent throughout the organization to further move the company forward. In recent months, we have brought on board 2 key leaders who will enhance our revenue generation capabilities. Mark joined us from MNT to head up the bank's New York commercial real estate group and brings more than 25 years of experience. Mark and his team will continue to strengthen and expand our lending and deposit gathering activities in the Greater New York metro market while maintaining the conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that is a hallmark of People's United. Essentially, Mark joined us from BB&T to become our new Chief Marketing Officer. He brings more than 30 years of experience to the position. Mark will be leading all of our marketing efforts, including branding, advertising, product development and digital marketing. Additionally, he will be working closely with our business lines to enhance sales force effectiveness and drive increased revenues to the bank. 
Finally, we are pleased to announce the board voted to raise the dividend to an annual rate of $0.68 per share. This marks the 23rd consecutive year the dividend has been increased, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering value to our shareholders through the consistent return of capital. 
This concludes our presentation. We will be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions."

When I think about the margin, two things are probably important to mention. The first was the pace of securities. The growth in securities will most likely moderate over the balance of the year. We've seen growth in the last 3 quarters and that pace will slow down. Secondly, our margin was impacted by a little over 2 basis points because of the reduced volume of loans. Had we met our loan growth expectations for the quarter, you would've seen the margin come in at 285 or so. And you had mentioned asset sensitivity. So what -- we benefited from the increase in LIBOR, which occurred prior to the Fed increase in the fourth quarter but also, we gave back some of that as the yield curve flattened in the first quarter. So when we think about the margin over the balance of the year, the level of short-term rates as well as the steepness of the yield curve will push our margin either way a few basis points as the year unfolds."

However, that original guidance did have that rate increase baked in. We -- what we mentioned in the prepared remarks was the fact that, and you saw in the press release, we had 1 basis point increase in the portfolio -- in the loan portfolio. And when you look at the securities portfolio, it was impacted by about $1.5 million from the change in the Federal Reserve bank dividend policy. Previously, that was a 6% on Fed stock and it's come down to the 10-year treasury. So on a linked-quarter basis, that won't be there next quarter.

We did that, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. From a security selection makeup of the portfolio, there's really nothing that's changed. We run a very conservative fixed income portfolio from the perspective that there's -- the mortgage-backed securities are all 10- or 15-year mortgages rather than 30.

I think the way to look at that from that way is, first, to think about the franchise and the growth that we've experienced and the opportunity created. And we've had a substantial residential mortgage home equity business a long time in the franchise. But as we grew in to eastern Massachusetts and into New York, we were underrepresented, right? We didn't have the people on the ground to basically generate to build the business. And we've been building that team. I think we referenced that probably a year ago, in particular, when we brought on a new mortgage sales manager. And that is beginning to bear fruit and some of the growth that we're experiencing. So I think on the ground, that's the most important thing. I'll just remind everybody, we do certify mortgage folks in the branches in our company. So we do generate mortgages through our branch personnel. And that's the differentiator. And we also have a wholesale operation. So in the combination of that, I think, gives us the right level of business flow across the footprint and there's opportunity to keep improving that with the personnel on the ground. We looked at the year and thought that we would see --  we saw with the mortgage bankers, we said in front of many people expected a slower market. And we did expect some slowing, but offset by the efforts that I just described in terms of building the business. So right now, we're seeing a decent flow of purchase activity and the recent rate changes have driven some refis again. So our pipeline is as high as it's been in recent times."

So kind of loans that have been booked in the last several quarters, including this one and where we see pipeline strong. And that would be Boston. Certainly, in New York, and particularly, on Long Island, our personnel there are doing a great job across C&I and commercial real estate and those pipelines look very good. Our equipment finance unit, particularly BCLC, is having a very -- had a good quarter and has got a very good full pipeline. ABL pipeline is good, less volume in the first quarter, but a lot of activity. And I think Connecticut was actually down in the 3 portfolio in this quarter, but has been pretty steady. We have a lot of long-term relationships there and we get a lot of repeat business from those customers. Then on the C&I side, Connecticut was okay in the quarter, but we had a couple of pay offs that hurt our balances, that came from actually companies being acquired and the acquirer just paying off our credit. So I really think -- again, I'll go back to where that comment came from. It is a mix, it always is, right, depending on geography and business line. It definitely cycles as activity comes through the process."

That's mostly [indiscernible] portfolio. Same thing would be for our HELOC portfolio. The -- we're still not additive with the longer-term fixed-rate loans that are more susceptible to the shape of the yield curve. So commercial real estate is still not additive.

So that's really just the volume issue. When you think about our asset sensitivity, there's really -- there's 2 components, and that's why we talk about yield curve twist and showed the slide. So we try to show investors what the short end impacts are to us as well as long end. And with what happened in -- from mid-December or just from the last 2 quarters, if you will, is we had benefit from rising short rates, Fed funds and LIBOR. But some of that benefit was given back as the yield curve flattened. So when we look at the balance of the year, those 2 components will still come into play as well as volume."

Good morning. Appreciate everyone joining us today. Turning to the overview of the first quarter on Slide 2. Our performance this quarter reflects our continued focus on further improving profitability while moving the company forward",357,"Thank you, Andrew. Good morning. Appreciate everyone joining us today. 
Turning to the overview of the first quarter on Slide 2. Our performance this quarter reflects our continued focus on further improving profitability while moving the company forward with a long-term view. Net income of $63 million or $0.21 per share represents a 6% increase from the prior year quarter or 5% increase on a per share basis. On a linked-quarter basis, net income was down from $71 million or $0.23 per share. However, as a reminder, fourth quarter net income included a net after-tax gain of $6 million or $0.02 per share, resulting from the sale of the company's payroll services business. Revenues increased 2% from the prior-year quarter and were essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis when adjusted for the gains on sale of the payroll business. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth and higher average balances in the securities portfolio, while noninterest income was negatively impacted primarily by lower bank service charges and commercial banking lending fees. 
Total expenses were generally consistent on both at linked-quarter basis and compared to the prior-year quarter. As we have discussed before, we remain committed to our proactive expense management approach to tightly control costs while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance. Period-end loans grew for the 22nd consecutive quarter, although the 1% annualized growth rate is a slower pace than in recent periods, as the first quarter is typically a seasonally slower period for loan growth. Residential mortgage results remained strong, with growth of 11% annualized, while commercial loan balances were slightly lower from year-end. However, on a quarterly average basis, commercial loans grew more than 4% annualized. Given deposits are a large component of profitability and integral part of customer relationships, we are pleased with our continued success growing deposits, as evidenced by the 11% annualized growth in organic deposits since year-end. As we maintain emphasis on franchise wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, we should continue to see further broad-based growth. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter in more detail."

On Slide 3, we provide the detail behind the linked-quarter increase and net interest income for the fourth quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth as well as our decision to increase the size of the securitie",1266,"Thank you, Jack. 
On Slide 3, we provide the detail behind the linked-quarter increase and net interest income for the fourth quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth as well as our decision to increase the size of the securities portfolio in recent periods, in light of the prolonged low interest rate environment. Even with this increase, the securities portfolio, as a percentage of total assets, remains low relative to peers at 17%. These benefits to net interest income were partially offset by an increase in borrowing costs and the impact of one less calendar day in the first quarter. 
On Slide 4, we display the drivers behind the decline in net interest margin of 4 basis points from the fourth quarter to 283. New loan volume favorably impacted the margin by 3 basis points, as new business yields were higher than the total loan portfolio yield. One less calendar day in the first quarter, a lower securities portfolio yield, and higher borrowing costs each negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points. The lower securities portfolio yield was driven in large part by a reduction in the dividend rate paid on Federal Reserve Bank stock. 
Turning to Slide 5. The loan portfolio grew $100 million or 1% annualized from the fourth quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $132 million. Retail contributed $133 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by strong residential mortgage growth of $154 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio decreased $1 million from the fourth quarter. Commercial real estate and equipment financing contributed total originated growth of $27 million and $5 million, respectively, while C&I originated balances declined by $33 million. Within C&I, the mortgage warehouse quarter end balance was $965 million, up $2 million from year-end. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $32 million this quarter compared to $45 million in the fourth quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $764 million. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the fourth quarter. Total deposits increased $688 million or 10% on an annualized basis. We reduced brokered deposits by $33 million during the quarter. Therefore, organic deposit growth was $721 million or 11% annualized. Commercial and retail grew deposits by $494 million and $194 million, respectively. In commercial, the seasonality of our municipal business had a favorable impact on deposits of $333 million during the first quarter. Just as a reminder, the first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposit growth. It is also worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 98% at March 31, and our costs of deposits were consistent with the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at noninterest income, which declined $2 million or 2% compared to the fourth quarter when adjusting for the $9.2 million gain on the sale of the payroll services business. Insurance revenues increased noninterest income by $1.8 million, primarily due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals. In addition, lower bank service charges and volume-related commercial banking lending fees negatively impacted noninterest income by $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Total expenses of $217.3 million were flat with the fourth quarter, but better than the first quarter expectations we set forth at year-end. Included in fourth quarter total expenses was $2.5 million of write-downs of banking house assets related to lease buyouts of previously closed branches. We did not have any write-downs of banking house assets in the first quarter, despite the closure of one branch. Total expenses in the first quarter were impacted by higher compensation and benefits, which increased $2.1 million from the fourth quarter as we saw the traditionally higher first quarter payroll-related and benefit costs. In addition, expenses related to regulatory assessments and occupancy and equipment were up $900,000 and $500,000, respectively. The primary offset to these increases was a $500,000 improvement in costs pertaining to outside and professional services. As you will recall, on our conference call in January, we guided the first quarter expenses of approximately $222 million. Actual first quarter results were better than expectations due to lower costs related to volume-driven incentives, health care as well as seasonal expenses, given the mild winter in the Northeast. 
The next slide displays our efficiency ratio over recent quarters. As you are aware, beginning with the results this quarter, we are no longer classifying expenses related to ordinary and reoccurring branch closures in severances nonoperating. In prior periods, these expenses were excluded from our efficiency ratio calculation. For comparability purposes, we have included on this slide what the metric would have been in prior periods with the inclusion of these expenses. While the efficiency ratio is higher due to the reporting change, overall trends are generally consistent. Continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important focus of the company. 
Slide 10 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 68 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 80 basis points in the first quarter of 2015. As you may have noticed in our recently filed proxy statement, we have adjusted the composition of our peer group for 2016 to account for significant changes in the competitive landscape among financial institutions, including completed or recently announced acquisitions. For a list of companies in our revised peer group, please see Page 17 of the presentation. Net charge-offs for the quarter remains at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years. 
As shown on Slide 11, return on average assets decreased from recent quarters and continues to be impacted by the interest rate environment. Our return on average tangible equity was 9.4% for the first quarter, a decrease of 130 basis points on a linked-quarter basis, but an improvement of 20 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. As we continued to focus on improving profitability, we expect to see progress in this metric over time. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. The tangible equity ratio improved 10 basis points from year-end to 730, primarily as a result of an improvement in the fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Capital ratios at the bank also improved from year-end due to an equity contribution from the holding company in order to create a more cost-effective capital structure. 
Finally, on Slide 13, we display our interest risk profile for both parallel rate changes as well as yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive and well positioned for rising interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel rate shock scenario. Our short-end asset sensitivity is slightly lower than at year-end, and as long end rates came down in the first quarter, we became more susceptible to lower long end rates, as evidenced by the down 100-basis-point yield curve twist scenario. 
Now with that, I'll pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

When I think about the margin, two things are probably important to mention. The first was the pace of securities. The growth in securities will most likely moderate over the balance of the year. We've seen growth in the last 3 quarters and that pace will slow down. Secondly, our margin was impacted by a little over 2 basis points because of the reduced volume of loans. Had we met our loan growth expectations for the quarter, you would've seen the margin come in at 285 or so. And you had mentioned asset sensitivity. So what -- we benefited from the increase in LIBOR, which occurred prior to the Fed increase in the fourth quarter, but also, we gave back some of that as the yield curve flattened in the first quarter. So when we think about the margin over the balance of the year, the level of short-term rates as well as the steepness of the yield curve will push our margin either way a few basis points as the year unfolds."

So we're -- no change to guidance. However, that original guidance did have that rate increase baked in. We -- what we mentioned in the prepared remarks was the fact that, and you saw in the press release, we had 1-basis-point increase in the portfolio -- in the loan portfolio. And when you look at the securities portfolio, it was impacted by about $1.5 million from the change in the Federal Reserve Bank dividend policy. Previously, that was a 6% on Fed stock, and it's come down to the 10-year treasury. So on a linked-quarter basis, that won't be there next quarter. The good news is the stabilization of loan spreads and the fact that the new business that went on in the quarter was higher than the originated loan yield. So that bodes well going forward."

What we said last quarter was the rationale for increasing the size of the book was, we were getting concerned about the domestic economy and where interest rates could possibly go. So we put a little bit more leverage on. We did that, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. From a security selection makeup of the portfolio, there's really nothing that's changed. We run a very conservative fixed income portfolio from the perspective that there's -- the mortgage-backed securities are all 10- or 15-year mortgages rather than 30.

And we've had a substantial residential mortgage home equity business a long time in the franchise. But as we grew in to Eastern Massachusetts and into New York, we were underrepresented, right. We didn't have the people on the ground to basically generate to build the business. And we've been building that team. I think we referenced that probably a year ago, in particular, when we brought on a new mortgage sales manager. And that is beginning to bear fruit and some of the growth that we're experiencing. So I think on the ground, that's the most important thing. I'll just remind everybody, we do certify mortgage folks in the branches in our company. So we do generate mortgages through our branch personnel. And that's the differentiator. And we also have a wholesale operation. So in the combination of that, I think, gives us the right level of business flow across the footprint, and there's opportunity to keep improving that with the personnel on the ground. We looked at the year and thought that we would see -- when we saw with the mortgage bankers, sat in front of many people, expected a slower market. And we did expect some slowing, but offset by the efforts that I just described in terms of building the business. So right now, we're seeing a decent flow of purchase activity and the recent rate changes have driven some refis again. So our pipeline is as high as it's been in recent times."

So I think I'll start with kind of things that have good momentum and that we certainly believe are going to move us -- have moved us forward. So kind of loans that have been booked in the last several quarters, including this one and where we see pipeline strong. And that would be Boston; certainly, in New York; and particularly, on Long Island. Our personnel there are doing a great job across C&I. And commercial real estate and those pipelines look very good. Our equipment finance unit, particularly BCLC, is having a very -- had a good quarter and has got a very good full pipeline. ABL pipeline is good, less volume in the first quarter, but a lot of activity. And I think Connecticut was actually down in the pre-portfolio in this quarter, but has been pretty steady. We have a lot of long-term relationships there, and we get a lot of repeat business from those customers. Then on the C&I side, Connecticut was okay in the quarter, but we had a couple of payoffs that hurt our balances. They -- that came from, actually, companies being acquired and the acquirer just paying off our credit. So I really think -- again, I'll go back to where I -- where that comment came from. It is a mix. It always is, right. Depending on geography and business line. It definitely cycles as activity comes through the process."

Well, in aggregate, as we said, the new business that came on in the quarter was higher than the originated portfolio. When we look at spreads of new business relative to the existing portfolio, individually, the C&I -- if you look at our major portfolios, C&I is additive at this point, primarily reflected by the Fed move last quarter and one-month LIBOR moving up. That's mostly a floating rate portfolio. Same thing would be for our HELOC portfolio. The -- we're still not additive with the longer-term fixed-rate loans that are more susceptible to the shape of the yield curve. So commercial real estate is still not additive. Equipment financing is slightly negative as well at this point. ABL would be additive because, again, it's a LIBOR-based portfolio. So hopefully, that's helpful."

So that's really just the volume issue. When you think about our asset sensitivity, there's really -- there's 2 components, and that's why we talk about yield curve twist and show the slide. So we try to show investors what the short-end impacts are to us as well as long end. And with what happened in -- from mid-December or just in the last 2 quarters, if you will, is we had benefit from rising short rates, Fed funds and LIBOR. But some of that benefit was given back as the yield curve flattened. So when we look at the balance of the year, those 2 components will still come into play as well as volume."

Good morning. Appreciate everyone joining us today. Turning to the overview of the first quarter on Slide 2. Our performance this quarter reflects our continued focus on further improving profitability while moving the company forward",357,"Thank you, Andrew. Good morning. Appreciate everyone joining us today. 
Turning to the overview of the first quarter on Slide 2. Our performance this quarter reflects our continued focus on further improving profitability while moving the company forward with a long-term view. Net income of $63 million or $0.21 per share represents a 6% increase from the prior year quarter or 5% increase on a per share basis. On a linked-quarter basis, net income was down from $71 million or $0.23 per share. However, as a reminder, fourth quarter net income included a net after-tax gain of $6 million or $0.02 per share, resulting from the sale of the company's payroll services business. Revenues increased 2% from the prior-year quarter and were essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis when adjusted for the gains on sale of the payroll business. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth and higher average balances in the securities portfolio, while noninterest income was negatively impacted primarily by lower bank service charges and commercial banking lending fees. 
Total expenses were generally consistent on both at linked-quarter basis and compared to the prior-year quarter. As we have discussed before, we remain committed to our proactive expense management approach to tightly control costs while investing in revenue-producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance. Period-end loans grew for the 22nd consecutive quarter, although the 1% annualized growth rate is a slower pace than in recent periods, as the first quarter is typically a seasonally slower period for loan growth. Residential mortgage results remained strong, with growth of 11% annualized, while commercial loan balances were slightly lower from year-end. However, on a quarterly average basis, commercial loans grew more than 4% annualized. Given deposits are a large component of profitability and integral part of customer relationships, we are pleased with our continued success growing deposits, as evidenced by the 11% annualized growth in organic deposits since year-end. As we maintain emphasis on franchise wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, we should continue to see further broad-based growth. 
With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter in more detail."

On Slide 3, we provide the detail behind the linked-quarter increase and net interest income for the fourth quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth as well as our decision to increase the size of the securitie",1267,"Thank you, Jack. 
On Slide 3, we provide the detail behind the linked-quarter increase and net interest income for the fourth quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth as well as our decision to increase the size of the securities portfolio in recent periods, in light of the prolonged low interest rate environment. Even with this increase, the securities portfolio, as a percentage of total assets, remains low relative to peers at 17%. These benefits to net interest income were partially offset by an increase in borrowing costs and the impact of one less calendar day in the first quarter. 
On Slide 4, we display the drivers behind the decline in net interest margin of 4 basis points from the fourth quarter to 283. New loan volume favorably impacted the margin by 3 basis points, as new business yields were higher than the total loan portfolio yield. One less calendar day in the first quarter, a lower securities portfolio yield, and higher borrowing costs each negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points. The lower securities portfolio yield was driven in large part by a reduction in the dividend rate paid on Federal Reserve Bank stock. 
Turning to Slide 5. The loan portfolio grew $100 million or 1% annualized from the fourth quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $132 million. Retail contributed $133 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by strong residential mortgage growth of $154 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio decreased $1 million from the fourth quarter. Commercial real estate and equipment financing contributed total originated growth of $27 million and $5 million, respectively, while C&I originated balances declined by $33 million. Within C&I, the mortgage warehouse quarter end balance was $965 million, up $2 million from year-end. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $32 million this quarter compared to $45 million in the fourth quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $764 million. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the fourth quarter. Total deposits increased $688 million or 10% on an annualized basis. We reduced brokered deposits by $33 million during the quarter. Therefore, organic deposit growth was $721 million or 11% annualized. Commercial and retail grew deposits by $494 million and $194 million, respectively. In commercial, the seasonality of our municipal business had a favorable impact on deposits of $333 million during the first quarter. Just as a reminder, the first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposit growth. It is also worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 98% at March 31, and our costs of deposits were consistent with the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 7, we take a closer look at noninterest income, which declined $2 million or 2% compared to the fourth quarter when adjusting for the $9.2 million gain on the sale of the payroll services business. Insurance revenues increased noninterest income by $1.8 million, primarily due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals. In addition, lower bank service charges and volume-related commercial banking lending fees negatively impacted noninterest income by $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Total expenses of $217.3 million were flat with the fourth quarter, but better than the first quarter expectations we set forth at year-end. Included in fourth quarter total expenses was $2.5 million of write-downs of banking house assets related to lease buyouts of previously closed branches. We did not have any write-downs of banking house assets in the first quarter, despite the closure of one branch. Total expenses in the first quarter were impacted by higher compensation and benefits, which increased $2.1 million from the fourth quarter as a result of traditionally higher first quarter payroll-related and benefit costs. In addition, expenses related to regulatory assessments and occupancy and equipment were up $900,000 and $500,000, respectively. The primary offset to these increases was a $500,000 improvement in costs pertaining to outside and professional services. As you will recall, on our conference call in January, we guided the first quarter expenses of approximately $222 million. Actual first quarter results were better than expectations due to lower costs related to volume-driven incentives, health care as well as seasonal expenses, given the mild winter in the Northeast. 
The next slide displays our efficiency ratio over recent quarters. As you are aware, beginning with the results this quarter, we are no longer classifying expenses related to ordinary and reoccurring branch closures in severances nonoperating. In prior periods, these expenses were excluded from our efficiency ratio calculation. For comparability purposes, we have included on this slide what the metric would have been in prior periods with the inclusion of these expenses. While the efficiency ratio is higher due to the reporting change, overall trends are generally consistent. Continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important focus of the company. 
Slide 10 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 68 basis points remain below our peer group and top 50 banks, and have improved from 80 basis points in the first quarter of 2015. As you may have noticed in our recently filed proxy statement, we have adjusted the composition of our peer group for 2016 to account for significant changes in the competitive landscape among financial institutions, including completed or recently announced acquisitions. For a list of companies in our revised peer group, please see Page 17 of the presentation. Net charge-offs for the quarter remains at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years. 
As shown on Slide 11, return on average assets decreased from recent quarters and continue to be impacted by the interest rate environment. Our return on average tangible equity was 9.4% for the first quarter, a decrease of 130 basis points on a linked-quarter basis, but an improvement of 20 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. As we continue to focus on improving profitability, we expect to see progress in this metric over time. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continued to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. The tangible equity ratio improved 10 basis points from year-end to 730, primarily as a result of an improvement in the fair value of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Capital ratios at the bank also improved from year-end due to an equity contribution from the holding company in order to create a more cost-effective capital structure. 
Finally, on Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes as well as yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset-sensitive and well positioned for rising interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel rate shock scenario. Our short-end asset sensitivity is slightly lower than at year-end, and as long end rates came down in the first quarter, we became more susceptible to lower long end rates, as evidenced by the down 100-basis-point yield curve twist scenario. 
Now with that, I'll pass it back to Jack to wrap up."

In recent months, we have brought on board 2 key leaders who will enhance our revenue generation capabilities. Mark Melchione joined us from M&T to head up the bank's New York commercial real estate group and brings more than 25 years of experience. Mark and his team will continue to strengthen and expand our lending and deposit gathering activities in the Greater New York metro market, while maintaining the conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that is the hallmark of People's United. Additionally, Mark Herron joined us from BB&T to become our new Chief Marketing Officer. He brings more than 30 years of experience to the position. Mark will be leading all of our marketing efforts, including branding, advertising, product development, and digital marketing. Additionally, he will be working closely with our business lines to enhance sales force effectiveness and drive increased revenues to the bank. 
Finally, we are pleased to announce the board voted to raise the dividend to an annual rate of $0.68 per share. This marks the 23rd consecutive year the dividend has been increased, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering value to our shareholders through the consistent return of capitals.

When I think about the margin, two things are probably important to mention. The first was the pace of securities. The growth in securities will most likely moderate over the balance of the year. We've seen growth in the last 3 quarters and that pace will slow down. Secondly, our margin was impacted by a little over 2 basis points because of the reduced volume of loans. Had we met our loan growth expectations for the quarter, you would've seen the margin come in at 285 or so. And you had mentioned asset sensitivity. So what -- we benefited from the increase in LIBOR, which occurred prior to the Fed increase in the fourth quarter, but also, we gave back some of that as the yield curve flattened in the first quarter. So when we think about the margin over the balance of the year, the level of short-term rates as well as the steepness of the yield curve will push our margin either way a few basis points as the year unfolds."

At this point, the probability of that rate hike has probably been pushed out to the end of the year by the market. But it's too early to tell, from our perspective. So we're -- no change to guidance. However, that original guidance did have that rate increase baked in. We -- what we mentioned in the prepared remarks was the fact that, and you saw in the press release, we had 1-basis-point increase in the portfolio -- in the loan portfolio. And when you look at the securities portfolio, it was impacted by about $1.5 million from the change in the Federal Reserve Bank dividend policy. Previously, that was a 6% on Fed stock, and it's come down to the 10-year treasury. So on a linked-quarter basis, that won't be there next quarter. The good news is the stabilization of loan spreads and the fact that the new business that went on in the quarter was higher than the originated loan yield. So that bodes well going forward."

What we said last quarter was the rationale for increasing the size of the book was, we were getting concerned about the domestic economy and where interest rates could possibly go. So we put a little bit more leverage on. We did that, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. From a security selection makeup of the portfolio, there's really nothing that's changed. We run a very conservative fixed income portfolio from the perspective that there's -- the mortgage-backed securities are all 10- or 15-year mortgages rather than 30. We give up some yield for that, but we have more defined cash flows. We do have a municipal portfolio that we run very high.

I think the way to look at us from that way is, first, to think about the franchise and the growth that we've experienced and the opportunity created. And we've had a substantial residential mortgage home equity business a long time in the franchise. But as we grew into Eastern Massachusetts and into New York, we were underrepresented, right. We didn't have the people on the ground to basically generate to build the business. And we've been building that team. I think we referenced that probably a year ago, in particular, when we brought on a new mortgage sales manager. And that is beginning to bear fruit and some of the growth that we're experiencing. So I think on the ground, that's the most important thing. I'll just remind everybody, we do certify mortgage folks in the branches in our company. So we do generate mortgages through our branch personnel. And that's the differentiator. And we also have a wholesale operation. So the combination of that, I think, gives us the right level of business flow across the footprint, and there's opportunity to keep improving that with the personnel on the ground. We looked at the year and thought that we would see -- when we saw what the mortgage bankers said, and the Freddie and Fannie people expected a slower market. And we did expect some slowing, but offset by the efforts that I just described in terms of building the business. So right now, we're seeing a decent flow of purchase activity and the recent rate changes have driven some refis again. So our pipeline is as high as it's been in recent times."

Our personnel there are doing a great job across C&I, and commercial real estate and those pipelines look very good. Our equipment finance unit, particularly BCLC, is having a very -- had a good quarter and has got a very good full pipeline. ABL pipeline is good, less volume in the first quarter, but a lot of activity. And I think Connecticut was actually down in the pre-portfolio in this quarter, but has been pretty steady. We have a lot of long-term relationships there, and we get a lot of repeat business from those customers. Then on the C&I side, Connecticut was okay in the quarter, but we had a couple of payoffs that hurt our balances. They -- that came from, actually, companies being acquired and the acquirer just paying off our credit. So I really think -- again, I'll go back to where I -- where that comment came from. It is a mix; it always is, right. Depending on geography and business line, it definitely cycles as activity comes through the process."

When we look at spreads of new business relative to the existing portfolio, individually, the C&I -- if you look at our major portfolios, C&I is additive at this point, primarily reflected by the Fed move last quarter and one-month LIBOR moving up. That's mostly a floating rate portfolio. Same thing would be for our HELOC portfolio. The -- we're still not additive with the longer-term fixed-rate loans that are more susceptible to the shape of the yield curve. So commercial real estate is still not additive. Equipment financing is slightly negative as well at this point. ABL would be additive because, again, it's a LIBOR-based portfolio. So hopefully, that's helpful."

Turning to the overview on the second quarter on Slide 2. We are pleased with the company's second quarter performance. Net income of $68.5 million or $0.23 per share represents increases in net income of 11% from the prior year quarter and 9% from the first quarter. The results this quarter reflect our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Revenues increased 4% from the prior year quarter, driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income, while growth of 1% from the first quarter reflected higher noninterest income. Total expenses increased modestly from a year ago, but declined on a linked-quarter basis as expected. As a result of our revenue growth and the ability to control costs, the efficiency ratio for the quarter is 60.4%, which represents improvements of 120 basis points from the prior year quarter and 230 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Loan production rebounded in the second quarter as the portfolio experienced annualized growth of more than 7%, particularly strong results in commercial and industrial lending as well as residential mortgage. This marks our 23rd consecutive quarter of loan growth. While deposit balances ended the quarter modestly lower due to seasonal declines in our retail and municipal businesses, franchise-wide cross-sell and commercial deposit gathering assets continue to be successful. Excluding municipal deposits, commercial deposit balances grew more than 16% during the quarter on an annualized basis. 
Before passing the call to David to go over the second quarter in more detail, I want to just to take a moment to talk about our announced acquisitions of Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher, which are 2 more successful steps in executing our strategy of growing and strengthening People's United in the New York Metro area. The acquisition of Suffolk is an excellent strategic and cultural fit and complements our previous acquisitions and organic growth in the market. Their impressive Long Island footprint, particularly on the island's eastern end where we currently do not have a presence, further bolsters our franchise in this very attractive banking market. Suffolk provides proven loan origination capabilities as well as a unique low-cost core deposit base, which very few banks possess. The transaction offers revenue synergies that present a substantial upside opportunities, which were not modeled into the economics of the deal. We are excited about both extending our full suite of products and services and utilizing our larger balance sheet to provide more comprehensive solutions to Suffolk's customer base. Compelling cost savings also exist as we have identified achievable reductions that amount to 15% of Suffolk's standalone expenses. Further, our complementary business models, shared commitment to relationship banking and conservative risk management philosophies will ease the integration and deliver value to both customers and shareholders. In the week since the acquisition announcement, we have started integration activities and spent more time with the Suffolk team. As a result, we feel even better about the consideration given and the expected benefits of this transaction. Following our acquisitions of the Bank of Smithtown in 2010 and 57 branches from RBS Citizens in 2012, People's United has been well received in the New York metro market. Since the end of the first quarter of 2010, our New York franchise has experienced organic compound annual loan and deposit growth of 35% and 28%, respectively. Today, we have $4.9 billion of loans in New York and $3.5 billion of deposits. All of this progress gives us confidence in our ability to successfully build upon the additional presence the Suffolk transaction provides us in the New York Metro market. 
Today's announcement of an all cash transaction for Gerstein Fisher, a $3 billion investment management firm, is our most significant wealth management acquisition to date and is expected to bring our total assets under administration to nearly $20 billion, of which $8 billion is under discretionary management. The firm's well known quantitative investment approach and scalable technology platform will complement our excellent range of investment solutions as well as enhance our brand in the wealth management marketplace. Gerstein Fisher's strong track record of growth and presence in New York will enable us to leverage our banking products and services with their clients. This transaction complements recent investments in our fee-based businesses and will further diversify revenues through additional noninterest income. 
An exciting and invaluable aspect of each transaction is that the accomplished leaders of these firms will join People's United in critical leadership roles. Howard Bloomer, Suffolk's President and CEO, will assume the role of New York Market President of People's United. Howard's deep roots in the region, understanding of the local economy and proven track record for growth will further our momentum in this important market. Greg Fisher, Gerstein Fisher's Founder and CIO, will join People's United as Head of Quantitative Research and Portfolio Strategy. Greg's highly respected expertise in the investment management as well as his commitment to innovation and research will strengthen our wealth management capabilities, enabling us to further deepen existing client relationships and forge new ones. 
With that, I'll pass it to David."

Turning to Slide 3, you can see net interest income was flat with the first quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from ongoing loan growth.

Turning to Slide 3, you can see net interest income was flat with the first quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from ongoing loan growth. This benefit to net interest income was offset by a $1.1 million decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired portfolio as well as $400,000 in higher borrowing costs. 
On Slide 4, net interest margin of $279 million was 4 basis points lower than the first quarter. New loan volumes negatively impacted margin by 3 basis points as new business yields were lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield reduced the margin by 1 basis point. 
Moving to Slide 5. The loan portfolio grew $527 million or 7% annualized from the first quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $600 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $413 million from the first quarter, driven primarily by $372 million of C&I growth. Equipment financing and commercial real estate contributed growth of $30 million and $11 million, respectively. Within C&I, we experienced strength across several categories, including middle-market C&I, asset-based lending and most notably, in mortgage warehouse lending. The end of period balance for mortgage warehouse reached $1.2 billion, up $217 million from March 31. Retail contributed $187 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $199 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $73 million this quarter, the largest amount since the first quarter of 2015 and it was primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $692 million. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the first quarter. Commercial balances continued to benefit from franchise-wide deposit gathering efforts and grew $102 million or 4% annualized. Retail balances, in line with historical second quarter trends, declined $208 million or 4% annualized. As a result, total deposits declined $106 million or 1% on an annualized basis. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business negatively impacted quarter end deposits by $200 million. Excluding municipals, total deposits experienced annualized growth in the second quarter of 1%, while commercial deposits grew more than 16% annualized. We expect municipal balances to rebound in the third quarter, in line with historical seasonal trends. It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits remained at 35 basis points for the third consecutive quarter. 
On Slide 7, we look at noninterest income, which increased $3.1 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Higher noninterest income benefited from several categories, including: increases of $1.1 million in commercial bank lending fees; $1 million in bank owned life insurance; and $900,000 in bank service charges. The $1.5 million increase in other was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of an interest in a real estate investment. The primary offset to these increases was a $2.3 million decrease in insurance revenues, largely due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Total expenses of $213 million decreased 2% from the first quarter. As expected, compensation and benefits decreased $2.7 million, resulting from lower payroll-related and benefit costs, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter. In addition, professional and outside service costs were $1 million lower in the quarter. The largest offset to these improvements was $1.2 million in higher regulatory assessments. As you will recall, the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited from credits received for overpayment of FDIC assessments made in prior quarters. As we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel, we closed 6 branches during the quarter. From the beginning of 2011, we have closed 61 branches, of which the majority were traditional branches. During the same time frame, we have opened 26 branches, most of which are more cost-efficient in-store locations. 
On Slide 9, you can see our efficiency ratio in the second quarter of 60.4%, improved 230 basis points from the first quarter, and 120 basis points from a year ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. 
Slide 10 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 64 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks, and has improved from recent quarters. Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy remains a hallmark of People's United. We continue to build the business for the long-term and will not sacrifice credit quality to achieve growth. 
As shown on Slide 11, return on average assets increased 5 basis points on a linked-quarter basis points and 3 basis points from the prior year quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. Our return on tangible equity was 10.1% for the second quarter, an increase from 9.4% in the first quarter and 9.5% in the prior year quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. As previously discussed, we plan on issuing $200 million to $250 million of preferred's this year, enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing on our already strong capital position. While all of our regulatory ratios are well above internal long-term operating targets, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points and support continued growth. 
On Slide 13, we display our interest rate profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive and well-positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel rate shock as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. At quarter end, over 43% of the loan portfolio was either one-month LIBOR or prime based compared to 42% at March 31 and 41% a year ago. Sustained lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning as evidenced by our long end down scenario on this slide. Therefore, we have begun to reinvest monthly security portfolio cash flows into treasury and municipal securities rather than mortgage-backed securities to mitigate prepayment risk to lower rates. This is a modest change in portfolio strategy, but one that will decrease downside risk if rates were to again move lower. 
Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I want to draw your attention to Slide 14, as we have provided an update to the full year 2016 goals we outlined in January. We have lowered our loan growth range from 6% to 8% to a range of 4% to 6%. Subsequent announcing the original goal, we decided to reduce the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio to focus our resources on full-service relationships. This approach is consistent with other geographic markets of our commercial real estate business. During this transition, the legacy New York multi-family portfolio has run off at a faster rate than new business has been originated. However, as mentioned on our call in April, new leadership and talent has been added to our New York pre-group and we are excited about their abilities to further expand and strengthen our lending activities in the Greater New York metro market. It is important to note, excluding the New York multi-family business, the rest of our loan portfolio is performing in line with our original goals. The next goal we are updating is net interest income. In addition to our revised loan growth goal, current interest rates, along with ongoing global economic uncertainties impacting rates are different than what was expected 6 months ago. As such, we have lowered the net interest income growth range from 7% to 9% to a range of 5% to 7%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 275 to 285. This is lower than the original range of 285 to 295, which included an assumption of 125 basis point interest rate increase in mid-2016 and a steeper yield curve. This updated net interest margin range is derived from many different factors. Two of the most significant are an assumption of no Fed interest rate increases during 2016 and a continuation of the current flat yield curve environment. We are also lowering our total expense range of $865 million to $885 million to a range of $860 million to $870 million, which excludes any merger related costs associated with recently announced acquisitions. As a result of our continued execution of strong cost controls, we have effectively managed expenses while continuing to make investments in revenue producing initiatives in the franchise. The net effect of these changes does not impact our original full year expectations with respect to earnings. Finally, it is important to note that full year goals for deposit growth, noninterest income, credit and capital are unchanged. 
With that, I'd like to pass it back to Jack for closing remarks."

The ability to consistently return capital to our shareholders is a key part of our business model and illustrates the success we have had in maintaining asset quality while growing the balance sheet. We have demonstrated this commitment by increasing our annual dividend for 23 consecutive years. The board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact it has on the valuation of the company's shares. As a result, one of our most important objectives is protecting the dividend as the company grows in size. Therefore, it is important for both current and prospective shareholders to know, we will not move the company pass the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend. As such, we will continue to reduce our dividend payout ratio by growing earnings and working with our regulators as we thoughtfully grow the franchise. While the Suffolk acquisition is strategically important transaction, it is relatively small at 5% of our asset size. Since integration is a core competency of People's United, this transaction does not preclude us from exploring other acquisitions. With pro forma assets of $42 billion, we are mindful of the $50 billion asset threshold and the potential implications of crossing it. However, we will continue to be opportunistic in regards to acquisitions, including those that would take us over the $50 billion level. We will only execute a larger transaction that would allow us to preserve our dividend. As we have discussed in the past, we have been building our readiness to cross the $50 billion threshold for the past couple of years through an internal project known as B50B. The project involves a formation of a cross functional readiness review teams that have completed gap analysis on each of the requirements that will be imposed on us when crossing $50 billion. Accordingly, based on these announcements, we continue to build out modeling, data management and staff capabilities. In recent years, we have already made investments to enhance our corporate infrastructure in areas such as enterprise risk management, model development and validation, internal audit, compliance, operational risk and BFA AML. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual one-time costs. 
In closing, the company has had a very solid quarter as we continue to successfully execute in the marketplace to find solutions and value for our customers as well as build the franchise for the long-term.

The other thing that is probably less apparent is that we have elevated and enhanced our risk management process around CRE over the last number of years and have really been operating with enhanced due diligence processes, well-established and in our run rate around the portfolio. So we feel very confident about moving forward in commercial real estate lending and going above the  $300 million level and we've demonstrated our ability to manage that risk. Given the diversification of our business lines and the portfolios, I don't expect that we'll go too far above the $300 million level in the immediate -- intermediate, I guess, I'd say, future. But it wouldn't be a concern for us to go above $300 million. And we like the balance and diversification, so we'll continue to move everything forward. I really am very optimistic about the talent and the folks that we brought in to New York and we're looking forward.

We've talked to our regulators about this issue and have a very good line of communication. I'd also point everybody to what's happening through the CCAR process, right? Many, many People's dividend payout ratios are coming up. I think the high mark this time around is 40% payout. We know there's discussion about deals out there that might be approved at 50%.

There's a lot of factors in it, Matt, as you know. The shape of the yield curve from our perspective as well as the volume in mix of loan production are the 2 key drivers. The yield curve has remained flat, but what is interesting is that the gap down in interest rates that we saw post-Brexit is completely reversed already. The -- so -- and then in the second quarter, what I didn't say in my prepared remarks was, we did quite a bit more of LIBOR-based production in the quarter. And so the mix has an impact. Our spread actually widened a little bit, but the new business yield went down not because of spreads, but because of mix. So the way I would think about it is, we had -- if you look year-over-year, the margin was down about 9 basis points in the year, but in a year that really had some dramatic changes, both in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. So there is more pressure -- there's more forces that are bringing the margin down than bringing the margin up today and I think that will be in place through the balance of this year. It's too early to call 2017 at this point."

Turning to the overview on the second quarter on Slide 2. We are pleased with the company's second quarter performance. Net income of $68.5 million or $0.23 per share represents increases in net income of 11% from the prior year quarter and 9% from the first quarter. The results this quarter reflect our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Revenues increased 4% from the prior year quarter, driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income, while growth of 1% from the first quarter reflected higher noninterest income. Total expenses increased modestly from a year ago, but declined on a linked-quarter basis as expected. As a result of our revenue growth and the ability to control costs, the efficiency ratio for the quarter is 60.4%, which represents improvements of 120 basis points from the prior year quarter and 230 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Loan production rebounded in the second quarter, as the portfolio experienced annualized growth of more than 7%, with particularly strong results in commercial and industrial lending as well as residential mortgage. This marks our 23rd consecutive quarter of loan growth. While deposit balances ended the quarter modestly lower due to seasonal declines in our retail and municipal businesses, franchise-wide cross-sell and commercial deposit gathering assets continue to be successful. Excluding municipal deposits, commercial deposit balances grew more than 16% during the quarter on an annualized basis.
Before passing the call to David to go over the second quarter in more detail, I want to just to take a moment to talk about our announced acquisitions of Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher, which are 2 more successful steps in executing our strategy of growing and strengthening People's United in the New York Metro area. The acquisition of Suffolk is an excellent strategic and cultural fit and complements our previous acquisitions and organic growth in the market. Their impressive Long Island footprint, particularly on the island's eastern end where we currently do not have a presence, further bolsters our franchise in this very attractive banking market. Suffolk provides proven loan origination capabilities as well as a unique low-cost core deposit base, which very few banks possess. The transaction offers revenue synergies that present a substantial upside opportunities, which were not modeled into the economics of the deal. We are excited about both extending our full suite of products and services and utilizing our larger balance sheet to provide more comprehensive solutions to Suffolk's customer base. Compelling cost savings also exist as we have identified achievable reductions that amount to 15% of Suffolk's standalone expenses. Further, our complementary business models, shared commitment to relationship banking and conservative risk management philosophies will ease the integration and deliver value to both customers and shareholders. In the week since the acquisition announcement, we have started integration activities and spent more time with the Suffolk team. As a result, we feel even better about the consideration given and the expected benefits of this transaction. Following our acquisitions of the Bank of Smithtown in 2010 and 57 branches from RBS Citizens in 2012, People's United has been well received in the New York metro market. Since the end of the first quarter of 2010, our New York franchise has experienced organic compound annual loan and deposit growth of 35% and 28%, respectively. Today, we have $4.9 billion of loans in New York and $3.5 billion of deposits. All of this progress gives us confidence in our ability to successfully build upon the additional presence the Suffolk transaction provides us in the New York Metro market.
Today's announcement of an all-cash transaction for Gerstein Fisher, a $3 billion investment management firm, is our most significant wealth management acquisition to date and is expected to bring our total assets under administration to nearly $20 billion, of which $8 billion is under discretionary management. The firm's well-known quantitative investment approach and scalable technology platform will complement our excellent range of investment solutions as well as enhance our brand in the wealth management marketplace. Gerstein Fisher's strong track record of growth and presence in New York will enable us to leverage our banking products and services with their clients. This transaction complements recent investments in our fee-based businesses and will further diversify revenues through additional noninterest income.
An exciting and invaluable aspect of each transaction is that the accomplished leaders of these firms will join People's United in critical leadership roles. Howard Bloomer, Suffolk's President and CEO, will assume the role of New York Market President of People's United. Howard's deep roots in the region, understanding of the local economy and proven track record for growth will further our momentum in this important market. Gregg Fisher, Gerstein Fisher's Founder and CIO, will join People's United as Head of Quantitative Research and Portfolio Strategy. Gregg's highly respected expertise in the investment management as well as his commitment to innovation and research will strengthen our wealth management capabilities, enabling us to further deepen existing client relationships and forge new ones.
With that, I'll pass it to David."

Turning to Slide 3, you can see net interest income was flat with the first quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from ongoing loan growth. This benefit to net interest income was offset by a $1.1 million decline in accretion from runoffs in the acquired portfolio as well as $400,000 in higher borrowing costs.
On Slide 4, net interest margin of 2.79% was 4 basis points lower than the first quarter. New loan volumes negatively impacted margin by 3 basis points, as new business yields were lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield reduced the margin by 1 basis point.
Moving to Slide 5. The loan portfolio grew $527 million or 7% annualized from the first quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $600 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $413 million from the first quarter, driven primarily by $372 million of C&I growth. Equipment financing and commercial real estate contributed growth of $30 million and $11 million, respectively. Within C&I, we experienced strength across several categories, including middle-market C&I, asset-based lending, and most notably, in mortgage warehouse lending. The end of period balance for mortgage warehouse reached $1.2 billion, up $217 million from March 31. Retail contributed $187 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $199 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $73 million this quarter, the largest announced since the first quarter of 2015, and it was primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $692 million.
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the first quarter. Commercial balances continued to benefit from franchise-wide deposit gathering efforts and grew $102 million or 4% annualized. Retail balances, in line with historical second quarter trends, declined $208 million or 4% annualized. As a result, total deposits declined $106 million or 1% on an annualized basis. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business negatively impacted quarter end deposits by $200 million. Excluding municipals, total deposits experienced annualized growth in the second quarter of 1%, while commercial deposits grew more than 16% annualized. We expect municipal balances to rebound in the third quarter, in line with historical seasonal trends. It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits remained at 35 basis points for the third consecutive quarter.
On Slide 7, we look at noninterest income, which increased $3.1 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Higher noninterest income benefited from several categories, including increases of $1.1 million in commercial bank lending fees, $1 million in bank-owned life insurance and $900,000 in bank service charges. The $1.5 million increase in Other was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of an interest in a real estate investment. The primary offset to these increases was a $2.3 million decrease in insurance revenues, largely due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Total expenses of $213 million decreased 2% from the first quarter. As expected, compensation and benefits decreased $2.7 million, resulting from lower payroll-related and benefit costs, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter. In addition, professional and outside service costs were $1 million lower in the quarter. The largest offset to these improvements was $1.2 million in higher regulatory assessments. As you will recall, the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited from credits received for overpayment of FDIC assessments made in prior quarters. As we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel, we closed 6 branches during the quarter. From the beginning of 2011, we have closed 61 branches, of which the majority were traditional branches. During the same time frame, we have opened 26 branches, most of which are more cost-efficient in-store locations.
On Slide 9, you can see our efficiency ratio in the second quarter of 60.4%, improved 230 basis points from the first quarter, and 120 basis points from a year ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management.
Slide 10 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 64 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks, and has improved from recent quarters. Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy remains a hallmark of People's United. We continue to build the business for the long term and will not sacrifice credit quality to achieve growth.
As shown on Slide 11, return on average assets increased 5 basis points on a linked-quarter basis points and 3 basis points from the prior year quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the low-interest rate environment. Our return on average tangible equity was 10.1% for the second quarter, an increase from 9.4% in the first quarter and 9.5% in the prior year quarter.
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. As previously discussed, we plan on issuing $200 million to $250 million of preferreds this year, enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing our already strong capital position. While all of our regulatory ratios are well above internal long-term operating targets, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points and support continued growth.
On Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive and well positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel rate shock as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. At quarter end, over 43% of the loan portfolio was either one-month LIBOR or prime based compared to 42% at March 31 and 41% a year ago. Sustained lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning, as evidenced by our long-end-down scenario on this slide. Therefore, we have begun to reinvest monthly security portfolio cash flows into treasury and municipal securities rather than mortgage-backed securities to mitigate prepayment risk to lower rates. This is a modest change in portfolio strategy, but one that will decrease downside risk if rates were to again move lower.
Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I want to draw your attention to Slide 14, as we have provided an update to the full year 2016 goals we outlined in January. We have lowered our loan growth range from 6% to 8% to a range of 4% to 6%. Subsequent to announcing the original goal, we decided to reduce the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio to focus our resources on full-service relationships. This approach is consistent with other geographic markets of our commercial real estate business. During this transition, the legacy New York multi-family portfolio has run off at a faster rate than new business has been originated. However, as mentioned on our call in April, new leadership and talent has been added to our New York pre-group, and we are excited about their abilities to further expand and strengthen our lending activities in the Greater New York metro market. It is important to note, excluding the New York multi-family business, the rest of our loan portfolio is performing in line with our original goals.
The next goal we are updating is net interest income. In addition to our revised loan growth goal, current interest rates, along with ongoing global economic uncertainties impacting rates are different than what was expected 6 months ago. As such, we have lowered the net interest income growth range from 7% to 9% to a range of 5% to 7%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.75% to 2.85%. This is lower than the original range of 2.85% to 2.95%, which included an assumption of 125 basis point interest rate increase in mid-2016 and a steeper yield curve. This updated net interest margin range is derived from many different factors. Two of the most significant are an assumption of no Fed interest rate increases during 2016 and a continuation of the current flat yield curve environment. We are also lowering our total expense range of $865 million to $885 million to a range of $860 million to $870 million, which excludes any merger-related costs associated with recently announced acquisitions. As a result of our continued execution of strong cost controls, we have effectively managed expenses while continuing to make investments in revenue producing initiatives in the franchise. The net effect of these changes does not impact our original full year expectations with respect to earnings. Finally, it is important to note that full year goals for deposit growth, noninterest income, credit and capital are unchanged.
With that, I'd like to pass it back to Jack for closing remarks."

We have demonstrated this commitmen",437,"Thank you, David.
The ability to consistently return capital to our shareholders is a key part of our business model and illustrates the success we have had in maintaining asset quality while growing the balance sheet. We have demonstrated this commitment by increasing our annual dividend for 23 consecutive years. The board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact it has on the valuation of the company's shares. As a result, one of our most important objectives is protecting the dividend as the company grows in size. Therefore, it is important for both current and prospective shareholders to know, we will not move the company pass the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend. As such, we will continue to reduce our dividend payout ratio by growing earnings and working with our regulators as we thoughtfully grow the franchise. While the Suffolk acquisition is strategically important transaction, it is relatively small at 5% of our asset size. Since integration is a core competency of People's United, this transaction does not preclude us from exploring other acquisitions. With pro forma assets of $42 billion, we are mindful of the $50 billion asset threshold and the potential implications of crossing it. However, we will continue to be opportunistic in regards to acquisitions, including those that would take us over the $50 billion level. We will only execute a larger transaction that would allow us to preserve our dividend. As we have discussed in the past, we have been building our readiness to cross the $50 billion threshold for the past couple of years through an internal project known as B50B [ph]. The project involves the formation of a cross-functional readiness review teams that have completed gap analysis on each of the requirements that will be imposed on us when crossing $50 billion. Accordingly, based on these announces, we continue to build out modeling, data management and staff capabilities. In recent years, we have already made investments to enhance our corporate infrastructure in areas such as enterprise risk management, model development and validation, internal audit, compliance, operational risk and BFA AML. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual one-time costs.
In closing, the company has had a very solid quarter as we continue to successfully execute in the marketplace to find solutions and value for our customers as well as build the franchise for the long term.
This concludes our presentation, and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions."

And we have a lot of long-term relationships that we value very much. And as you probably realize, our concentration level is below $300 million. The other thing that is probably less apparent is that we have elevated and enhanced our risk management process around CRE over the last number of years and have really been operating with enhanced due diligence processes, well established and in our run rate around the portfolio. So we feel very confident about moving forward in commercial real estate lending and going above the $300 million level, and we've demonstrated our ability to manage that risk. Given the diversification of our business lines and the portfolios, I don't expect that we'll go too far above the $300 million level in the immediate -- intermediate, I guess, I'd say, future. But it wouldn't be a concern for us to go above $300 million. And we like the balance and diversification, so we'll continue to move everything forward. I really am very optimistic about the talent in the folks that we brought in to New York and we're looking forward. They've got a nice full pipeline, and they've got some great relationships and we expect to do some great business there and build that out. We are, by the way -- just to add one thing.

We continue and have continued to increase our dividend, $0.01 a year. And we continue to -- that is our approach with the dividend. And the board and management is very committed to staying on that path. If you look at our history, we've steadily brought the dividend payout ratio down by improving earnings. We're continuing to build our plans around that. And we're making steady progress and we're going to continue to make steady progress as we move through moving from $40 billion to $50 billion. And we solemnly believe that the actions we're taking will continue to improve profitability. And we've tried to clarify our efforts around being prepared on $50 billion on many fronts. We've talked to our regulators about this issue and have a very good lines of communication. I'd also point everybody to what's happening through the CCAR process, right? Many, many people's dividend payout ratios are coming up. I think the high mark this time around is 40% payout. We know there's discussion about deals out there that might be approved at 50%. So as we continue to bring our payout ratio down over time and the environment changes, we feel that we will successfully navigate from where we are today to the $50 billion mark and continue to maintain our dividend performance."

The yield curve has remained flat, but what is interesting is that the gap down in interest rates that we saw post-Brexit is completely reversed already. The -- so -- and then in the second quarter, what I didn't say in my prepared remarks was, we did quite a bit more of LIBOR-based production in the quarter. And so the mix has an impact. Our spread actually widened a little bit, but the new business yield went down not because of spreads, but because of mix. So the way I would think about it is, we had -- if you look year-over-year, the margin was down about 9 basis points in a year, but in a year that really had some dramatic changes, both in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. So there is more pressure -- there's more forces that are bringing the margin down than bringing the margin up today, and I think that will be in place through for the balance of this year.

Turning to the overview on the second quarter on Slide 2. We are pleased with the company's second quarter performance. Net income of $68.5 million or $0.23 per share represents increases in net income of 11% from the prior year quarter and 9% from the first quarter. The results this quarter reflect our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Revenues increased 4% from the prior year quarter, driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income, while growth of 1% from the first quarter reflected higher noninterest income. Total expenses increased modestly from a year ago, but declined on a linked-quarter basis as expected. As a result of our revenue growth and the ability to control costs, the efficiency ratio for the quarter is 60.4%, which represents improvements of 120 basis points from the prior year quarter and 230 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Loan production rebounded in the second quarter, as the portfolio experienced annualized growth of more than 7%, with particularly strong results in commercial and industrial lending as well as residential mortgage. This marks our 23rd consecutive quarter of loan growth. While deposit balances ended the quarter modestly lower due to seasonal declines in our retail and municipal businesses, franchise-wide cross-sell and commercial deposit gathering assets continue to be successful. Excluding municipal deposits, commercial deposit balances grew more than 16% during the quarter on an annualized basis.
Before passing the call to David to go over the second quarter in more detail, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our announced acquisitions of Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher, which are 2 more successful steps in executing our strategy of growing and strengthening People's United in the New York Metro area. The acquisition of Suffolk is an excellent strategic and cultural fit and complements our previous acquisitions and organic growth in the market. Their impressive Long Island footprint, particularly on the island's eastern end where we currently do not have a presence, further bolsters our franchise in this very attractive banking market. Suffolk provides proven loan origination capabilities as well as a unique low-cost core deposit base, which very few banks possess. The transaction offers revenue synergies that present substantial upside opportunities, which were not modeled into the economics of the deal. We are excited about both extending our full suite of products and services and utilizing our larger balance sheet to provide more comprehensive solutions to Suffolk's customer base. Compelling cost savings also exist as we have identified achievable reductions that amount to 15% of Suffolk's standalone expenses. Further, our complementary business models, shared commitment to relationship banking and conservative risk management philosophies will ease the integration and deliver value to both customers and shareholders. In the weeks since the acquisition announcement, we have started integration activities and spent more time with the Suffolk team. As a result, we feel even better about the consideration given and the expected benefits of this transaction. Following our acquisitions of the Bank of Smithtown in 2010 and 57 branches from RBS Citizens in 2012, People's United has been well received in the New York metro market. Since the end of the first quarter of 2010, our New York franchise has experienced organic compound annual loan and deposit growth of 35% and 28%, respectively. Today, we have $4.9 billion of loans in New York and $3.5 billion of deposits. All of this progress gives us confidence in our ability to successfully build upon the additional presence the Suffolk transaction provides us in the New York Metro market.
Today's announcement of an all-cash transaction for Gerstein Fisher, a $3 billion investment management firm, is our most significant wealth management acquisition to date and is expected to bring our total assets under administration to nearly $20 billion, of which $8 billion is under discretionary management. The firm's well-known quantitative investment approach and scalable technology platform will complement our excellent range of investment solutions as well as enhance our brand in the wealth management marketplace. Gerstein Fisher's strong track record of growth and presence in New York will enable us to leverage our banking products and services with their clients. This transaction complements recent investments in our fee-based businesses and will further diversify revenues through additional noninterest income.
An exciting and invaluable aspect of each transaction is that the accomplished leaders of these firms will join People's United in critical leadership roles. Howard Bluver, Suffolk's President and CEO, will assume the role of New York Market President for People's United. Howard's deep roots in the region, understanding of the local economy and proven track record for growth will further our momentum in this important market. Gregg Fisher, Gerstein Fisher's Founder and CIO, will join People's United as Head of Quantitative Research and Portfolio Strategy. Gregg's highly respected expertise in the investment management as well as his commitment to innovation and research will strengthen our wealth management capabilities, enabling us to further deepen existing client relationships and forge new ones.
With that, I'll pass it to David."

Turning to Slide 3, you can see net interest income was flat with the first quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from ongoing loan growth. This benefit to net interest income was offset by a $1.1 million decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired portfolio as well as $400,000 in higher borrowing costs.
On Slide 4, net interest margin of 2.79% was 4 basis points lower than the first quarter. New loan volumes negatively impacted margin by 3 basis points, as new business yields were lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield reduced the margin by 1 basis point.
Moving to Slide 5. The loan portfolio grew $527 million or 7% annualized from the first quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $600 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $413 million from the first quarter, driven primarily by $372 million of C&I growth. Equipment financing and commercial real estate contributed growth of $30 million and $11 million, respectively. Within C&I, we experienced strength across several categories, including middle-market C&I, asset-based lending, and most notably, in mortgage warehouse lending. The end of period balance for mortgage warehouse reached $1.2 billion, up $217 million from March 31. Retail contributed $187 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $199 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $73 million this quarter, the largest announced since the first quarter of 2015, and it was primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $692 million.
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the first quarter. Commercial balances continued to benefit from franchise-wide deposit gathering efforts and grew $102 million or 4% annualized. Retail balances, in line with historical second quarter trends, declined $208 million or 4% annualized. As a result, total deposits declined $106 million or 1% on an annualized basis. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business negatively impacted quarter end deposits by $200 million. Excluding municipals, total deposits experienced annualized growth in the second quarter of 1%, while commercial deposits grew more than 16% annualized. We expect municipal balances to rebound in the third quarter, in line with historical seasonal trends. It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits remained at 35 basis points for the third consecutive quarter.
On Slide 7, we look at noninterest income, which increased $3.1 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Higher noninterest income benefited from several categories, including increases of $1.1 million in commercial bank lending fees, $1 million in bank-owned life insurance and $900,000 in bank service charges. The $1.5 million increase in Other was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of an interest in a real estate investment. The primary offset to these increases was a $2.3 million decrease in insurance revenues, largely due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Total expenses of $213 million decreased 2% from the first quarter. As expected, compensation and benefits decreased $2.7 million, resulting from lower payroll-related and benefit costs, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter. In addition, professional and outside service costs were $1 million lower in the quarter. The largest offset to these improvements was $1.2 million in higher regulatory assessments. As you will recall, the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited from credits received for overpayment of FDIC assessments made in prior quarters. As we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel, we closed 6 branches during the quarter. From the beginning of 2011, we have closed 61 branches, of which the majority were traditional branches. During the same time frame, we have opened 26 branches, most of which are more cost-efficient in-store locations.
On Slide 9, you can see our efficiency ratio in the second quarter of 60.4%, improved 230 basis points from the first quarter, and 120 basis points from a year ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management.
Slide 10 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 64 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks, and has improved from recent quarters. Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy remains a hallmark of People's United. We continue to build the business for the long term and will not sacrifice credit quality to achieve growth.
As shown on Slide 11, return on average assets increased 5 basis points on a linked-quarter basis points and 3 basis points from the prior year quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the low-interest rate environment. Our return on average tangible equity was 10.1% for the second quarter, an increase from 9.4% in the first quarter and 9.5% in the prior year quarter.
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. As previously discussed, we plan on issuing $200 million to $250 million of preferreds this year, enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing our already strong capital position. While all of our regulatory ratios are well above internal long-term operating targets, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points and support continued growth.
On Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive and well positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel rate shock as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. At quarter end, over 43% of the loan portfolio was either one-month LIBOR or prime based compared to 42% at March 31 and 41% a year ago. Sustained lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning, as evidenced by our long-end-down scenario on this slide. Therefore, we have begun to reinvest monthly security portfolio cash flows into treasury and municipal securities rather than mortgage-backed securities to mitigate prepayment risk to lower rates. This is a modest change in portfolio strategy, but one that will decrease downside risk if rates were to again move lower.
Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I want to draw your attention to Slide 14, as we have provided an update to the full year 2016 goals we outlined in January. We have lowered our loan growth range from 6% to 8% to a range of 4% to 6%. Subsequent to announcing the original goal, we decided to reduce the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio to focus our resources on full-service relationships. This approach is consistent with other geographic markets of our commercial real estate business. During this transition, the legacy New York multi-family portfolio has run off at a faster rate than new business has been originated. However, as mentioned on our call in April, new leadership and talent has been added to our New York CRE group, and we are excited about their abilities to further expand and strengthen our lending activities in the Greater New York metro market. It is important to note, excluding the New York multi-family business, the rest of our loan portfolio is performing in line with our original goals.
The next goal we are updating is net interest income. In addition to our revised loan growth goal, current interest rates, along with ongoing global economic uncertainties impacting rates are different than what was expected 6 months ago. As such, we have lowered the net interest income growth range from 7% to 9% to a range of 5% to 7%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.75% to 2.85%. This is lower than the original range of 2.85% to 2.95%, which included an assumption of 125 basis point interest rate increase in mid-2016 and a steeper yield curve. This updated net interest margin range is derived from many different factors. Two of the most significant are an assumption of no Fed interest rate increases during 2016 and a continuation of the current flat yield curve environment. We are also lowering our total expense range of $865 million to $885 million to a range of $860 million to $870 million, which excludes any merger-related costs associated with recently announced acquisitions. As a result of our continued execution of strong cost controls, we have effectively managed expenses while continuing to make investments in revenue producing initiatives in the franchise. The net effect of these changes does not impact our original full year expectations with respect to earnings. Finally, it is important to note that full year goals for deposit growth, noninterest income, credit and capital are unchanged.
With that, I'd like to pass it back to Jack for closing remarks."

We have demonstrated this commitmen",437,"Thank you, David.
The ability to consistently return capital to our shareholders is a key part of our business model and illustrates the success we have had in maintaining asset quality while growing the balance sheet. We have demonstrated this commitment by increasing our annual dividend for 23 consecutive years. The board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact it has on the valuation of the company's shares. As a result, one of our most important objectives is protecting the dividend as the company grows in size. Therefore, it is important for both current and prospective shareholders to know, we will not move the company past the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend. As such, we will continue to reduce our dividend payout ratio by growing earnings and working with our regulators as we thoughtfully grow the franchise. While the Suffolk acquisition is strategically important transaction, it is relatively small at 5% of our asset size. Since integration is a core competency of People's United, this transaction does not preclude us from exploring other acquisitions. With pro forma assets of $42 billion, we are mindful of the $50 billion asset threshold and the potential implications of crossing it. However, we will continue to be opportunistic in regards to acquisitions, including those that would take us over the $50 billion level. We will only execute a larger transaction that would allow us to preserve our dividend. As we have discussed in the past, we have been building our readiness to cross the $50 billion threshold for the past couple of years through an internal project known as B50B [ph]. The project involves the formation of a cross-functional readiness review teams that have completed gap analysis on each of the requirements that will be imposed on us when crossing $50 billion. Accordingly, based on these analyses, we continue to build out modeling, data management and staff capabilities. In recent years, we have already made investments to enhance our corporate infrastructure in areas such as enterprise risk management, model development and validation, internal audit, compliance, operational risk and BFA A&L. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual one-time costs.
In closing, the company has had a very solid quarter as we continue to successfully execute in the marketplace to find solutions and value for our customers as well as build the franchise for the long term.
This concludes our presentation, and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions."

And we have a lot of long-term relationships that we value very much. And as you probably realize, our concentration level is below $300 million. The other thing that is probably less apparent is that we have elevated and enhanced our risk management process around CRE over the last number of years and have really been operating with enhanced due diligence processes, well established and in our run rate around the portfolio. So we feel very confident about moving forward in commercial real estate lending and going above the $300 million level, and we've demonstrated our ability to manage that risk. Given the diversification of our business lines and the portfolios, I don't expect that we'll go too far above the $300 million level in the immediate -- intermediate, I guess, I'd say, future. But it wouldn't be a concern for us to go above $300 million. And we like the balance and diversification, so we'll continue to move everything forward. I really am very optimistic about the talent in the folks that we brought in to New York and we're looking forward. They've got a nice full pipeline, and they've got some great relationships and we expect to do some great business there and build that out. We are, by the way -- just to add one thing. Sorry to cut you off, but the -- in Long Island, we've really had a great success over the last 4 or 5 years.

We continue and have continued to increase our dividend, $0.01 a year. And we continue to -- that is our approach with the dividend. And the board and management is very committed to staying on that path. If you look at our history, we've steadily brought the dividend payout ratio down by improving earnings. We're continuing to build our plans around that. And we're making steady progress and we're going to continue to make steady progress as we move through moving from $40 billion to $50 billion. And we solemnly believe that the actions we're taking will continue to improve profitability. And we've tried to clarify our efforts around being prepared on $50 billion on many fronts. We've talked to our regulators about this issue and have a very good line of communication. I'd also point everybody to what's happening through the CCAR process, right? Many, many people's dividend payout ratios are coming up. I think the high mark this time around is 40% payout. We know there's discussion about deals out there that might be approved at 50%. So as we continue to bring our payout ratio down over time and the environment changes, we feel that we will successfully navigate from where we are today to the $50 billion mark and continue to maintain our dividend performance."

And that's what it's all about. It's just -- several years ago, back in 2011, we made a conscious decision to have a few members of the management team highly focused on expenses on a very active weekly basis and revealing everything that we spend as a company, both tactically and strategically.

The yield curve has remained flat, but what is interesting is that the gap down in interest rates that we saw post-Brexit is completely reversed already. The -- so -- and then in the second quarter, what I didn't say in my prepared remarks was, we did quite a bit more of LIBOR-based production in the quarter. And so the mix has an impact. Our spread actually widened a little bit, but the new business yield went down not because of spreads, but because of mix. So the way I would think about it is, we had -- if you look year-over-year, the margin was down about 9 basis points in a year, but in a year that really had some dramatic changes, both in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. So there is more pressure -- there's more forces that are bringing the margin down than bringing the margin up today, and I think that will be in place through the balance of this year.

Turning to the overview on the second quarter on Slide 2. We are pleased with the company's second quarter performance. Net income of $68.5 million or $0.23 per share represents increases in net income of 11% from the prior year quarter and 9% from the first quarter. The results this quarter reflect our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Revenues increased 4% from the prior year quarter, driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income, while growth of 1% from the first quarter reflected higher noninterest income. Total expenses increased modestly from a year ago, but declined on a linked-quarter basis as expected. As a result of our revenue growth and the ability to control costs, the efficiency ratio for the quarter is 60.4%, which represents improvements of 120 basis points from the prior year quarter and 230 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Loan production rebounded in the second quarter, as the portfolio experienced annualized growth of more than 7%, with particularly strong results in commercial and industrial lending as well as residential mortgage. This marks our 23rd consecutive quarter of loan growth. While deposit balances ended the quarter modestly lower due to seasonal declines in our retail and municipal businesses, franchise-wide cross-sell and commercial deposit gathering assets continue to be successful. Excluding municipal deposits, commercial deposit balances grew more than 16% during the quarter on an annualized basis.
Before passing the call to David to go over the second quarter in more detail, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our announced acquisitions of Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher, which are 2 more successful steps in executing our strategy of growing and strengthening People's United in the New York Metro area. The acquisition of Suffolk is an excellent strategic and cultural fit and complements our previous acquisitions and organic growth in the market. Their impressive Long Island footprint, particularly on the island's eastern end where we currently do not have a presence, further bolsters our franchise in this very attractive banking market. Suffolk provides proven loan origination capabilities as well as a unique low-cost core deposit base, which very few banks possess. The transaction offers revenue synergies that present substantial upside opportunities, which were not modeled into the economics of the deal. We are excited about both extending our full suite of products and services and utilizing our larger balance sheet to provide more comprehensive solutions to Suffolk's customer base. Compelling cost savings also exist as we have identified achievable reductions that amount to 15% of Suffolk's standalone expenses. Further, our complementary business models, shared commitment to relationship banking and conservative risk management philosophies will ease the integration and deliver value to both customers and shareholders. In the weeks since the acquisition announcement, we have started integration activities and spent more time with the Suffolk team. As a result, we feel even better about the consideration given and the expected benefits of this transaction. Following our acquisitions of the Bank of Smithtown in 2010 and 57 branches from RBS Citizens in 2012, People's United has been well received in the New York metro market. Since the end of the first quarter of 2010, our New York franchise has experienced organic compound annual loan and deposit growth of 35% and 28%, respectively. Today, we have $4.9 billion of loans in New York and $3.5 billion of deposits. All of this progress gives us confidence in our ability to successfully build upon the additional presence the Suffolk transaction provides us in the New York Metro market.
Today's announcement of an all-cash transaction for Gerstein Fisher, a $3 billion investment management firm, is our most significant wealth management acquisition to date and is expected to bring our total assets under administration to nearly $20 billion, of which $8 billion is under discretionary management. The firm's well-known quantitative investment approach and scalable technology platform will complement our excellent range of investment solutions as well as enhance our brand in the wealth management marketplace. Gerstein Fisher's strong track record of growth and presence in New York will enable us to leverage our banking products and services with their clients. This transaction complements recent investments in our fee-based businesses and will further diversify revenues through additional noninterest income.
An exciting and invaluable aspect of each transaction is that the accomplished leaders of these firms will join People's United in critical leadership roles. Howard Bluver, Suffolk's President and CEO, will assume the role of New York Market President for People's United. Howard's deep roots in the region, understanding of the local economy and proven track record for growth will further our momentum in this important market. Gregg Fisher, Gerstein Fisher's Founder and CIO, will join People's United as Head of Quantitative Research and Portfolio Strategy. Gregg's highly respected expertise in the investment management as well as his commitment to innovation and research will strengthen our wealth management capabilities, enabling us to further deepen existing client relationships and forge new ones.
With that, I'll pass it to David."

Turning to Slide 3, you can see net interest income was flat with the first quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from ongoing loan growth. This benefit to net interest income was offset by a $1.1 million decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired portfolio as well as $400,000 in higher borrowing costs.
On Slide 4, net interest margin of 2.79% was 4 basis points lower than the first quarter. New loan volumes negatively impacted margin by 3 basis points, as new business yields were lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield reduced the margin by 1 basis point.
Moving to Slide 5. The loan portfolio grew $527 million or 7% annualized from the first quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $600 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $413 million from the first quarter, driven primarily by $372 million of C&I growth. Equipment financing and commercial real estate contributed growth of $30 million and $11 million, respectively. Within C&I, we experienced strength across several categories, including middle-market C&I, asset-based lending, and most notably, in mortgage warehouse lending. The end of period balance for mortgage warehouse reached $1.2 billion, up $217 million from March 31. Retail contributed $187 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $199 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $73 million this quarter, the largest announced since the first quarter of 2015, and it was primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $692 million.
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the first quarter. Commercial balances continued to benefit from franchise-wide deposit gathering efforts and grew $102 million or 4% annualized. Retail balances, in line with historical second quarter trends, declined $208 million or 4% annualized. As a result, total deposits declined $106 million or 1% on an annualized basis. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business negatively impacted quarter end deposits by $200 million. Excluding municipals, total deposits experienced annualized growth in the second quarter of 1%, while commercial deposits grew more than 16% annualized. We expect municipal balances to rebound in the third quarter, in line with historical seasonal trends. It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits remained at 35 basis points for the third consecutive quarter.
On Slide 7, we look at noninterest income, which increased $3.1 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Higher noninterest income benefited from several categories, including increases of $1.1 million in commercial bank lending fees, $1 million in bank-owned life insurance and $900,000 in bank service charges. The $1.5 million increase in Other was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of an interest in a real estate investment. The primary offset to these increases was a $2.3 million decrease in insurance revenues, largely due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Total expenses of $213 million decreased 2% from the first quarter. As expected, compensation and benefits decreased $2.7 million, resulting from lower payroll-related and benefit costs, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter. In addition, professional and outside service costs were $1 million lower in the quarter. The largest offset to these improvements was $1.2 million in higher regulatory assessments. As you will recall, the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited from credits received for overpayment of FDIC assessments made in prior quarters. As we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel, we closed 6 branches during the quarter. From the beginning of 2011, we have closed 61 branches, of which the majority were traditional branches. During the same time frame, we have opened 26 branches, most of which are more cost-efficient in-store locations.
On Slide 9, you can see our efficiency ratio in the second quarter of 60.4%, improved 230 basis points from the first quarter, and 120 basis points from a year ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management.
Slide 10 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 64 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks, and has improved from recent quarters. Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy remains a hallmark of People's United. We continue to build the business for the long term and will not sacrifice credit quality to achieve growth.
As shown on Slide 11, return on average assets increased 5 basis points on a linked-quarter basis points and 3 basis points from the prior year quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the low-interest rate environment. Our return on average tangible equity was 10.1% for the second quarter, an increase from 9.4% in the first quarter and 9.5% in the prior year quarter.
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. As previously discussed, we plan on issuing $200 million to $250 million of preferreds this year, enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing our already strong capital position. While all of our regulatory ratios are well above internal long-term operating targets, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points and support continued growth.
On Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive and well positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel rate shock as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. At quarter end, over 43% of the loan portfolio was either one-month LIBOR or prime based compared to 42% at March 31 and 41% a year ago. Sustained lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning, as evidenced by our long-end-down scenario on this slide. Therefore, we have begun to reinvest monthly security portfolio cash flows into treasury and municipal securities rather than mortgage-backed securities to mitigate prepayment risk to lower rates. This is a modest change in portfolio strategy, but one that will decrease downside risk if rates were to again move lower.
Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I want to draw your attention to Slide 14, as we have provided an update to the full year 2016 goals we outlined in January. We have lowered our loan growth range from 6% to 8% to a range of 4% to 6%. Subsequent to announcing the original goal, we decided to reduce the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio to focus our resources on full-service relationships. This approach is consistent with other geographic markets of our commercial real estate business. During this transition, the legacy New York multi-family portfolio has run off at a faster rate than new business has been originated. However, as mentioned on our call in April, new leadership and talent has been added to our New York CRE group, and we are excited about their abilities to further expand and strengthen our lending activities in the Greater New York metro market. It is important to note, excluding the New York multi-family business, the rest of our loan portfolio is performing in line with our original goals.
The next goal we are updating is net interest income. In addition to our revised loan growth goal, current interest rates, along with ongoing global economic uncertainties impacting rates are different than what was expected 6 months ago. As such, we have lowered the net interest income growth range from 7% to 9% to a range of 5% to 7%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.75% to 2.85%. This is lower than the original range of 2.85% to 2.95%, which included an assumption of 125 basis point interest rate increase in mid-2016 and a steeper yield curve. This updated net interest margin range is derived from many different factors. Two of the most significant are an assumption of no Fed interest rate increases during 2016 and a continuation of the current flat yield curve environment. We are also lowering our total expense range of $865 million to $885 million to a range of $860 million to $870 million, which excludes any merger-related costs associated with recently announced acquisitions. As a result of our continued execution of strong cost controls, we have effectively managed expenses while continuing to make investments in revenue producing initiatives in the franchise. The net effect of these changes does not impact our original full year expectations with respect to earnings. Finally, it is important to note that full year goals for deposit growth, noninterest income, credit and capital are unchanged.
With that, I'd like to pass it back to Jack for closing remarks."

We have demonstrated this commitmen",436,"Thank you, David.
The ability to consistently return capital to our shareholders is a key part of our business model and illustrates the success we have had in maintaining asset quality while growing the balance sheet. We have demonstrated this commitment by increasing our annual dividend for 23 consecutive years. The board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact it has on the valuation of the company's shares. As a result, one of our most important objectives is protecting the dividend as the company grows in size. Therefore, it is important for both current and prospective shareholders to know, we will not move the company past the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend. As such, we will continue to reduce our dividend payout ratio by growing earnings and working with our regulators as we thoughtfully grow the franchise. While the Suffolk acquisition is strategically important transaction, it is relatively small at 5% of our asset size. Since integration is a core competency of People's United, this transaction does not preclude us from exploring other acquisitions. With pro forma assets of $42 billion, we are mindful of the $50 billion asset threshold and the potential implications of crossing it. However, we will continue to be opportunistic in regards to acquisitions, including those that would take us over the $50 billion level. We will only execute a larger transaction that would allow us to preserve our dividend. As we have discussed in the past, we have been building our readiness to cross the $50 billion threshold for the past couple of years through an internal project known as B50B [ph]. The project involves the formation of a cross-functional readiness review teams that have completed gap analysis on each of the requirements that will be imposed on us when crossing $50 billion. Accordingly, based on these analyses, we continue to build out modeling, data management and staff capabilities. In recent years, we have already made investments to enhance our corporate infrastructure in areas such as enterprise risk management, model development and validation, internal audit, compliance, operational risk and BSA/AML. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual one-time costs.
In closing, the company has had a very solid quarter as we continue to successfully execute in the marketplace to find solutions and value for our customers as well as build the franchise for the long term.
This concludes our presentation, and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions."

And we have a lot of long-term relationships that we value very much. And as you probably realize, our concentration level is below $300 million. The other thing that is probably less apparent is that we have elevated and enhanced our risk management process around CRE over the last number of years and have really been operating with enhanced due diligence processes, well established and in our run rate around the portfolio. So we feel very confident about moving forward in commercial real estate lending and going above the $300 million level, and we've demonstrated our ability to manage that risk. Given the diversification of our business lines and the portfolios, I don't expect that we'll go too far above the $300 million level in the immediate -- intermediate, I guess, I'd say, future. But it wouldn't be a concern for us to go above $300 million. And we like the balance and diversification, so we'll continue to move everything forward. I really am very optimistic about the talent in the folks that we brought in to New York and we're looking forward. They've got a nice full pipeline, and they've got some great relationships and we expect to do some great business there and build that out. We are, by the way -- just to add one thing. Sorry to cut you off, but the -- in Long Island, we've really had a great success over the last 4 or 5 years.

But to your point, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. But I'd say a couple of things, if you -- first of all, we are very committed to our dividend, as I stated. We continue and have continued to increase our dividend, $0.01 a year. And we continue to -- that is our approach with the dividend. And the board and management is very committed to staying on that path. If you look at our history, we've steadily brought the dividend payout ratio down by improving earnings. We're continuing to build our plans around that. And we're making steady progress and we're going to continue to make steady progress as we move through moving from $40 billion to $50 billion. And we solemnly believe that the actions we're taking will continue to improve profitability. And we've tried to clarify our efforts around being prepared on $50 billion on many fronts. We've talked to our regulators about this issue and have a very good line of communication. I'd also point everybody to what's happening through the CCAR process, right? Many, many people's dividend payout ratios are coming up. I think the high mark this time around is 40% payout. We know there's discussion about deals out there that might be approved at 50%. So as we continue to bring our payout ratio down over time and the environment changes, we feel that we will successfully navigate from where we are today to the $50 billion mark and continue to maintain our dividend performance."

And that's what it's all about. It's just -- several years ago, back in 2011, we made a conscious decision to have a few members of the management team highly focused on expenses on a very active weekly basis and revealing everything that we spend as a company, both tactically and strategically.

The yield curve has remained flat, but what is interesting is that the gap down in interest rates that we saw post-Brexit is completely reversed already. The -- so -- and then in the second quarter, what I didn't say in my prepared remarks was, we did quite a bit more of LIBOR-based production in the quarter. And so the mix has an impact. Our spread actually widened a little bit, but the new business yield went down not because of spreads, but because of mix. So the way I would think about it is, we had -- if you look year-over-year, the margin was down about 9 basis points in a year, but in a year that really had some dramatic changes, both in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. So there is more pressure -- there's more forces that are bringing the margin down than bringing the margin up today, and I think that will be in place through the balance of this year.

Good afternoon, and as always, we appreciate everybody joining us today. 
The company's performance continues to reflect business momentum generated through our consistent solution-oriented approach to banking. We have always partnered with clients to deliver thoughtful, straightforward solutions that address their financial needs. 
During the quarter, I spent time meeting with our relationship managers and their clients across the footprint, as I often do throughout the year and very much enjoy. These visits enable me to see first hand how well we are meeting clients' needs. Once again, I came away impressed with the strength of our relationships and the quality of the clients we do business with. The feedback I continually receive is that our approach to banking differentiates us in the market. The combination with our expensive suite of products and services, this approach has enabled us to deepen existing relationships and develop new ones. As a result, we have grown the loan portfolio for 24 consecutive quarters while maintaining exceptional asset quality and over the same period, nearly doubled our deposit base and increased wealth management assets under discretionary management by approximately 40%. 
Now turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Our results for the third quarter reflect further improvements in profitability and continued growth in earning assets. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $74 million, which increased 8% from both the linked and prior year quarters as well as generated a return on average tangible equity of 10.7%. The efficiency ratio of 59.9% reflects a continued gradual improvement in this metric and demonstrates our focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. 
Solid growth in both net interest income and noninterest income drove revenues higher by 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Expenses of $218 million, which excludes $3.1 million of merger-related costs, were up approximately 2% from both the second quarter and prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher compensation and benefits cost. 
In the third quarter, we continued to optimize our branch network with the closing of 4 branches. Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 65 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same timeframe, we have opened 26 branches, the majority of which are more cost-efficient in-store branches. We remain confident in our ability to further control costs as the mindset of actively managing expenses has become very much ingrained in the culture of the company. 
The loan portfolio continued to benefit from our diversified business mix. Annualized loan growth during the quarter was 5%, with particularly strong results in residential mortgage as well as commercial and industrial lending. On an average basis, annualized loan growth was 8%. 
Looking ahead, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations. With pipelines ending the quarter at very solid levels, our current view is for the trend to continue. Our success gathering deposits was evidenced by annualized growth of 9% from the end of the second quarter while the cost 
Of deposits declined 1 basis point. Recently released FDIC deposit data show our market share percentages either increased or remained consistent in each state we operate. We are particularly pleased with our continued #1 market share position in Fairfield County, Connecticut and the state of Vermont. 
Before turning the call over to David to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to comment on our pending acquisitions. The closing and integration processes of the Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher transaction are progressing very well. We are working closely with teams at each firm to execute our time-tested acquisition approach. We expect to close Gerstein Fisher in early November and continue to move towards closing Suffolk pending regulatory approvals. 
As a result of these integration activities over the past few months, we have come away even more excited about the expected benefits of each of these transactions, particularly the talented people that will be joining us. Each of these transactions will further grow and strengthen People's United in the New York Metro area. 
Since the beginning of 2010, we have made substantial progress in expanding our New York franchise both organically and via acquisitions. Over this time, we built C&I and commercial real estate teams to the New York Metro area, entered Manhattan with a branch on Park Avenue, and incorporated our broader set of products and training into the branches we acquired in the 2010 Smithtown and 2012 Citizens branch transactions. Additionally, we have hired local talent that both knows the markets and is well known in the market. 
Collectively, these investments over the last 6 years have enabled us to significantly grow our New York loan portfolio and deposit base. This progress gives us even greater confidence in our ability to successfully continue to move our franchise forward in the New York Metro area. 
With that, I'll pass it to David."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income increased $5.3 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by ongoing loan growth. Net interest income also benefited $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter and $400,000 from lower deposit cost, primarily as a result of higher average noninterest-bearing deposit balances. Furthermore, it is important to note, the increase in LIBOR rate had a modest favorable impact on net interest income of approximately $1 million in the third quarter. The primary offset to these increases was a $1.4 million decline and accretion from runoff of the acquired portfolio. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by $800,000 in higher borrowing costs and $500,000 from lower yields in the securities portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 4. Net interest margin of 280 increased 1 basis point from the second quarter. A higher loan portfolio yield and the additional calendar day in the third quarter each benefited the margin by 2 basis points, while the lower securities portfolio yield and higher borrowing costs collectively reduced the margin by 3 basis points. 
On Slide 5, you can see loan balances increased $330 million or 5% annualized from June 30, with growth in both our retail and commercial portfolios. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $376 million.  Retail contributed $234 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $249 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. 
As we have grown our residential mortgage portfolio in recent years, originations continue to be very high quality. The portfolio's LTV and FICO metrics have remained consistent, and the overwhelming majority of business retained on the balance sheet continues to be hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 
For originated loans added to the portfolio during the first 9 months of 2016, the average LTV is 68% and the average FICO is 762. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $142 million, driven by C&I growth of $141 million. We experienced solid production across several C&I categories, including large corporate, middle-market and asset-based lending. 
While end of period mortgage warehouse balances of $1.2 billion were consistent with June 30, average balances for the quarter were up $117 million. 
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $46 million this quarter compared to $73 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $645 million. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment. Deposits grew $657 million or 9% on an annualized basis during the third quarter, primarily due to higher noninterest-bearing and municipal balances. 
Commercial continued to benefit from franchise-wide deposit-gathering efforts and grew $755 million or 32% annualized during the quarter. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business had a favorable $255 million impact on quarter-end commercial balances. 
Retail balances declined $98 million or 2% annualized as the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits. Following historical trends, growth is expected in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 7, we look at noninterest income, which increased $5 million or 6% compared to the second quarter. Insurance revenues increased noninterest income by $2.8 million, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions as well as the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year. 
Noninterest income also benefited from several categories, including increases of $1.1 million in operating lease income, $1 million from net gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans and $600,000 in bank service charges. 
In addition, the $2 million increase in other was driven by higher income related to a distribution from an acquired equity investment partnership. The primary offset to these positives was a $2.1 million decrease in commercial banking lending fees, primarily due to lower commercial real estate prepayment fees, resulting from a reduced level of pre-activity in our market. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding $3.1 million of merger-related costs, which are reported in professional and outside services, third quarter expenses were $218.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million or 2.5% from the second quarter. Compensation and benefits increased $4.7 million, primarily reflecting the impact of an additional work day and higher benefit-related costs in the third quarter. The higher benefit-related costs were driven in part by one additional payroll in the quarter. The largest offset to these increases was $1.8 million in lower professional and outside services costs due to the timing of certain projects during the quarter. 
Before we moving to the next slide, it is important to mention the FDIC rule requiring banks with over $10 billion in assets to be responsible for recapitalizing the deposit insurance fund, which became effective on July 1. We anticipate the impact of the surcharge is expected to increase regulatory assessment expenses by $2.5 million to $3 million per annum. 
On Slide 9, you can see our efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 59.9%, improved 50 basis points from the second quarter and 180 basis points from a year ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. 
Slide 10 is a reminder of our exceptional credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 63 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has continued to improve from recent quarters. 
Net charge-offs improved from our already low levels to 4 basis point, the lowest level in over 9 years. These levels reflect the minimum lost continent in our nonperforming assets. 
As shown on Slide 11, both return on average assets and return on average tangible equity improved for the second consecutive quarter. Return on average assets of 73 basis points increased 3 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and was consistent with the prior year quarter. Return on average tangible equity of 10.7% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter and 20 basis points from a year ago. Notwithstanding these improvements, our returns continued to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continued to be especially strong in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. 
As previously discussed, we plan on issuing $200 million to $250 million of preferreds before year end, enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing our already strong capital position. While all of our regulatory ratios are above internal long-term operating targets, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points to support continued growth. 
On Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive, though slightly less than last quarter. 
We remain well positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel shock scenario as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. 
At quarter and, over 44% of the loan portfolio was either 1-month LIBOR or prime based compared to 43% at June 30 and 41% a year ago. Sustained lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning as evidenced by our long and down scenario on this slide. 
Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I wanted to point out, we revised our estimate for the full year effective tax rate, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.6% for the third quarter. The effective tax rate through 9 months of 2016 is 32.4%, a decrease from 33.4% through the full year of 2015 due to our continued investments in tax reference items. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Jack for closing remarks."

In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, which includes record quarterly net income, improvement in the efficiency ratio to 59.9%, continued loan growth highlighting our diverse business mix, sustained exceptional asset quality and strong deposit growth, along with lower cost of deposit. 
Our integration and closing processes with Suffolk and Gerstein Fisher acquisitions are progressing very well, and we're excited about the expected benefits of each of these transactions. 
We continue to build our readiness to cross the $50 billion asset threshold through our Be 50 B [ph] project, which we discussed in detail last quarter. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual onetime costs. 
We remain committed to consistently returning capital to shareholders, as today, the board declared dividends for the 93rd consecutive quarter. As such, the board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact that it has to the valuation of company shares. Therefore, it is important to remind both current and prospective shareholders, we do not -- we will not move the company past the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend. 
This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

And so on the residential and consumer side, the residential side, there's a shift going on that there's -- the mix of purchase and refi is kind of 50-50 lately. And the volume's strong, the pipeline is strong. The branches tend to do a little less refi -- I'm sorry, a little purchase of their refi as it slow down, I think it's affecting that. We're getting a lot more activity through the mortgage originators, mortgage account officers and we're adding, as we've told you in the past, mortgage account officers, particularly inside 195 in Boston and in New York. So those are the numbers of mortgage originators are up fairly considerably. And then, the wholesale business is seeing a good amount of activity as well. So it's a mix of kind of the channels, if you will, in the residential area. And consumer. I think consumer has been flat and continues to be on the flattish side. It tends to build as we build households and it tends to pull back when refi is more active and people tend to roll their home equities outstands into fixed rate longer returns. I just want to correct, I said $20 million to $40 million a quarter, and [indiscernible] it's actually, the $20 million to $40 million of multifamily runoff is per month, not per quarter."

Good afternoon, and as always, we appreciate everybody joining us today. The company's performance continues to reflect business momentum generated through our consistent solution-oriented approach to banking. We have always partnered",835,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, and as always, we appreciate everybody joining us today. 
The company's performance continues to reflect business momentum generated through our consistent solution-oriented approach to banking. We have always partnered with clients to deliver thoughtful, straightforward solutions that address their financial needs. 
During the quarter, I spent time meeting with our relationship managers and their clients across the footprint, as I often do throughout the year and very much enjoy. These visits enable me to see first hand how well we are meeting clients' needs. Once again, I came away impressed with the strength of our relationships and the quality of the clients we do business with. The feedback I continually receive is that our approach to banking differentiates us in the market. The combination with our expansive suite of products and services, this approach has enabled us to deepen existing relationships and develop new ones. As a result, we have grown the loan portfolio for 24 consecutive quarters while maintaining exceptional asset quality and over the same period, nearly doubled our deposit base and increased wealth management assets under discretionary management by approximately 40%. 
Now turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Our results for the third quarter reflect further improvements in profitability and continued growth in earning assets. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $74 million, which increased 8% from both the linked and prior year quarters as well as generated a return on average tangible equity of 10.7%. The efficiency ratio of 59.9% reflects a continued gradual improvement in this metric and demonstrates our focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. 
Solid growth in both net interest income and noninterest income drove revenues higher by 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Expenses of $218 million, which excludes $3.1 million of merger-related costs, were up approximately 2% from both the second quarter and prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher compensation and benefits cost. 
In the third quarter, we continued to optimize our branch network with the closing of 4 branches. Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 65 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same timeframe, we have opened 26 branches, the majority of which are more cost-efficient in-store branches. We remain confident in our ability to further control costs as the mindset of actively managing expenses has become very much ingrained in the culture of the company. 
The loan portfolio continued to benefit from our diversified business mix. Annualized loan growth during the quarter was 5%, with particularly strong results in residential mortgage as well as commercial and industrial lending. On an average basis, annualized loan growth was 8%. 
Looking ahead, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations. With pipelines ending the quarter at very solid levels, our current view is for the trend to continue. Our success gathering deposits was evidenced by annualized growth of 9% from the end of the second quarter while the cost 
Of deposits declined 1 basis point. Recently released FDIC deposit data show our market share percentages either increased or remained consistent in each state we operate. We are particularly pleased with our continued #1 market share position in Fairfield County, Connecticut and the state of Vermont. 
Before turning the call over to David to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to comment on our pending acquisitions. The closing and integration processes of the Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher transaction are progressing very well. We are working closely with teams at each firm to execute our time-tested acquisition approach. We expect to close Gerstein Fisher in early November and continue to move towards closing Suffolk pending regulatory approvals. 
As a result of these integration activities over the past few months, we have come away even more excited about the expected benefits of each of these transactions, particularly the talented people that will be joining us. Each of these transactions will further grow and strengthen People's United in the New York Metro area. 
Since the beginning of 2010, we have made substantial progress in expanding our New York franchise both organically and via acquisitions. Over this time, we built C&I and commercial real estate teams to the New York Metro area, entered Manhattan with a branch on Park Avenue, and incorporated our broader set of products and training into the branches we acquired in the 2010 Smithtown and 2012 Citizens branch transactions. Additionally, we have hired local talent that both knows the markets and is well known in the market. 
Collectively, these investments over the last 6 years have enabled us to significantly grow our New York loan portfolio and deposit base. This progress gives us even greater confidence in our ability to successfully continue to move our franchise forward in the New York Metro area. 
With that, I'll pass it to David."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income increased $5.3 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by ongoing loan growth. Net interest income also benefited $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarte",1317,"Thank you, Jack. 
Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income increased $5.3 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by ongoing loan growth. Net interest income also benefited $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter and $400,000 from lower deposit cost, primarily as a result of higher average noninterest-bearing deposit balances. Furthermore, it is important to note, the increase in LIBOR rate had a modest favorable impact on net interest income of approximately $1 million in the third quarter. The primary offset to these increases was a $1.4 million decline and accretion from runoff of the acquired portfolio. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by $800,000 in higher borrowing costs and $500,000 from lower yields in the securities portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 4. Net interest margin of 280 increased 1 basis point from the second quarter. A higher loan portfolio yield and the additional calendar day in the third quarter each benefited the margin by 2 basis points, while the lower securities portfolio yield and higher borrowing costs collectively reduced the margin by 3 basis points. 
On Slide 5, you can see loan balances increased $330 million or 5% annualized from June 30, with growth in both our retail and commercial portfolios. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $376 million.  Retail contributed $234 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $249 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. 
As we have grown our residential mortgage portfolio in recent years, originations continue to be very high quality. The portfolio's LTV and FICO metrics have remained consistent, and the overwhelming majority of business retained on the balance sheet continues to be hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 
For originated loans added to the portfolio during the first 9 months of 2016, the average LTV is 68% and the average FICO is 762. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $142 million, driven by C&I growth of $141 million. We experienced solid production across several C&I categories, including large corporate, middle-market and asset-based lending. 
While end of period mortgage warehouse balances of $1.2 billion were consistent with June 30, average balances for the quarter were up $117 million. 
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $46 million this quarter compared to $73 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $645 million. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment. Deposits grew $657 million or 9% on an annualized basis during the third quarter, primarily due to higher noninterest-bearing and municipal balances. 
Commercial continued to benefit from franchise-wide deposit-gathering efforts and grew $755 million or 32% annualized during the quarter. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business had a favorable $255 million impact on quarter-end commercial balances. 
Retail balances declined $98 million or 2% annualized as the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits. Following historical trends, growth is expected in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 7, we look at noninterest income, which increased $5 million or 6% compared to the second quarter. Insurance revenues increased noninterest income by $2.8 million, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions as well as the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year. 
Noninterest income also benefited from several categories, including increases of $1.1 million in operating lease income, $1 million from net gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans and $600,000 in bank service charges. 
In addition, the $2 million increase in other was driven by higher income related to a distribution from an acquired equity investment partnership. The primary offset to these positives was a $2.1 million decrease in commercial banking lending fees, primarily due to lower commercial real estate prepayment fees, resulting from a reduced level of pre-activity in our market. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding $3.1 million of merger-related costs, which are reported in professional and outside services, third quarter expenses were $218.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million or 2.5% from the second quarter. Compensation and benefits increased $4.7 million, primarily reflecting the impact of an additional work day and higher benefit-related costs in the third quarter. The higher benefit-related costs were driven in part by one additional payroll in the quarter. The largest offset to these increases was $1.8 million in lower professional and outside services costs due to the timing of certain projects during the quarter. 
Before we moving to the next slide, it is important to mention the FDIC rule requiring banks with over $10 billion in assets to be responsible for recapitalizing the deposit insurance fund, which became effective on July 1. We anticipate the impact of the surcharge is expected to increase regulatory assessment expenses by $2.5 million to $3 million per annum. 
On Slide 9, you can see our efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 59.9%, improved 50 basis points from the second quarter and 180 basis points from a year ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. 
Slide 10 is a reminder of our exceptional credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 63 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has continued to improve from recent quarters. 
Net charge-offs improved from our already low levels to 4 basis point, the lowest level in over 9 years. These levels reflect the minimum lost continent in our nonperforming assets. 
As shown on Slide 11, both return on average assets and return on average tangible equity improved for the second consecutive quarter. Return on average assets of 73 basis points increased 3 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and was consistent with the prior year quarter. Return on average tangible equity of 10.7% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter and 20 basis points from a year ago. Notwithstanding these improvements, our returns continued to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continued to be especially strong in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. 
As previously discussed, we plan on issuing $200 million to $250 million of preferreds before year end, enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing our already strong capital position. While all of our regulatory ratios are above internal long-term operating targets, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points to support continued growth. 
On Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive, though slightly less than last quarter. 
We remain well positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel shock scenario as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. 
At quarter and, over 44% of the loan portfolio was either 1-month LIBOR or prime based compared to 43% at June 30 and 41% a year ago. Sustained lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning as evidenced by our long and down scenario on this slide. 
Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I wanted to point out, we revised our estimate for the full year effective tax rate, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.6% for the third quarter. The effective tax rate through 9 months of 2016 is 32.4%, a decrease from 33.4% through the full year of 2015 due to our continued investments in tax reference items. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Jack for closing remarks."

In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, which includes record quarterly net income, improvement in the efficiency ratio to 59.9%, continued loan growth highlighting our diverse business mix, sustained exceptional asset quality and strong deposit growth, along with lower cost of deposit. 
Our integration and closing processes with Suffolk and Gerstein Fisher acquisitions are progressing very well, and we're excited about the expected benefits of each of these transactions. 
We continue to build our readiness to cross the $50 billion asset threshold through our Be 50 B [ph] project, which we discussed in detail last quarter. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual onetime costs. 
We remain committed to consistently returning capital to shareholders, as today, the board declared dividends for the 93rd consecutive quarter. As such, the board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact that it has to the valuation of company shares. Therefore, it is important to remind both current and prospective shareholders, we do not -- we will not move the company past the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend. 
This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

And there's a dynamic taking place right now that involves the pullback from the New York multifamily portfolio. That's running off, and we're still gauging the pace of that, probably somewhere between $20 million and $40 million a quarter. But we'll see how that goes. It's slowed as of late. On the other hand, we have obviously a large customer base across the rest of the footprint and now, a very strengthened group in New York and we're getting, I'd say, good origination. I expect we'll start seeing some growth in CRE as we go forward. And the only contrary, I guess, or signal I'd give there, the market does seem to be a little slower, a little softer in terms of transactions this year. So that's CRE. C&I is very steady across the middle-market. Starting to see actually a little better progress on business banking. ABL's having a very strong year. Mortgage warehouse is having a very strong year, even though it had a flat quarter, if you will, or a modest quarter. And equipment finance is also doing reasonably well, although slower overall than it has been in the past. And so on the residential and consumer side, the residential side, there's a fair -- there's a shift going on that there's -- the mix of purchase and refi is kind of 50-50 lately. And the volume's strong, the pipelines are strong. The branches tend to do a little less refi -- I'm sorry, a little purchase, so the refi, as it slowed down, I think, is affecting that. We're getting a lot more activity through the mortgage originators, mortgage account officers. And we're adding, as we've told you in the past, mortgage account officers, particularly inside 495 in Boston and in New York. So those -- the numbers of mortgage originators are up fairly considerably. And then, our wholesale business is seeing a good amount of activity as well. So it's a mix of kind of the channels, if you will, in the residential area. And consumer, I think consumer has been flat and continues to be on the flattish side. It tends to build as we build households and it tends to pull back when refi is more active and people tend to roll their home equities outstandings into fixed-rate longer terms. I just want to correct, I said $20 million to $40 million a quarter, and it's a month later."

Good afternoon, and as always, we appreciate everybody joining us today. The company's performance continues to reflect business momentum generated through our consistent solution-oriented approach to banking. We have always partnered",835,"Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, and as always, we appreciate everybody joining us today. 
The company's performance continues to reflect business momentum generated through our consistent solution-oriented approach to banking. We have always partnered with clients to deliver thoughtful, straightforward solutions that address their financial needs. 
During the quarter, I spent time meeting with our relationship managers and their clients across the footprint, as I often do throughout the year and very much enjoy. These visits enable me to see first hand how well we are meeting clients' needs. Once again, I came away impressed with the strength of our relationships and the quality of the clients we do business with. The feedback I continually receive is that our approach to banking differentiates us in the market. The combination with our extensive suite of products and services, this approach has enabled us to deepen existing relationships and develop new ones. As a result, we have grown the loan portfolio for 24 consecutive quarters while maintaining exceptional asset quality and over the same period, nearly doubled our deposit base and increased wealth management assets under discretionary management by approximately 40%. 
Now turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Our results for the third quarter reflect further improvements in profitability and continued growth in earning assets. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $74 million, which increased 8% from both the linked and prior year quarters as well as generated a return on average tangible equity of 10.7%. The efficiency ratio of 59.9% reflects a continued gradual improvement in this metric and demonstrates our focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. 
Solid growth in both net interest income and noninterest income drove revenues higher by 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Expenses of $218 million, which excludes $3.1 million of merger-related costs, were up approximately 2% from both the second quarter and prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher compensation and benefits costs. 
In the third quarter, we continued to optimize our branch network with the closing of 4 branches. Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 65 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same timeframe, we have opened 26 branches, the majority of which are more cost-efficient in-store branches. We remain confident in our ability to further control costs as the mindset of actively managing expenses has become very much ingrained in the culture of the company. 
The loan portfolio continued to benefit from our diversified business mix. Annualized loan growth during the quarter was 5%, with particularly strong results in residential mortgage as well as commercial and industrial lending. On an average basis, annualized loan growth was 8%. 
Looking ahead, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations. With pipelines ending the quarter at very solid levels, our current view is for the trend to continue. Our success gathering deposits was evidenced by annualized growth of 9% from the end of the second quarter while the cost of deposits declined 1 basis point. Recently released FDIC deposit data show our market share percentages either increased or remained consistent in each state we operate. We are particularly pleased with our continued #1 market share position in Fairfield County, Connecticut and the state of Vermont. 
Before turning the call over to David to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to comment on our pending acquisitions. The closing and integration processes of the Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher transaction are progressing very well. We are working closely with teams at each firm to execute our time-tested acquisition approach. We expect to close Gerstein Fisher in early November and continue to move towards closing Suffolk pending regulatory approvals. 
As a result of these integration activities over the past few months, we have come away even more excited about the expected benefits of each of these transactions, particularly the talented people that will be joining us. Each of these transactions will further grow and strengthen People's United in the New York Metro area. 
Since the beginning of 2010, we have made substantial progress in expanding our New York franchise both organically and via acquisitions. Over this time, we built C&I and commercial real estate teams in the New York Metro area, entered Manhattan with a branch on Park Avenue, and incorporated our broader set of products and training into the branches we acquired in the 2010 Smithtown and 2012 Citizens branch transactions. Additionally, we have hired local talent that both knows the markets and is well known in the market. 
Collectively, these investments over the last 6 years have enabled us to significantly grow our New York loan portfolio and deposit base. This progress gives us even greater confidence in our ability to successfully continue to move our franchise forward in the New York Metro area. 
With that, I'll pass it to David."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income increased $5.3 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by ongoing loan growth. Net interest income also benefited $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarte",1316,"Thank you, Jack. 
Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income increased $5.3 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by ongoing loan growth. Net interest income also benefited $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter and $400,000 from lower deposit cost, primarily as a result of higher average noninterest-bearing deposit balances. Furthermore, it is important to note, the increase in LIBOR rate had a modest favorable impact on net interest income of approximately $1 million in the third quarter. The primary offset to these increases was a $1.4 million decline and accretion from runoff of the acquired portfolio. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by $800,000 in higher borrowing costs and $500,000 from lower yields in the securities portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 4. Net interest margin of 2.80% increased 1 basis point from the second quarter. A higher loan portfolio yield and the additional calendar day in the third quarter each benefited the margin by 2 basis points, while the lower securities portfolio yield and higher borrowing costs collectively reduced the margin by 3 basis points. 
On Slide 5, you can see loan balances increased $330 million or 5% annualized from June 30, with growth in both our retail and commercial portfolios. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $376 million.  Retail contributed $234 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $249 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. 
As we have grown our residential mortgage portfolio in recent years, originations continue to be very high quality. The portfolio's LTV and FICO metrics have remained consistent, and the overwhelming majority of business retained on the balance sheet continues to be hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 
For originated loans added to the portfolio during the first 9 months of 2016, the average LTV is 68% and the average FICO is 762. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $142 million, driven by C&I growth of $141 million. We experienced solid production across several C&I categories, including large corporate, middle-market and asset-based lending. 
While end of period mortgage warehouse balances of $1.2 billion were consistent with June 30, average balances for the quarter were up $117 million. 
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $46 million this quarter compared to $73 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $645 million. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment. Deposits grew $657 million or 9% on an annualized basis during the third quarter, primarily due to higher noninterest-bearing and municipal balances. 
Commercial continued to benefit from franchise-wide deposit-gathering efforts and grew $755 million or 32% annualized during the quarter. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business had a favorable $255 million impact on quarter-end commercial balances. 
Retail balances declined $98 million or 2% annualized as the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits. Following historical trends, growth is expected in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 7, we look at noninterest income, which increased $5 million or 6% compared to the second quarter. Insurance revenues increased noninterest income by $2.8 million, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions as well as the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year. 
Noninterest income also benefited from several categories, including increases of $1.1 million in operating lease income, $1 million from net gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans and $600,000 in bank service charges. 
In addition, the $2 million increase in other was driven by higher income related to a distribution from an acquired equity investment partnership. The primary offset to these positives was a $2.1 million decrease in commercial banking lending fees, primarily due to lower commercial real estate prepayment fees, resulting from a reduced level of pre-activity in our market. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding $3.1 million of merger-related costs, which are reported in professional and outside services, third quarter expenses were $218.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million or 2.5% from the second quarter. Compensation and benefits increased $4.7 million, primarily reflecting the impact of an additional work day and higher benefit-related costs in the third quarter. The higher benefit-related costs were driven in part by one additional payroll in the quarter. The largest offset to these increases was $1.8 million in lower professional and outside services costs due to the timing of certain projects during the quarter. 
Before moving to the next slide, it is important to mention the FDIC rule requiring banks with over $10 billion in assets to be responsible for recapitalizing the deposit insurance fund, which became effective on July 1. We anticipate the impact of the surcharge is expected to increase regulatory assessment expenses by $2.5 million to $3 million per annum. 
On Slide 9, you can see our efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 59.9%, improved 50 basis points from the second quarter and 180 basis points from a year ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. 
Slide 10 is a reminder of our exceptional credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 63 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has continued to improve from recent quarters. 
Net charge-offs improved from our already low levels to 4 basis point, the lowest level in over 9 years. These levels reflect the minimum lost continent in our nonperforming assets. 
As shown on Slide 11, both return on average assets and return on average tangible equity improved for the second consecutive quarter. Return on average assets of 73 basis points increased 3 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and was consistent with the prior year quarter. Return on average tangible equity of 10.7% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter and 20 basis points from a year ago. Notwithstanding these improvements, our returns continued to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continued to be especially strong in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. 
As previously discussed, we plan on issuing $200 million to $250 million of preferreds before year end, enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing our already strong capital position. While all of our regulatory ratios are above internal long-term operating targets, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points to support continued growth. 
On Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive, though slightly less than last quarter. 
We remain well positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel shock scenario as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. 
At quarter and, over 44% of the loan portfolio was either 1-month LIBOR or prime based compared to 43% at June 30 and 41% a year ago. Sustained lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning as evidenced by our long and down scenario on this slide. 
Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I wanted to point out, we revised our estimate for the full year effective tax rate, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.6% for the third quarter. The effective tax rate through 9 months of 2016 is 32.4%, a decrease from 33.4% through the full year of 2015 due to our continued investments in tax reference items. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Jack for closing remarks."

In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, which includes record quarterly net income, improvement in the efficiency ratio to 59.9%, continued loan growth highlighting our diverse business mix, sustained exceptional asset quality and strong deposit growth, along with lower cost of deposit. 
Our integration and closing processes with Suffolk and Gerstein Fisher acquisitions are progressing very well, and we're excited about the expected benefits of each of these transactions. 
We continue to build our readiness to cross the $50 billion asset threshold through our Be 50 B [ph] project, which we discussed in detail last quarter. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual onetime costs. 
We remain committed to consistently returning capital to shareholders, as today, the board declared dividends for the 93rd consecutive quarter. As such, the board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact that it has to the valuation of company shares. Therefore, it is important to remind both current and prospective shareholders, we do not -- we will not move the company past the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend. 
This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

So Jack, I appreciate your comments about New York, that's very helpful.

And there's a dynamic taking place right now that involves the pullback from the New York multifamily portfolio. That's running off, and we're still gauging the pace of that, probably somewhere between $20 million and $40 million a quarter. But we'll see how that goes. It's slowed as of late. On the other hand, we have obviously a large customer base across the rest of the footprint and now, a very strengthened group in New York and we're getting, I'd say, good origination. I expect we'll start seeing some growth in CRE as we go forward. And the only contrary, I guess, or signal I'd give there, the market does seem to be a little slower, a little softer in terms of transactions this year. So that's CRE. C&I is very steady across the middle-market. Starting to see actually a little better progress on business banking. ABL's having a very strong year. Mortgage warehouse is having a very strong year, even though it had a flat quarter, if you will, or a modest quarter. And equipment finance is also doing reasonably well, although slower overall than it has been in the past. And so on the residential and consumer side, the residential side, there's a fair -- there's a shift going on that there's -- the mix of purchase and refi is kind of 50-50 lately. And the volume's strong, the pipelines are strong. The branches tend to do a little less refi -- I'm sorry, a little purchase, so the refi, as it slowed down, I think, is affecting that. We're getting a lot more activity through the mortgage originators, mortgage account officers. And we're adding, as we've told you in the past, mortgage account officers, particularly inside 495 in Boston and in New York. So those -- the numbers of mortgage originators are up fairly considerably. And then, our wholesale business is seeing a good amount of activity as well. So it's a mix of kind of the channels, if you will, in the residential area. And consumer, I think consumer has been flat and continues to be on the flattish side. It tends to build as we build households and it tends to pull back when refi is more active and people tend to roll their home equities outstandings into fixed-rate longer terms. I just want to correct, I said $20 million to $40 million a quarter, and it's a monthly."

The company's performance continues to reflect business momentum generated through our consistent solution-oriented approach to banking. We have always partnered with clients to deliver thoughtful, straightforward solutions that address their financial needs. 
During the quarter, I spent time meeting with our relationship managers and their clients across the footprint, as I often do throughout the year and very much enjoy. These visits enable me to see firsthand how well we are meeting clients' needs. Once again, I came away impressed with the strength of our relationships and the quality of the clients we do business with. The feedback I continually receive is that our approach to banking differentiates us in the market. The combination with our extensive suite of products and services, this approach has enabled us to deepen existing relationships and develop new ones. As a result, we have grown the loan portfolio for 24 consecutive quarters while maintaining exceptional asset quality and over the same period, nearly doubled our deposit base and increased wealth management assets under discretionary management by approximately 40%. 
Now turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Our results for the third quarter reflect further improvements in profitability and continued growth in earning assets. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $74 million, which increased 8% from both the linked and prior year quarters as well as generated a return on average tangible equity of 10.7%. The efficiency ratio of 59.9% reflects a continued gradual improvement in this metric and demonstrates our focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. 
Solid growth in both net interest income and noninterest income drove revenues higher by 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 4% compared to the prior year quarter. Expenses of $218 million, which excludes $3.1 million of merger-related costs, were up approximately 2% from both the second quarter and prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher compensation and benefits costs. 
In the third quarter, we continued to optimize our branch network with the closing of 4 branches. Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 65 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same timeframe, we have opened 26 branches, the majority of which are more cost-efficient in-store branches. We remain confident in our ability to further control costs as the mindset of actively managing expenses has become very much ingrained in the culture of the company. 
The loan portfolio continued to benefit from our diversified business mix. Annualized loan growth during the quarter was 5%, with particularly strong results in residential mortgage as well as commercial and industrial lending. On an average basis, annualized loan growth was 8%. 
Looking ahead, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations. With pipelines ending the quarter at very solid levels, our current view is for the trend to continue. Our success gathering deposits was evidenced by annualized growth of 9% from the end of the second quarter while the cost of deposits declined 1 basis point. Recently released FDIC deposit data show our market share percentages either increased or remained consistent in each state we operate. We are particularly pleased with our continued #1 market share position in Fairfield County, Connecticut and the state of Vermont. 
Before turning the call over to David to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to comment on our pending acquisitions. The closing and integration processes of the Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher transaction are progressing very well. We are working closely with teams at each firm to execute our time-tested acquisition approach. We expect to close Gerstein Fisher in early November and continue to move towards closing Suffolk pending regulatory approvals. 
As a result of these integration activities over the past few months, we have come away even more excited about the expected benefits of each of these transactions, particularly the talented people that will be joining us. Each of these transactions will further grow and strengthen People's United in the New York Metro area. 
Since the beginning of 2010, we have made substantial progress in expanding our New York franchise both organically and via acquisitions. Over this time, we built C&I and commercial real estate teams in the New York Metro area, entered Manhattan with a branch on Park Avenue, and incorporated our broader set of products and training into the branches we acquired in the 2010 Smithtown and 2012 Citizens branch transactions. Additionally, we have hired local talent that both knows the markets and is well known in the market. 
Collectively, these investments over the last 6 years have enabled us to significantly grow our New York loan portfolio and deposit base. This progress gives us even greater confidence in our ability to successfully continue to move our franchise forward in the New York Metro area. 
With that, I'll pass it to David."

Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income increased $5.3 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by ongoing loan growth. Net interest income also benefited $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarte",1316,"Thank you, Jack. 
Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income increased $5.3 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by ongoing loan growth. Net interest income also benefited $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter and $400,000 from lower deposit cost, primarily as a result of higher average noninterest-bearing deposit balances. Furthermore, it is important to note, the increase in LIBOR rate had a modest favorable impact on net interest income of approximately $1 million in the third quarter. The primary offset to these increases was a $1.4 million decline and accretion from runoff of the acquired portfolio. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by $800,000 in higher borrowing costs and $500,000 from lower yields in the securities portfolio. 
Moving to Slide 4. Net interest margin of 2.80% increased 1 basis point from the second quarter. A higher loan portfolio yield and the additional calendar day in the third quarter each benefited the margin by 2 basis points, while the lower securities portfolio yield and higher borrowing costs collectively reduced the margin by 3 basis points. 
On Slide 5, you can see loan balances increased $330 million or 5% annualized from June 30, with growth in both our retail and commercial portfolios. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $376 million.  Retail contributed $234 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $249 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. 
As we have grown our residential mortgage portfolio in recent years, originations continue to be very high quality. The portfolio's LTV and FICO metrics have remained consistent, and the overwhelming majority of business retained on the balance sheet continues to be hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 
For originated loans added to the portfolio during the first 9 months of 2016, the average LTV is 68% and the average FICO is 762. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $142 million, driven by C&I growth of $141 million. We experienced solid production across several C&I categories, including large corporate, middle-market and asset-based lending. 
While end of period mortgage warehouse balances of $1.2 billion were consistent with June 30, average balances for the quarter were up $117 million. 
We experienced acquired loan runoff of $46 million this quarter compared to $73 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $645 million. 
Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment. Deposits grew $657 million or 9% on an annualized basis during the third quarter, primarily due to higher noninterest-bearing and municipal balances. 
Commercial continued to benefit from franchise-wide deposit-gathering efforts and grew $755 million or 32% annualized during the quarter. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business had a favorable $255 million impact on quarter-end commercial balances. 
Retail balances declined $98 million or 2% annualized as the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits. Following historical trends, growth is expected in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 7, we look at noninterest income, which increased $5 million or 6% compared to the second quarter. Insurance revenues increased noninterest income by $2.8 million, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions as well as the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year. 
Noninterest income also benefited from several categories, including increases of $1.1 million in operating lease income, $1 million from net gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans and $600,000 in bank service charges. 
In addition, the $2 million increase in other was driven by higher income related to a distribution from an acquired equity investment partnership. The primary offset to these positives was a $2.1 million decrease in commercial banking lending fees, primarily due to lower commercial real estate prepayment fees, resulting from a reduced level of pre-activity in our market. 
On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding $3.1 million of merger-related costs, which are reported in professional and outside services, third quarter expenses were $218.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million or 2.5% from the second quarter. Compensation and benefits increased $4.7 million, primarily reflecting the impact of an additional work day and higher benefit-related costs in the third quarter. The higher benefit-related costs were driven in part by one additional payroll in the quarter. The largest offset to these increases was $1.8 million in lower professional and outside services costs due to the timing of certain projects during the quarter. 
Before moving to the next slide, it is important to mention the FDIC rule requiring banks with over $10 billion in assets to be responsible for recapitalizing the deposit insurance fund, which became effective on July 1. We anticipate the impact of the surcharge is expected to increase regulatory assessment expenses by $2.5 million to $3 million per annum. 
On Slide 9, you can see our efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 59.9%, improved 50 basis points from the second quarter and 180 basis points from a year ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. 
Slide 10 is a reminder of our exceptional credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 63 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has continued to improve from recent quarters. 
Net charge-offs improved from our already low levels to 4 basis point, the lowest level in over 9 years. These levels reflect the minimum lost continent in our nonperforming assets. 
As shown on Slide 11, both return on average assets and return on average tangible equity improved for the second consecutive quarter. Return on average assets of 73 basis points increased 3 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and was consistent with the prior year quarter. Return on average tangible equity of 10.7% increased 60 basis points from the second quarter and 20 basis points from a year ago. Notwithstanding these improvements, our returns continued to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. 
Turning to Slide 12. Capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continued to be especially strong in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. 
As previously discussed, we plan on issuing $200 million to $250 million of preferreds before year end, enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing our already strong capital position. While all of our regulatory ratios are above internal long-term operating targets, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points to support continued growth. 
On Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive, though slightly less than last quarter. 
We remain well positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel shock scenario as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. 
At quarter and, over 44% of the loan portfolio was either 1-month LIBOR or prime based compared to 43% at June 30 and 41% a year ago. Sustained lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning as evidenced by our long and down scenario on this slide. 
Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I wanted to point out, we revised our estimate for the full year effective tax rate, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.6% for the third quarter. The effective tax rate through 9 months of 2016 is 32.4%, a decrease from 33.4% through the full year of 2015 due to our continued investments in tax reference items. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Jack for closing remarks."

In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, which includes record quarterly net income, improvement in the efficiency ratio to 59.9%, continued loan growth highlighting our diverse business mix, sustained exceptional asset quality and strong deposit growth, along with lower cost of deposit. 
Our integration and closing processes with Suffolk and Gerstein Fisher acquisitions are progressing very well, and we're excited about the expected benefits of each of these transactions. 
We continue to build our readiness to cross the $50 billion asset threshold through our Be 50 B [ph] project, which we discussed in detail last quarter. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual onetime costs. 
We remain committed to consistently returning capital to shareholders, as today, the board declared dividends for the 93rd consecutive quarter. As such, the board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact that it has to the valuation of company shares. Therefore, it is important to remind both current and prospective shareholders, we do not -- we will not move the company past the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend. 
This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions."

And there's a dynamic taking place right now that involves the pullback from the New York multifamily portfolio. That's running off, and we're still gauging the pace of that, probably somewhere between $20 million and $40 million a quarter. But we'll see how that goes. It's slowed as of late. On the other hand, we have obviously a large customer base across the rest of the footprint and now, a very strengthened group in New York and we're getting, I'd say, good origination. I expect we'll start seeing some growth in CRE as we go forward. And the only contrary, I guess, or signal I'd give there, the market does seem to be a little slower, a little softer in terms of transactions this year. So that's CRE. C&I is very steady across the middle-market. Starting to see actually a little better progress on business banking. ABL's having a very strong year. Mortgage warehouse is having a very strong year, even though it had a flat quarter, if you will, or a modest quarter. And equipment finance is also doing reasonably well, although slower overall than it has been in the past. And so on the residential and consumer side, the residential side, there's a fair -- there's a shift going on that there's -- the mix of purchase and refi is kind of 50-50 lately. And the volume's strong, the pipelines are strong. The branches tend to do a little less refi -- I'm sorry, a little purchase, so the refi, as it slowed down, I think, is affecting that. We're getting a lot more activity through the mortgage originators, mortgage account officers. And we're adding, as we've told you in the past, mortgage account officers, particularly inside 495 in Boston and in New York. So those -- the numbers of mortgage originators are up fairly considerably. And then, our wholesale business is seeing a good amount of activity as well. So it's a mix of kind of the channels, if you will, in the residential area. And consumer, I think consumer has been flat and continues to be on the flattish side. It tends to build as we build households and it tends to pull back when refi is more active and people tend to roll their home equities outstandings into fixed-rate longer terms. I just want to correct, I said $20 million to $40 million a quarter, and it's a monthly."

It's too early to call a bottom in the NIM. There still is a small and shrinking differential between the existing loan portfolio and new business. And you are correct, you saw about an 8 basis point decline quarter-over-quarter in security portfolio yield. So the way I would answer the question is, our revised guidance on the margins was $275 million to $285 million in July and it looks like we're on track to be right there in the middle of that guidance, plus or minus."

So there's a little bit of that in that line. That was about a little over $3 million in the quarter. There's a lot of little things that go through there. Credit card fees is probably the one of the larger drivers. That's been growing. We've talked about that before, where a few quarters ago, we entered an agreement with Elan, and we're getting a lot of traction in our customer base adopting the credit card offering that we now have. That was almost nonexistent over the last couple of years. That's the primary driver, but the rest of the stuff are fees around some retail, home equity, de-locked [ph] account, things like -- things of that nature."
