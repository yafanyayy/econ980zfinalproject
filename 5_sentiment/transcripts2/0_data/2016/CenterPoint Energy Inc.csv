Welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today. 
Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Bill Rogers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our fourth quarter 2015 results and provide highlights on other key areas. We also have with us other members of management who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks. 
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides which can be found under the Investor section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides which, along with our Form 10-K, have been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and we encourage you to review the information on our website. 
Today management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. 
We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The utility operations guidance range considers performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, volumes, commodity prices, ancillary services, tax rates, interest rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, the value of ZENS securities and their related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market in any inventory. 
In providing Midstream investment guidance related to the company's 55.4% ownership interest company takes into account factors as enables public forecast effective tax rate, amortization of basic difference in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, impairments or Enable Midstream's unusual items. 
Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2015 was a strong year for CenterPoint.

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 2015 was a strong year for CenterPoint. Our utility operations performed well, helping us to achieve our earnings objective on a guidance basis by earning at the top end of our guidance range. 
Enable made a strong contribution to our earnings as well, falling in the middle of the guidance range we have provided at the start of 2015. 
Using the same basis that we used for providing guidance, full year adjusted earnings were $475 million, or $1.10 per diluted share. During 2015 we were focused on creating shareholder value through sustainable earnings growth. Our intention remains to grow annual EPS 4% to 6% through 2018. 
Given the reduction in Enable's unit price throughout the year, we recorded noncash impairment charges in both the third and fourth quarters of 2015. As a result this morning we reported a loss of $692 million, or a loss of $1.61 per diluted share for 2015, compared with net income of $611 million or $1.42 per diluted share in 2014. Bill will discuss more about the impairments later on in the call. 
Slide 4 highlights several of the components that drove our 2015 performance. We continue to see strong customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined our utilities added nearly 80,000 [ph] new customers in 2015. Our collective rate base grew 10%. We obtained $90 [ph] million in annualized rate relief, excluding $48 million of interim rate relief in Minnesota that will be decided upon in 2016. 
Further we continue to focus attention on O&M and financing costs. 
The collective impact of these components led to 2015 Utility Operations earnings of $0.79 per diluted share, compared with baseline 2014 utility earnings of $0.70 per share, an increase of nearly 13%. Each year we conduct an annual assessment and prioritization of capital needs, driven by requirements around safety, growth, maintenance and reliability. As you will see in Tracy's and Joe's slides, our planned capital expenditures for the upcoming years, while remaining well above historic levels, will be down from the peak expenditure level of 2015. Associated with this reduction, we anticipate our utility rate base growth will more closely track utility earnings growth, allowing us to maintain our 4% to 6% earnings growth target for CenterPoint Energy as a whole. Our plan assumes we maintain ROEs at or near our allowed returns.
On Slide 5, you can see EPS on a guidance basis for last year as well as our target for 2016. The percentage of earnings from our utilities is expected to increase from about 65% in 2014 to 75% to 80% in 2016. Also, the utilities provided over 80% of the cash flow in 2015. As our utilities continue to grow, they provide a larger balance that can help mitigate additional commodity-driven earnings challenges that may impact Enable.
Our 2016 EPS guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 represent solid growth following a very strong performance in 2015. We anticipate this growth will be built upon many of the same factors that drove us forward in 2015: growing service territories; management of capital; and timely recovery on and of our investments. These factors will continue to be aided by ongoing attention to financing and operating costs. 
Turning to Midstream Investments. We believe continued focus on Enable's financial performance and balance sheet strength translates into value for CenterPoint Energy shareholders. Despite the commodity environment, Enable remains financially sound with solid fundamentals and encouraging operating statistics. 
I've noted some of the key take aways from Enable's call last week on Slide 6. Producers remain active within Enable's footprint. Currently there are 28 rigs drilling wells to connect to Enable's system in the Anadarko basin. Enable's processing and transportation volumes are up over 2014 and their bare den system in the Bakken has increased volumes by 6,500 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
From a financing perspective, Enable will have no debt maturities due this year or in 2017, and as of year-end 2015, reported $1.2 billion of available under the credit facility. 
CenterPoint's core strategy remains to operate, maintain and invest in our current utility service territories, deploying capital to arrest needs for system growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer interactions.
Beyond our core strategy, we continue to look for additional opportunities to grow earnings. 
On Slide -- as shown on Slide 7, we recently announced 2 transactions that demonstrate our commitment to pursuing sustainable earnings growth. First, we announced we would be using funds paid to us by Enable for outstanding debt to invest in a preferred security at Enable. This is an accretive investment for CenterPoint shareholders with a return of 10%. Additionally we announced an earnings accretive acquisition of continuums retail energy business, which expands our profitable, low-risk, Energy Services business. 
As for our announcement about strategic reviews, over the past 12 to 18 months, we've been asked by many investors about 2 topics: Enable's fit within our portfolio; and separately, whether we would consider forming a REIT for utility assets. In response, we have announced we will independently study each for sustainable value creation. I want to stress that we are in the evaluation stage. Long-term shareholder value creation and long-term business model sustainability are top priorities in our evaluation process. We will not pursue actions that provide only short-term financial benefits or that will negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and address the growing needs of our vibrant service territories. We do not plan to answer questions, as premature discussions could prove confusing and distracting to the process. We plan to share as we reach conclusions. And while we have no definitive time line, we anticipate providing an update during the second half of 2016.
Turning to Slide 8, I will conclude my comments by acknowledging the commitment and accomplishments of our employees. Their dedication to our vision of leadership can be seen through the awards we have received. For example, JD Power & Associates, which measures customer satisfaction, ranked each of our gas distribution companies in the top 4 in their respective regions. We ranked first  in operational satisfaction in natural gas operations, and were named an environmental champion by Cogent Energy Reports in the Midwest. Cogent also identified our electric utility as ranking #1 in Texas for customer engagement. Effective customer service strengthens our relationships with our customers and reinforces with regulators our commitment to provide reliability service to the communities we serve. In closing, let me reiterate that we remain committed to our vision, to lead the nation in delivering energy service and value. We will continue to invest in our energy delivery systems to better serve our customers and to seek timely recovery of those investments. 
Tracy will now update you on Electric Operations."
279513,321594530,942255,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. 2015 was another strong year for Houston Electric. As you see on Slide 10, core operating income was $502 million in 2015 compared to $477 million in 2014, representing a 5% increase. The business benefited from higher transmission and d",444,"Thank you, Scott. 2015 was another strong year for Houston Electric. As you see on Slide 10, core operating income was $502 million in 2015 compared to $477 million in 2014, representing a 5% increase. The business benefited from higher transmission and distribution-related revenues, customer growth and increased usage due to a return to more normal weather. These benefits were partially offset by lower equity return related to true-up proceeds, lower energy efficiency bonus including the absence of a onetime energy efficiency bonus received in 2014, higher depreciation and lower right-of-way revenues. 
Turning to Slide 11. Houston Electric added nearly 50,000 metered customers last year, which equates to 2% year-over-year growth. The Houston area added 27,000 net new jobs last year, and the greater Houston partnership is projecting approximately 22,000 net new jobs this year, mostly from the health care and construction industries. We anticipate approximately 2% metered customer growth in 2016. Recent monthly meter additions support that planned growth rate. 
We continue to meet O&M expense management goals. Houston Electric held O&M expenses flat last year compared to 2014, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We will continue our efforts in 2016 as we work to keep annual interim expense growth under 2%. 
Last year, Houston Electric received approval for approximately $67 million in annualized transmission and distribution-related rate relief. About 90% of our capital investment is eligible for recovery using our annual cost recovery mechanisms, Transmission Cost of Service, or TCOS, and Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, or DCRF. We expect to file DCRF in April and TCOS in the second half this year. We do not anticipate that Houston Electric general rate filing in 2016, 2017 or 2018. 
Turning to Slide 12. Houston Electric invested $934 million of capital in 2015, which represents a 14% increase over 2014 primarily due to load growth investments. Our new 5-year plan includes $3.7 billion of capital expenditures. This investment will be used to improve service reliability and system resiliency and support load growth and ongoing system maintenance.
Right-of-way work has begun on the largest project in our capital plan, the Brazos Valley Connection. Last month, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved a certificate of convenience and necessity for Houston Electric to construct this project. We anticipate total capital spend of $270 million to $310 million and completion by mid-2018.
As you'll see on Slide 13, rate base is projected to grow at a 5.2% compound annual growth rate through the 5-year plan. I am very pleased with Houston Electric's performance in 2015 and our forecast for 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe McGoldrick for an update on natural gas operations."
279513,321594530,942255,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business had another strong year. Natural gas utilities operating income in 2015 was $273 million compared to $287 million in 2014",848,"Thank you, Tracy. Natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business had another strong year. Natural gas utilities operating income in 2015 was $273 million compared to $287 million in 2014. 
As you will see on Slide 15, $25 million of the decline in operating income is primarily due to a return to more normal weather in 2015 when compared to the extreme weather in the first half of 2014.
Rate relief, customer growth and other revenues added to operating income, but were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and other taxes. 
Customer growth remained strong at our utilities, having added nearly 30,000 customers since the fourth quarter of 2014, a 1% increase. The strongest growth occurred in Minnesota and Texas and we expect similar growth or approximately 1% in the foreseeable future. 
We managed operating cost effectively in 2015. O&M expenses were flat versus 2014, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We remain committed to disciplined O&M expense management.
We continue to invest in infrastructure and technology. For example, our natural gas utilities completed the deployment of drive-by meter reading technology to 3.4 million meters. And we continue with our pipeline replacement projects, such as cast iron and bear steel in Arkansas and our Minnesota beltline project. These investments are improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our gas distribution system. 
We are also executing on our multi-jurisdictional regulatory strategy, filing base rate increase request in Minnesota and Arkansas, as well as annual grip filings and other annual mechanisms. In 2015, approximately 90% of our capital spend was eligible for recovery through a combination of annual mechanisms and forward test years.
The general rate case that was filed last year in Minnesota requesting a $54.1 [ph] million annual increase is on track and we expect third quarter of 2016. Interim rates of $47.8 million went into effect in October of last year.
Additionally, we filed a general rate case in Arkansas in November 2015. This is the first general rate filing we have made there since 2007, requesting $35.6 million in annualized rate recovery. As part of the filing, we requested approval of a formula rate plan as allowed by a new legislation. The formula rate plan will allow our rates to be prospectively adjusted based on abandoned ROE approach in a projected test year. We expect the final decision in new base rates to be implemented in the third quarter of 2016.
Turning to Slide 16. We invested $601 million in our natural gas utilities last year, which represents a 14% increase over 2014. The increase was a combination of growth activity and public improvement projects, primarily in Minnesota and Texas, in addition to system maintenance activities across all jurisdictions. Our revised 5-year capital plan includes $2.3 billion. We are prioritizing capital investments with a focus on safety, reliability and growth. And with our automated meter reading capital project now complete, and public improvement expenditures expected to decline, our 2016 capital will return to a more normal level.
As you can see on Slide 17, rate base is projected to grow on a 6.2% compound annual growth rate through the 5-year plan. We anticipate that capital prioritization and effective implementation of our regulatory strategy will result in convergence of rate base growth and operating income growth over the next 5 years. 
On Slide 18, you'll see that 2015 operating income for Energy Services business was $38 million compared to $23 million in 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $4 million and $29 million, respectively.
Our energy services business realized solid customer growth and has increased operating income substantially over the last few [ph] years. The business also benefited from improved margins, a reduction in O&M expense and a lower inventory adjustment in 2015. 
Energy services is a profitable business segment that complements our gas distribution business and allows us to provide gas purchase options to CenterPoint customers across multiple states. We have worked hard to grow the commercial retail business within energy services, including by entering into an agreement to acquire Continuum's Retail Energy Services business subject to customary closing conditions. With similar business models and a commitment to customer service, this transaction positions energy services to have access to more market and officially grow our customer base by over 30% across 26 states. Moreover, our business this year has a common footprint and we expect to capture synergies and reduce G&A over time as we leverage economies of scale. Transactions expected to increase annual gross margin by approximately 40%. With the addition of Continuum, we expect energy services to contribute $40 million to $50 million of annual operating income. Details for the transaction are provided on Slide 19.
Our natural gas operations achieved strong operational and financial results in 2015. We are confident that our businesses will continue to grow in 2016 and beyond, as we continue to enhance service to our customers and communities and create long-term value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Bill who will cover financial activities."
279513,321594530,942255,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin by summarizing comments from Scott, Tracy and Joe, to review the contributories to our Utility Operations performance from our baseline of $0.70 [ph] per share in 2014 to 79% [ph] per share delive",897,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin by summarizing comments from Scott, Tracy and Joe, to review the contributories to our Utility Operations performance from our baseline of $0.70 [ph] per share in 2014 to 79% [ph] per share delivered in 2015. 
The primary contributors to this EPS growth were: A $0.06 year-on-year improvement in Houston Electric; and a $0.05 year-on-year improvement in Energy services. These improvements were offset in part by higher income taxes.
As noted by Tracy and Joe, holding O&M flat contributed to the year-on-year EPS performance at our Utility Operations. 
As we have shared with you in the past several quarters, we are working on delivering consistent 4% to 6% annual EPS growth. On Slide 21, you'll see a few points regarding our guidance. Our 4% to 6% growth target begins with the 2015 EPS on a guidance basis of $1.10 per share. The $0.02 net accretion from our investment Enable preferred, plus net of $0.04 from our combined Utility Operations in Midstream Investment, brings us to the midpoint of our 2016 EPS guidance. The EPS from the Utility Operations is expected to increase, whereas the EPS from our Midstream Investment is expected to decline.
As Scott noted in his comments, strong performance from Utility Operations, which is 80% of our EPS guidance, is expected to offset the anticipated decline in the EPS at Midstream Investments.
I will also provide some detail on the components of our EPS guidance. For Utility Operations, the midpoint of 2016's $0.88 to $0.92 EPS forecast relative to $0.79 in 2015 consist of: $0.05 from operating income; $0.02 from lower interest expense; and $0.04 from the dividend income associated with our recent preferred investment in Enable. 
For our Midstream Investments, Enable provided their earnings forecast on their February 17 earnings call. This earnings forecast translated into $0.19 to $0.25 EPS for CenterPoint after accruing for income taxes. That forecast range, plus the accounting income of accretion, translates into our guidance of $0.24 to $0.28 for the Midstream contribution to our combined 2016 EPS estimate.
There are certain factors which drive variation within the guidance range, which we have included in our disclosure and on Page 21. Lower commodity prices are a primary example of this. If oil prices declined to $20 per barrel, we anticipate EPS from Midstream Investments would be at the low end of the $0.24 to $0.28 range. Similarly, continued favorable interest rates versus the year end forward curves, or exceeding our goals for Continuum integration and customer retention, could move our Utility Operations EPS to the high end of their range. As with 2015, we are confident in our ability to deliver within our guidance range under a variety of circumstances.
Turning to Slide 22. CenterPoint's fourth quarter 2015 earnings reflects a pretax noncash impairment charge of $984 million, all related to our investment in Enable and Midstream. This impairment recognizes the decline in the estimated fair value of our balance sheet investment, which was $15.41 per unit as of September 30, 2015. With an Enable unit price of just over $9 at year-end, it was appropriate for us to again review the investment for impairment. With these noncash charges, we have reduced our balance sheet investment in Enable and Midstream from $3.6 billion to $2.6 billion. The new, per-unit value of $11.09, as of year end, is calculated using multiple methods and includes the value of our limited partner common and subordinated units and our general partner and incentive distribution rights.
Importantly, these impairments do not affect the company's liquidity, cash flow or compliance with debt covenants. After the impairment, the equity percentage and the capital structure is 36% at CenterPoint. And at the CERC level, the impairment, along with the recent $363 million dividend from CERC to the holding company provides a pro forma equity capital of 55% at CERC. 
On Slide 23, we provide a forecast of our financing plans. Importantly, we do not anticipate issuing equity in 2016. Part of the reason for this is the strength of our cash flow in 2015 and our expectations for some elevated strong cash flow from operations in 2016. To illustrate this, in 2015 CenterPoint made record capital investments of nearly $1.6 billion. Our cash flow covered all capital expenditures in 2015. As a result, our net increase in borrowings were only $330 million. 
We anticipate continued strong cash flow in upcoming years, with forecasted of net debt only $150 million by year-end 2016. With this limited net increase in debt, our cash flow coverages and balance sheet are protected to further improve relative to 2015. 
During 2015, we worked to provide for a more flexible debt structure. This resulted in similar interest expense in 2015 relative to 2014 despite increased borrowings. And, as I mentioned in previous comments, we anticipate continuing to lower interest expense in 2016. 
With respect to income tax provisions, Slide 24 also notes our 2015 effective tax rates as well as the anticipated 36% effective tax rate for 2016.
I will close by reminding you of the $0.2575 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 20. This represents a 4% increase over the previous quarterly dividend and marks the 11th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to David."

Then we take a look at CERC's balance sheet and track at what's the appropriate strength of that balance sheet. And through its earnings cash flow, determine how much we would dividend out of CERC out of any given year. As I said, after the impairment and the pro forma for the dividend distribution associated with Enable's paying down debt over to CERC, their balance sheet is a 55%. So we start with that balance sheet. on the Houston Electric side, again it depends upon their sources and uses of cash as well as their earnings for the year. But we target to maintain a 45% equity of the capital, and then dividend the funds after that. Now going to the dividend, which clearly is paid out of the holding company, whether there's borrowings from the holding company or whether it's fully sourced from CERC and Houston Electric would depend on how much dividend they make and the borrowings with the holding company make up for that."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.2015 was a strong year for CenterPoint. Our utility operations performed well, helping us to achieve our earn",1152,"Thank you, David, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
2015 was a strong year for CenterPoint. Our utility operations performed well, helping us to achieve our earnings objective on a guidance basis by earning at the top end of our guidance range.
Enable made a strong contribution to our earnings as well, falling in the middle of the guidance range we had provided at the start of 2015.
Using the same basis that we use when providing guidance, full year adjusted earnings were $475 million or $1.10 per diluted share. During 2015 we were focused on creating shareholder value through sustainable earnings growth. Our intention remains to grow annual EPS 4% to 6% through 2018.
Given the reduction in Enable's unit price throughout the year, we recorded noncash impairment charges in both the third and fourth quarters of 2015. As a result, this morning we reported a loss of $692 million or a loss of $1.61 per diluted share for 2015, compared with net income of $611 million or $1.42 per diluted share in 2014. Bill will discuss more about the impairments later in the call.
Slide 4 highlights several of the components that drove our 2015 performance. We continue to see strong customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added nearly 80,000 new customers in 2015. Our collective rate base grew 10%. We obtained $90 million in annualized rate relief, excluding $48 million of interim rate relief in Minnesota that will be decided upon in 2016. Further we continued to focus attention on O&M and financing costs.
The collective impact of these components led to 2015 Utility Operations earnings of $0.79 per diluted share compared with baseline 2014 utility earnings of $0.70 per share, an increase of nearly 13%. Each year we conduct an annual assessment and prioritization of capital needs, driven by requirements around safety, growth, maintenance and reliability. As you will see in Tracy's and Joe's slides, our planned capital expenditures for the upcoming years, while remaining well above historic levels, will be down from the peak expenditure level of 2015. Associated with this reduction, we anticipate our utility rate base growth will more closely track utility earnings growth, allowing us to maintain our 4% to 6% earnings growth target for CenterPoint Energy as a whole. Our plan assumes we maintain ROEs at or near our allowed returns.
On Slide 5, you can see EPS on a guidance basis for last year as well as our target for 2016. The percentage of earnings from our utilities is expected to increase from about 65% in 2014 to 75% to 80% in 2016. Also, the utilities provided over 80% of the cash flow in 2015. As our utilities continue to grow, they provide a larger ballast that can help mitigate additional commodity-driven earnings challenges that may impact Enable.
Our 2016 EPS guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 represent solid growth following a very strong performance in 2015. We anticipate this growth will be built upon many of the same factors that drove us forward in 2015: growing service territories; management of capital; and timely recovery on and of our investments. These factors will continue to be aided by ongoing attention to financing and operating costs.
Turning to Midstream Investments. We believe continued focus on Enable's financial performance and balance sheet strength translates to the value for CenterPoint Energy shareholders. Despite the commodity environment, Enable remains financially sound, with solid fundamentals and encouraging operating statistics.
I've noted some of the key take aways from Enable's call last week on Slide 6. Producers remain active within Enable's footprint. Currently, there are 28 rigs drilling wells to connect to Enable's system in the Anadarko basin. Enable's processing and transportation volumes are up over 2014, and their Bear Den system in the Bakken has increased volumes by 6,500 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2015.
From a financing perspective, Enable will have no debt maturities due this year or in 2017 and as of year-end 2015, reported $1.2 billion available under their credit facility.
CenterPoint's core strategy remains to operate, maintain and invest in our current utility service territories, deploying capital to address needs for system growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer interactions. Beyond our core strategy, we continue to look for additional opportunities to grow earnings.
On Slide -- as shown on Slide 7, we recently announced 2 transactions that demonstrate our commitment to pursuing sustainable earnings growth. First, we announced we will be using funds paid to us by Enable for outstanding debt to invest in a preferred security at Enable. This is an accretive investment for CenterPoint shareholders with a return of 10%. Additionally, we announced an earnings-accretive acquisition of Continuum's retail energy business, which expands our profitable, low-risk, Energy Services business.
As for our announcement about strategic reviews, over the past 12 to 18 months, we've been asked by many investors about 2 topics: Enable's fit within our portfolio; and separately, whether we would consider forming a REIT for utility assets. In response, we have announced we will independently study each for sustainable value creation. I want to stress that we are in the evaluation stage. Long-term shareholder value creation and long-term business model sustainability are top priorities in our evaluation process. We will not pursue actions that provide only short-term financial benefits or that will negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and address the growing needs of our vibrant service territories. We do not plan to answer questions as premature discussions could prove confusing and distracting to the process. We plan to share as we reach conclusions, and while we have no definitive time line, we anticipate providing an update during the second half of 2016.
Turning to Slide 8, I will conclude my comments by acknowledging the commitment and accomplishments of our employees. Their dedication to our vision of leadership could be seen through the awards we have received. For example, J.D. Power and Associates, which measures customer satisfaction, ranked each of our gas distribution companies in the top 4 in their respective regions. We ranked first in operational satisfaction in natural gas operations and were named an environmental champion by Cogent Energy Reports in the Midwest. Cogent also identified our electric utility as ranking #1 in Texas for customer engagement. Effective customer service strengthens our relationships with our customers and reinforces with regulators our commitment to provide reliability utility service to the communities we serve.
In closing, let me reiterate that we remain committed to our vision, to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We will continue to invest in our energy delivery systems to better serve our customers and to seek timely recovery of those investments.
Tracy will now update you on Electric Operations."

As you will see on Slide 10, core operating income was $502 million in 2015 compared to $477 million in 2014, representing a 5% increase. The business benefited from higher transmission",446,"Thank you, Scott.
2015 was another strong year for Houston Electric. As you will see on Slide 10, core operating income was $502 million in 2015 compared to $477 million in 2014, representing a 5% increase. The business benefited from higher transmission and distribution-related revenues, customer growth and increased usage due to a return to more normal weather. These benefits were partially offset by lower equity return related to true-up proceeds, lower energy efficiency bonus including the absence of a onetime energy efficiency bonus received in 2014, higher depreciation and lower right-of-way revenues.
Turning to Slide 11. Houston Electric added nearly 50,000 metered customers last year, which equates to 2% year-over-year growth. The Houston area added 27,000 net new jobs last year, and the greater Houston partnership is projecting approximately 22,000 net new jobs this year, mostly from the health care and construction industries. We anticipate approximately 2% metered customer growth in 2016. Recent monthly meter additions support that planned growth rate.
We continue to meet O&M expense management goals. Houston Electric held O&M expenses flat last year compared to 2014, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We will continue our efforts in 2016 as we work to keep annual O&M expense growth under 2%.
Last year, Houston Electric received approval for approximately $67 million in annualized transmission and distribution-related rate relief. About 90% of our capital investment is eligible for recovery using our annual cost recovery mechanisms, Transmission Cost of Service, or TCOS, and Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, or DCRF. We expect to file DCRF in April and TCOS in the second half this year. We do not anticipate a Houston Electric general rate filing in 2016, 2017 or 2018.
Turning to Slide 12. Houston Electric invested $934 million of capital in 2015, which represents a 14% increase over 2014, primarily due to load growth investments. Our new 5-year plan includes $3.7 billion of capital expenditures. This investment will be used to improve service reliability and system resiliency and support load growth and ongoing system maintenance.
Right-of-way work has begun on the largest project in our capital plan, the Brazos Valley Connection. Last month, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for Houston Electric to construct this project. We anticipate total capital spend of $270 million to $310 million and completion by mid-2018.
As you will see on Slide 13, rate base is projected to grow at a 5.2% compound annual growth rate through the 5-year plan. I am very pleased with Houston Electric's performance in 2015 and our forecast for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Joe McGoldrick for an update on natural gas operations."
279513,321594530,942704,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy.Natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, had another strong year. Natural gas utilities operating income in 2015 was $273 million compared to $287 million in 20",853,"Thank you, Tracy.
Natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, had another strong year. Natural gas utilities operating income in 2015 was $273 million compared to $287 million in 2014.
As you will see on Slide 15, $25 million of the decline in operating income is primarily due to a return to more normal weather in 2015 when compared to the extreme weather in the first half of 2014.
Rate relief, customer growth and other revenues added to operating income but were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and other taxes.
Customer growth remained strong at our utilities, having added nearly 30,000 customers since the fourth quarter of 2014, a 1% increase. The strongest growth occurred in Minnesota and Texas, and we expect similar growth or approximately 1% in the foreseeable future.
We managed operating cost effectively in 2015. O&M expenses were flat versus 2014, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We remain committed to disciplined O&M expense management.
We continue to invest in infrastructure and technology. For example, our natural gas utilities completed the deployment of drive-by meter reading technology to 3.4 million meters. And we continue with our pipeline replacement projects, such as cast iron and bare steel in Arkansas and our Minnesota beltline project. These investments are improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our gas distribution system.
We are also executing on our multi-jurisdictional regulatory strategy, filing base rate increase request in Minnesota and Arkansas as well as annual grip filings and other annual mechanisms. In 2015, approximately 90% of our capital spend was eligible for recovery through a combination of annual mechanisms and forward test years.
The general rate case that was filed last year in Minnesota, requesting a $54.1 million annual increase, is on track, and we expect to file an order in the third quarter of 2016. Interim rates of $47.8 million went into effect in October of last year.
Additionally, we filed a general rate case in Arkansas in November 2015. This is the first general rate filing we have made there since 2007, requesting $35.6 million in annualized rate recovery. As part of the filing, we requested approval of a formula rate plan as allowed by a new legislation. The formula rate plan will allow our rates to be prospectively adjusted based on a banded ROE approach in a projected test year. We expect the final decision in new base rates to be implemented in the third quarter of 2016.
Turning to Slide 16. We invested $601 million in our natural gas utilities last year, which represents a 14% increase over 2014. The increase was a combination of growth activity and public improvement projects, primarily in Minnesota and Texas, in addition to system maintenance activities across all jurisdictions. Our revised 5-year capital plan includes $2.3 billion. We are prioritizing capital investments, with a focus on safety, reliability and growth. And with our automated meter reading capital project now complete and public improvement expenditures expected to decline, our 2016 capital will return to a more normal level.
As you can see on Slide 17, rate base is projected to grow on a 6.2% compound annual growth rate through the 5-year plan. We anticipate that capital prioritization and effective implementation of our regulatory strategy will result in convergence of rate base growth and operating income growth over the next 5 years.
On Slide 18, you'll see that 2015 operating income for our Energy Services business was $38 million compared to $23 million in 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $4 million and $29 million, respectively.
Our energy services business realized solid customer growth and has increased operating income substantially over the last two years. The business also benefited from improved margins, a reduction in O&M expense and a lower inventory adjustment in 2015.
Energy Services is a profitable business segment that complements our gas distribution business and allows us to provide gas purchase options to CenterPoint customers across multiple states. We have worked hard to grow the commercial retail business within Energy Services, including by entering into an agreement to acquire Continuum's Retail Energy Services business, subject to customary closing conditions. With similar business models and a commitment to customer service, this transaction positions Energy Services to have access to more markets and officially grow our customer base by over 30% across 26 states. Moreover, our businesses share a common footprint, and we expect to capture synergies and reduce G&A over time as we leverage economies of scale. Transactions is expected to increase annual gross margin by approximately 40%. With the addition of Continuum, we expect Energy Services to contribute $40 million to $50 million of annual operating income. Details for the transaction are provided on Slide 19.
Our natural gas operations achieved strong operational and financial results in 2015. We are confident that our businesses will continue to grow in 2016 and beyond as we continue to enhance service to our customers and communities and create long-term value for our stakeholders.
I will now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial activities."
279513,321594530,942704,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone.I will begin by summarizing comments from Scott, Tracy and Joe to review the contributors to our Utility Operations performance from our baseline of $0.70 per share in 2014 to 79% per share delivered in 2015.",894,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone.
I will begin by summarizing comments from Scott, Tracy and Joe to review the contributors to our Utility Operations performance from our baseline of $0.70 per share in 2014 to 79% per share delivered in 2015.
The primary contributors to this EPS growth were: a $0.06 year-on-year improvement in Houston Electric and a $0.05 year-on-year improvement in Energy services. These improvements were offset in part by higher income taxes. As noted by Tracy and Joe, holding O&M flat contributed to the year-on-year EPS performance at our Utility Operations.
As we have shared with you in the past several quarters, we are working on delivering consistent 4% to 6% annual EPS growth. On Slide 21, you'll see a few points regarding our guidance. Our 4% to 6% growth target begins with the 2015 EPS on a guidance basis of $1.10 per share. The $0.02 net accretion from our investment in Enable preferred, plus net of $0.04 from our combined Utility Operations in Midstream Investment, brings us to the midpoint of our 2016 EPS guidance. The EPS from the Utility Operations is expected to increase, whereas the EPS from our Midstream Investment is expected to decline.
As Scott noted in his comments, strong performance from Utility Operations, which is 80% of our EPS guidance, is expected to offset the anticipated decline in the EPS at Midstream Investments.
I will also provide some detail on the components of our EPS guidance. For Utility Operations, the midpoint of 2016's $0.88 to $0.92 EPS forecast relative to $0.79 in 2015 consist of $0.05 from operating income, $0.02 from lower interest expense and $0.04 from the dividend income associated with our recent preferred investment in Enable.
For our Midstream Investments, Enable provided their earnings forecast on their February 17 earnings call. This earnings forecast translated into $0.19 to $0.25 EPS for CenterPoint after accruing for income taxes. That forecast range, plus the accounting income of accretion, translates into our guidance of $0.24 to $0.28 for the Midstream contribution to our combined 2016 EPS estimate.
There are certain factors which drive variation within the guidance range, which we have included in our disclosure and on Page 21. Lower commodity prices are a primary example of this. If oil prices declined to $20 per barrel, we anticipate EPS from Midstream Investments would be at the low end of the $0.24 to $0.28 range. Similarly, continued favorable interest rates versus the year end forward curves or exceeding our goals for Continuum integration and customer retention, could move our Utility Operations EPS to the high end of their range. As with 2015, we are confident in our ability to deliver within our guidance range under a variety of circumstances.
Turning to Slide 22. CenterPoint's fourth quarter 2015 earnings reflects a pretax noncash impairment charge of $984 million, all related to our investment in Enable Midstream. This impairment recognizes the decline in the estimated fair value of our balance sheet investment, which was $15.41 per unit as of September 30, 2015. With an Enable unit price of just over $9 at year-end, it was appropriate for us to again review the investment for impairment. With these noncash charges, we have reduced our balance sheet investment in Enable Midstream from $3.6 billion to $2.6 billion. The new per-unit value of $11.09 as of year end is calculated using multiple methods and includes the value of our limited partner common and subordinated units and our general partner and incentive distribution rights.
Importantly, these impairments do not affect the company's liquidity, cash flow or compliance with debt covenants. After the impairment, the equity percentage and the capital structure is 36% at CenterPoint. And at the CERC level, the impairment, along with the recent $363 million dividend from CERC to the holding company, provides a pro forma equity capital of 55% at CERC.
On Slide 23, we provide a forecast of our financing plans. Importantly, we do not anticipate issuing equity in 2016. Part of the reason for this is the strength of our cash flow in 2015 and our expectations for similarly strong cash flow from operations in 2016. To illustrate this, in 2015 CenterPoint made record capital investments of nearly $1.6 billion. Our cash flow covered all capital expenditures in 2015. As a result, our net increase in borrowings were only $330 million.
We anticipate continued strong cash flow in upcoming years, with forecasted net debt of only $150 million by year-end 2016. With this limited net increase in debt, our cash flow coverages and our balance sheet are protected to further improve relative to 2015.
During 2015, we worked to provide for a more flexible debt structure. This resulted in similar interest expense in 2015 relative to 2014 despite increased borrowings. And, as I mentioned in previous comments, we anticipate continuing to lower interest expense in 2016.
With respect to income tax provisions, Slide 24 also notes our 2015 effective tax rates as well as the anticipated 36% effective tax rate for 2016.
I will close by reminding you of the $0.2575 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 20. This represents a 4% increase over the previous quarterly dividend and marks the 11th consecutive year we have increased our dividend.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to David."

With respect to how we think about distributions to Enable's and how that fits in, as Scott mentioned in his opening comments, Enable's contribution to our cash flow was less than 20%.

We -- as I said, after the impairment and then pro forma for the dividend distribution associated with Enable's paying down debt over to CERC, their balance sheet is at 55%. So we start with that balance sheet. On the Houston Electric side, again, it depends upon their sources and uses of cash as well as their earnings for the year. But we target to maintain a 45% equity of the capital and then dividend the funds after that. Now going to the dividend, which clearly is paid out of the holding company, whether there's borrowings from the holding company or whether it's fully sourced from CERC and Houston Electric would depend on how much dividends they make and the borrowings with the holding company make up for that."

The second point I put to that is that I mentioned, really, very little in the way of net incremental debt in 2016, and that's associated again with the strong cash flow of our utilities.

In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, the value of ZENS' securities and their related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market and inventory.
In providing Midstream Investments' guidance related to the company's 55.4% limited partner ownership interest in Enable, the company takes into account such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast, effective tax rates, the amortization of our basis difference in Enable and other factors. The company does not include other potential impacts such as changes in accounting standards, impairments or Enable Midstream's unusual items.
Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.2015 was a strong year for CenterPoint.

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
2015 was a strong year for CenterPoint. Our utility operations performed well, helping us to achieve our earnings objective on a guidance basis by earning at the top end of our guidance range.
Enable made a strong contribution to our earnings as well, falling in the middle of the guidance range we had provided at the start of 2015.
Using the same basis that we use when providing guidance, full year adjusted earnings were $475 million or $1.10 per diluted share. During 2015 we were focused on creating shareholder value through sustainable earnings growth. Our intention remains to grow annual EPS 4% to 6% through 2018.
Given the reduction in Enable's unit price throughout the year, we recorded noncash impairment charges in both the third and fourth quarters of 2015. As a result, this morning we reported a loss of $692 million or a loss of $1.61 per diluted share for 2015, compared with net income of $611 million or $1.42 per diluted share in 2014. Bill will discuss more about the impairments later in the call.
Slide 4 highlights several of the components that drove our 2015 performance. We continue to see strong customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added nearly 80,000 new customers in 2015. Our collective rate base grew 10%. We obtained $90 million in annualized rate relief, excluding $48 million of interim rate relief in Minnesota that will be decided upon in 2016. Further we continued to focus attention on O&M and financing costs.
The collective impact of these components led to 2015 Utility Operations earnings of $0.79 per diluted share compared with baseline 2014 utility earnings of $0.70 per share, an increase of nearly 13%. Each year we conduct an annual assessment and prioritization of capital needs, driven by requirements around safety, growth, maintenance and reliability. As you will see in Tracy's and Joe's slides, our planned capital expenditures for the upcoming years, while remaining well above historic levels, will be down from the peak expenditure level of 2015. Associated with this reduction, we anticipate our utility rate base growth will more closely track utility earnings growth, allowing us to maintain our 4% to 6% earnings growth target for CenterPoint Energy as a whole. Our plan assumes we maintain ROEs at or near our allowed returns.
On Slide 5, you can see EPS on a guidance basis for last year as well as our target for 2016. The percentage of earnings from our utilities is expected to increase from about 65% in 2014 to 75% to 80% in 2016. Also, the utilities provided over 80% of the cash flow in 2015. As our utilities continue to grow, they provide a larger ballast that can help mitigate additional commodity-driven earnings challenges that may impact Enable.
Our 2016 EPS guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 represent solid growth following a very strong performance in 2015. We anticipate this growth will be built upon many of the same factors that drove us forward in 2015: growing service territories; management of capital; and timely recovery on and of our investments. These factors will continue to be aided by ongoing attention to financing and operating costs.
Turning to Midstream Investments. We believe continued focus on Enable's financial performance and balance sheet strength translates to the value for CenterPoint Energy shareholders. Despite the commodity environment, Enable remains financially sound, with solid fundamentals and encouraging operating statistics.
I've noted some of the key take aways from Enable's call last week on Slide 6. Producers remain active within Enable's footprint. Currently, there are 28 rigs drilling wells to connect to Enable's system in the Anadarko basin. Enable's processing and transportation volumes are up over 2014, and their Bear Den system in the Bakken has increased volumes by 6,500 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2015.
From a financing perspective, Enable will have no debt maturities due this year or in 2017 and as of year-end 2015, reported $1.2 billion available under their credit facility.
CenterPoint's core strategy remains to operate, maintain and invest in our current utility service territories, deploying capital to address needs for system growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer interactions. Beyond our core strategy, we continue to look for additional opportunities to grow earnings.
On Slide -- as shown on Slide 7, we recently announced 2 transactions that demonstrate our commitment to pursuing sustainable earnings growth. First, we announced we will be using funds paid to us by Enable for outstanding debt to invest in a preferred security at Enable. This is an accretive investment for CenterPoint shareholders with a return of 10%. Additionally, we announced an earnings-accretive acquisition of Continuum's retail energy business, which expands our profitable, low-risk, Energy Services business.
As for our announcement about strategic reviews, over the past 12 to 18 months, we've been asked by many investors about 2 topics: Enable's fit within our portfolio; and separately, whether we would consider forming a REIT for utility assets. In response, we have announced we will independently study each for sustainable value creation. I want to stress that we are in the evaluation stage. Long-term shareholder value creation and long-term business model sustainability are top priorities in our evaluation process. We will not pursue actions that provide only short-term financial benefits or that will negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and address the growing needs of our vibrant service territories. We do not plan to answer questions as premature discussions could prove confusing and distracting to the process. We plan to share as we reach conclusions, and while we have no definitive time line, we anticipate providing an update during the second half of 2016.
Turning to Slide 8, I will conclude my comments by acknowledging the commitment and accomplishments of our employees. Their dedication to our vision of leadership could be seen through the awards we have received. For example, J.D. Power and Associates, which measures customer satisfaction, ranked each of our gas distribution companies in the top 4 in their respective regions. We ranked first in operational satisfaction in natural gas operations and were named an environmental champion by Cogent Energy Reports in the Midwest. Cogent also identified our electric utility as ranking #1 in Texas for customer engagement. Effective customer service strengthens our relationships with our customers and reinforces with regulators our commitment to provide reliability utility service to the communities we serve.
In closing, let me reiterate that we remain committed to our vision, to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We will continue to invest in our energy delivery systems to better serve our customers and to seek timely recovery of those investments.
Tracy will now update you on Electric Operations."

As you will see on Slide 10, core operating income was $502 million in 2015 compared to $477 million in 2014, representing a 5% increase. The business benefited from higher transmission",446,"Thank you, Scott.
2015 was another strong year for Houston Electric. As you will see on Slide 10, core operating income was $502 million in 2015 compared to $477 million in 2014, representing a 5% increase. The business benefited from higher transmission and distribution-related revenues, customer growth and increased usage due to a return to more normal weather. These benefits were partially offset by lower equity return related to true-up proceeds, lower energy efficiency bonus including the absence of a onetime energy efficiency bonus received in 2014, higher depreciation and lower right-of-way revenues.
Turning to Slide 11. Houston Electric added nearly 50,000 metered customers last year, which equates to 2% year-over-year growth. The Houston area added 27,000 net new jobs last year, and the greater Houston partnership is projecting approximately 22,000 net new jobs this year, mostly from the health care and construction industries. We anticipate approximately 2% metered customer growth in 2016. Recent monthly meter additions support that planned growth rate.
We continue to meet O&M expense management goals. Houston Electric held O&M expenses flat last year compared to 2014, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We will continue our efforts in 2016 as we work to keep annual O&M expense growth under 2%.
Last year, Houston Electric received approval for approximately $67 million in annualized transmission and distribution-related rate relief. About 90% of our capital investment is eligible for recovery using our annual cost recovery mechanisms, Transmission Cost of Service, or TCOS, and Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, or DCRF. We expect to file DCRF in April and TCOS in the second half this year. We do not anticipate a Houston Electric general rate filing in 2016, 2017 or 2018.
Turning to Slide 12. Houston Electric invested $934 million of capital in 2015, which represents a 14% increase over 2014, primarily due to load growth investments. Our new 5-year plan includes $3.7 billion of capital expenditures. This investment will be used to improve service reliability and system resiliency and support load growth and ongoing system maintenance.
Right-of-way work has begun on the largest project in our capital plan, the Brazos Valley Connection. Last month, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for Houston Electric to construct this project. We anticipate total capital spend of $270 million to $310 million and completion by mid-2018.
As you will see on Slide 13, rate base is projected to grow at a 5.2% compound annual growth rate through the 5-year plan. I am very pleased with Houston Electric's performance in 2015 and our forecast for 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Joe McGoldrick for an update on natural gas operations."
279513,321594530,942970,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy.Natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, had another strong year. Natural gas utilities operating income in 2015 was $273 million compared to $287 million in 20",854,"Thank you, Tracy.
Natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business, had another strong year. Natural gas utilities operating income in 2015 was $273 million compared to $287 million in 2014.
As you will see on Slide 15, $25 million of the decline in operating income is primarily due to a return to more normal weather in 2015 when compared to the extreme weather in the first half of 2014.
Rate relief, customer growth and other revenues added to operating income but were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and other taxes.
Customer growth remained strong at our utilities, having added nearly 30,000 customers since the fourth quarter of 2014, a 1% increase. The strongest growth occurred in Minnesota and Texas, and we expect similar customer growth or approximately 1% in the foreseeable future.
We managed operating cost effectively in 2015. O&M expenses were flat versus 2014, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We remain committed to disciplined O&M expense management.
We continue to invest in infrastructure and technology. For example, our natural gas utilities completed the deployment of drive-by meter reading technology to 3.4 million meters. And we continue with our pipeline replacement projects, such as cast iron and bare steel in Arkansas and our Minnesota beltline project. These investments are improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our gas distribution system.
We are also executing on our multi-jurisdictional regulatory strategy, filing base rate increase request in Minnesota and Arkansas as well as annual grip filings and other annual mechanisms. In 2015, approximately 90% of our capital spend was eligible for recovery through a combination of annual mechanisms and forward test years.
The general rate case that was filed last year in Minnesota, requesting a $54.1 million annual increase, is on track, and we expect to file an order in the third quarter of 2016. Interim rates of $47.8 million went into effect in October of last year.
Additionally, we filed a general rate case in Arkansas in November 2015. This is the first general rate filing we have made there since 2007, requesting $35.6 million in annualized rate recovery. As part of the filing, we requested approval of a formula rate plan as allowed by a new legislation. The formula rate plan will allow our rates to be prospectively adjusted based on a banded ROE approach in a projected test year. We expect the final decision in new base rates to be implemented in the third quarter of 2016.
Turning to Slide 16. We invested $601 million in our natural gas utilities last year, which represents a 14% increase over 2014. The increase was a combination of growth activity and public improvement projects, primarily in Minnesota and Texas, in addition to system maintenance activities across all jurisdictions. Our revised 5-year capital plan includes $2.3 billion. We are prioritizing capital investments, with a focus on safety, reliability and growth. And with our automated meter reading capital project now complete and public improvement expenditures expected to decline, our 2016 capital will return to a more normal level.
As you can see on Slide 17, rate base is projected to grow on a 6.2% compound annual growth rate through the 5-year plan. We anticipate that capital prioritization and effective implementation of our regulatory strategy will result in convergence of rate base growth and operating income growth over the next 5 years.
On Slide 18, you'll see that 2015 operating income for our Energy Services business was $38 million compared to $23 million in 2014, excluding mark-to-market gains of $4 million and $29 million, respectively.
Our energy services business realized solid customer growth and has increased operating income substantially over the last two years. The business also benefited from improved margins, a reduction in O&M expense and a lower inventory adjustment in 2015.
Energy Services is a profitable business segment that complements our gas distribution business and allows us to provide gas purchase options to CenterPoint customers across multiple states. We have worked hard to grow the commercial retail business within Energy Services, including by entering into an agreement to acquire Continuum's Retail Energy Services business, subject to customary closing conditions. With similar business models and a commitment to customer service, this transaction positions Energy Services to have access to more markets and officially grow our customer base by over 30% across 26 states. Moreover, our businesses share a common footprint, and we expect to capture synergies and reduce G&A over time as we leverage economies of scale. Transactions is expected to increase annual gross margin by approximately 40%. With the addition of Continuum, we expect Energy Services to contribute $40 million to $50 million of annual operating income. Details for the transaction are provided on Slide 19.
Our natural gas operations achieved strong operational and financial results in 2015. We are confident that our businesses will continue to grow in 2016 and beyond as we continue to enhance service to our customers and communities and create long-term value for our stakeholders.
I will now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial activities."
279513,321594530,942970,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone.I will begin by summarizing comments from Scott, Tracy and Joe to review the contributors to our Utility Operations performance from our baseline of $0.70 per share in 2014 to 79% per share delivered in 2015.",894,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone.
I will begin by summarizing comments from Scott, Tracy and Joe to review the contributors to our Utility Operations performance from our baseline of $0.70 per share in 2014 to 79% per share delivered in 2015.
The primary contributors to this EPS growth were: a $0.06 year-on-year improvement in Houston Electric and a $0.05 year-on-year improvement in Energy services. These improvements were offset in part by higher income taxes. As noted by Tracy and Joe, holding O&M flat contributed to the year-on-year EPS performance at our Utility Operations.
As we have shared with you in the past several quarters, we are working on delivering consistent 4% to 6% annual EPS growth. On Slide 21, you'll see a few points regarding our guidance. Our 4% to 6% growth target begins with the 2015 EPS on a guidance basis of $1.10 per share. The $0.02 net accretion from our investment in Enable preferred, plus net of $0.04 from our combined Utility Operations in Midstream Investment, brings us to the midpoint of our 2016 EPS guidance. The EPS from the Utility Operations is expected to increase, whereas the EPS from our Midstream Investment is expected to decline.
As Scott noted in his comments, strong performance from Utility Operations, which is 80% of our EPS guidance, is expected to offset the anticipated decline in the EPS at Midstream Investments.
I will also provide some detail on the components of our EPS guidance. For Utility Operations, the midpoint of 2016's $0.88 to $0.92 EPS forecast relative to $0.79 in 2015 consist of $0.05 from operating income, $0.02 from lower interest expense and $0.04 from the dividend income associated with our recent preferred investment in Enable.
For our Midstream Investments, Enable provided their earnings forecast on their February 17 earnings call. This earnings forecast translated into $0.19 to $0.25 EPS for CenterPoint after accruing for income taxes. That forecast range, plus the accounting income of accretion, translates into our guidance of $0.24 to $0.28 for the Midstream contribution to our combined 2016 EPS estimate.
There are certain factors which drive variation within the guidance range, which we have included in our disclosure and on Page 21. Lower commodity prices are a primary example of this. If oil prices declined to $20 per barrel, we anticipate EPS from Midstream Investments would be at the low end of the $0.24 to $0.28 range. Similarly, continued favorable interest rates versus the year end forward curves or exceeding our goals for Continuum integration and customer retention, could move our Utility Operations EPS to the high end of their range. As with 2015, we are confident in our ability to deliver within our guidance range under a variety of circumstances.
Turning to Slide 22. CenterPoint's fourth quarter 2015 earnings reflects a pretax noncash impairment charge of $984 million, all related to our investment in Enable Midstream. This impairment recognizes the decline in the estimated fair value of our balance sheet investment, which was $15.41 per unit as of September 30, 2015. With an Enable unit price of just over $9 at year-end, it was appropriate for us to again review the investment for impairment. With these noncash charges, we have reduced our balance sheet investment in Enable Midstream from $3.6 billion to $2.6 billion. The new per-unit value of $11.09 as of year end is calculated using multiple methods and includes the value of our limited partner common and subordinated units and our general partner and incentive distribution rights.
Importantly, these impairments do not affect the company's liquidity, cash flow or compliance with debt covenants. After the impairment, the equity percentage and the capital structure is 36% at CenterPoint. And at the CERC level, the impairment, along with the recent $363 million dividend from CERC to the holding company, provides a pro forma equity capital of 55% at CERC.
On Slide 23, we provide a forecast of our financing plans. Importantly, we do not anticipate issuing equity in 2016. Part of the reason for this is the strength of our cash flow in 2015 and our expectations for similarly strong cash flow from operations in 2016. To illustrate this, in 2015 CenterPoint made record capital investments of nearly $1.6 billion. Our cash flow covered all capital expenditures in 2015. As a result, our net increase in borrowings were only $330 million.
We anticipate continued strong cash flow in upcoming years, with forecasted net debt of only $150 million by year-end 2016. With this limited net increase in debt, our cash flow coverages and our balance sheet are protected to further improve relative to 2015.
During 2015, we worked to provide for a more flexible debt structure. This resulted in similar interest expense in 2015 relative to 2014 despite increased borrowings. And, as I mentioned in previous comments, we anticipate continuing to lower interest expense in 2016.
With respect to income tax provisions, Slide 24 also notes our 2015 effective tax rates as well as the anticipated 36% effective tax rate for 2016.
I will close by reminding you of the $0.2575 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on January 20. This represents a 4% increase over the previous quarterly dividend and marks the 11th consecutive year we have increased our dividend.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to David."

So we start with that balance sheet. On the Houston Electric side, again, it depends upon their sources and uses of cash as well as their earnings for the year. But we target to maintain a 45% equity of the capital and then dividend the funds after that.

We also have with us other members of management who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks. 
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides which can be found under the Investor section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides which, along with our Form 10-K, have been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information, and encourage you to review the information on our website. 
Today management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. 
We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers Utility Operations performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as changing accounting standards or unusual items, earnings from the change in the value of ZENS securities and their related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's energy services. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items. 
Before Scott begins I have 2 reminders, the first is that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website.

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 
I will start on Slide 4. This morning we reported first quarter 2016 earnings of $154 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared with $131 million or $0.30 per diluted share in 2015. Using the same basis that we used when providing guidance, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $138 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared with net income of $129 million or $0.30 per diluted share in 2015. 
Increases due to rate relief, customer growth and Midstream Investments were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses and reductions in usage driven by [indiscernible]. 
Turning to Slide 5. Given our solid start to the year, we are reiterating our 2016 guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 per share. Our focus remains to invest in our current utility service territories, to address ongoing needs associated with growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer service. 
Earnings growth will be driven by multiple factors, including customer and sales growth, capital discipline, timely recovery on and of our investments, as well as continued attention to managing financing and operating costs. We anticipate Utility Operations to contribute 75% to 80% of CenterPoint earnings in 2016. 
On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.23 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.22 per diluted share in 2015. Combined, our gas and electric utilities added nearly 83,000 customers since the first quarter of 2015. Rate relief from various 2015 regulatory filings was a significant contributor to earnings this quarter. While our service territories experienced milder weather, it had only a slight impact on our earnings in the first quarter of 2016, due in large part to the effectiveness of our regulatory mechanisms, including the benefit of a 3-year decoupling pilot in Minnesota. 
Constructive regulation enables timely capital recovery and helps normalize for specific causes of variability. Joe and Tracy will provide additional regulatory insights later in the call. 
Midstream Investments contributed $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.08 per diluted share in 2015. Slide 6 includes highlights from Enable's earnings call on May 4. Enable performed well in the first quarter of 2016 and continues to make balance sheet strength and financial discipline top priorities. We believe they remain well-positioned to navigate today's challenging market conditions. 
Our strategic reviews around our ownership of Enable and possible reformation are progressing as planned. Our objectives remain to explore options that would help minimize earnings variability and create sustainable value for our long-term shareholders without impacting our ability to serve the needs of CenterPoint's growing service territories. We remain on track to provide an update later this year. 
Before I close, I would like to thank our electric and gas employees for their response to the severe storms and flooding that have impact the Houston area recently. Across multiple rain events we had more than 400,000 power outages. Our teams, including crews from other companies, along with our grid automation technologies, were able to restore power to approximately 90% of the homes within 12 hours. 
In closing, let me reiterate that we remain committed to our vision to lead the nation in delivering energy service and value. We will continue to invest in our energy delivery systems to better serve our customers. We will continue to seek timely recovery of those investments. We will continue to constructively manage our O&M expenses. Consistent earnings growth at CenterPoint is underpinned by strong utility growth and has helped our stock performance in recent months. We continue to focus on consistent performance and long-term value creation. 
Tracy will now update you on electric operations."

As you can see on Slide 8, core operating income was $59 [ph] million compared to $68 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher rate relief and customer growth. These benefits were more than offset by higher depreciation as a result of increased rate base, higher O&M expenses, lower right-of-way revenue and reductions in usage primarily driven by weather. Higher depreciation expense was anticipated and due to both the amount and type of capital invested. The increased O&M expense and lower right-of-way revenue are both largely attributable to timing. We remain on track to hold O&M increases to under 2% for 2016, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets, and we continue to anticipate $10 million to $20 million in right-of-way revenue for the year. 
Turning to Slide 9. Houston added [ph] approximately 159,000 residents and over 15,000 [ph] new jobs in 2015. The greater Houston partnership has forecasted similar increases in 2016. 
Our year-over-year residential meter growth was in excess of 2%. We continue to forecast 2% customer growth for 2016, which equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million in incremental base revenue annually. 
On April 4, we filed for $36 million in annualized rate relief for distribution capital invested in 2015. Similar to last year's filing, we expect new rates to go into effect in September. Overall, Houston Electric performed well this quarter. We will continue to operate and manage this business with a focus on safety, reliability, efficiency and growth. 
Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,330038889,979660,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 10, 2016",2016-05-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy.

Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated Energy Services business had a strong quarter both operationally and financially. We experienced significantly milder weather across much of our territory, but weather normalization adjustments are decoupling pilot in Minnesota and rate design in Texas have all worked to remove weather sensitivity as a material risk to our natural gas utility revenues. 
As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities in the first quarter was $160 million compared to $146 million for the same period in 2015. Operating income was higher due to significant rate relief and continued customer growth. These increases were partially offset by milder and unhedged weather effects in Texas and higher depreciation and amortization expense.
Customer growth remained strong at our natural gas utilities having added almost 29,000 customers since the first quarter of 2015. Texas led with nearly 2% customer growth, followed by Minnesota which added more than 1%. 
O&M expenses at our natural gas utilities were up less than 3% for the first quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We remain committed to disciplined O&M expense management. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be in our first year of our 3-year decoupling pilot in Minnesota, which acts as natural hedge against usage fluctuations, whether its due to energy conservation our weather. We now have weather normalization adjustments or decoupling in every state we operate in, except for Texas, which tends to experience less variability as a result of higher, nonvalue metric customer charges in less severe winter weather.
On the regulatory front, this is the first year we have filed GRIP mechanisms in all 4 Texas jurisdictions. On March 31, we filed for a combined $18 [ph] million in annualized Texas GRIP recovery. 
Also on March 31, we filed for a $5.5 million rate relief using the Arkansas decoupling mechanism. And our Minnesota and Arkansas rate cases are progressing and we anticipate final decisions on both cases in the second and third quarters, respectively. We are already experiencing high revenues in Minnesota through interim rates and expect new rates in Arkansas to be implemented during the third quarter. 
On Slide 12, you'll see that operating income for Energy Services business was $15 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $17 million for the same period last year, excluding mark-to-market losses of $9 million and $4 million respectively. The remaining $2 million decline was primarily from reduced weather-related optimization opportunities.
As you will notice on Slide 13, we closed the Continuum Retail Energy Services acquisition on April 1 of this year. We are consolidating that business with a focus on customer retention, as well as integrating accounting, customer and risk systems. We believe our energy services business will provide annual operating income, excluding mark-to-market variations, in the $40 million to $50 million range in 2017, the first full year of combined operations. 
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. We will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill who will cover financial performance and forecast."

I will begin on Slide 15. First quarter earnings were $0.36 per diluted share versus $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The guidance basis of $0.32 was less than the GAAP basis of $0.36 due to the",518,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin on Slide 15. First quarter earnings were $0.36 per diluted share versus $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The guidance basis of $0.32 was less than the GAAP basis of $0.36 due to the reversal out of a net $0.05 gain related to our marketable securities and indexed debt securities, and the reversal out of a $0.01 loss related to our mark-to-market accounting of natural gas in our Energy Services business segment. 
Our guidance basis earnings per share increased from $0.30 to $0.32 through the stronger performance in our Utility Operations segment and our Midstream Investment. We are pleased with the combined, core operating income quarter-to-quarter improvement, which Tracy and Joe discussed. Given these results, as Scott mentioned earlier, we are reiterating our earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.20. Additionally, we are reiterating our target of 4% to 6% EPS growth annually through 2018. 
On Slide 16, we have provided more detail on our earnings guidance. Our 4% to 6% growth target begins with a 2015 EPS on a guidance basis of $1.10 per share. The EPS from Utility Operations is expected to increase whereas the EPS for our Midstream Investment is expected to decline in 2016. We anticipate Utility Operations to grow from $0.79 to $0.88 to $0.92 per share. Expected growth drivers include an increase in operating income from our utilities, a reduction in interest expense and dividend account from our investment in Enable's preferred securities. On an ongoing basis, we expect the Enable preferred investment to contribute $0.05 per year, with 2016 being a partial year. 
As the earnings contribution from Utility Operations continues to grow, our ability to minimize earnings volatility also improves. On Slide 17, we will provide an overview of our anticipated financing plans, interest expense and accrual tax rate. In the first quarter, our interest expense was lower on period-to-period basis due to repayment of higher interest rate in the 2015 year. For the full year 2016, we expect interest expense to be lower compared to 2015 due to refinancing activity. 
Similar interest expense saving opportunities should be available with the refinancing of debt maturing in 2017 and 2018. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 36% and we anticipate that is our effective tax rate for the year. 
With respect to financing, internally generated cash flow remains strong. In the first quarter, our operating cash flow positioned us to fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and pay down debt. For the full year, our anticipated net incremental borrowing needs are approximately $150 million relative to our year-end debt balance at 2015. This includes approximately $100 million for the recent acquisition of Continuum Retail Energy Services. 
As stated in our year-end call, we expect to refinance $600 million of Houston Electric gas in 2016. We are not forecasting a need for equity in either 2016 or 2017. 
I'll close by reminding you of the 25.75% [ph] per-share dividend declared by our board on April 28. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dave."

And while we are not in receipt of the final order yet, we expect that early June sometime they did make some decisions and especially with regard to the cost of capital.

We're a little disappointed in that 7.7% [ph] of debt, debt capital was that short-term rates. But while we're disappointed in that, we do anticipate that the final rate increase amount when we get the final order will be in line with our expectations for the financial performance of the business and consistent with our overall guidance. And we do expect to be able to continue to earn right at the that allowed ROE. And we really don't experience much lag in Minnesota once we've filed the case because we're allowed to put interim rates into effect, and those have been in effect at a $48 million level since some time last year."

Welcome to our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today. 
Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Bill Rogers, Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our first quarter 2016 results and provide highlights on other key areas. We also have with us other members of management, who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks. 
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides which can be found under the Investor section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides, which, along with our Form 10-Q, have been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website. 
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. 
We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers utility operations' performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings from the change in the value of ZENS securities and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's energy service business. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable midstream's unusual items. 
Before Scott begins I have 2 reminders. The first is that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. The second is that on our Investor website under Financial Information, you can find our debt and maturity slides, which investors often find helpful. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. I will start on Slide 4. This morning, we reported first quarter 2016 earnings of $154 million or $0.36 per",624,"Thank you, David, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 
I will start on Slide 4. This morning, we reported first quarter 2016 earnings of $154 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared with $131 million or $0.30 per diluted share in 2015. Using the same basis that we used when providing guidance, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $138 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared with net income of $129 million or $0.30 per diluted share in 2015. Increases due to rate relief, customer growth and midstream investments were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses and reductions in usage driven by weather. 
Turning to Slide 5. Given our solid start to the year, we are reiterating our 2016 guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 per share. Our focus remains to invest in our current utility service territories, to address ongoing needs associated with growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer service. Earnings growth will be driven by multiple factors, including customer and sales growth, capital discipline, timely recovery on and of our investments as well as continued attention to managing financing and operating costs. We anticipate utility operations to contribute 75% to 80% of CenterPoint earnings in 2016. On a guidance basis, utility operations contributed $0.23 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.22 per diluted share in 2015. Combined, our gas and electric utilities added nearly 83,000 customers since the first quarter of 2015. Rate relief from various 2015 regulatory filings was a significant contributor to earnings this quarter. 
While our service territories experienced milder weather, it had only a slight impact on our earnings in the first quarter of 2016 due in large part to the effectiveness of our regulatory mechanisms, including the benefit of a 3-year decoupling pilot in Minnesota. Constructive regulation enables timely capital recovery and helps normalize for specific causes of variability. Joe and Tracy will provide additional regulatory insights later in the call. Midstream investments contributed $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.08 per diluted share in 2015. 
Slide 6 includes highlights from Enable's earnings call on May 4. Enable performed well in the first quarter of 2016 and continues to make balance sheet strength and financial discipline top priorities. We believe they remain well positioned to navigate today's challenging market conditions. Our strategic reviews around our ownership of Enable and possible reformation are progressing as planned. Our objectives remain to explore options that could help minimize earnings variability and create sustainable value for our long-term shareholders without impacting our ability to serve the needs of CenterPoint's growing service territories. We remain on track to provide an update later this year. 
Before I close, I would like to thank our electric and gas employees for their response to the severe storms and flooding that have impacted the Houston area recently. Across multiple rain events, we had more than 400,000 power outages. Our teams, including crews from other companies, along with our grid automation technologies, were able to restore power to approximately 90% of the homes within 12 hours. 
In closing, let me reiterate that we remain committed to our vision to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We will continue to invest in our energy delivery systems to better serve our customers. We will continue to seek timely recovery of those investments. We will continue to constructively manage our O&M expenses. Consistent earnings growth at CenterPoint is underpinned by strong utility growth and has helped our stock performance in recent months. We continue to focus on consistent performance and long-term value creation. 
Tracy will now update you on electric operations."

As you can see on Slide 8, core operating income was $59 million compared to $68 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher rate relief and customer growth. These benefits were more than offset by higher depreciation as a result of increased rate base, higher O&M expenses, lower right-of-way revenue and reductions in usage primarily driven by weather. Higher depreciation expense was anticipated and due to both the amount and type of capital invested. The increased O&M expense and lower right-of-way revenue are both largely attributed to timing. We remain on track to hold O&M increases to under 2% for 2016, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets, and we continue to anticipate $10 million to $20 million in right-of-way revenue for the year. 
Turning to Slide 9. Houston added approximately 159,000 new residents and over 15,000 new jobs in 2015. The Greater Houston Partnership has forecasted similar increases in 2016. Our year-over-year residential meter growth was in excess of 2%. We continue to forecast 2% customer growth for 2016, which equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million in incremental base revenue annually. On April 4, we filed for $36 million in annualized rate relief for distribution capital invested in 2015. Similar to last year's filing, we expect new rates to go into effect in September. Overall, Houston Electric performed well this quarter. We will continue to operate and manage this business with a focus on safety, reliability, efficiency and growth. 
Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,330038889,979884,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 10, 2016",2016-05-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy.

Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business had a strong quarter, both operationally and financially. We experienced significantly milder weather across much of our territory, but weather normalization adjustments, our decoupling pilot in Minnesota and rate design in Texas have all worked to remove weather sensitivity as a material risk to our natural gas utility revenues. 
As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities in the first quarter was $160 million compared to $146 million for the same period in 2015. Operating income was higher due to significant rate relief and continued customer growth. These increases were partially offset by milder and unhedged weather effects in Texas and higher depreciation and amortization expense. Customer growth remained strong at our natural gas utilities, having added almost 29,000 customers since the first quarter of 2015. Texas led with nearly 2% customer growth, followed by Minnesota, which added more than 1%. O&M expenses at our natural gas utilities were up less than 3% for the first quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We remain committed to disciplined O&M expense management. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're pleased to be in the first year of our 3-year full decoupling pilot in Minnesota, which acts as natural hedge against usage fluctuations, whether it's due to energy conservation or weather. We now have weather normalization adjustments or decoupling in every state we operate in, except for Texas, which tends to experience less variability as a result of higher, non-value metric customer charges and less severe winter weather.
On the regulatory front, this is the first year we have filed GRIP mechanisms in all 4 Texas jurisdictions. On March 31, we filed for a combined $18 million in annualized Texas GRIP recovery. Also on March 31, we filed for a $5.5 million rate relief using the Arkansas decoupling mechanism. And our Minnesota and Arkansas rate cases are progressing, and we anticipate final decisions on both cases in the second and third quarters, respectively. We're already experiencing high revenues in Minnesota through interim rates and expect new rates in Arkansas to be implemented during the third quarter. 
On Slide 12, you'll see that operating income for energy services business was $15 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $17 million for the same period last year, excluding mark-to-market losses of $9 million and $4 million, respectively. The remaining $2 million decline was primarily from reduced weather-related optimization opportunities.
As you'll notice on Slide 13, we closed the Continuum Retail Energy Services acquisition on April 1 of this year. We're consolidating that business with a focus on customer retention, as well as integrating accounting, customer and risk systems. We believe our energy services business will provide annual operating income, excluding mark-to-market variations, in the $40 million to $50 million range in 2017, the first full year of combined operations. 
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. We will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."

I will begin on Slide 15. First quarter earnings were $0.36 per diluted share versus $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015.

First quarter earnings were $0.36 per diluted share versus $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The guidance basis of $0.32 was less than the GAAP basis of $0.36 due to the reversal out of a net $0.05 gain related to our marketable securities and indexed debt securities and the reversal out of a $0.01 loss related to our mark-to-market accounting of natural gas in our energy services business segment. Our guidance basis earnings per share increased from $0.30 to $0.32 through the stronger performance in our utility operations segment and our midstream investment. We are pleased with the combined core operating income quarter-to-quarter improvement, which Tracy and Joe discussed. Given these results, as Scott mentioned earlier, we are reiterating our earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.20. Additionally, we are reiterating our target of 4% to 6% EPS growth annually through 2018. 
On Slide 16, we've provided more detail on our earnings guidance. Our 4% to 6% growth target begins with a 2015 EPS on a guidance basis of $1.10 per share. The EPS from utility operations is expected to increase, whereas the EPS for our midstream investment is expected to decline in 2016. We anticipate utility operations to grow from $0.79 to $0.88 to $0.92 per share. Expected growth drivers include an increase in operating income from our utilities, a reduction in interest expense and dividend coming from our investment in Enable's preferred securities. On an ongoing basis, we expect the Enable preferred investment to contribute $0.05 per year with 2016 being a partial year. As the earnings contribution from utility operations continues to grow, our ability to minimize earnings volatility also improves. 
On Slide 17, we will provide an overview of our anticipated financing plans, interest expense and accrual tax rate. In the first quarter, our interest expense was lower on a period-to-period basis due to repayment of higher interest rate debt in the 2015 year. For the full year 2016, we expect interest expense to be lower compared to 2015 due to refinancing activity. Similar interest expense saving opportunities should be available with the refinancing of debt maturing in 2017 and 2018. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 36%, and we anticipate that as our effective tax rate for the year. 
With respect to financing, internally generated cash flow remained strong. In the first quarter, our operating cash flow positioned us to fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and pay down debt. For the full year, our anticipated net incremental borrowing needs are approximately $150 million relative to our year-end debt balance at 2015. This includes approximately $100 million for the recent acquisition of Continuum Retail Energy Services. As stated in our year-end call, we expect to refinance $600 million of Houston Electric debt in 2016. We are not forecasting a need for equity in either 2016 or 2017. 
I'll close by reminding you of the 25¾% per-share dividend declared by our board on April 28. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dave."

Welcome to our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today. 
Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Bill Rogers, Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our first quarter 2016 results and provide highlights on other key areas. We also have with us other members of management, who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks. 
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides which can be found under the Investor section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides, which, along with our Form 10-Q, have been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website. 
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. 
We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers utility operations' performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings from the change in the value of ZENS securities and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's energy service business. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable midstream's unusual items. 
Before Scott begins I have 2 reminders. The first is that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. The second is that on our Investor website under Financial Information, you can find our debt and maturity slides, which investors often find helpful. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. I will start on Slide 4. This morning, we reported first quarter 2016 earnings of $154 million or $0.36 per",624,"Thank you, David, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. 
I will start on Slide 4. This morning, we reported first quarter 2016 earnings of $154 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared with $131 million or $0.30 per diluted share in 2015. Using the same basis that we used when providing guidance, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $138 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared with net income of $129 million or $0.30 per diluted share in 2015. Increases due to rate relief, customer growth and midstream investments were partially offset by higher depreciation, O&M expenses and reductions in usage driven by weather. 
Turning to Slide 5. Given our solid start to the year, we are reiterating our 2016 guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 per share. Our focus remains to invest in our current utility service territories, to address ongoing needs associated with growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer service. Earnings growth will be driven by multiple factors, including customer and sales growth, capital discipline, timely recovery on and of our investments as well as continued attention to managing financing and operating costs. We anticipate utility operations to contribute 75% to 80% of CenterPoint earnings in 2016. On a guidance basis, utility operations contributed $0.23 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.22 per diluted share in 2015. Combined, our gas and electric utilities added nearly 83,000 customers since the first quarter of 2015. Rate relief from various 2015 regulatory filings was a significant contributor to earnings this quarter. 
While our service territories experienced milder weather, it had only a slight impact on our earnings in the first quarter of 2016 due in large part to the effectiveness of our regulatory mechanisms, including the benefit of a 3-year decoupling pilot in Minnesota. Constructive regulation enables timely capital recovery and helps normalize for specific causes of variability. Joe and Tracy will provide additional regulatory insights later in the call. Midstream investments contributed $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.08 per diluted share in 2015. 
Slide 6 includes highlights from Enable's earnings call on May 4. Enable performed well in the first quarter of 2016 and continues to make balance sheet strength and financial discipline top priorities. We believe they remain well positioned to navigate today's challenging market conditions. Our strategic reviews around our ownership of Enable and possible reformation are progressing as planned. Our objectives remain to explore options that could help minimize earnings variability and create sustainable value for our long-term shareholders without impacting our ability to serve the needs of CenterPoint's growing service territories. We remain on track to provide an update later this year. 
Before I close, I would like to thank our electric and gas employees for their response to the severe storms and flooding that have impacted the Houston area recently. Across multiple rain events, we had more than 400,000 power outages. Our teams, including crews from other companies, along with our grid automation technologies, were able to restore power to approximately 90% of the homes within 12 hours. 
In closing, let me reiterate that we remain committed to our vision to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We will continue to invest in our energy delivery systems to better serve our customers. We will continue to seek timely recovery of those investments. We will continue to constructively manage our O&M expenses. Consistent earnings growth at CenterPoint is underpinned by strong utility growth and has helped our stock performance in recent months. We continue to focus on consistent performance and long-term value creation. 
Tracy will now update you on electric operations."

As you can see on Slide 8, core operating income was $59 million compared to $68 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from higher rate relief and customer growth. These benefits were more than offset by higher depreciation as a result of increased rate base, higher O&M expenses, lower right-of-way revenue and reductions in usage primarily driven by weather. Higher depreciation expense was anticipated and due to both the amount and type of capital invested. The increased O&M expense and lower right-of-way revenue are both largely attributed to timing. We remain on track to hold O&M increases to under 2% for 2016, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets, and we continue to anticipate $10 million to $20 million in right-of-way revenue for the year. 
Turning to Slide 9. Houston added approximately 159,000 new residents and over 15,000 new jobs in 2015. The Greater Houston Partnership has forecasted similar increases in 2016. Our year-over-year residential meter growth was in excess of 2%. We continue to forecast 2% customer growth for 2016, which equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million in incremental base revenue annually. On April 4, we filed for $36 million in annualized rate relief for distribution capital invested in 2015. Similar to last year's filing, we expect new rates to go into effect in September. Overall, Houston Electric performed well this quarter. We will continue to operate and manage this business with a focus on safety, reliability, efficiency and growth. 
Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,330038889,980063,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 10, 2016",2016-05-10,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy.

Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas utilities and our nonregulated energy services business had a strong quarter, both operationally and financially. We experienced significantly milder weather across much of our territory, but weather normalization adjustments, our decoupling pilot in Minnesota and rate design in Texas have all worked to remove weather sensitivity as a material risk to our natural gas utility revenues. 
As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities in the first quarter was $160 million compared to $146 million for the same period in 2015. Operating income was higher due to significant rate relief and continued customer growth. These increases were partially offset by milder and unhedged weather effects in Texas and higher depreciation and amortization expense. Customer growth remained strong at our natural gas utilities, having added almost 29,000 customers since the first quarter of 2015. Texas led with nearly 2% customer growth, followed by Minnesota, which added more than 1%. O&M expenses at our natural gas utilities were up less than 3% for the first quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We remain committed to disciplined O&M expense management. 
As I mentioned earlier, we're pleased to be in the first year of our 3-year full decoupling pilot in Minnesota, which acts as natural hedge against usage fluctuations, whether it's due to energy conservation or weather. We now have weather normalization adjustments or decoupling in every state we operate in, except for Texas, which tends to experience less variability as a result of higher, non-value metric customer charges and less severe winter weather.
On the regulatory front, this is the first year we have filed GRIP mechanisms in all 4 Texas jurisdictions. On March 31, we filed for a combined $18 million in annualized Texas GRIP recovery. Also on March 31, we filed for a $5.5 million rate relief using the Arkansas decoupling mechanism. And our Minnesota and Arkansas rate cases are progressing, and we anticipate final decisions on both cases in the second and third quarters, respectively. We're already experiencing high revenues in Minnesota through interim rates and expect new rates in Arkansas to be implemented during the third quarter. 
On Slide 12, you'll see that operating income for energy services business was $15 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared with $17 million for the same period last year, excluding mark-to-market losses of $9 million and $4 million, respectively. The remaining $2 million decline was primarily from reduced weather-related optimization opportunities.
As you'll notice on Slide 13, we closed the Continuum Retail Energy Services acquisition on April 1 of this year. We're consolidating that business with a focus on customer retention, as well as integrating accounting, customer and risk systems. We believe our energy services business will provide annual operating income, excluding mark-to-market variations, in the $40 million to $50 million range in 2017, the first full year of combined operations. 
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. We will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."

I will begin on Slide 15. First quarter earnings were $0.36 per diluted share versus $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015.

First quarter earnings were $0.36 per diluted share versus $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The guidance basis of $0.32 was less than the GAAP basis of $0.36 due to the reversal out of a net $0.05 gain related to our marketable securities and indexed debt securities and the reversal out of a $0.01 loss related to our mark-to-market accounting of natural gas in our energy services business segment. Our guidance basis earnings per share increased from $0.30 to $0.32 through the stronger performance in our utility operations segment and our midstream investment. We are pleased with the combined core operating income quarter-to-quarter improvement, which Tracy and Joe discussed. Given these results, as Scott mentioned earlier, we are reiterating our earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.20. Additionally, we are reiterating our target of 4% to 6% EPS growth annually through 2018. 
On Slide 16, we've provided more detail on our earnings guidance. Our 4% to 6% growth target begins with a 2015 EPS on a guidance basis of $1.10 per share. The EPS from utility operations is expected to increase, whereas the EPS for our midstream investment is expected to decline in 2016. We anticipate utility operations to grow from $0.79 to $0.88 to $0.92 per share. Expected growth drivers include an increase in operating income from our utilities, a reduction in interest expense and dividend income from our investment in Enable's preferred securities. On an ongoing basis, we expect the Enable preferred investment to contribute $0.05 per year with 2016 being a partial year. As the earnings contribution from utility operations continues to grow, our ability to minimize earnings volatility also improves. 
On Slide 17, we will provide an overview of our anticipated financing plans, interest expense and accrual tax rate. In the first quarter, our interest expense was lower on a period-to-period basis due to repayment of higher interest rate debt in the 2015 year. For the full year 2016, we expect interest expense to be lower compared to 2015 due to refinancing activity. Similar interest expense saving opportunities should be available with the refinancing of debt maturing in 2017 and 2018. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 36%, and we anticipate that as our effective tax rate for the year. 
With respect to financing, internally generated cash flow remained strong. In the first quarter, our operating cash flow positioned us to fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and pay down debt. For the full year, our anticipated net incremental borrowing needs are approximately $150 million relative to our year-end debt balance at 2015. This includes approximately $100 million for the recent acquisition of Continuum Retail Energy Services. As stated in our year-end call, we expect to refinance $600 million of Houston Electric debt in 2016. We are not forecasting a need for equity in either 2016 or 2017. 
I'll close by reminding you of the 25¾% per-share dividend declared by our board on April 28. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dave."

We also have with us other members of management, who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks. 
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides, which can be found under the Investor section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the earnings guidance provided in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides, which, along with our Form 10-Q, have been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.  
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers utility operations' performance to date and significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings from the change in the value of ZENS securities and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's energy service business.  The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable midstream's unusual items. 
Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott."

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will begin on Slide 4.

Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will begin on Slide 4. 
This morning, we reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $2 million or $0.01 loss per diluted share compared with net income of $77 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. Second quarter 2016 earnings were impacted by several charges, which Bill will discuss in greater detail later in the call. 
On a guidance basis, second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $73 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $84 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. 
The fundamentals of our utility business segments remain strong. On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.14 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.13 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year, improving $0.01 despite milder-than-normal weather at our electric utility. 
We continue to see strong customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added over 90,000 metered customers during the last 12 months. Capital expenditures remain strong as we invest to meet growth, safety and reliability needs within our service territories. Rate relief, driven by capital investment, continues to be an important contributor to earnings growth. To date, we have secured $45 million in annualized distribution investment recovery at our electric utility and $18 million in annualized revenue associated with recovery of capital investments at our Texas gas utilities. Further, we expect approvals in 2 gas rate cases in the third and fourth quarters. Joe and Tracy will provide additional regulatory updates for their business segments later in the call. 
Turning to midstream investments. We have a number of highlights on Slide 5. Midstream investments contributed $0.03 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.06 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. The contribution was reduced as a result of losses attributable to changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives and an increase in deferred taxes. As I mentioned earlier, Bill will provide additional details on these items. 
Enable's call highlighted the robustness of drilling activity in the SCOOP and STACK plays, which continue to be recognized as 2 of the top plays in the country. Enable continues to focus on strengthening their balance sheet, lowering cost and improving capital efficiency. We believe they are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities over the next 2 years. 
Turning to Slide 6. Given the year-to-date performance and outlook for both utility operation and midstream investments, we are reaffirming full year earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 per diluted share. 2016 earnings growth drivers include utility customer growth, capital discipline, rate relief and operating and financing cost management. 
CenterPoint's core strategy remains to operate, maintain and invest in our current utility service territories, deploying capital to address needs for system growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer interactions. In February, we announced that we would conduct 2 strategic reviews focused on possible incremental value creation for our long-term shareholders. One review contemplated placing utility assets in a REIT structure with the assumption of executing a public offering of that REIT and redeploying those proceeds on behalf of our shareholders. We have completed our REIT evaluation based upon assumptions for qualified assets, revenue requirements determined through general regulatory proceedings and capital market considerations. Key variables include the collection of federal income taxes within the revenue requirement and the timing of adjustments to lease payments related to capital investments by the REIT on behalf of the utility operating company. We have concluded that current uncertainties, along with the complexity of the structure, do not warrant pursuit of a REIT. As always, we remain open to explore avenues for long-term value creation for our current shareholders. 
The strategic review regarding our Enable ownership is ongoing, and we remain committed to providing an update on this subject before the end of 2016. As I mentioned before, our utility fundamentals continue to be strong and on track. We remain committed to our vision to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We are focused on consistent performance, including safe, reliable and efficient operations for our customers and long-term value creation for our shareholders. Tracy will now update you on Houston Electric."

I am pleased with Houston Electric's performance this quarter. As you will see on Slide 8, core operating income in the second quarter of 2016 was $135 million compared with $131 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from rate relief, customer growth, higher equity return, primarily related to true-up proceeds, and higher right-of-way revenues. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation and taxes, lower usage, primarily due to milder weather, and modestly higher O&M. Similar to the first quarter of this year, higher depreciation was anticipated due to both the amount and type of capital invested. We continue to focus on keeping annual O&M growth under 2%, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. 
Houston Electric added approximately 55,000 metered customers since the second quarter of last year. We continue to anticipate approximately 2% metered customer growth this year. As we've mentioned before, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually. 
Slide 9 provides a regulatory update for Houston Electric. In April, we filed an application with the Texas Public Utility Commission for a DCRF interim rate adjustment. Our application requested the annualized revenue requirement be set at $49.4 million. In July 2016, a settlement was approved by the commission, providing for an annualized revenue requirement of $45 million, effective September 1, 2016. As a reminder, the amount is reset with each filing, so it is not additive to the approved DCRF revenue requirement from the prior filing. 
Recently, Houston Electric was awarded the International Smart Grid Action Network Award of Excellence and the Global Smart Grid Federation Best Smart Grid Project. Through our smart grid deployment, key technology partnerships and the dedication of our employees, we have reduced outages by more than 134 million minutes, enabled restoration of more than 1.5 million outage cases without a customer phone call and saved millions of dollars in eliminated fees for more than 2.3 million metered customers in our service area. I'm pleased to report Houston Electric's performance is on track for the year. Although we experienced milder-than-normal weather in the second quarter, the third quarter to date has been warmer than normal. 
Further, the third quarter has historically been the most impactful quarter for Houston Electric. We will continue to focus on the safety, reliability and efficiency of our system to meet the growing needs of our service territory. Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."

Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas distribution business and our nonregulated energy services business, had a solid quarter. As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities was $20 million compared to $19 million for the same period in 2015. Operating income was higher, primarily due to rate relief and continued customer growth. These increases were offset by higher depreciation and taxes, as well as increased contractor services expense related to integrity services and increased credit and collection activities. 
Customer growth remained strong at our natural gas utilities, having added nearly 36,000 customers since the second quarter of 2015, almost identical to the growth in customers this time last year. This represents customer growth slightly in excess of 1%. 
Slides 12 and 13 provide detail on 2016 regulatory developments, including  our rate cases in Minnesota and Arkansas.
The Minnesota PUC issued an order authorizing a $27.5 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.49%. We have had interim rates in effect since last fall and will implement final rates later this year. 
In the Arkansas case, a nonunanimous settlement was reached for an annual revenue increase of $14.2 million. The settlement includes the use of a formula rate plan mechanism starting in 2017 to recover future capital investment and expenses. The recommended ROE in the Arkansas settlement is 9.5%. The settlement is pending commission approval and we expect the final order and new rates to be implemented in the third quarter. 
As Scott mentioned, we have also finalized 4 Texas GRIP cases, which collectively increase revenues $18 million on an annualized basis. 
Turning to Slide 14. Operating income for our Energy Services business was $7 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared with $7 million for the same period last year, excluding a mark-to-market loss of $7 million and again of $2 million, respectively. 
Our integration efforts from our recent acquisition are anticipated to be completed within 2016. With more than 12,000 new metered customers, Energy Services now has more than 30,000 customers. Inclusive of integration and acquisition costs, this year, we anticipate the Energy Services business will roughly match last year's financial performance of $38 million in operating income, again, excluding mark-to-market adjustments. 
For 2017, the first full year of combined operations, we now expect Energy Services to provide annual operating income, excluding mark-to-market gains or losses, in the range of $45 million to $55 million. 
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. Excluding mark-to-market, year-to-date operating income is up $13 million or 7% higher than 2015 despite lower weather-related throughput at utilities and acquisition and integration cost at Energy Services. We will convey to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. I will now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."
279513,370694753,1026970,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin on Slide 16. We reported the second quarter 2016 loss of $0.01 per diluted share. Earnings included a charge of $110 million or $0.17 per diluted share associated with our ZENS securities. This ch",779,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin on Slide 16. We reported the second quarter 2016 loss of $0.01 per diluted share. Earnings included a charge of $110 million or $0.17 per diluted share associated with our ZENS securities. This charge is primarily due to the merger of Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications through a cash and sale in the related revaluation of associated assets and liabilities on our books. Further details on the accounting at the merger date on May 18 are provided on Page 17 of the slide deck, as well as Note 11 in our second quarter Form 10-Q. 
In addition, the quarter also included a $0.01 mark-to-market charge in our Energy Services segment. Therefore, our earnings per share on a guidance basis was $0.17 versus earnings of $0.19 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Earnings per share increased $0.01 for our Utility Operations segment and decreased $0.03 for our Midstream Investments. Midstream was impacted by losses attributable to changes in fair value of commodity derivatives. 
As discussed on Enable's call and disclosed in their second quarter Form 10-Q, Enable uses derivatives to manage the partnership's commodity price risk. The accounting for these derivatives requires that the charges associated with the fair value of the instruments be recognized in current earnings. 
In addition, at the CenterPoint level, we recognize an increase in deferred tax expense related to recent Louisiana tax law changes and our Enable income from Louisiana. The sum of these 2 factors reduce the midstream per share contribution to earnings by approximately $0.03. 
Additionally, this is the first quarter that we recognize income from our investment in the Enable preferred, as disclosed in Footnote 8 and within Other Income. Assuming Enable declares this dividend on a going-forward basis, we expect to earn $0.03 per share in 2016 and $0.05 per share per year in future years.
As a reminder, second quarter has historically provided the least contribution to our annual earnings. For the first 2 quarters of this year, we have delivered $0.49 in guidance earnings per share, consisting of $0.37 in utility earnings and $0.12 in midstream earnings.
Given our performance year-to-date and ongoing strong utility fundamentals, as Scott mentioned earlier, we are reiterating EPS guidance of $1.12 to $1.20. 
As shown on Slide 18, we are also reiterating our target of 4% to 6% EPS growth in each of 27 -- 2017 and 2018. 
On Slide 19, we provide an overview of our anticipated financing plans, interest expense and effective tax rate. Year-to-date, internally generated cash is strong, allowing us to fully fund capital expenditures and to pay dividends. In the second quarter, our interest expense was lower on a period-to-period basis due to refinancing maturing debt at lower interest rates. During the quarter, we refinanced $300 million of short-term debt at Houston electric with a 5-year maturity at a coupon of 1.85%. We expect to refinance another $300 million of short-term debt at Houston Electric in the second half of 2016. 
Therefore, for the full year 2016, we expect interest expense to be lower compared to 2015 with an EPS contribution of approximately $0.02. 
Interest expense saving opportunities should also present themselves in 2017 and 2018. We have $1.15 billion in maturities in those years and the weighted average coupon for this maturing debt is roughly 6.1%. 
With respect to cash expense, as a result of deferred tax recognition for the Midstream segment income, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37% this year. This is higher than our previously stated anticipated tax rate of 36%. 
In addition to our earnings release and our 10-Q filings for all of our registrants filed this morning, we would like to remind you of other press releases or filings of interest. First, our Board of Directors declared a $0.2575 dividend per share on July 28, payable on September 9. 
Second, on July 21, we filed with the SEC an amendment to our Form 13-D with respect to our ownership interest in Enable Midstream. The required update to our February filing reflects that we send OG&E a right of first offer, or ROFO, and that we will solicit offers from third parties to acquire our interest in Enable. 
As stated in our press release earlier this year and in our Form 13DA, we continue to evaluate a number of strategic alternatives for our investment in the partnership, including a sale, a spin-off or maintain our ownership. As Scott stated, our intent is to provide an update on the review prior to the end of the year. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

Actual results could differ materially based upon factors, including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers Utility Operations' performance to date and significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance uses non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes or ZENS securities in the -- and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's energy service business. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable midstream's unusual items. 
Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will begin on Slide 4. This morning, we reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $2 million or $0.01 loss p",739,"Thank you, David, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will begin on Slide 4. 
This morning, we reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $2 million or $0.01 loss per diluted share compared with net income of $77 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. Second quarter 2016 earnings were impacted by several charges, which Bill will discuss in greater detail later in the call. 
On a guidance basis, second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $73 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $84 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. 
The fundamentals of our utility business segments remain strong. On a guidance basis, Utility Operations contributed $0.14 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.13 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year, improving $0.01 despite milder-than-normal weather at our electric utility. 
We continue to see strong customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added over 90,000 metered customers during the last 12 months. Capital expenditures remain strong as we invest to meet growth, safety and reliability needs within our service territories. Rate relief, driven by capital investment, continues to be an important contributor to earnings growth. To date, we have secured $45 million in annualized distribution investment recovery at our electric utility and $18 million in annualized revenue associated with recovery of capital investments at our Texas gas utilities. Further, we expect approvals in 2 gas rate cases in the third and fourth quarters. Joe and Tracy will provide additional regulatory updates for their business segments later in the call. 
Turning to midstream investments, we have a number of highlights on Slide 5. Midstream investments contributed $0.03 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.06 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. The contribution was reduced as a result of losses attributable to changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives and an increase in deferred taxes. As I mentioned earlier, Bill will provide additional details on these items. 
Enable's call highlighted the robustness of drilling activity in the SCOOP and STACK plays, which continue to be recognized as 2 of the top plays in the country. Enable continues to focus on strengthening their balance sheet, lowering cost and improving capital efficiency. We believe they are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities over the next few years. 
Turning to Slide 6. Given the year-to-date performance and outlook for both Utility Operations and midstream investments, we are reaffirming full year earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 per diluted share. 2016 earnings growth drivers include utility customer growth, capital discipline, rate relief and operating and financing cost management. 
CenterPoint's core strategy remains to operate, maintain and invest in our current utility service territories, deploying capital to address needs for system growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer interactions. In February, we announced that we would conduct 2 strategic reviews focused on possible incremental value creation for our long-term shareholders. One review contemplated placing utility assets in a REIT structure with the assumption of executing a public offering of that REIT and redeploying those proceeds on behalf of our shareholders. We have completed our REIT evaluation based upon assumptions for qualified assets, revenue requirements determined through general regulatory proceedings and capital markets considerations. Key variables include the collection of federal income taxes within the revenue requirement and the timing of adjustments to lease payments related to capital investments by the REIT on behalf of the utility operating company. We have concluded that current uncertainties, along with the complexity of the structure, do not warrant pursuit of a REIT. As always, we remain open to explore avenues for long-term value creation for our current shareholders. 
The strategic review regarding our Enable ownership is ongoing, and we remain committed to providing an update on this subject before the end of 2016. 
As I mentioned before, our utility fundamentals continue to be strong and on track. We remain committed to our vision to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We are focused on consistent performance, including safe, reliable and efficient operations for our customers and long-term value creation for our shareholders. Tracy will now update you on Houston Electric."
279513,370694753,1027223,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott.

I am pleased with Houston Electric's performance this quarter. As you will see on Slide 8, core operating income in the second quarter of 2016 was $135 million compared with $131 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from rate relief, customer growth, higher equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds and higher right-of-way revenues. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation and taxes, lower usage primarily due to milder weather and modestly higher O&M. Similar to the first quarter of this year, higher depreciation was anticipated due to both the amount and type of capital invested. We continue to focus on keeping annual O&M growth under 2%, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. 
Houston Electric added approximately 55,000 metered customers since the second quarter of last year. We continue to anticipate approximately 2% metered customer growth this year. As we've mentioned before, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually. 
Slide 9 provides a regulatory update for Houston Electric. In April, we filed an application with the Texas Public Utility Commission for a DCRF interim rate adjustment. Our application requested the annualized revenue requirement be set at $49.4 million. In July 2016, a settlement was approved by the commission, providing for an annualized revenue requirement of $45 million, effective September 1, 2016. As a reminder, the amount is reset with each filing, so it is not additive to the approved DCRF revenue requirement from the prior filing. 
Recently, Houston Electric was awarded the International Smart Grid Action Network Award of Excellence and the Global Smart Grid Federation Best Smart Grid Project. Through our smart grid deployment, key technology partnerships and the dedication of our employees, we have reduced outages by more than 134 million minutes, enabled restoration of more than 1.5 million outage cases without a customer phone call and saved millions of dollars in eliminated fees for more than 2.3 million metered customers in our service area. I am pleased to report Houston Electric's performance is on track for the year. Although we experienced milder-than-normal weather in the second quarter, the third quarter to date has been warmer than normal. 
Further, the third quarter has historically been the most impactful quarter for Houston Electric. We will continue to focus on the safety, reliability and efficiency of our system to meet the growing needs of our service territory. 
Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,370694753,1027223,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas distribution business and our nonregulated energy services business, had a solid quarter. As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities was $20 million c",483,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas distribution business and our nonregulated energy services business, had a solid quarter. As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities was $20 million compared to $19 million for the same period in 2015. Operating income was higher, primarily due to rate relief and continued customer growth. These increases were offset by higher depreciation and taxes, as well as increased contractor services expense related to integrity services and increased credit and collection activities. 
Customer growth remained strong at our natural gas utilities, having added nearly 36,000 customers since the second quarter of 2015, almost identical to the growth in customers this time last year. This represents customer growth slightly in excess of 1%. 
Slides 12 and 13 provide detail on 2016 regulatory developments, including  our rate cases in Minnesota and Arkansas.
The Minnesota PUC issued an order authorizing a $27.5 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.49%. We have had interim rates in effect since last fall and will implement final rates later this year. 
In the Arkansas case, a nonunanimous settlement was reached for an annual revenue increase of $14.2 million. The settlement includes the use of a formula rate plan mechanism starting in 2017 to recover future capital investment and expenses. The recommended ROE in the Arkansas settlement is 9.5%. The settlement is pending commission approval, and we expect the final order and new rates to be implemented in the third quarter. 
As Scott mentioned, we have also finalized 4 Texas GRIP cases, which collectively increased revenues $18 million on an annualized basis. 
Turning to Slide 14. Operating income for our Energy Services business was $7 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared with $7 million for the same period last year, excluding a mark-to-market loss of $7 million and a gain of $2 million, respectively. 
Our integration efforts from our recent acquisition are anticipated to be completed within 2016. With more than 12,000 new metered customers, Energy Services now has more than 30,000 customers. Inclusive of integration and acquisition costs, this year, we anticipate the Energy Services business will roughly match last year's financial performance of $38 million in operating income, again, excluding mark-to-market adjustments. 
For 2017, the first full year of combined operations, we now expect Energy Services to provide annual operating income, excluding mark-to-market gains or losses, in the range of $45 million to $55 million. 
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. Excluding mark-to-market, year-to-date operating income is up $13 million or 7% higher than 2015 despite lower weather-related throughput at utilities and acquisition and integration costs at Energy Services. We will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. 
I will now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."
279513,370694753,1027223,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin on Slide 16. We reported the second quarter 2016 loss of $0.01 per diluted share. Earnings included a charge of $110 million or $0.17 per diluted share associated with our ZENS securities. This ch",782,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin on Slide 16. We reported the second quarter 2016 loss of $0.01 per diluted share. Earnings included a charge of $110 million or $0.17 per diluted share associated with our ZENS securities. This charge is primarily due to the merger of Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications through a cash and site sale in the related revaluation of associated assets and liabilities on our books. Further details on the accounting at the merger date on May 18 are provided on Page 17 of the slide deck, as well as Note 11 in our second quarter Form 10-Q. 
In addition, the quarter also included a $0.01 mark-to-market charge in our Energy Services segment. Therefore, our earnings per share on a guidance basis was $0.17 versus earnings of $0.19 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Earnings per share increased $0.01 for our Utility Operations segment and decreased $0.03 for our Midstream Investments. Midstream was impacted by losses attributable to changes in fair value of commodity derivatives. 
As discussed on Enable's call and disclosed in their second quarter Form 10-Q, Enable uses derivatives to manage the partnership's commodity price risk. The accounting for these derivatives requires that the charges associated with the fair value of the instruments be recognized in current earnings. 
In addition, at the CenterPoint level, we recognize an increase in deferred tax expense related to recent Louisiana tax law changes and our Enable income from Louisiana. The sum of these 2 factors reduce the midstream per share contribution to earnings by approximately $0.03. 
Additionally, this is the first quarter that we recognize income from our investment in the Enable preferred, as disclosed in Footnote 8 and within Other Income. Assuming Enable declares this dividend on a going-forward basis, we expect to earn $0.03 per share in 2016 and $0.05 per share per year in future years.
As a reminder, second quarter has historically provided the least contribution to our annual earnings. For the first 2 quarters of this year, we have delivered $0.49 in guidance earnings per share, consisting of $0.37 in utility earnings and $0.12 in the midstream earnings.
Given our performance year-to-date and ongoing strong utility fundamentals, as Scott mentioned earlier, we are reiterating EPS guidance of $1.12 to $1.20. 
As shown on Slide 18, we are also reiterating our target of 4% to 6% EPS growth in each of 27 and 28 '17 and 2018. 
On Slide 19, we provide an overview of our anticipated financing plans, interest expense and effective tax rate. Year-to-date, internally generated cash is strong, allowing us to fully fund capital expenditures and to pay dividends. 
In the second quarter, our interest expense was lower on a period-to-period basis due to refinancing maturing debt at lower interest rates. During the quarter, we refinanced $300 million of short-term debt at Houston Electric with a 5-year maturity at a coupon of 1.85%. We expect to refinance another $300 million of short-term debt at Houston Electric in the second half of 2016. 
Therefore, for the full year 2016, we expect interest expense to be lower compared to 2015 with an EPS contribution of approximately $0.02. 
Interest expense saving opportunities should also present themselves in 2017 and 2018. We have $1.15 billion in maturities in those years, and the weighted average coupon for this maturing debt is roughly 6.1%. 
With respect to cash expense, as a result of deferred tax recognition for the Midstream segment income, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37% this year. This is higher than our previously stated anticipated tax rate of 36%. 
In addition to our earnings release and our 10-Q filings for all of our registrants filed this morning, we would like to remind you of other press releases or filings of interest. 
First, our Board of Directors declared a $0.2575 dividend per share on July 28, payable on September 9. 
Second, on July 21, we filed with the SEC an amendment to our Form 13D with respect to our ownership interest in Enable Midstream. The required update to our February filing reflects that we send OGE a right of first offer, or ROFO, and that we will solicit offers from third parties to acquire our interest in Enable. 
As stated in our press release earlier this year and in our Form 13D/A, we continue to evaluate a number of strategic alternatives for our investment in the partnership, including a sale, a spin-off or maintain our ownership. As Scott stated, our intent is to provide an update on the review prior to the end of the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

We also have with us other members of management, who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks. 
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides, which can be found under the Investors section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing earnings guidance in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides, which along with our Form 10-Q, have been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.  
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers utility operations' performance to date and significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company uses non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes or ZENS securities in the -- and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items.

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will begin on Slide 4. This morning, we reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $2 million or a $0.01 loss",740,"Thank you, David, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will begin on Slide 4. 
This morning, we reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $2 million or a $0.01 loss per diluted share, compared with net income of $77 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. Second quarter 2016 earnings were impacted by several charges, which Bill will discuss in greater detail later in the call. 
On a guidance basis, second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $73 million or $0.17 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $84 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. 
The fundamentals of our utility business segments remain strong. On a guidance basis, utility operations contributed $0.14 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $0.13 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year, improving $0.01 despite milder-than-normal weather at our electric utility. 
We continue to see strong customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added over 90,000 metered customers during the last 12 months. Capital expenditures remain strong as we invest to meet growth, safety and reliability needs within our service territories. Rate relief, driven by capital investment, continues to be an important contributor to earnings growth. To date, we have secured $45 million in annualized distribution investment recovery at our electric utility and $18 million in annualized revenue associated with recovery of capital investments at our Texas gas utilities. Further, we expect approvals in 2 gas rate cases in the third and fourth quarters. Joe and Tracy will provide additional regulatory updates for their business segments later in the call. 
Turning to midstream investments, we have a number of highlights on Slide 5. Midstream investments contributed $0.03 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $0.06 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. The contribution was reduced as a result of losses attributable to changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives and an increase in deferred taxes. As I mentioned earlier, Bill will provide additional details on these items. 
Enable's call highlighted the robustness of drilling activity in the SCOOP and STACK plays, which continue to be recognized as 2 of the top plays in the country. Enable continues to focus on strengthening their balance sheet, lowering cost and improving capital efficiency. We believe they are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities over the next few years. 
Turning to Slide 6. Given the year-to-date performance and outlook for both utility operations and midstream investments, we are reaffirming full year earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 per diluted share. 2016 earnings growth drivers include utility customer growth, capital discipline, rate relief and operating and financing cost management. 
CenterPoint's core strategy remains to operate, maintain and invest in our current utility service territories, deploying capital to address needs for system growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer interactions. In February, we announced that we would conduct 2 strategic reviews focused on possible incremental value creation for our long-term shareholders. One review contemplated placing utility assets in a REIT structure, with the assumption of executing a public offering of that REIT and redeploying those proceeds on behalf of our shareholders. We have completed our REIT evaluation based upon assumptions for qualified assets, revenue requirements determined through general regulatory proceedings and capital markets considerations. Key variables include the collection of federal income taxes within the revenue requirement and the timing of adjustments to lease payments related to capital investments by the REIT on behalf of the utility operating company. We have concluded that current uncertainties, along with the complexity of the structure, do not warrant pursuit of a REIT. As always, we remain open to explore avenues for long-term value creation for our current shareholders. 
The strategic review regarding our Enable ownership is ongoing, and we remain committed to providing an update on this subject before the end of 2016. 
As I mentioned before, our utility fundamentals continue to be strong and on track. We remain committed to our vision to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We are focused on consistent performance, including safe, reliable and efficient operations for our customers and long-term value creation for our shareholders. Tracy will now update you on Houston Electric."

As you will see on Slide 8, core operating income in the second quarter of 2016 was $135 million, compared with $131 million for the same period last year. The business benef",415,"Thank you, Scott. I am pleased with Houston Electric's performance this quarter. As you will see on Slide 8, core operating income in the second quarter of 2016 was $135 million, compared with $131 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from rate relief, customer growth, higher equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds and higher right-of-way revenues. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation and taxes, lower usage primarily due to milder weather and modestly higher O&M. Similar to the first quarter of this year, higher depreciation was anticipated due to both the amount and type of capital invested. We continue to focus on keeping annual O&M growth under 2%, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. 
Houston Electric added approximately 55,000 metered customers since the second quarter of last year. We continue to anticipate approximately 2% metered customer growth this year. As we've mentioned before, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually. 
Slide 9 provides a regulatory update for Houston Electric. In April, we filed an application with the Texas Public Utility Commission for a DCRF interim rate adjustment. Our application requested the annualized revenue requirement be set at $49.4 million. In July 2016, a settlement was approved by the commission, providing for an annualized revenue requirement of $45 million, effective September 1, 2016. As a reminder, the amount is reset with each filing, so it is not additive to the approved DCRF revenue requirement from the prior filing. 
Recently, Houston Electric was awarded the International Smart Grid Action Network Award of Excellence and the Global Smart Grid Federation Best Smart Grid Project. Through our smart grid deployment, key technology partnerships and the dedication of our employees, we have reduced outages by more than 134 million minutes, enabled restoration of more than 1.5 million outage cases without a customer phone call and saved millions of dollars in eliminated fees for more than 2.3 million metered customers in our service area. I am pleased to report Houston Electric's performance is on track for the year. Although we experienced milder-than-normal weather in the second quarter, the third quarter to date has been warmer than normal. 
Further, the third quarter has historically been the most impactful quarter for Houston Electric. We will continue to focus on the safety, reliability and efficiency of our system to meet the growing needs of our service territory. 
Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."

Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas distribution business and our nonregulated Energy Services business, had a solid quarter. As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities was $20 million,",484,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas distribution business and our nonregulated Energy Services business, had a solid quarter. As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities was $20 million, compared to $19 million for the same period in 2015. Operating income was higher, primarily due to rate relief and continued customer growth. These increases were offset by higher depreciation and taxes, as well as increased contractor services expense related to integrity services and increased credit and collection activities. 
Customer growth remained strong at our natural gas utilities, having added nearly 36,000 customers since the second quarter of 2015, almost identical to the growth in customers this time last year. This represents customer growth slightly in excess of 1%. 
Slides 12 and 13 provide detail on 2016 regulatory developments, including  our rate cases in Minnesota and Arkansas.
The Minnesota PUC issued an order authorizing a $27.5 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.49%. We have had interim rates in effect since last fall and will implement final rates later this year. 
In the Arkansas case, a non-unanimous settlement was reached for an annual revenue increase of $14.2 million. The settlement includes the use of a formula rate plan mechanism starting in 2017 to recover future capital investment and expenses. The recommended ROE in the Arkansas settlement is 9.5%. The settlement is pending commission approval, and we expect a final order and new rates to be implemented in the third quarter. 
As Scott mentioned, we have also finalized 4 Texas GRIP cases, which collectively increase revenues $18 million on an annualized basis. 
Turning to Slide 14. Operating income for our Energy Services business was $7 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared with $7 million for the same period last year, excluding a mark-to-market loss of $7 million and a gain of $2 million, respectively. 
Our integration efforts from our recent acquisition are anticipated to be completed within 2016. With more than 12,000 new metered customers, Energy Services now has more than 30,000 customers. Inclusive of integration and acquisition costs, this year, we anticipate the Energy Services business will roughly match last year's financial performance of $38 million in operating income, again, excluding mark-to-market adjustments. 
For 2017, the first full year of combined operations, we now expect Energy Services to provide annual operating income, excluding mark-to-market gains or losses, in the range of $45 million to $55 million. 
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. Excluding mark-to-market, year-to-date operating income is up $13 million or 7% higher than 2015, despite lower weather-related throughput at the utilities and acquisition and integration costs at Energy Services. We will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. 
I will now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."

I will begin on Slide 16. We reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $0.01 per diluted share. Earnings included a charge of $110 million or $0.17 per diluted share associated with our ZENS securities. This char",783,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin on Slide 16. We reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $0.01 per diluted share. Earnings included a charge of $110 million or $0.17 per diluted share associated with our ZENS securities. This charge is primarily due to the merger of Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications through a cash and stock sale and the related revaluation of associated assets and liabilities on our books. Further details on the accounting at the merger date on May 18 are provided on Page 17 of the slide deck, as well as Note 11 in our second quarter Form 10-Q. 
In addition, the quarter also included a $0.01 mark-to-market charge in our Energy Services segment. Therefore, our earnings per share on a guidance basis was $0.17 versus earnings of $0.19 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Earnings per share increased $0.01 for our utility operations segment and decreased $0.03 for our midstream investments. Midstream was impacted by losses attributable to changes in fair value of commodity derivatives. 
As discussed on Enable's call and disclosed in their second quarter Form 10-Q, Enable uses derivatives to manage the partnership's commodity price risk. The accounting for these derivatives requires that the charges associated with the fair value of the instruments be recognized in current earnings. 
In addition, at the CenterPoint level, we recognized an increase in deferred tax expense related to recent Louisiana tax law changes and our Enable income from Louisiana. The sum of these 2 factors reduced the midstream per share contribution to our earnings by approximately $0.03. 
Additionally, this is the first quarter that we recognize income from our investment in the Enable preferred, as disclosed in Footnote 8 and within Other Income. Assuming Enable declares this dividend on a going-forward basis, we expect to earn $0.03 per share in 2016 and $0.05 per share per year in future years.
As a reminder, second quarter has historically provided the least contribution to our annual earnings. For the first 2 quarters of this year, we have delivered $0.49 in guidance earnings per share, consisting of $0.37 in utility earnings and $0.12 in midstream earnings.
Given our performance year-to-date and ongoing strong utility fundamentals, as Scott mentioned earlier, we are reiterating EPS guidance of $1.12 to $1.20. 
As shown on Slide 18, we are also reiterating our target of 4% to 6% EPS growth in each of 27 and 28 -- '17 and 2018. 
On Slide 19, we provide an overview of our anticipated financing plans, interest expense and effective tax rate. Year-to-date, internally generated cash is strong, allowing us to fully fund capital expenditures and to pay dividends. 
In the second quarter, our interest expense was lower on a period-to-period basis due to refinancing maturing debt at lower interest rates. During the quarter, we refinanced $300 million of short-term debt at Houston Electric with a 5-year maturity at a coupon of 1.85%. We expect to refinance another $300 million of short-term debt at Houston Electric in the second half of 2016. 
Therefore, for the full year 2016, we expect interest expense to be lower compared to 2015, with an EPS contribution of approximately $0.02. 
Interest expense saving opportunities should also present themselves in 2017 and 2018. We have $1.15 billion in maturities in those years, and the weighted average coupon for this maturing debt is roughly 6.1%. 
With respect to cash expense, as a result of deferred tax recognition for the midstream segment income, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37% this year. This is higher than our previously stated anticipated tax rate of 36%. 
In addition to our earnings release and our 10-Q filings for all of our registrants filed this morning, we would like to remind you of other press releases or filings of interest. 
First, our Board of Directors declared a $0.2575 dividend per share on July 28, payable on September 9. 
Second, on July 21, we filed with the SEC an amendment to our Form 13D with respect to our ownership interest in Enable Midstream. The required update to our February filing reflects that we send OGE a right of first offer, or ROFO, and that we will solicit offers from third parties to acquire our interest in Enable. 
As stated in our press release earlier this year and in our Form 13D/A, we continue to evaluate a number of strategic alternatives for our investment in the partnership, including a sale, a spin-off or maintain our ownership. As Scott stated, our intent is to provide an update on the review prior to the end of the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Bill Rogers, Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our second quarter 2016 results and provide highlights on other key areas. We also have with us other members of management, who may assist in answering questions following the prepared remarks. 
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides, which can be found under the Investors section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing earnings guidance in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and our slides, which along with our Form 10-Q, have been posted on our website. Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.  
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers utility operations' performance to date and significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company uses non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes or ZENS securities in the -- and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items. 
Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott."

Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will begin on Slide 4. This morning, we reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $2 million or a $0.01 loss",740,"Thank you, David, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will begin on Slide 4. 
This morning, we reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $2 million or a $0.01 loss per diluted share, compared with net income of $77 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. Second quarter 2016 earnings were impacted by several charges, which Bill will discuss in greater detail later in the call. 
On a guidance basis, second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $73 million or $0.17 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $84 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. 
The fundamentals of our utility business segments remain strong. On a guidance basis, utility operations contributed $0.14 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $0.13 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year, improving $0.01 despite milder-than-normal weather at our electric utility. 
We continue to see strong customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added over 90,000 metered customers during the last 12 months. Capital expenditures remain strong as we invest to meet growth, safety and reliability needs within our service territories. Rate relief, driven by capital investment, continues to be an important contributor to earnings growth. To date, we have secured $45 million in annualized distribution investment recovery at our electric utility and $18 million in annualized revenue associated with recovery of capital investments at our Texas gas utilities. Further, we expect approvals in 2 gas rate cases in the third and fourth quarters. Joe and Tracy will provide additional regulatory updates for their business segments later in the call. 
Turning to midstream investments, we have a number of highlights on Slide 5. Midstream investments contributed $0.03 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $0.06 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. The contribution was reduced as a result of losses attributable to changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives and an increase in deferred taxes. As I mentioned earlier, Bill will provide additional details on these items. 
Enable's call highlighted the robustness of drilling activity in the SCOOP and STACK plays, which continue to be recognized as 2 of the top plays in the country. Enable continues to focus on strengthening their balance sheet, lowering cost and improving capital efficiency. We believe they are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities over the next few years. 
Turning to Slide 6. Given the year-to-date performance and outlook for both utility operations and midstream investments, we are reaffirming full year earnings guidance of $1.12 to $1.20 per diluted share. 2016 earnings growth drivers include utility customer growth, capital discipline, rate relief and operating and financing cost management. 
CenterPoint's core strategy remains to operate, maintain and invest in our current utility service territories, deploying capital to address needs for system growth, maintenance, reliability, safety and customer interactions. In February, we announced that we would conduct 2 strategic reviews focused on possible incremental value creation for our long-term shareholders. One review contemplated placing utility assets in a REIT structure, with the assumption of executing a public offering of that REIT and redeploying those proceeds on behalf of our shareholders. We have completed our REIT evaluation based upon assumptions for qualified assets, revenue requirements determined through general regulatory proceedings and capital markets considerations. Key variables include the collection of federal income taxes within the revenue requirement and the timing of adjustments to lease payments related to capital investments by the REIT on behalf of the utility operating company. We have concluded that current uncertainties, along with the complexity of the structure, do not warrant pursuit of a REIT. As always, we remain open to explore avenues for long-term value creation for our current shareholders. 
The strategic review regarding our Enable ownership is ongoing, and we remain committed to providing an update on this subject before the end of 2016. 
As I mentioned before, our utility fundamentals continue to be strong and on track. We remain committed to our vision to lead the nation in delivering energy, service and value. We are focused on consistent performance, including safe, reliable and efficient operations for our customers and long-term value creation for our shareholders. Tracy will now update you on Houston Electric."

I am pleased with Houston Electric's performance this quarter. As you will see on Slide 8, core operating income in the second quarter of 2016 was $135 million, compared with $131 million for the same period last year. The business benefited from rate relief, customer growth, higher equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds and higher right-of-way revenues. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation and taxes, lower usage primarily due to milder weather and modestly higher O&M. Similar to the first quarter of this year, higher depreciation was anticipated due to both the amount and type of capital invested. We continue to focus on keeping annual O&M growth under 2%, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. 
Houston Electric added approximately 55,000 metered customers since the second quarter of last year. We continue to anticipate approximately 2% metered customer growth this year. As we've mentioned before, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually. 
Slide 9 provides a regulatory update for Houston Electric. In April, we filed an application with the Texas Public Utility Commission for a DCRF interim rate adjustment. Our application requested the annualized revenue requirement be set at $49.4 million. In July 2016, a settlement was approved by the commission, providing for an annualized revenue requirement of $45 million, effective September 1, 2016. As a reminder, the amount is reset with each filing, so it is not additive to the approved DCRF revenue requirement from the prior filing. 
Recently, Houston Electric was awarded the International Smart Grid Action Network Award of Excellence and the Global Smart Grid Federation Best Smart Grid Project. Through our smart grid deployment, key technology partnerships and the dedication of our employees, we have reduced outages by more than 134 million minutes, enabled restoration of more than 1.5 million outage cases without a customer phone call and saved millions of dollars in eliminated fees for more than 2.3 million metered customers in our service area. I am pleased to report Houston Electric's performance is on track for the year. Although we experienced milder-than-normal weather in the second quarter, the third quarter to date has been warmer than normal. 
Further, the third quarter has historically been the most impactful quarter for Houston Electric. We will continue to focus on the safety, reliability and efficiency of our system to meet the growing needs of our service territory. 
Joe will now update you on the results for gas operations."
279513,370694753,1028113,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas distribution business and our nonregulated Energy Services business, had a solid quarter. As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities was $20 million,",484,"Thank you, Tracy. Our natural gas operations, which includes both our gas distribution business and our nonregulated Energy Services business, had a solid quarter. As you'll see on Slide 11, operating income for our natural gas utilities was $20 million, compared to $19 million for the same period in 2015. Operating income was higher, primarily due to rate relief and continued customer growth. These increases were offset by higher depreciation and taxes, as well as increased contractor services expense related to integrity services and increased credit and collection activities. 
Customer growth remained strong at our natural gas utilities, having added nearly 36,000 customers since the second quarter of 2015, almost identical to the growth in customers this time last year. This represents customer growth slightly in excess of 1%. 
Slides 12 and 13 provide detail on 2016 regulatory developments, including  our rate cases in Minnesota and Arkansas.
The Minnesota PUC issued an order authorizing a $27.5 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.49%. We have had interim rates in effect since last fall and will implement final rates later this year. 
In the Arkansas case, a non-unanimous settlement was reached for an annual revenue increase of $14.2 million. The settlement includes the use of a formula rate plan mechanism starting in 2017 to recover future capital investment and expenses. The recommended ROE in the Arkansas settlement is 9.5%. The settlement is pending commission approval, and we expect a final order and new rates to be implemented in the third quarter. 
As Scott mentioned, we have also finalized 4 Texas GRIP cases, which collectively increase revenues $18 million on an annualized basis. 
Turning to Slide 14. Operating income for our Energy Services business was $7 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared with $7 million for the same period last year, excluding a mark-to-market loss of $7 million and a gain of $2 million, respectively. 
Our integration efforts from our recent acquisition are anticipated to be completed within 2016. With more than 12,000 new metered customers, Energy Services now has more than 30,000 customers. Inclusive of integration and acquisition costs, this year, we anticipate the Energy Services business will roughly match last year's financial performance of $38 million in operating income, again, excluding mark-to-market adjustments. 
For 2017, the first full year of combined operations, we now expect Energy Services to provide annual operating income, excluding mark-to-market gains or losses, in the range of $45 million to $55 million. 
Overall, our natural gas operations performed well this quarter. Excluding mark-to-market, year-to-date operating income is up $13 million or 7% higher than 2015, despite lower weather-related throughput at the utilities and acquisition and integration costs at Energy Services. We will continue to operate effectively and efficiently as we focus on growth, safety and the reliability of our system. 
I will now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."
279513,370694753,1028113,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","CenterPoint Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin on Slide 16. We reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $0.01 per diluted share. Earnings included a charge of $110 million or $0.17 per diluted share associated with our ZENS securities. This char",783,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everyone. I will begin on Slide 16. We reported a second quarter 2016 loss of $0.01 per diluted share. Earnings included a charge of $110 million or $0.17 per diluted share associated with our ZENS securities. This charge is primarily due to the merger of Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications through a cash and stock sale and the related revaluation of associated assets and liabilities on our books. Further details on the accounting at the merger date on May 18 are provided on Page 17 of the slide deck, as well as Note 11 in our second quarter Form 10-Q. 
In addition, the quarter also included a $0.01 mark-to-market charge in our Energy Services segment. Therefore, our earnings per share on a guidance basis was $0.17 versus earnings of $0.19 per share for the second quarter of 2015. Earnings per share increased $0.01 for our utility operations segment and decreased $0.03 for our midstream investments. Midstream was impacted by losses attributable to changes in fair value of commodity derivatives. 
As discussed on Enable's call and disclosed in their second quarter Form 10-Q, Enable uses derivatives to manage the partnership's commodity price risk. The accounting for these derivatives requires that the charges associated with the fair value of the instruments be recognized in current earnings. 
In addition, at the CenterPoint level, we recognized an increase in deferred tax expense related to recent Louisiana tax law changes and our Enable income from Louisiana. The sum of these 2 factors reduced the midstream per share contribution to our earnings by approximately $0.03. 
Additionally, this is the first quarter that we recognize income from our investment in the Enable preferred, as disclosed in Footnote 8 and within Other Income. Assuming Enable declares this dividend on a going-forward basis, we expect to earn $0.03 per share in 2016 and $0.05 per share per year in future years.
As a reminder, second quarter has historically provided the least contribution to our annual earnings. For the first 2 quarters of this year, we have delivered $0.49 in guidance earnings per share, consisting of $0.37 in utility earnings and $0.12 in midstream earnings.
Given our performance year-to-date and ongoing strong utility fundamentals, as Scott mentioned earlier, we are reiterating EPS guidance of $1.12 to $1.20. 
As shown on Slide 18, we are also reiterating our target of 4% to 6% EPS growth in each of 27 and 28 -- '17 and 2018. 
On Slide 19, we provide an overview of our anticipated financing plans, interest expense and effective tax rate. Year-to-date, internally generated cash is strong, allowing us to fully fund capital expenditures and to pay dividends. 
In the second quarter, our interest expense was lower on a period-to-period basis due to refinancing maturing debt at lower interest rates. During the quarter, we refinanced $300 million of short-term debt at Houston Electric with a 5-year maturity at a coupon of 1.85%. We expect to refinance another $300 million of short-term debt at Houston Electric in the second half of 2016. 
Therefore, for the full year 2016, we expect interest expense to be lower compared to 2015, with an EPS contribution of approximately $0.02. 
Interest expense saving opportunities should also present themselves in 2017 and 2018. We have $1.15 billion in maturities in those years, and the weighted average coupon for this maturing debt is roughly 6.1%. 
With respect to cash expense, as a result of deferred tax recognition for the midstream segment income, we expect our effective tax rate to be 37% this year. This is higher than our previously stated anticipated tax rate of 36%. 
In addition to our earnings release and our 10-Q filings for all of our registrants filed this morning, we would like to remind you of other press releases or filings of interest. 
First, our Board of Directors declared a $0.2575 dividend per share on July 28, payable on September 9. 
Second, on July 21, we filed with the SEC an amendment to our Form 13D with respect to our ownership interest in Enable Midstream. The required update to our February filing reflects that we send OGE a right of first offer, or ROFO, and that we will solicit offers from third parties to acquire our interest in Enable. 
As stated in our press release earlier this year and in our Form 13D/A, we continue to evaluate a number of strategic alternatives for our investment in the partnership, including a sale, a spin-off or maintain our ownership. As Scott stated, our intent is to provide an update on the review prior to the end of the year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to David."

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. We recognize this is a busy day for earnings calls, so we especially appreciate your interest in CenterPoint. Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Bill Rogers, Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our third quarter 2016 results and provide highlights on other key areas.
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides which can be found under the Investors section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing earnings guidance in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and to our slides, which along with our Form 10-Q, have been posted on our website.
Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers utility operations' performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes, or ZENS securities, and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items.
Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found in our website.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
We will begin on Slide 4. This morning, we reported third quarter 2016 net income of $179 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with a loss of $391 million or a loss of $0.91 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. The 2015 loss is inclusive of impairment charges related to midstream investments.
On a guidance basis, third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $177 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $146 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year.
Utility operations and midstream investments both performed well this quarter. We had strong contribution from Houston Electric during their peak season as well as solid results from gas distribution and energy services. On a guidance basis, utility operations contributed $0.31 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year, improving $0.07 per share.
Our strong third quarter utility performance was driven by a number of factors. We continue to see solid customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added over 86,000 metered customers during the last 12 months.
Capital expenditures remain strong as we invest to meet growth, safety and reliability needs within our service territories. Rate relief, driven by capital investment, continues to be an important contributor to earnings growth. Tracy and Joe will provide additional regulatory updates for their business segments later in the call.
Slide 5 provides some of the highlights from Enable's third quarter results. Midstream investments contributed $0.10 per diluted share for both the third quarter of 2016 and the same period of last year. On their third quarter call, Wednesday, Enable guided to the midpoint of their previous 2016 guidance for net income attributable to unit holders. This equates to the high end of our guidance range for midstream investments.
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, Enable has achieved a coverage ratio of 1.26x. Enable also provided an initial estimate for 2017 net income attributable to unit holders, which represents notable growth over their estimate for 2016. Their 2017 forecast is driven by several favorable developments. Rig counts continue to increase. The number of rigs contractually dedicated to Enable rose more than 13% during the last quarter. Enable also signed a new 10-year gathering and processing agreement in the STACK, replacing an existing percent of proceeds contract and adding 61,000 additional gross dedicated acres to their STACK footprint. The terms of the contract increases their fee-based margin and reduces their commodity exposure. We are very pleased to see these improvements and the positive impact it has on their 2017 forecast.
On Monday, we announced the purchase of Atmos Energy Marketing from Atmos Energy. Our gas marketing and sales business continues to be a steady contributor to earnings growth and is a valuable complement to the organic growth of our natural gas utilities. Jill (sic) [  Bill ] will share more about this purchase in his remarks.
As most of you are aware, in February, we announced our intention to evaluate strategic alternatives for our midstream investment segment. Our objective is twofold: First, explore ways to reduce CenterPoint's share price volatility caused by commodity price impacts on Enable's earnings and unit price; and second, only take action if we can create sustained value for our long-term shareholders. The options open for consideration are a sale, a spin of a new company containing CenterPoint stake in Enable or keep our current stake in Enable and work to reduce exposure to commodity price influences. That process continues. And Bill will provide more detail on the sale evaluation process and tax considerations in connection with the spin.
Turning to Slide 6. Given the year-to-date performance and outlook for both utility operations and midstream investments, we are updating our 2016 full year earnings guidance to $1.16 to $1.20 per diluted share. Our investors value consistent steady growth, and we continue to target 4% to 6% annual earnings growth through 2018.
Tracy will now update you on Houston Electric."

I am pleased with Houston Electric's operational and financial results this quarter. Starting on Slide 8, core operating income in the third quarter of 2016 was $234 million compared with $219 million for the same period last year.
The business benefited from rate relief, customer growth and higher equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation and other taxes.
By the time we have our next earnings call, Houston will have hosted Super Bowl 51. It's great to see Houston getting ready with enhancements throughout the city. Houston's growing economy continues to require a substantial electric infrastructure improvements and capital investment.  Through the end of the third quarter, we've invested $638 million in capital, and our meter count is up 2% from the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually.
O&M expense for the third quarter of 2016 was 1.7% higher than the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We continue to focus on keeping annual O&M growth under 2%.
Slide 9 provides an overview of regulatory developments year-to-date. Our regulatory strategy remains on track. Since the last earnings call, we received approval for our July transmission cost of service or TCOS filing. Adjusted rates from our TCOS filing as well as our April Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, or DCRF filing, went into effect in September.
Additionally, we recently received approval for our $10.6 million energy efficiency performance incentive, and we will recognize those earnings in the fourth quarter.
Joe will now update you on the results for natural gas operations."

Natural gas distribution's third quarter operating in",589,"Thank you, Tracy.
Our natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas distribution business and our nonregulated energy services business, had a strong third quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. Natural gas distribution's third quarter operating income was $22 million compared to $11 million for the same period in 2015.
Operating income was higher due to several factors, including rate relief, revenue from decoupling mechanisms, lower bad debt expense and lower sales and use tax. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and labor and benefits expense.
We continue to see solid natural gas distribution customer growth of approximately 1%, having added nearly 35,000 customers since the third quarter of 2015. O&M expenses were approximately 1.5% higher in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets.  Despite the quarter-to-quarter variability that can occur, O&M expense discipline remains a priority.
We continue to benefit from our long standing regulatory strategy of utilizing constructive rate mechanisms like the decoupling mechanisms in Arkansas and Minnesota that contributed to earnings this quarter. For a complete overview of regulatory developments this year, please see slides 12 and 13. I'll speak to a few of the highlights.
In September, we received the final order for our Arkansas rate case, which provided for an annual increase of $14.2 million. This increase implemented in September reflects the 9.5% ROE. It also established a formula rate tariff which allows rates to be adjusted based on a plus or minus 50-basis point banded ROE approach and a projected test year.
In Minnesota, the $12.7 million conservation improvement program incentive, which we filed in May 2016, was approved by the Minnesota commission and recognized in the third quarter this year.
Later this month, we plan to file a Houston and Texas coast rate case that seeks to combine 2 rate jurisdictions that are operationally and geographically aligned. We are required to file a rate case in our Houston jurisdiction, and once finalized, this case will reset rate base and allow us to utilize the GRIP mechanism in the future. We do not anticipate receiving incremental GRIP revenues in these 2 jurisdictions while the case is active. Because we have not filed the rate case yet, we cannot share any further details at this time.
Turning to Slide 14. Operating income for our energy services business was $7 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $2 million for the same period last year, excluding a mark-to-market loss of $2 million and a gain of $5 million, respectively.
As announced on Monday, we have signed an agreement with Atmos Energy to acquire their retail energy services business, Atmos Energy Marketing or AEM. This business is complementary to our existing energy services business and will allow us to grow our customer base and revenues while maintaining a low bar operating model and a cost-effective organization. This deal will increase our scale, geographic reach and expand our capabilities. We are particularly excited about AEM's impressive large industrial customer mix and their talented and experienced employees.
Energy services continues to be a steady and growing contributor to CenterPoint's earnings growth.
I'll close by pointing out that in addition to Houston Electric being the host of electric utility serving in the upcoming Super Bowl, gas distribution will also be serving the Super Bowl in Houston as well as Super Bowl 52 in Minneapolis at U.S. Bank Stadium.
I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."

I will begin on Slide 16.Today, we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $0.41 per diluted share. On a guidance basis, earnings were also $0.41 per diluted share versus $0.34 for third quarter 2015.Guidanc",678,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I will begin on Slide 16.
Today, we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $0.41 per diluted share. On a guidance basis, earnings were also $0.41 per diluted share versus $0.34 for third quarter 2015.
Guidance basis earnings per share increased $0.07 for our utility operations segment compared to last year. Our midstream investment segment was $0.10 per share for this quarter and for third quarter 2015. As Tracy and Joe discussed, combined core operating income improved $31 million, excluding mark-to-market adjustments.
Year-to-date, we have delivered $0.90 in guidance basis EPS, consisting of $0.68 in utility operations earnings and $0.22 in midstream investment earnings.
We are updating our full year 2016 EPS guidance range to $1.16 to $1.20 based on the strength of our combined performance year-to-date, our expectations for the fourth quarter and Enable's recent confirmation of its 2016 guidance. We are also confirming our year-over-year EPS growth target of 4% to 6% in 2017 and 2018.
Dividend increases will come with earnings growth at a rate that will allow us to gradually move our payout ratio lower. As Scott and Joe have mentioned, we announced an agreement to purchase Atmos Energy marketing on Monday. We plan to finance this through internally generated cash flow and/or debt financing. We expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive in 2017 after costs associated with the acquisition and integration into CES.
As Joe reviewed in our second quarter call, we are forecasting that our CES business will provide $45 million to $55 million in operating income in 2017. We expect AEM to be additive to this forecast.
As previously disclosed, in 2017, we expect to benefit of approximately $12 million in net income from a full year of our investment in Enable's preferred securities and from interest expense savings.
Slide 17 details our expected financing plans, interest expense and effective tax rate. Cash from operations remain strong.  Therefore, we continue to believe we will not need equity in either 2017 or 2018. Further, we see, foresee modest incremental debt requirements in those years. We are committed to strong credit metrics with a target consolidated FFO debt metric of 18% to 20%. As of the third quarter, we are well above that target credit metric.
Additionally, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 to be 37% due to the onetime recognition of deferred tax for midstream segment income in the second quarter. On a going-forward basis, we expect the effective tax rate to be 36%.
Finally, I'll take a moment to expand on the Enable strategic review. We recognize this process is taking longer than expected. We continue to explore 3 options: Sale, spin or keep.
You can review our objectives for potential transaction on Slide 18. Our criteria for consideration of a sale or spin include comparable earnings and dividends per share, improved visibility and certainty of future earnings and lower volatility from our midstream investments.
We would seek to meet these criteria without a change to our credit ratings. With respect to the sale option, we continue our discussions with third parties that have an interest in our midstream investments.  Should those discussions continue past mid-January, the partnership agreement requires that we submit a Right of First Offer or ROFO notice to OG&E to continue such discussions.  Due to the confidential nature of our discussions, we are not providing any further comment at this time. 
With respect to the spin option, we are working to gain certainty regarding the tax characteristics of the spend and confirmation of minimal tax leakage that may occur as a result of the spin.
Further, we continue to research capital market considerations with our existing investors and others, including whether the resulting entity from a spin would be an attractive security for our portfolio managers.
Let me conclude by reminding you that our Board of Directors declared a $0.2575 [ph] of dividend per share on October 27, payable on December 9. 
And with that, I will turn the call back over to David."

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. We recognize this is a busy day for earnings calls, so we especially appreciate your interest in CenterPoint. Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Bill Rogers, Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our third quarter 2016 results and provide highlights on other key areas.
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides which can be found under the Investors section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing earnings guidance in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and to our slides, which along with our Form 10-Q, have been posted on our website.
Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers utility operations' performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes, or ZENS securities, and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items.
Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found in our website.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
We will begin on Slide 4. This morning, we reported third quarter 2016 net income of $179 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with a loss of $391 million or a loss of $0.91 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. The 2015 loss is inclusive of impairment charges related to midstream investments.
On a guidance basis, third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $177 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $146 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year.
Utility operations and midstream investments both performed well this quarter. We had strong contribution from Houston Electric during their peak season as well as solid results from gas distribution and energy services. On a guidance basis, utility operations contributed $0.31 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year, improving $0.07 per share.
Our strong third quarter utility performance was driven by a number of factors. We continue to see solid customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added over 86,000 metered customers during the last 12 months.
Capital expenditures remain strong as we invest to meet growth, safety and reliability needs within our service territories. Rate relief, driven by capital investment, continues to be an important contributor to earnings growth. Tracy and Joe will provide additional regulatory updates for their business segments later in the call.
Slide 5 provides some of the highlights from Enable's third quarter results. Midstream investments contributed $0.10 per diluted share for both the third quarter of 2016 and the same period of last year. On their third quarter call, Wednesday, Enable guided to the midpoint of their previous 2016 guidance for net income attributable to unit holders. This equates to the high end of our guidance range for midstream investments.
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, Enable has achieved a coverage ratio of 1.26x. Enable also provided an initial estimate for 2017 net income attributable to unit holders, which represents notable growth over their estimate for 2016. Their 2017 forecast is driven by several favorable developments. Rig counts continue to increase. The number of rigs contractually dedicated to Enable rose more than 13% during the last quarter. Enable also signed a new 10-year gathering and processing agreement in the STACK, replacing an existing percent of proceeds contract and adding 61,000 additional gross dedicated acres to their STACK footprint. The terms of the contract increases their fee-based margin and reduces their commodity exposure. We are very pleased to see these improvements and the positive impact it has on their 2017 forecast.
On Monday, we announced the purchase of Atmos Energy Marketing from Atmos Energy. Our gas marketing and sales business continues to be a steady contributor to earnings growth and is a valuable complement to the organic growth of our natural gas utilities. Jill (sic) [  Bill ] will share more about this purchase in his remarks.
As most of you are aware, in February, we announced our intention to evaluate strategic alternatives for our midstream investment segment. Our objective is twofold: First, explore ways to reduce CenterPoint's share price volatility caused by commodity price impacts on Enable's earnings and unit price; and second, only take action if we can create sustained value for our long-term shareholders. The options open for consideration are a sale, a spin of a new company containing CenterPoint stake in Enable or keep our current stake in Enable and work to reduce exposure to commodity price influences. That process continues. And Bill will provide more detail on the sale evaluation process and tax considerations in connection with the spin.
Turning to Slide 6. Given the year-to-date performance and outlook for both utility operations and midstream investments, we are updating our 2016 full year earnings guidance to $1.16 to $1.20 per diluted share. Our investors value consistent steady growth, and we continue to target 4% to 6% annual earnings growth through 2018.
Tracy will now update you on Houston Electric."

I am pleased with Houston Electric's operational and financial results this quarter. Starting on Slide 8, core operating income in the third quarter of 2016 was $234 million compared with $219 million for the same period last year.
The business benefited from rate relief, customer growth and higher equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation and other taxes.
By the time we have our next earnings call, Houston will have hosted Super Bowl 51. It's great to see Houston getting ready with enhancements throughout the city. Houston's growing economy continues to require a substantial electric infrastructure improvements and capital investment. Through the end of the third quarter, we've invested $638 million in capital, and our meter count is up 2% from the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually.
O&M expense for the third quarter of 2016 was 1.7% higher than the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We continue to focus on keeping annual O&M growth under 2%.
Slide 9 provides an overview of regulatory developments year-to-date. Our regulatory strategy remains on track. Since the last earnings call, we received approval for our July transmission cost of service or TCOS filing. Adjusted rates from our TCOS filing as well as our April Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, or DCRF filing, went into effect in September.
Additionally, we recently received approval for our $10.6 million energy efficiency performance incentive, and we will recognize those earnings in the fourth quarter.
Joe will now update you on the results for natural gas operations."

Natural gas distribution's third quarter operating in",589,"Thank you, Tracy.
Our natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas distribution business and our nonregulated energy services business, had a strong third quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. Natural gas distribution's third quarter operating income was $22 million compared to $11 million for the same period in 2015.
Operating income was higher due to several factors, including rate relief, revenue from decoupling mechanisms, lower bad debt expense and lower sales and use tax. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and labor and benefits expense.
We continue to see solid natural gas distribution customer growth of approximately 1%, having added nearly 35,000 customers since the third quarter of 2015. O&M expenses were approximately 1.5% higher in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. Despite the quarter-to-quarter variability that can occur, O&M expense discipline remains a priority.
We continue to benefit from our long standing regulatory strategy of utilizing constructive rate mechanisms like the decoupling mechanisms in Arkansas and Minnesota that contributed to earnings this quarter. For a complete overview of regulatory developments this year, please see slides 12 and 13. I'll speak to a few of the highlights.
In September, we received the final order for our Arkansas rate case, which provided for an annual increase of $14.2 million. This increase implemented in September reflects the 9.5% ROE. It also established a formula rate tariff which allows rates to be adjusted based on a plus or minus 50-basis point banded ROE approach and a projected test year.
In Minnesota, the $12.7 million conservation improvement program incentive, which we filed in May 2016, was approved by the Minnesota commission and recognized in the third quarter this year.
Later this month, we plan to file a Houston and Texas coast rate case that seeks to combine 2 rate jurisdictions that are operationally and geographically aligned. We are required to file a rate case in our Houston jurisdiction, and once finalized, this case will reset rate base and allow us to utilize the GRIP mechanism in the future. We do not anticipate receiving incremental GRIP revenues in these 2 jurisdictions while the case is active. Because we have not filed the rate case yet, we cannot share any further details at this time.
Turning to Slide 14. Operating income for our energy services business was $7 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $2 million for the same period last year, excluding a mark-to-market loss of $2 million and a gain of $5 million, respectively.
As announced on Monday, we have signed an agreement with Atmos Energy to acquire their retail energy services business, Atmos Energy Marketing or AEM. This business is complementary to our existing energy services business and will allow us to grow our customer base and revenues while maintaining a low bar operating model and a cost-effective organization. This deal will increase our scale, geographic reach and expand our capabilities. We are particularly excited about AEM's impressive large industrial customer mix and their talented and experienced employees.
Energy services continues to be a steady and growing contributor to CenterPoint's earnings growth.
I'll close by pointing out that in addition to Houston Electric being the host of electric utility serving in the upcoming Super Bowl, gas distribution will also be serving the Super Bowl in Houston as well as Super Bowl 52 in Minneapolis at U.S. Bank Stadium.
I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."

I will begin on Slide 16.Today, we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $0.41 per diluted share. On a guidance basis, earnings were also $0.41 per diluted share versus $0.34 for third quarter 2015.Guidanc",677,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I will begin on Slide 16.
Today, we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $0.41 per diluted share. On a guidance basis, earnings were also $0.41 per diluted share versus $0.34 for third quarter 2015.
Guidance basis earnings per share increased $0.07 for our utility operations segment compared to last year. Our midstream investments segment was $0.10 per share for this quarter and for third quarter 2015. As Tracy and Joe discussed, combined core operating income improved $31 million, excluding mark-to-market adjustments.
Year-to-date, we have delivered $0.90 in guidance basis EPS, consisting of $0.68 in utility operations earnings and $0.22 in midstream investment earnings.
We are updating our full year 2016 EPS guidance range to $1.16 to $1.20 based on the strength of our combined performance year-to-date, our expectations for the fourth quarter and Enable's recent confirmation of its 2016 guidance. We are also confirming our year-over-year EPS growth target of 4% to 6% in 2017 and 2018.
Dividend increases will come with earnings growth at a rate that will allow us to gradually move our payout ratio lower. As Scott and Joe have mentioned, we announced an agreement to purchase Atmos Energy marketing on Monday. We plan to finance this through internally generated cash flow and/or debt financing. We expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive in 2017 after costs associated with the acquisition and integration into CES.
As Joe reviewed in our second quarter call, we are forecasting that our CES business will provide $45 million to $55 million in operating income in 2017. We expect AEM to be additive to this forecast.
As previously disclosed, in 2017, we expect a benefit of approximately $12 million in net income from a full year of our investment in Enable's preferred securities and from interest expense savings.
Slide 17 details our expected financing plans, interest expense and effective tax rate. Cash from operations remain strong. Therefore, we continue to believe we will not need equity in either 2017 or 2018. Further, we see -- foresee modest incremental debt requirements in those years. We are committed to strong credit metrics, with a target consolidated FFO debt metric of 18% to 20%. As of the third quarter, we are well-above that target credit metric.
Additionally, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 to be 37% due to the one-time recognition of deferred tax for midstream segment income in the second quarter. On a going-forward basis, we expect the effective tax rate to be 36%.
Finally, I'll take a moment to expand on the Enable strategic review. We recognize this process is taking longer than expected. We continue to explore 3 options: sale, spin or keep.
You can review our objectives for a potential transaction on Slide 18. Our criteria for consideration of a sale or spin include comparable earnings and dividends per share, improved visibility and certainty of future earnings and lower volatility from our midstream investments. We would seek to meet these criteria without a change to our credit ratings.
With respect to the sale option, we continue our discussions with third parties that have an interest in our midstream investments. Should those discussions continue past mid-January, the partnership agreement requires that we submit a Right of First Offer, or ROFO notice, to OG&E to continue such discussions. Due to the confidential nature of our discussions, we are not providing any further comment at this time.
With respect to the spin option, we are working to gain certainty regarding the tax characteristics of a spin and confirmation of minimal tax leakage that may occur as a result of the spin. Further, we continue to research capital market considerations with our existing investors and others, including whether the resulting entity from a spin would be an attractive security for our portfolio managers.
Let me conclude by reminding you that our Board of Directors declared a $0.2575 dividend per share on October 27, payable on December 9.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to David."

Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Bill Rogers, Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our third quarter 2016 results and provide highlights on other key areas.
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides which can be found under the Investors section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing earnings guidance in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and to our slides, which along with our Form 10-Q, have been posted on our website.
Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers utility operations' performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes, or ZENS securities, and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark to market accounting in the company's Energy Services business. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items.
Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found in our website.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
We will begin on Slide 4. This morning, we reported third quarter 2016 net income of $179 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with a loss of $391 million or a loss of $0.91 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. The 2015 loss is inclusive of impairment charges related to midstream investments.
On a guidance basis, third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $177 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $146 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year.
Utility operations and midstream investments both performed well this quarter. We had strong contribution from Houston Electric during their peak season as well as solid results from gas distribution and energy services. On a guidance basis, utility operations contributed $0.31 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year, improving $0.07 per share.
Our strong third quarter utility performance was driven by a number of factors. We continue to see solid customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added over 86,000 metered customers during the last 12 months.
Capital expenditures remain strong as we invest to meet growth, safety and reliability needs within our service territories. Rate relief, driven by capital investment, continues to be an important contributor to earnings growth. Tracy and Joe will provide additional regulatory updates for their business segments later in the call.
Slide 5 provides some of the highlights from Enable's third quarter results. Midstream investments contributed $0.10 per diluted share for both the third quarter of 2016 and the same period of last year. On their third quarter call, Wednesday, Enable guided to the midpoint of their previous 2016 guidance for net income attributable to unit holders. This equates to the high end of our guidance range for midstream investments.
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, Enable has achieved a coverage ratio of 1.26x. Enable also provided an initial estimate for 2017 net income attributable to unit holders, which represents notable growth over their estimate for 2016. Their 2017 forecast is driven by several favorable developments. Rig counts continue to increase. The number of rigs contractually dedicated to Enable rose more than 13% during the last quarter. Enable also signed a new 10-year gathering and processing agreement in the STACK, replacing an existing percent of proceeds contract and adding 61,000 additional gross dedicated acres to their STACK footprint. The terms of the contract increases their fee-based margin and reduces their commodity exposure. We are very pleased to see these improvements and the positive impact it has on their 2017 forecast.
On Monday, we announced the purchase of Atmos Energy Marketing from Atmos Energy. Our gas marketing and sales business continues to be a steady contributor to earnings growth and is a valuable complement to the organic growth of our natural gas utilities. Jill (sic) [  Bill ] will share more about this purchase in his remarks.
As most of you are aware, in February, we announced our intention to evaluate strategic alternatives for our midstream investment segment. Our objective is twofold: First, explore ways to reduce CenterPoint's share price volatility caused by commodity price impacts on Enable's earnings and unit price; and second, only take action if we can create sustained value for our long-term shareholders. The options open for consideration are a sale, a spin of a new company containing CenterPoint stake in Enable or keep our current stake in Enable and work to reduce exposure to commodity price influences. That process continues. And Bill will provide more detail on the sale evaluation process and tax considerations in connection with the spin.
Turning to Slide 6. Given the year-to-date performance and outlook for both utility operations and midstream investments, we are updating our 2016 full year earnings guidance to $1.16 to $1.20 per diluted share. Our investors value consistent steady growth, and we continue to target 4% to 6% annual earnings growth through 2018.
Tracy will now update you on Houston Electric."

I am pleased with Houston Electric's operational and financial results this quarter. Starting on Slide 8, core operating income in the third quarter of 2016 was $234 million compared with $219 million for the same period last year.
The business benefited from rate relief, customer growth and higher equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation and other taxes.
By the time we have our next earnings call, Houston will have hosted Super Bowl 51. It's great to see Houston getting ready with enhancements throughout the city. Houston's growing economy continues to require a substantial electric infrastructure improvements and capital investment. Through the end of the third quarter, we've invested $638 million in capital, and our meter count is up 2% from the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually.
O&M expense for the third quarter of 2016 was 1.7% higher than the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We continue to focus on keeping annual O&M growth under 2%.
Slide 9 provides an overview of regulatory developments year-to-date. Our regulatory strategy remains on track. Since the last earnings call, we received approval for our July transmission cost of service or TCOS filing. Adjusted rates from our TCOS filing as well as our April Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, or DCRF filing, went into effect in September.
Additionally, we recently received approval for our $10.6 million energy efficiency performance incentive, and we will recognize those earnings in the fourth quarter.
Joe will now update you on the results for natural gas operations."

Natural gas distribution's third quarter operating in",591,"Thank you, Tracy.
Our natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas distribution business and our nonregulated energy services business, had a strong third quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. Natural gas distribution's third quarter operating income was $22 million compared to $11 million for the same period in 2015.
Operating income was higher due to several factors, including rate relief, revenue from decoupling mechanisms, lower bad debt expense and lower sales and use tax. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and labor and benefits expense.
We continue to see solid natural gas distribution customer growth of approximately 1%, having added nearly 35,000 customers since the third quarter of 2015. O&M expenses were approximately 1.5% higher in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. Despite the quarter-to-quarter variability that can occur, O&M expense discipline remains a priority.
We continue to benefit from our long standing regulatory strategy of utilizing constructive rate mechanisms like the decoupling mechanisms in Arkansas and Minnesota that contributed to earnings this quarter. For a complete overview of regulatory developments this year, please see slides 12 and 13. I'll speak to a few of the highlights.
In September, we received the final order for our Arkansas rate case, which provided for an annual increase of $14.2 million. This increase implemented in September reflects the 9.5% ROE. It also established a formula rate tariff which allows rates to be adjusted based on a plus or minus 50-basis point banded ROE approach and a projected test year.
In Minnesota, the $12.7 million conservation improvement program incentive, which we filed in May 2016, was approved by the Minnesota commission and recognized in the third quarter this year.
Later this month, we plan to file a Houston and Texas coast rate case that seeks to combine 2 rate jurisdictions that are operationally and geographically aligned. We are required to file a rate case in our Houston jurisdiction, and once finalized, this case will reset rate base and allow us to utilize the GRIP mechanism in the future. We do not anticipate receiving incremental GRIP revenues in these 2 jurisdictions while the case is active. Because we have not filed the rate case yet, we cannot share any further details at this time.
Turning to Slide 14. Operating income for our energy services business was $7 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $2 million for the same period last year, excluding a mark to market loss of $2 million and a gain of $5 million, respectively.
As announced on Monday, we have signed an agreement with Atmos Energy to acquire their retail energy services business, Atmos Energy Marketing or AEM. This business is complementary to our existing energy services business and will allow us to grow our customer base and revenues while maintaining a low bar operating model and a cost-effective organization. This deal will increase our scale, geographic reach and expand our capabilities. We are particularly excited about AEM's impressive large industrial customer mix and their talented and experienced employees.
Energy services continues to be a steady and growing contributor to CenterPoint's earnings growth.
I'll close by pointing out that in addition to Houston Electric being the host of electric utility serving in the upcoming Super Bowl, gas distribution will also be serving the Super Bowl in Houston as well as Super Bowl 52 in Minneapolis at U.S. Bank Stadium.
I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."

I will begin on Slide 16.Today, we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $0.41 per diluted share. On a guidance basis, earnings were also $0.41 per diluted share versus $0.34 for third quarter 2015.Guidanc",679,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I will begin on Slide 16.
Today, we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $0.41 per diluted share. On a guidance basis, earnings were also $0.41 per diluted share versus $0.34 for third quarter 2015.
Guidance basis earnings per share increased $0.07 for our utility operations segment compared to last year. Our midstream investments segment was $0.10 per share for this quarter and for third quarter 2015. As Tracy and Joe discussed, combined core operating income improved $31 million, excluding mark to market adjustments.
Year-to-date, we have delivered $0.90 in guidance basis EPS, consisting of $0.68 in utility operations earnings and $0.22 in midstream investment earnings.
We are updating our full year 2016 EPS guidance range to $1.16 to $1.20 based on the strength of our combined performance year-to-date, our expectations for the fourth quarter and Enable's recent confirmation of its 2016 guidance. We are also confirming our year-over-year EPS growth target of 4% to 6% in 2017 and 2018.
Dividend increases will come with earnings growth at a rate that will allow us to gradually move our payout ratio lower. As Scott and Joe have mentioned, we announced an agreement to purchase Atmos Energy marketing on Monday. We plan to finance this through internally generated cash flow and/or debt financing. We expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive in 2017 after costs associated with the acquisition and integration into CES.
As Joe reviewed in our second quarter call, we are forecasting that our CES business will provide $45 million to $55 million in operating income in 2017. We expect AEM to be additive to this forecast.
As previously disclosed, in 2017, we expect a benefit of approximately $12 million in net income from a full year of our investment in Enable's preferred securities and from interest expense savings.
Slide 17 details our expected financing plans, interest expense and effective tax rate. Cash from operations remain strong. Therefore, we continue to believe we will not need equity in either 2017 or 2018. Further, we see -- foresee modest incremental debt requirements in those years. We are committed to strong credit metrics, with a target consolidated FFO debt metric of 18% to 20%. As of the third quarter, we are well-above that target credit metric.
Additionally, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 to be 37% due to the one-time recognition of deferred tax for midstream segment income in the second quarter. On a going-forward basis, we expect the effective tax rate to be 36%.
Finally, I'll take a moment to expand on the Enable strategic review. We recognize this process is taking longer than expected. We continue to explore 3 options: sale, spin or keep.
You can review our objectives for a potential transaction on Slide 18. Our criteria for consideration of a sale or spin include comparable earnings and dividends per share, improved visibility and certainty of future earnings and lower volatility from our midstream investments. We would seek to meet these criteria without a change to our credit ratings.
With respect to the sale option, we continue our discussions with third parties that have an interest in our midstream investments. Should those discussions continue past mid-January, the partnership agreement requires that we submit a Right of First Offer, or ROFO notice, to OG&E to continue such discussions. Due to the confidential nature of our discussions, we are not providing any further comment at this time.
With respect to the spin option, we are working to gain certainty regarding the tax characteristics of a spin and confirmation of minimal tax leakage that may occur as a result of the spin. Further, we continue to research capital market considerations with our existing investors and others, including whether the resulting entity from a spin would be an attractive security for our portfolio managers.
Let me conclude by reminding you that our Board of Directors declared a $0.2575 dividend per share on October 27, payable on December 9.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to David."

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. We recognize this is a busy day for earnings calls, so we especially appreciate your interest in CenterPoint. Scott Prochazka, President and CEO; Tracy Bridge, Executive Vice President and President of our Electric Division; Joe McGoldrick, Executive Vice President and President of our Gas Division; and Bill Rogers, Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our third quarter 2016 results and provide highlights on other key areas.
In conjunction with the call today, we will be using slides which can be found under the Investors section on our website, centerpointenergy.com. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in providing earnings guidance in today's call, please refer to our earnings press release and to our slides, which along with our Form 10-Q, have been posted on our website.
Please note that we may announce material information using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts and posts to the Investors section of our website. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to communicate important information and encourage you to review the information on our website.
Today, management is going to discuss certain topics that will contain projections and forward-looking information that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions and information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks or uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially based upon factors including weather variations, regulatory actions, economic conditions and growth, commodity prices, changes in our service territories and other risk factors noted in our SEC filings. We will also discuss our guidance for 2016. The guidance range considers utility operations' performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes, or ZENS securities, and the related stocks or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business. The guidance range also considers such factors as Enable's most recent public forecast and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts, such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items.
Before Scott begins, I would like to mention that this call is being recorded. Information on how to access the replay can be found in our website.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
We will begin on Slide 4. This morning, we reported third quarter 2016 net income of $179 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with a loss of $391 million or a loss of $0.91 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year. The 2015 loss is inclusive of impairment charges related to midstream investments.
On a guidance basis, third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were $177 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with adjusted earnings of $146 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year.
Utility operations and midstream investments both performed well this quarter. We had strong contribution from Houston Electric during their peak season as well as solid results from gas distribution and energy services. On a guidance basis, utility operations contributed $0.31 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the same quarter of last year, improving $0.07 per share.
Our strong third quarter utility performance was driven by a number of factors. We continue to see solid customer growth in both our electric and gas utilities. Combined, our utilities added over 86,000 metered customers during the last 12 months.
Capital expenditures remain strong as we invest to meet growth, safety and reliability needs within our service territories. Rate relief, driven by capital investment, continues to be an important contributor to earnings growth. Tracy and Joe will provide additional regulatory updates for their business segments later in the call.
Slide 5 provides some of the highlights from Enable's third quarter results. Midstream investments contributed $0.10 per diluted share for both the third quarter of 2016 and the same period of last year. On their third quarter call, Wednesday, Enable guided to the midpoint of their previous 2016 guidance for net income attributable to unit holders. This equates to the high end of our guidance range for midstream investments.
For the first 3 quarters of 2016, Enable has achieved a coverage ratio of 1.26x. Enable also provided an initial estimate for 2017 net income attributable to unit holders, which represents notable growth over their estimate for 2016. Their 2017 forecast is driven by several favorable developments. Rig counts continue to increase. The number of rigs contractually dedicated to Enable rose more than 13% during the last quarter. Enable also signed a new 10-year gathering and processing agreement in the STACK, replacing an existing percent of proceeds contract and adding 61,000 additional gross dedicated acres to their STACK footprint. The terms of the contract increases their fee-based margin and reduces their commodity exposure. We are very pleased to see these improvements and the positive impact it has on their 2017 forecast.
On Monday, we announced the purchase of Atmos Energy Marketing from Atmos Energy. Our gas marketing and sales business continues to be a steady contributor to earnings growth and is a valuable complement to the organic growth of our natural gas utilities. Jill (sic) [ Bill ] will share more about this purchase in his remarks.
As most of you are aware, in February, we announced our intention to evaluate strategic alternatives for our midstream investment segment. Our objective is twofold: First, explore ways to reduce CenterPoint's share price volatility caused by commodity price impacts on Enable's earnings and unit price; and second, only take action if we can create sustained value for our long-term shareholders. The options open for consideration are a sale, a spin of a new company containing CenterPoint stake in Enable or keep our current stake in Enable and work to reduce exposure to commodity price influences. That process continues. And Bill will provide more detail on the sale evaluation process and tax considerations in connection with the spin.
Turning to Slide 6. Given the year-to-date performance and outlook for both utility operations and midstream investments, we are updating our 2016 full year earnings guidance to $1.16 to $1.20 per diluted share. Our investors value consistent steady growth, and we continue to target 4% to 6% annual earnings growth through 2018.
Tracy will now update you on Houston Electric."

I am pleased with Houston Electric's operational and financial results this quarter. Starting on Slide 8, core operating income in the third quarter of 2016 was $234 million compared with $219 million for the same period last year.
The business benefited from rate relief, customer growth and higher equity return primarily related to true-up proceeds. These benefits were partially offset by higher depreciation and other taxes.
By the time we have our next earnings call, Houston will have hosted Super Bowl 51. It's great to see Houston getting ready with enhancements throughout the city. Houston's growing economy continues to require a substantial electric infrastructure improvements and capital investment. Through the end of the third quarter, we've invested $638 million in capital, and our meter count is up 2% from the third quarter of 2015. As a reminder, 2% customer growth equates to approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue annually.
O&M expense for the third quarter of 2016 was 1.7% higher than the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. We continue to focus on keeping annual O&M growth under 2%.
Slide 9 provides an overview of regulatory developments year-to-date. Our regulatory strategy remains on track. Since the last earnings call, we received approval for our July transmission cost of service or TCOS filing. Adjusted rates from our TCOS filing as well as our April Distribution Cost Recovery Factor, or DCRF filing, went into effect in September.
Additionally, we recently received approval for our $10.6 million energy efficiency performance incentive, and we will recognize those earnings in the fourth quarter.
Joe will now update you on the results for natural gas operations."

Natural gas distribution's third quarter operating in",589,"Thank you, Tracy.
Our natural gas operations, which includes both our natural gas distribution business and our nonregulated energy services business, had a strong third quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. Natural gas distribution's third quarter operating income was $22 million compared to $11 million for the same period in 2015.
Operating income was higher due to several factors, including rate relief, revenue from decoupling mechanisms, lower bad debt expense and lower sales and use tax. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and labor and benefits expense.
We continue to see solid natural gas distribution customer growth of approximately 1%, having added nearly 35,000 customers since the third quarter of 2015. O&M expenses were approximately 1.5% higher in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year, excluding certain expenses that have revenue offsets. Despite the quarter-to-quarter variability that can occur, O&M expense discipline remains a priority.
We continue to benefit from our long standing regulatory strategy of utilizing constructive rate mechanisms like the decoupling mechanisms in Arkansas and Minnesota that contributed to earnings this quarter. For a complete overview of regulatory developments this year, please see slides 12 and 13. I'll speak to a few of the highlights.
In September, we received the final order for our Arkansas rate case, which provided for an annual increase of $14.2 million. This increase implemented in September reflects the 9.5% ROE. It also established a formula rate tariff which allows rates to be adjusted based on a plus or minus 50-basis point banded ROE approach and a projected test year.
In Minnesota, the $12.7 million conservation improvement program incentive, which we filed in May 2016, was approved by the Minnesota commission and recognized in the third quarter this year.
Later this month, we plan to file a Houston and Texas coast rate case that seeks to combine 2 rate jurisdictions that are operationally and geographically aligned. We are required to file a rate case in our Houston jurisdiction, and once finalized, this case will reset rate base and allow us to utilize the GRIP mechanism in the future. We do not anticipate receiving incremental GRIP revenues in these 2 jurisdictions while the case is active. Because we have not filed the rate case yet, we cannot share any further details at this time.
Turning to Slide 14. Operating income for our energy services business was $7 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $2 million for the same period last year, excluding a mark-to-market loss of $2 million and a gain of $5 million, respectively.
As announced on Monday, we have signed an agreement with Atmos Energy to acquire their retail energy services business, Atmos Energy Marketing or AEM. This business is complementary to our existing energy services business and will allow us to grow our customer base and revenues while maintaining a low bar operating model and a cost-effective organization. This deal will increase our scale, geographic reach and expand our capabilities. We are particularly excited about AEM's impressive large industrial customer mix and their talented and experienced employees.
Energy services continues to be a steady and growing contributor to CenterPoint's earnings growth.
I'll close by pointing out that in addition to Houston Electric being the host of electric utility serving in the upcoming Super Bowl, gas distribution will also be serving the Super Bowl in Houston as well as Super Bowl 52 in Minneapolis at U.S. Bank Stadium.
I'll now turn the call over to Bill, who will cover financial performance and forecast."

Today, we reported third quarter 2016 earnings of $0.41 per diluted share. On a guidance basis, earnings were also $0.41 per diluted share versus $0.34 for third quarter 2015.
Guidance basis earnings per share increased $0.07 for our utility operations segment compared to last year. Our midstream investments segment was $0.10 per share for this quarter and for third quarter 2015. As Tracy and Joe discussed, combined core operating income improved $31 million, excluding mark-to-market adjustments.
Year-to-date, we have delivered $0.90 in guidance basis EPS, consisting of $0.68 in utility operations earnings and $0.22 in midstream investment earnings.
We are updating our full year 2016 EPS guidance range to $1.16 to $1.20 based on the strength of our combined performance year-to-date, our expectations for the fourth quarter and Enable's recent confirmation of its 2016 guidance. We are also confirming our year-over-year EPS growth target of 4% to 6% in 2017 and 2018.
Dividend increases will come with earnings growth at a rate that will allow us to gradually move our payout ratio lower. As Scott and Joe have mentioned, we announced an agreement to purchase Atmos Energy marketing on Monday. We plan to finance this through internally generated cash flow and/or debt financing. We expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive in 2017 after costs associated with the acquisition and integration into CES.
As Joe reviewed in our second quarter call, we are forecasting that our CES business will provide $45 million to $55 million in operating income in 2017. We expect AEM to be additive to this forecast.
As previously disclosed, in 2017, we expect a benefit of approximately $12 million in net income from a full year of our investment in Enable's preferred securities and from interest expense savings.
Slide 17 details our expected financing plans, interest expense and effective tax rate. Cash from operations remain strong. Therefore, we continue to believe we will not need equity in either 2017 or 2018. Further, we see -- foresee modest incremental debt requirements in those years. We are committed to strong credit metrics, with a target consolidated FFO debt metric of 18% to 20%. As of the third quarter, we are well-above that target credit metric.
Additionally, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 to be 37% due to the one-time recognition of deferred tax for midstream segment income in the second quarter. On a going-forward basis, we expect the effective tax rate to be 36%.
Finally, I'll take a moment to expand on the Enable strategic review. We recognize this process is taking longer than expected. We continue to explore 3 options: sale, spin or keep.
You can review our objectives for a potential transaction on Slide 18. Our criteria for consideration of a sale or spin include comparable earnings and dividends per share, improved visibility and certainty of future earnings and lower volatility from our midstream investments. We would seek to meet these criteria without a change to our credit ratings.
With respect to the sale option, we continue our discussions with third parties that have an interest in our midstream investments. Should those discussions continue past mid-January, the partnership agreement requires that we submit a Right of First Offer, or ROFO notice, to OG&E to continue such discussions. Due to the confidential nature of our discussions, we are not providing any further comment at this time.
With respect to the spin option, we are working to gain certainty regarding the tax characteristics of a spin and confirmation of minimal tax leakage that may occur as a result of the spin. Further, we continue to research capital market considerations with our existing investors and others, including whether the resulting entity from a spin would be an attractive security for our portfolio managers.
Let me conclude by reminding you that our Board of Directors declared a $0.2575 dividend per share on October 27, payable on December 9.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to David."
