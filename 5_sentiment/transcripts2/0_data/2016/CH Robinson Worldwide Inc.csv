I'm going to start by highlighting a few of the financial metrics that we look at and then maybe share a few headline thoughts before turning it over to Andy. I",1102,"Thank you, Tim, and thanks for everybody taking the time to listen to the call this morning. I'm going to start by highlighting a few of the financial metrics that we look at and then maybe share a few headline thoughts before turning it over to Andy. 
In terms of financial metrics on Slide 3 that Tim referenced, if you look at our total revenues for the quarter, we're down 4.4%. Similar to the rest of the year, the total revenues grew at a slower pace primarily due to the cost of fuel and the reduction of fuel surcharges in our services. In the fourth quarter, we also seen -- did see some decline in prices that resulted in reduced total revenues. Total net revenues increased 13.7% in the quarter. As the slide indicates, 7.3% growth came from our organic growth, while the Freightquote acquisition contributed about 6.5 percentage points to that growth.
Income from operations for the quarter was up 14.3% and net income was up 12%, earnings per share of $0.88 compared to earnings per share of $0.77 last year. Wanted to share just a couple of comments on the difference between income from operations and net income and the comment that's noted on Slide 4 about the indemnification asset. When we acquired Phoenix 3 years ago, there were some uncertain tax positions around the world that we received an indemnification promise from the sellers. The purchase accounting for that is to record an indemnification receivable as well as a contingent tax liability for the issues that were uncertain. If those issues are all resolved without any obligations, both the receivable and the contingent liability would come back off the balance sheet without any cash charges or any net impact to earnings. The nuance with the accounting for that is the receivable comes off when the indemnification period ends and the tax liabilities come off when the statute of limitation passes in all the various countries that they apply to. So what we saw during the fourth quarter was a $7.1 million indemnification asset writeoff that went to other expense. That's the reversal of the receivable that was recorded, which is a noncash charge. We also saw a portion of the tax liabilities come off the balance sheet as well and reduced the tax provision, and the rest of the tax liabilities will come off in future periods as those statute of limitations pass. So a little bit unusual but it does result in a $7 million other expense charge that net of those tax liabilities that reversed did have a negative impact of $0.02 per share on the quarter. That's what results in a different growth rate in net income compared to income from operations for the quarter.
In terms of other financial metrics down at the bottom of that slide, we talk about our team and our headcount. We finished the year with 13,159 employees, which represents a little over 14% increase from the previous year. Just under 1,000 of those employees joined us through the Freightquote acquisitions and the remainder came from organic growth of staffing up our teams across the network.
If you look at the year-to-date results, which is always good to do because we do have a fair amount of incentive contracts and other things that apply on an annual basis, still, we did complete 2015 with year-to-date results that reflected 15% EPS growth. That represents our second year of 15% EPS growth and something that we're very proud of. If you look at almost all of the year-to-date financial metrics represent records in terms of size and scale of Robinson, and we're proud of our performance and Robinson is a bigger and stronger business today in just about every financial metric that you can look at. I want to take this moment to thank the Robinson team. We've had to adapt and change a lot to the changing marketplace and a changing industry over the last several years, and we're doing that and we feel very good about the strength of our team and the results that we achieved in 2015.
So those are the financial metrics. Now I'll highlight just a few other headline thoughts again before I turn it over to Andy. I mentioned Freightquote already once in the last few quarters. We've talked about that. As a reminder, we closed that acquisition on January 1, 2015. So this will be the last quarter where Freightquote's inclusion will be highlighted. We've been doing that simply to be transparent around the impact of those acquired revenues and the acquired impacts of Freightquote, but we're very pleased with that acquisition. Similar to what we've said in previous quarters, we're happy with what we've achieved there. We have a little bit work to do in terms of integrating the business and going forward, but year 1 was a success. And hopefully, the impact of Freightquote to our financials has been clear throughout the year.
The thought that I would share is with regards to pricing. When you look through the deck, and Andy gives the comments on our various services, you'll see a lot of down arrows on pricing. We talked in our last call about softening markets and softening pricing and I don't think it's any surprise to anyone that over the last quarter, pretty much in all of our services, that demand has been softening and that has resulted in price declines. We've talked a lot -- if you look at the last couple of years now, 2014 and '15, last year, we had some pretty meaningful price increases in all of our services, particularly in the truckload area. And now this year, we're seeing a more typical cycling or turning down of some of those prices. That's an important change that we have to adapt to and we'll do the best we can to give you our color on kind of what we're seeing in the market and how we adjust our business to do that. But as a reminder, we really think of our value creation in the long term around taking market share and helping our customers and suppliers adapt to those changing market conditions. So while it is a pretty relevant change to what's going on in the market, it's nothing that we haven't experienced before, and it's part of how we think we can add value to the marketplace in a declining price market.
So I'll stop there with those headline thoughts and turn it over to Andy to walk you through the deck of our financials."

I also want to echo your comments about our fourth quarter and full year. 2015 was a great year for Robinson and our people are and should be very proud of these results. While it was a different transportation market than 2014, our global network continues to prove that we can provide excellent service to our customers and deliver strong results for our shareholders in any condition. This industry continues to change and evolve and will do so in an increasing pace in the years to come. We like that because we have been disrupting and innovating for years. 
Today, approximately 72% of our customer shipments originate from either an electronic or digital transaction or is web- or mobile-based. We have connections with well over 150,000 organizations and execute over 5 million web or mobile interactions among -- with customers and carriers. These customers and carriers rely on us to lead and that is exactly what we are doing, and I think these results reflect that.
So I will start my review of the detailed results on Slide 4 with our transportation. Transportation net revenues increased 13.8% to $544 million in the quarter. We finished the full year with a 13.5% net revenue growth, driven in part by our 14% growth in global shipment count to approximately 17 million shipments in 2015. Fourth quarter transportation net revenue margin increased 310 basis points from 2014's fourth quarter to 19%. From a historical perspective, it is our best net revenue margin quarter since Q4 2008. This increase was a result of the impact of lower transportation cost in most of the transportation modes including the decrease in fuel prices when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The chart on this page shows our transportation net revenue margin for the past 10 years, representing multiple in economic and industry cycles. It is a combination of our people, process and technology that produce these best-in-class results on a consistent and sustainable basis.
Moving on to Slide 5 and our truckload results. We had another strong quarter in our truckload business, growing net revenues by 13.4%. Organic net revenue increased approximately 10% while Freightquote added approximately 3.5% to the net revenues in the quarter. Truckload volume increased 5% with organic volume of approximately 2% and Freightquote adding approximately 3%. By comparison, CAS [ph] volumes were down on approximately 2.5% in the fourth quarter. We feel good about our ability to profitably grow volumes and take market share. In fact, we've done that for 26 consecutive quarters.
In North America, the line haul price per mile to our customers excluding the impact of fuel was down 3% on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 5%. From a historical perspective, since 2008, the average increase of pricing to customers has been 2.5%. During that same 8-year period, the price paid to carriers has risen 2.5%. There has been and probably always will be short-term volatility between these 2 numbers. But over a longer period of time, they tend to converge. In real-time, we are seeing the pricing in the spot market had a larger impact on changes in overall pricing than in the previous quarters in the year.
Our volume growth in the quarter and for most of the year in 2015 came from our committed business, with transactional volume down on a year-over-year basis as you would expect. The demand environment in the second half of 2015 was softer than in the first half when compared to 2014. Thus far, in 2016, our volume growth is similar to what we saw in the second half of '15. John will talk more about that in his closing comments.
Moving on to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. Our LTL net revenues increased 41.4% with organic net revenues increasing approximately 9% and Freightquote contributing approximately 32% in the fourth quarter. LTL volumes increased 36% with organic contributing 17% and Freightquote adding approximately 19%. Net revenue margin increased on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of higher-margin Freightquote business with small customers and growth in our consolidation business. For the year, LTL net revenues are up nearly 40%, driven by strong organic and Freightquote contributions. We are the largest nonasset LTL provider in North America by a wide margin, and our go-to-market strategy has proven to be a winning one with customers and providers.
Transitioning to Intermodal results on Slide 7. Intermodal net revenue decreased 13.7% in the fourth quarter with volumes down 8%. Without Freightquote, organic net revenues decreased approximately 22% in the fourth quarter. It was a tough fourth quarter in the intermodal business as we had a significant decrease in our transactional volumes. The intermodal services represents less than 2% of our net revenues and we typically see the results impacted negatively in a softer truckload market with lower fuel prices. These market conditions often impact the decision of shippers to utilize truckload services rather than intermodal.
Moving to Slide 8 and a review of our global forwarding business. Net revenue for the global forwarding services decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter. Ocean net revenues decreased 1.5% while air decreased 4.1% and custom services were down 1.3%. There are 2 things in the quarter to highlight. The first is that we continue to capture market share in global forwarding. Volumes were up in ocean and up slightly in air despite a very challenging marketplace. Pricing, however, in both ocean and air continue to be a major headwind both down double digits in the quarter. The second issue to reflect is that it's important to remember the strong Q4 2014 comparable, which was driven by the West Coast port strikes, where net revenue grew 18% in that particular period. The 2015 full year results were very positive on both top and bottom lines and our global forwarding team has done an excellent job. We've got a great team and are confident in the platform and how we are positioned for the future.
Slide 9 and our other logistic services. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 16.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Managed services, primarily our TMS offering branded TMC, represents over half the net revenue in this area and that business is performing extremely well with strong net revenue growth. TMC finished the year with a record number of new implementations and the pipeline for pending implementations as an all-time high.
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues increased 11.9% in the fourth quarter and case volume grew 4.5%. We are pleased with the sourcing team's ability to finish the year strong in the fourth quarter and grow net revenues just short of 5% for the year. Our customer base is very concentrated with retail and food services customers representing our 2 largest segments. The sourcing team continues to adapt the value proposition and they have done a good job working through a tough couple of years with a lot of change in both our services and how we meet the needs of our top customers.
Slide 11 covers our summarized income statements for the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 14.3% in the fourth quarter and as a percent of net revenue was 37.6%, up 20 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. For the year, operating income as a percent of net revenue increased 50 basis points to 37.8%. Thank you to all of our people for another strong productivity year. Personnel expenses were up 14.1% in the quarter. This increased personnel expense was due to the additional headcount relating to our acquisition of Freightquote, contributing approximately 9.1% and a 5% increase in our organic headcount. Other SG&A expenses increased 11.4%. This increase again was primarily due to the Freightquote acquisition including amortization expense of $1.9 million. John mentioned earlier that we had an interest in other expense increase during the quarter by $7.1 million. That expense was partially offset by the related tax liabilities decreasing earnings per share by $0.02 in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to Slide 11 and other financial information. We had a great cash flow quarter generating just over $253 million in the period. Year-to-date, cash flow was $718 million, a 40% increase versus last year. Capital expenditures were $11.8 million in the fourth quarter and year-to-date $44 million. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be between $70 million and $80 million, with $30 million coming from our new data center. We finished the fourth quarter with $950 million in debt and just under $170 million in cash.
And finally, before turning it back to John, on the Slide 13 in our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter with approximately $64 million coming from dividends and $66 million in share repurchases. We finished the quarter returning approximately 103% of net income to shareholders, and for the year, we returned 92%, which is in line with our target. Since 2010, we've returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividend and share repurchases. Again, our thanks to everyone at Robinson for a great quarter in 2015, and thank you all as well for listening in. 
With that, I will turn it back to John for his closing comments."

To start with our January, total company revenue organ",1104,"All right. Thanks, Andy. So Slide 14 labeled a look ahead is just some bullet points that we laid out to kind of share with you what we're seeing and what our headline thoughts are heading in to 2016. To start with our January, total company revenue organic growth rate is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2015. As I mentioned earlier, Freightquote has lapped, so the impact of Freightquote in 2015 would not reoccur again this year. But basically, what we're -- what we saw in January was a continued soft transactional market and continued margin expansion on our committed freight very similar to what Andy laid out for Q4 of 2015.
What is our mindset and how are we thinking about 2016? I mentioned in my kickoff comments that our long-term value proposition and how we think about growing the business is to be very focused on taking share knowing that there's going to be different periods of different environments and different pricing scenarios, but that is absolutely what we're focused on in 2016. We put the word profitably on there. It's important from our standpoint that when we think about how we go to market and how we want to grow our business, that when we enter into a committed relationship and are trying to add value to the customers in the marketplace on a longer-term basis, that those relationships are sustainable and that we're getting compensated for what we're doing and that we're adding value to the customer on a long-term basis. In the transactional world, again, there's not a lot of point in executing transactional business if you can't get a return on it. So when we think about how we go to market, it makes sense for us to think about how we can add value and go after market share in a sustainable way. We think we've done that in our past and that will continue to be our mindset going forward.
Global forwarding success. Andy touched on the results that we had and why we feel good about our global forwarding team and our global forwarding success. I think as -- the next 2 points really go together around integrated services and global forwarding, but we've talked a lot in the last 3 years -- 3 years ago we weren't as proud or content with our competitive positioning in global forwarding. With the Phoenix acquisition and the further investment over the last 3 years, we've been able to grow our net -- combined net revenues high single digits over that period of time and really improve our service offering and our capabilities. And it's not only been a good investment, but I think it's been a very important expansion of what Robinson is capable of and allowing our cross-selling services and allowing us to look at other regions of the world and how we can build further on to our network. So we're very focused on that continuation of cross-selling, looking at international air [indiscernible] and customs brokerage and other regions and really leveraging the platform that we've built over the last 3 years as an important part of our thoughts going forward.
The demand for integrated global services is growing. That's probably not a new thought to most people, but just to share with you about when we look at our customer metrics and our business that we do see an escalation of the number of customers that are using multiple services. Andy mentioned that the growth in the pipeline and our managed services division that we've talked about cross-selling of some of our international and domestic stuff. There's a lot of data points and a lot of metrics that point to our continued success in working on a more global basis and working with more integrated customers, so we do feel that's an important trend that we're going to stay focused on.
Another point related to that, though, that we have emphasized and continued to believe is very important is that all of the services that we offer are very competitive and do require competitive pricing and service levels in order to be successful. So when we think about the pace and how aggressively we expand those services and expand those geographies, it is balanced by wanting to retain our market leadership position and a high quality, high service and competitive price profile as we move into each of those. We also have talked about we do believe it's important to maintain both a transactional and committed contractual presence in the marketplace. So as we grow with those bigger more global and integrated opportunities, we also are staying focused on how to remain competitive in the transactional marketplace and balancing the different types of relationships and segment offerings that we have with our customers.
So that's a little bit of insight into how we're thinking about our offerings and expanding our profile and our platform going into the year and increasing those global integrated services. The last point is really repetitive from things that we've been emphasizing for a long time and we've talked about people, process and technology and really believing that, that is the competitive foundation of the things that really matter in the forwarding and 3PL sector that we're going to continue to focus on. Our people have always been our primary asset and will remain that. Our talent and our account managers and how we go to market are just really what we think makes a difference, and whether we succeed or fail at Robinson and will continue to be our primary asset that we invest in. 
Technology is as important as ever. A lot of focus and emphasis around technology disruption and the impact that it's having on our industry. We believe we're a technology leader and we're going to continue to invest in our Navisphere platform and continue to maintain that competitive advantage that we think is really important in the marketplace.
Our business processes are very important. Sometimes it's about bringing consistency and discipline to those processes, and at other times, it's about innovation and new ideas that customers are looking to try to make changes or to improve or to take costs out of their supply chain, and that talent technology and innovation, people process technology focus, we're as convinced as ever that, that is the differentiator at Robinson and that is what we're going to continue to invest in to make a difference in the marketplace.
Those are our prepared thoughts. With that, I will turn it over to Tim to facilitate some prepared Q&A."

The first question is for Andy around truckload pricing.

Listening to that question, I would say the other thing that probably comes to mind is that from a macro standpoint, we've been trying hard to analyze our business from an industry and vertical standpoint more and more. And probably not surprisingly, when you look across the vertical sectors in Robinson, it is where you would see some of the higher correlations to the economy and where things are at. Anything, energy- or mining-related obviously very soft. And even in those regions where that's focused, less activity going on. On the retail world, there's a lot of transition, lot of increase in e-commerce, a lot of store closings, a lot of transition that's going on in the retail world. We're still fairly big in food and beverage, which is a little bit more stable than a lot of the other sectors. Our automotive business is still remaining pretty good in North America, but that industry has continued to do fairly well. So again, not shocking or surprising given the headlines and the types of things that are happening in the U.S. and around the world. But I would say that our freight activities further validate some of the headlines that you see about what's happening in the overall economy."

So yes, if I look from a standpoint of '14 -- 2014 being a tighter market and some aggressive price increases and now some of those coming back, we are probably moving back more towards a midpoint around the balance of supply and demand in the marketplace. What I think is different, though, is that a lot of the way we talked about our business back in 2011 and '12 was during the sustained period of a balanced market, there became some different dynamics around route guides and how important it was to be near the top of the road guide and how we have to aggressively go after share in a fairly sustained balanced market for a long period of time. It's too early to know what the rest of -- even '16 is going to be like much less '17 and '18. So I don't think it's fair to conclude that we're back into a sustained balanced market. We'll have to see how the rest of '16 plays out and what the next couple of years look like going back into an environment like we saw in '11 and '12."

Almost every committed bid that we work on will have dozens of providers and lots of carriers, lots of other 3PLs and the market remains very competitive. So we continue to see a very competitive marketplace with a lot of people out there. I commented earlier in our prepared comments that we take approach around sustainability and profitability. And whenever somebody is aggressively going after market share with a different attitude towards profitability or sustainability, it can have an impact that we have to try to understand that and make sure that we're not overreacting or mispricing our services or doing things that we don't intend to do because others are taking a different go-to-market strategy in terms of what they're doing. So we do have to watch out for that. But I think for the most part, the vast majority of the competitors have a similar attitude and have continued to work on that. We haven't seen a lot of change this year in the competitive landscape. Again whenever the market is moving, softening like it has, there will be a lot of transition and a lot of bid activity. But with thousands of competitors in a very fragmented market, it's hard to see any unique changes in a short period of time.

We've talked a lot about our intermodal business and the competitive positioning of it over the past several years. What we have today is a capable team. We understand the service and we compete primarily in that multimodal freight that can typically be served by either truck or intermodal services. We feel like we do a good job of making certain that our customers get exposure to intermodal opportunities and pricing when that's appropriate. What we've confessed in the past is that what we don't have is the density of high-volume committed freight in all intermodal lanes or the dedicated equipment that is sometimes the most effective way to serve those dense corridors and those more committed areas. That's something that we continue to work on and still aspire to be better at in the future. So as our business continues to transition and hopefully strengthen ourselves in terms of dedicated and committed relationships on the intermodal front, we will continue to see more fluctuations in transactional shipments based upon the market conditions."

So the very best performance here that we've had from a growth and profitability standpoint is when the economies are growing, the markets are very active and there's healthy market share opportunities in both committed and transactional relationships that we have in the marketplace. There's a lot of other market environments like we've talked about earlier, where demand will cycle and capacity will cycle and so supply and demand will lead to price increases and prices decreases.

Some of the regulation that's come into the marketplace over the last 6 or 7 years around safety and hours of service and now the electronic watch that are coming in, there is a cost factor that impacts that capacity in the marketplace, but we're pretty comfortable that similar to a lot of the previously implemented legislation that it'll get absorbed over time and that it'll get adapted to by the small carriers. I think one of the things that is important to understand too is that while hours of service and some of the safety ratings and some of the electronic logging regulations that have come or are coming into place, one of the other impacts of that is that it really is sort of genericizing the capacity out there, where some of the quality differentiations that maybe some of the larger carriers tried to differentiate within the past are not going to be as prevalent. So while there's a cost issue and a potential productivity issue, we do think that the capacity landscape is going to remain very fragmented and that in a lot of ways, it will actually improve the quality and the overall blend of capacity that we can utilize in the marketplace."

That being said, we feel really good about our ability to work with our customers to understand what that volatility is doing and, quite frankly, the ability to price into that volatility with them."

So when we look across our book of rates and contracts, there will be some that have been in place for years that we and the customer are continuing to live by. And in other instances, those customers will have a very rigid annual cycle or a more systematic approach towards how and when they rebid those services. Even when a shipper rebids their contracts or committed pricing, they may or may not include all of the freight. There's another step in the process to determine based on market conditions and their service levels around what they would want to do. So for us, it's a very fluid process. There are bids going on at any point during the year. There are more of them going on this time of year than in others, but there really is no single bellwether or month. There's very much of an ongoing evolution based on supply and demand conditions as to when either providers are giving 30-day notice and opting out or when shippers are choosing to rebid the contracts in the marketplace."

We do have metrics that establish that we have been successful with that. There's measured net revenue in relationships that have come in both ways. And as I commented in my prepared comments about the numbers of customers with multiple services and our cross-selling success from our joint account managers, we do feel very good that that's real and that we've been successful in doing that. With the Freightquote acquisition, there's probably less specific cross-selling. The business is very transactional. I think the theme that we've talked more about there is really more us having a clear segmentation strategy that in our LTL business, while we've been very comfortable with how we've grown it over the last decade, we have gravitated more towards committed relationships with higher-volume shippers because that was really our expertise and capability, and our account management structure really didn't facilitate an efficient interface with a small shipper who wanted to spend a lot of time price shopping and doing other things that a more typical smaller transactional customer would do. So what's been positive about the Phoenix -- or I'm sorry about the Freightquote acquisition this year is really helping us evolve into a clear segmentation strategy where the true transactional smaller shippers, especially the LTL but also truckload, are leads and opportunities that we can put more under the Freightquote brand that has established a very efficient front end and interface with customers for doing that and then allowing the traditional Robinson network to focus more on the medium and larger customers where we're investing our account management resources in a little bit more cost-intensive approach and provide the service that's required for those relationships. So a little bit different in terms of the way we're going after the synergies and the growth but feeling good about both of them that they've been good additions to the Robinson network and have made it stronger."

So what will happen in any period of time is that there will be some volatility in the results relative to the weather and the crop yields and just the amount of freight and activity that comes out of it. That fresh group also provides a lot of temperature control transportation within the Robinson network. So at any point in time, we're working with those retailers and food service companies to not only provide temp control transportation but also product for them where we can source and supply the fresh product into their network. Because of the customer concentration over the past 6, 7 years, we've had a couple of instances where we knew that larger customers were not going to be sourcing certain commodities from us in the future. So we've cautioned that some of the declines were foreseeable that we can see them. At this point, we do think our Robinson fresh sourcing business is at a normal activity level. We don't see -- we're not aware of any losses or things that we expect in terms of customer declines. So we hope this type of activity in the fourth quarter would be normal. But again, back to the normal caveat that it is a very weather-sensitive business and a lot of these commodities can fluctuate up and down in unforeseen ways pretty quickly, so there will continue to be a little bit more volatility in the sourcing line item of our revenues."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and thanks for everybody taking the time to listen to the call this morning. I'm going to start by highlighting a few of the financial metrics that we look at, and then maybe share a few headline thoughts before turning it over to Andy.",1105,"Thank you, Tim, and thanks for everybody taking the time to listen to the call this morning. I'm going to start by highlighting a few of the financial metrics that we look at, and then maybe share a few headline thoughts before turning it over to Andy. 
In terms of financial metrics on Slide 3 that Tim referenced, if you look at our total revenues for the quarter, we're down 4.4%. Similar to the rest of the year, the total revenues grew at a slower pace, primarily due to the cost of fuel and the reduction of fuel surcharges in our services. In the fourth quarter, we also have seen -- did see some decline in prices that result in reduced total revenues. Total net revenues increased 13.7% in the quarter. As the slide indicates, 7.3% growth came from our organic growth, while the Freightquote acquisition contributed about 6.5 percentage points to that growth.
Income from operations for the quarter was up 14.3% and net income was up 12%, earnings per share of $0.88 compared to earnings per share of $0.77 last year. I wanted to share just a couple of comments on the difference between income from operations and net income and the comment that's noted on Slide 4 about the indemnification asset. When we acquired Phoenix 3 years ago, there were some uncertain tax positions around the world that we received an indemnification promise from the sellers. The purchase accounting for that is to record an indemnification receivable as well as a contingent tax liability for the issues that were uncertain. If those issues are all resolved without any obligations, both the receivable and the contingent liability would come back off the balance sheet without any cash charges or any net impact to earnings. The nuance with the accounting for that is the receivable comes off when the indemnification period ends and the tax liabilities come off when the statute of limitation passes in all the various countries that they apply to. So what we saw during the fourth quarter was a $7.1 million indemnification asset writeoff that went to other expense. That's the reversal of the receivable that was recorded, which is a noncash charge. We also saw a portion of the tax liabilities come off the balance sheet as well and reduced the tax provision, and the rest of the tax liabilities will come off in future periods as those statute of limitations pass. So a little bit unusual, but it does result in a $7 million other expense charge that net of those tax liabilities that reversed did have a negative impact of $0.02 per share on the quarter. That's what results in a different growth rate in net income compared to income from operations for the quarter.
In terms of other financial metrics down at the bottom of that slide, we talk about our team and our headcount. We finished the year with 13,159 employees, which represents a little over 14% increase from the previous year. Just under 1,000 of those employees joined us through the Freightquote acquisitions, and the remainder came from organic growth of staffing up our teams across the network.
If you look at the year-to-date results, which is always good to do because we do have a fair amount of incentive contracts and other things that apply on an annual basis, still, we did complete 2015 with year-to-date results that reflected 15% EPS growth. That represents our second year of 15% EPS growth and something that we're very proud of. If you look at almost all of the year-to-date financial metrics represent records in terms of size and scale of Robinson, and we're proud of our performance. And Robinson is a bigger and stronger business today in just about every financial metric that you can look at. I want to take this moment to thank the Robinson team. We've had to adapt and change a lot to a changing marketplace and a changing industry over the last several years. And we're doing that, and we feel very good about the strength of our team and the results that we achieved in 2015.
So those are the financial metrics. Now I'll highlight just a few other headline thoughts again before I turn it over to Andy. I mentioned Freightquote already once in the last few quarters. We've talked about that. As a reminder, we closed that acquisition on January 1, 2015. So this will be the last quarter where Freightquote's inclusion will be highlighted. We've been doing that simply to be transparent around the impact of those acquired revenues and the acquired impacts of Freightquote, but we're very pleased with that acquisition. Similar to what we've said in previous quarters, we're happy with what we've achieved there. We have a little bit more work to do in terms of integrating the business and going forward, but year 1 was a success. And hopefully, the impact of Freightquote to our financials has been clear throughout the year.
The thought that I would share is with regards to pricing. When you look through the deck, and Andy gives the comments on our various services, you'll see a lot of down arrows on pricing. We talked in our last call about softening markets and softening pricing. And I don't think it's any surprise to anyone that over the last quarter, pretty much in all of our services, that demand has been softening and that has resulted in price declines. We've talked a lot -- if you look at the last couple of years now, 2014 and '15, last year, we had some pretty meaningful price increases in all of our services, particularly in the truckload area. And now this year, we're seeing a more typical cycling or turning down of some of those prices. That's an important change that we have to adapt to, and we'll do the best we can to give you our color on kind of what we're seeing in the market and how we adjust our business to do that. But as a reminder, we really think of our value creation in the long term around taking market share and helping our customers and suppliers adapt to those changing market conditions. So while it is a pretty relevant change to what's going on in the market, it's nothing that we haven't experienced before, and it's part of how we think we can add value to the marketplace in a declining price market.
So I'll stop there with those headline thoughts and turn it over to Andy to walk you through the deck of our financials."

I also want to echo your comments about our fourth quarter and full year. 2015 was a great year for Robinson, and our people are and should be very proud of these results. While it was a different transportation market than 2014, our global network continues to prove that we can provide excellent service to our customers and deliver strong results for our shareholders in any condition. This industry continues to change and evolve and will do so at an increasing pace in the years to come. We like that because we have been disrupting and innovating for years. 
Today, approximately 72% of our customer shipments originate from either an electronic or digital transaction or is web or mobile-based. We have connections with well over 150,000 organizations and execute over 5 million web or mobile interactions among -- with customers and carriers. These customers and carriers rely on us to lead. And that is exactly what we are doing, and I think these results reflect that.
So I will start my review of the detailed results on Slide 4 with our transportation. Transportation net revenues increased 13.8% to $544 million in the quarter. We finished the full year with a 13.5% net revenue growth, driven in part by our 14% growth in global shipment count to approximately 17 million shipments in 2015. Fourth quarter transportation net revenue margin increased 310 basis points from 2014's fourth quarter to 19%. From a historical perspective, it is our best net revenue margin quarter since Q4 2008. This increase was a result of the impact of lower transportation cost in most of the transportation modes, including the decrease in fuel prices when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The chart on this page shows our transportation net revenue margin for the past 10 years, representing multiple economic and industry cycles. It is a combination of our people, process and technology that produce these best-in-class results on a consistent and sustainable basis.
Moving on to Slide 5 and our truckload results. We had another strong quarter in our truckload business, growing net revenues by 13.4%. Organic net revenue increased approximately 10% while Freightquote added approximately 3.5% to the net revenues in the quarter. Truckload volume increased 5% with organic volume of approximately 2% and Freightquote adding approximately 3%. By comparison, case volumes were down approximately 2.5% in the fourth quarter. We feel good about our ability to profitably grow volumes and take market share. In fact, we've done that for 26 consecutive quarters.
In North America, the line haul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was down 3% on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 5%. From a historical perspective, since 2008, the average increase of pricing to customers has been 2.5%. During that same 8-year period, the price paid to carriers has risen 2.5%. There has been and probably always will be short-term volatility between these 2 numbers. But over a longer period of time, they tend to converge. In real time, we are seeing the pricing in the spot market had a larger impact on changes in overall pricing than in the previous quarters in the year.
Our volume growth in the quarter and for most of the year in 2015 came from our committed business, with transactional volume down on a year-over-year basis, as you would expect. The demand environment in the second half of 2015 was softer than in the first half when compared to 2014. Thus far, in 2016, our volume growth is similar to what we saw in the second half of '15. John will talk more about that in his closing comments.
Moving on to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. Our LTL net revenues increased 41.4% with organic net revenues increasing approximately 9% and Freightquote contributing approximately 32% in the fourth quarter. LTL volumes increased 36% with organic contributing 17% and Freightquote adding approximately 19%. Net revenue margin increased on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of higher-margin Freightquote business with small customers and growth in our consolidation business. For the year, LTL net revenues are up nearly 40%, driven by strong organic and Freightquote contributions. We are the largest non-asset LTL provider in North America by a wide margin, and our go-to-market strategy has proven to be a winning one with customers and providers.
Transitioning to intermodal results on Slide 7. Intermodal net revenue decreased 13.7% in the fourth quarter, with volumes down 8%. Without Freightquote, organic net revenues decreased approximately 22% in the fourth quarter. It was a tough fourth quarter in the intermodal business, as we had a significant decrease in our transactional volumes. The intermodal services represents less than 2% of our net revenues, and we typically see the results impacted negatively in a softer truckload market with lower fuel prices. These market conditions often impact the decision of shippers to utilize truckload services rather than intermodal.
Moving to Slide 8 and a review of our global forwarding business. Net revenue for the global forwarding services decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter. Ocean net revenues decreased 1.5%, while air decreased 4.1% and custom services were down 1.3%. There are 2 things in the quarter to highlight. The first is that we continue to capture market share in global forwarding. Volumes were up in ocean and up slightly in air despite a very challenging marketplace. Pricing, however, in both ocean and air continue to be a major headwind with -- both down double digits in the quarter. The second issue to reflect is that it's important to remember the strong Q4 2014 comparable, which was driven by the West Coast port strikes, where net revenue grew 18% in that particular period. The 2015 full year results were very positive on both top and bottom lines, and our global forwarding team has done an excellent job. We've got a great team and are confident in the platform and how we are positioned for the future.
Slide 9 and our other logistic services. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 16.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Managed services, primarily our TMS offering branded TMC, represents over half the net revenue in this area, and that business is performing extremely well with strong net revenue growth. TMC finished the year with a record number of new implementations and the pipeline for pending implementations as at an all-time high.
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues increased 11.9% in the fourth quarter, and case volume grew 4.5%. We are pleased with the sourcing team's ability to finish the year strong in the fourth quarter and grow net revenues just short of 5% for the year. Our customer base is very concentrated with retail and food services customers representing our 2 largest segments. The sourcing team continues to adapt the value proposition, and they have done a good job working through a tough couple of years with a lot of change in both our services and how we meet the needs of our top customers.
Slide 11 covers our summarized income statements for the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 14.3% in the fourth quarter and as a percent of net revenue was 37.6%, up 20 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. For the year, operating income as a percent of net revenue increased 50 basis points to 37.8%. Thank you to all of our people for another strong productivity year. Personnel expenses were up 14.1% in the quarter. This increased personnel expense was due to the additional headcount relating to our acquisition of Freightquote, contributing approximately 9.1% and a 5% increase in our organic headcount. Other SG&A expenses increased 11.4%. This increase again was primarily due to the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million. John mentioned earlier that we had an interest in other expense increase during the quarter by $7.1 million. That expense was partially offset by the related tax liabilities, decreasing earnings per share by $0.02 in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to Slide 11 and other financial information. We had a great cash flow quarter, generating just over $253 million in the period. Year-to-date, cash flow was $718 million, a 40% increase versus last year. Capital expenditures were $11.8 million in the fourth quarter and year-to-date $44 million. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be between $70 million and $80 million, with $30 million coming from our new data center. We finished the fourth quarter with $950 million in debt and just under $170 million in cash.
And finally, before turning it back to John, on the Slide 13 in our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter with approximately $64 million coming from dividends and $66 million in share repurchases. We finished the quarter returning approximately 103% of net income to shareholders. And for the year, we returned 92%, which is in line with our target. Since 2010, we've returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividend and share repurchases. Again, our thanks to everyone at Robinson for a great quarter in 2015, and thank you all as well for listening in. 
With that, I will turn it back to John for his closing comments."

So Slide 14 labeled a look ahead is just some bullet points that we laid out to kind of share with you what we're seeing and what our headline thoughts are heading in to 2016. To start with our January, total company net revenue organic growth rate is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2015. As I mentioned earlier, Freightquote has lapped, so the impact of Freightquote in 2015 would not reoccur again this year. But basically, what we saw in January was a continued soft transactional market and continued margin expansion on our committed freight, very similar to what Andy laid out for Q4 of 2015.
What is our mindset and how are we thinking about 2016? I mentioned in my kickoff comments that our long-term value proposition and how we think about growing the business is to be very focused on taking share, knowing that there's going to be different periods of different environments and different pricing scenarios, but that is absolutely what we're focused on in 2016. We put the word, profitably, on there. It's important from our standpoint that when we think about how we go to market and how we want to grow our business, that when we enter into a committed relationship and are trying to add value to the customers in the marketplace on a longer-term basis, that those relationships are sustainable, and that we're getting compensated for what we're doing and that we're adding value to the customer on a long-term basis. In the transactional world, again, there's not a lot of point in executing transactional business if you can't get a return on it. So when we think about how we go to market, it makes sense for us to think about how we can add value and go after market share in a sustainable way. We think we've done that in our past, and that will continue to be our mindset going forward.
Global forwarding success. Andy touched on the results that we had and why we feel good about our global forwarding team and our global forwarding success. I think as -- the next 2 points really go together around integrated services and global forwarding. But we've talked a lot in the last 3 years. 3 years ago, we weren't as proud or content with our competitive positioning in global forwarding. With the Phoenix acquisition and the further investment over the last 3 years, we've been able to grow our net -- combined net revenues high-single digits over that period of time and really improve our service offering and our capabilities. And it's not only been a good investment, but I think it's been a very important expansion of what Robinson is capable of and allowing our cross-selling services and allowing us to look at other regions of the world and how we can build further on to our network. So we're very focused on that continuation of cross-selling, looking at international air, ocean and customs brokerage in other regions and really leveraging the platform that we've built over the last 3 years as an important part of our thoughts going forward.
The demand for integrated global services is growing. That's probably not a new thought to most people, but just to share with you that when we look at our customer metrics and our business that we do see an escalation of the number of customers that are using multiple services. Andy mentioned that the growth in the pipeline in our managed services division, and we've talked about cross-selling of some of our international and domestic stuff. There's a lot of data points and a lot of metrics that point to our continued success in working on a more global basis and working with more integrated customers. So we do feel that's an important trend that we're going to stay focused on.
Another point related to that, though, that we have emphasized and continued to believe is very important is that all of the services that we offer are very competitive and do require competitive pricing and service levels in order to be successful. So when we think about the pace and how aggressively we expand those services and expand those geographies, it is balanced by wanting to retain our market leadership position and a high quality, high service and competitive price profile as we move into each of those. We also have talked about we do believe it's important to maintain both a transactional and a committed or contractual presence in the marketplace. So as we grow with those bigger, more global and integrated opportunities, we also are staying focused on how to remain competitive in the transactional marketplace and balancing the different types of relationships and segment offerings that we have with our customers.
So that's a little bit of insight into how we're thinking about our offerings and expanding our profile and our platform going into the year and increasing those global integrated services. The last point is really repetitive from things that we've been emphasizing for a long time. We've talked about people, process and technology and really believing that, that is the competitive foundation of the things that really matter in the forwarding and 3PL sector that we're going to continue to focus on. Our people have always been our primary asset and will remain that. Our talent and our account managers and how we go to market are just really what we think makes a difference, and whether we succeed or fail at Robinson, will continue to be our primary asset that we invest in. 
Technology is as important as ever, a lot of focus and emphasis around technology disruption and the impact that it's having on our industry. We believe we're a technology leader, and we're going to continue to invest in our Navisphere platform and continue to maintain that competitive advantage that we think is really important in the marketplace.
Our business processes are very important. Sometimes, it's about bringing consistency and discipline to those processes. And at other times, it's about innovation and new ideas that customers are looking to try to make changes or to improve or to take costs out of their supply chain. And that talent, technology and innovation, people process technology focus, we're as convinced as ever that, that is the differentiator at Robinson. And that is what we're going to continue to invest in to make a difference in the marketplace.
Those are our prepared thoughts. With that, I will turn it over to Tim to facilitate some prepared Q&A."

The first question is for Andy around truckload pricing. North America truckload pricing to CHRW customers was down 3% year-over-year while transportation costs per mile declined 5%, a spread that widened more significantly during the fourth quarter when compared to earlier this year. Has this spread widened, narrowed or remained relatively the same in January?"

Listening to that question, I would say the other thing that probably comes to mind is that from a macro standpoint, we've been trying hard to analyze our business from an industry and vertical standpoint more and more. And probably not surprisingly, when you look across the vertical sectors in Robinson, it is where you would see some of the higher correlations to the economy and where things are at. Anything energy or mining-related obviously are very soft. And even in those regions where that's focused, less activity going on. On the retail world, there's a lot of transition, lot of increase in e-commerce, a lot of store closings, a lot of transition that's going on in the retail world. We're still fairly big in food and beverage, which is a little bit more stable than a lot of the other sectors. Our automotive business is still remaining pretty good in North America, but that industry has continued to do fairly well. So again, not shocking or surprising given the headlines and the types of things that are happening in the U.S. and around the world. But I would say that our freight activities probably validate some of the headlines that you see about what's happening in the overall economy."

And if you go back and look at our activity over the last 5 or 6 years, throughout 2010, '11, '12, '13, we talked a lot about it being a little bit unusual in an extended period of time, where there was a fairly balanced market. That balanced market ended with some weather and some meaningful price increases in late '13, '14. And now what we're seeing in '15 is -- towards the end of the year, some of that double-digit price increase, especially in the transactional market, being given back. So yes, if I look from a standpoint of 2014 being a tighter market and some aggressive price increases and now some of those coming back, we are probably moving back more towards a midpoint around the balance of supply and demand in the marketplace. What I think is different, though, is that a lot of the way we talked about our business back in 2011 and '12 was during a sustained period of a balanced market. There became some different dynamics around route guides and how important it was to be near the top-of-the-route guide and how we have to aggressively go after share in a fairly sustained balanced market for a long period of time. It's too early to know what the rest of even '16 is going to be like, much less '17 and '18. So I don't think it's fair to conclude that we're back into a sustained balanced market. We'll have to see how the rest of '16 plays out and what the next couple of years look like if we're going back into an environment like we saw in '11 and '12."

Almost every committed bid that we work on will have dozens of providers and lots of carriers, lots of other 3PLs and the market remains very competitive. So we continue to see a very competitive marketplace with a lot of people out there. I commented earlier in our prepared comments that we take approach around sustainability and profitability. And whenever somebody is aggressively going after market share with a different attitude towards profitability or sustainability, it can have an impact that we have to try to understand that and make sure that we're not overreacting or mispricing our services or doing things that we don't intend to do because others are taking a different go-to-market strategy in terms of what they're doing. So we do have to watch out for that. But I think for the most part, the vast majority of the competitors have a similar attitude and have continued to work on that. We haven't seen a lot of change this year in the competitive landscape. Again, whenever the market is moving, softening like it has, there will be a lot of transition and a lot of bid activity. But with thousands of competitors in a very fragmented market, it's hard to see any unique changes in a short period of time.

And that fragmented marketplace and those -- I guess, it depends upon your definition of medium and small, but to us, 100 pieces of equipment all the way down to that individual true owner operator with one truck, that is the backbone of our truckload capacity and continues to be a very similar mix today that it's been over the last couple of decades."

When you think about the years in our history, where we've had really significant growth, it was environments where there was a lot of economic growth and a lot of continued opportunity in the marketplace, where in those longer-term committed relationships, we have a high degree of volume. And we're able to take market share and expand those committed relationships while, at the same time, there's a very robust market of transactional opportunities and unexpected freight that we can help service in the marketplace as well, too. So the very best performance years we've had from a growth and profitability standpoint is when the economies are growing, the markets are very active and there's healthy market share opportunities in both committed and transactional relationships that we have in the marketplace. There's a lot of other market environments like we've talked about earlier, where demand will cycle and capacity will cycle. And so supply and demand will lead to price increases and price decreases. And as I've said a couple of times, we'll continue to add value and take market share and apply our services in whatever environment the marketplace throws at us. But the optimum conditions, which is probably true for a lot of industries and a lot of companies, is overall economic growth and prosperity is a good thing for all of us. And when we see a sustained environment of that, it's probably the best thing."

For the past several decades, there's been a lot of speculation around the extra strain on the small carrier and whether or not that was going to impact the marketplace as a whole and whether that would impact our relationships with them. Some of the regulation that's come into the marketplace over the last 6 or 7 years around safety and hours of service and now the electronic watch that are coming in, there is a cost factor that impacts that capacity in the marketplace. But we're pretty comfortable that similar to a lot of the previously implemented legislation that it'll get absorbed over time and that it'll get adapted to by the small carriers. And I think one of the things that is important to understand, too, is that while hours of service and some of the safety ratings and some of the electronic logging regulations that have come or are coming into place, one of the other impacts of that is it really is sort of genericizing the capacity out there, where some of the quality differentiations that maybe some of the larger carriers tried to differentiate within the past are not going to be as prevalent. So while there's a cost issue and a potential productivity issue, we do think that the capacity landscape is going to remain very fragmented and that in a lot of ways, it will actually improve the quality and the overall blend of capacity that we can utilize in the marketplace."

So when we look across our book of rates and contracts, there will be some that have been in place for years that we and the customer are continuing to live by. And in other instances, those customers will have a very rigid annual cycle or a more systematic approach towards how and when they rebid those services. Even when a shipper rebids their contracts or committed pricing, they may or may not include all of the freight. There's another step in the process to determine based on market conditions and their service levels around what they would want to do. So for us, it's a very fluid process. There are bids going on at any point during the year. There are more of them going on this time of year than in others, but there really is no single bellwether or month. It's very much of an ongoing evolution based on supply and demand conditions as to when either providers are giving 30-day notice and opting out or when shippers are choosing to rebid the contracts in the marketplace."

We do have metrics that establish that we have been successful with that. There's measured net revenue in relationships that have come in both ways. And as I commented my prepared comments about the numbers of customers with multiple services and our cross-selling success from our joint account managers, we do feel very good that that's real and that we've been successful in doing that. With the Freightquote acquisition, there's probably less specific cross-selling. The business is very transactional. I think the theme that we've talked more about there is really more us having a clearer segmentation strategy that in our LTL business, while we've been very comfortable with how we've grown it over the last decade, we have gravitated more towards committed relationships with higher-volume shippers because that was really our expertise and capability. And our account management structure really didn't facilitate an efficient interface with a small shipper, who wanted to spend a lot of time price-shopping and doing other things that a more typical smaller transactional customer would do. So what's been positive about the Phoenix -- or I'm sorry about the Freightquote acquisition this year is really helping us evolve into a clearer segmentation strategy, where the true transactional smaller shippers, especially the LTL, but also truckload, are leads and opportunities that we can put more under the Freightquote brand that has established a very efficient front end and interface with customers for doing that, and then allowing the traditional Robinson network to focus more on the medium and larger customers, where we're investing our account management resources in a little bit more cost-intensive approach to provide the service that's required for those relationships. So a little bit different in terms of the way we're going after the synergies and the growth, but feeling good about both of them that they've been good additions to the Robinson network and have made it stronger."

And we also have a fair amount of concentration in certain commodities like melons and other stuff that we have unique expertise and that we do a lot of activity. So what will happen in any period of time is that there will be some volatility in the results relative to the weather and the crop yields and just the amount of freight and activity that comes out of it. That Fresh group also provides a lot of temperature control transportation within the Robinson network. So at any point in time, we're working with those retailers and food service companies to not only provide temp control transportation, but also product for them, where we can source and supply the Fresh product into their network. Because of the customer concentration over the past 6, 7 years, we've had a couple of instances where we knew that larger customers were not going to be sourcing certain commodities from us in the future. So we've cautioned that some of the declines were foreseeable that we can see them. At this point, we do think our Robinson Fresh sourcing business is at a normal activity level. We don't see -- we're not aware of any losses or things that we expect in terms of customer declines. So we hope this type of activity in the fourth quarter would be normal. But again, back to the normal caveat that it is a very weather-sensitive business and a lot of these commodities can fluctuate up and down in unforeseen ways pretty quickly, so there will continue to be a little bit more volatility in the sourcing line item of our revenues."

I'm going to start by highlighting a few of the financial metrics that we look at, and then maybe share a few headline thoughts before turning it over to Andy.",1106,"Thank you, Tim, and thanks for everybody taking the time to listen to the call this morning. I'm going to start by highlighting a few of the financial metrics that we look at, and then maybe share a few headline thoughts before turning it over to Andy. 
In terms of financial metrics on Slide 3 that Tim referenced, if you look at our total revenues for the quarter, we're down 4.4%. Similar to the rest of the year, the total revenues grew at a slower pace, primarily due to the cost of fuel and the reduction of fuel surcharges in our services. In the fourth quarter, we also have seen -- did see some decline in prices that result in reduced total revenues. Total net revenues increased 13.7% in the quarter. As the slide indicates, 7.3% growth came from our organic growth, while the Freightquote acquisition contributed about 6.5 percentage points to that growth.
Income from operations for the quarter was up 14.3% and net income was up 12%, earnings per share of $0.88 compared to earnings per share of $0.77 last year. I wanted to share just a couple of comments on the difference between income from operations and net income and the comment that's noted on Slide 4 about the indemnification asset. When we acquired Phoenix 3 years ago, there were some uncertain tax positions around the world that we received an indemnification promise from the sellers. The purchase accounting for that is to record an indemnification receivable as well as a contingent tax liability for the issues that were uncertain. If those issues are all resolved without any obligations, both the receivable and the contingent liability would come back off the balance sheet without any cash charges or any net impact to earnings. The nuance with the accounting for that is the receivable comes off when the indemnification period ends and the tax liabilities come off when the statute of limitation passes in all the various countries that they apply to. So what we saw during the fourth quarter was a $7.1 million indemnification asset writeoff that went to other expense. That's the reversal of the receivable that was recorded, which is a noncash charge. We also saw a portion of the tax liabilities come off the balance sheet as well and reduced the tax provision, and the rest of the tax liabilities will come off in future periods as those statute of limitations pass. So a little bit unusual, but it does result in a $7 million other expense charge that net of those tax liabilities that reversed did have a negative impact of $0.02 per share on the quarter. That's what results in a different growth rate in net income compared to income from operations for the quarter.
In terms of other financial metrics down at the bottom of that slide, we talk about our team and our headcount. We finished the year with 13,159 employees, which represents a little over 14% increase from the previous year. Just under 1,000 of those employees joined us through the Freightquote acquisitions, and the remainder came from organic growth of staffing up our teams across the network.
If you look at the year-to-date results, which is always good to do because we do have a fair amount of incentive contracts and other things that apply on an annual basis, still, we did complete 2015 with year-to-date results that reflected 15% EPS growth. That represents our second year of 15% EPS growth and something that we're very proud of. If you look at almost all of the year-to-date financial metrics represent records in terms of size and scale of Robinson, and we're proud of our performance. And Robinson is a bigger and stronger business today in just about every financial metric that you can look at. I want to take this moment to thank the Robinson team. We've had to adapt and change a lot to a changing marketplace and a changing industry over the last several years. And we're doing that, and we feel very good about the strength of our team and the results that we achieved in 2015.
So those are the financial metrics. Now I'll highlight just a few other headline thoughts again before I turn it over to Andy. I mentioned Freightquote already once in the last few quarters. We've talked about that. As a reminder, we closed that acquisition on January 1, 2015. So this will be the last quarter where Freightquote's inclusion will be highlighted. We've been doing that simply to be transparent around the impact of those acquired revenues and the acquired impacts of Freightquote, but we're very pleased with that acquisition. Similar to what we've said in previous quarters, we're happy with what we've achieved there. We have a little bit more work to do in terms of integrating the business and going forward, but year 1 was a success. And hopefully, the impact of Freightquote to our financials has been clear throughout the year.
The other thought that I would share is with regards to pricing. When you look through the deck, and Andy gives the comments on our various services, you'll see a lot of down arrows on pricing. We talked in our last call about softening markets and softening pricing. And I don't think it's any surprise to anyone that over the last quarter, pretty much in all of our services, that demand has been softening and that has resulted in price declines. We've talked a lot -- if you look at the last couple of years now, 2014 and '15, last year, we had some pretty meaningful price increases in all of our services, particularly in the truckload area. And now this year, we're seeing a more typical cycling or turning down of some of those prices. That's an important change that we have to adapt to, and we'll do the best we can to give you our color on kind of what we're seeing in the market and how we adjust our business to do that. But as a reminder, we really think of our value creation in the long term around taking market share and helping our customers and suppliers adapt to those changing market conditions. So while it is a pretty relevant change to what's going on in the market, it's nothing that we haven't experienced before, and it's part of how we think we can add value to the marketplace in a declining price market.
So I'll stop there with those headline thoughts and turn it over to Andy to walk you through the deck of our financials."

While it was a different transportation market than 2014, our glob",1573,"Thank you, John. I also want to echo your comments about our fourth quarter and full year. 2015 was a great year for Robinson, and our people are and should be very proud of these results. While it was a different transportation market than 2014, our global network continues to prove that we can provide excellent service to our customers and deliver strong results for our shareholders in any condition. This industry continues to change and evolve and will do so at an increasing pace in the years to come. We like that because we have been disrupting and innovating for years. 
Today, approximately 72% of our customer shipments originate from either an electronic or digital transaction or is web or mobile-based. We have connections with well over 150,000 organizations and execute over 5 million web or mobile interactions a month with customers and carriers. These customers and carriers rely on us to lead. And that is exactly what we are doing, and I think these results reflect that.
So I will start my review of the detailed results on Slide 4 with our transportation. Transportation net revenues increased 13.8% to $544 million in the quarter. We finished the full year with a 13.5% net revenue growth, driven in part by our 14% growth in global shipment count to approximately 17 million shipments in 2015. Fourth quarter transportation net revenue margin increased 310 basis points from 2014's fourth quarter to 19%. From a historical perspective, it is our best net revenue margin quarter since Q4 2008. This increase was a result of the impact of lower transportation cost in most of the transportation modes, including the decrease in fuel prices when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The chart on this page shows our transportation net revenue margin for the past 10 years, representing multiple economic and industry cycles. It is a combination of our people, process and technology that produce these best-in-class results on a consistent and sustainable basis.
Moving on to Slide 5 and our truckload results. We had another strong quarter in our truckload business, growing net revenues by 13.4%. Organic net revenue increased approximately 10% while Freightquote added approximately 3.5% to the net revenues in the quarter. Truckload volume increased 5% with organic volume of approximately 2% and Freightquote adding approximately 3%. By comparison, case volumes were down approximately 2.5% in the fourth quarter. We feel good about our ability to profitably grow volumes and take market share. In fact, we've done that for 26 consecutive quarters.
In North America, the line haul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was down 3% on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 5%. From a historical perspective, since 2008, the average increase of pricing to customers has been 2.5%. During that same 8-year period, the price paid to carriers has risen 2.5%. There has been and probably always will be short-term volatility between these 2 numbers. But over a longer period of time, they tend to converge. In real time, we are seeing the pricing in the spot market had a larger impact on changes in overall pricing than in the previous quarters in the year.
Our volume growth in the quarter and for most of the year in 2015 came from our committed business, with transactional volume down on a year-over-year basis, as you would expect. The demand environment in the second half of 2015 was softer than in the first half when compared to 2014. Thus far, in 2016, our volume growth is similar to what we saw in the second half of '15. John will talk more about that in his closing comments.
Moving on to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. Our LTL net revenues increased 41.4% with organic net revenues increasing approximately 9% and Freightquote contributing approximately 32% in the fourth quarter. LTL volumes increased 36% with organic contributing 17% and Freightquote adding approximately 19%. Net revenue margin increased on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of higher-margin Freightquote business with small customers and growth in our consolidation business. For the year, LTL net revenues are up nearly 40%, driven by strong organic and Freightquote contributions. We are the largest non-asset LTL provider in North America by a wide margin, and our go-to-market strategy has proven to be a winning one with customers and providers.
Transitioning to intermodal results on Slide 7. Intermodal net revenue decreased 13.7% in the fourth quarter, with volumes down 8%. Without Freightquote, organic net revenues decreased approximately 22% in the fourth quarter. It was a tough fourth quarter in the intermodal business, as we had a significant decrease in our transactional volumes. The intermodal services represents less than 2% of our net revenues, and we typically see the results impacted negatively in a softer truckload market with lower fuel prices. These market conditions often impact the decision of shippers to utilize truckload services rather than intermodal.
Moving to Slide 8 and a review of our global forwarding business. Net revenue for the global forwarding services decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter. Ocean net revenues decreased 1.5%, while air decreased 4.1% and custom services were down 1.3%. There are 2 things in the quarter to highlight. The first is that we continue to capture market share in global forwarding. Volumes were up in ocean and up slightly in air despite a very challenging marketplace. Pricing, however, in both ocean and air continue to be a major headwind with -- both down double digits in the quarter. The second issue to reflect is that it's important to remember the strong Q4 2014 comparable, which was driven by the West Coast port strikes, where net revenue grew 18% in that particular period. The 2015 full year results were very positive on both top and bottom lines, and our global forwarding team has done an excellent job. We've got a great team and are confident in the platform and how we are positioned for the future.
Slide 9 and our other logistic services. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 16.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Managed services, primarily our TMS offering branded TMC, represents over half the net revenue in this area, and that business is performing extremely well with strong net revenue growth. TMC finished the year with a record number of new implementations and the pipeline for pending implementations as at an all-time high.
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues increased 11.9% in the fourth quarter, and case volume grew 4.5%. We are pleased with the sourcing team's ability to finish the year strong in the fourth quarter and grow net revenues just short of 5% for the year. Our customer base is very concentrated with retail and food services customers representing our 2 largest segments. The sourcing team continues to adapt the value proposition, and they have done a good job working through a tough couple of years with a lot of change in both our services and how we meet the needs of our top customers.
Slide 11 covers our summarized income statements for the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 14.3% in the fourth quarter and as a percent of net revenue was 37.6%, up 20 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. For the year, operating income as a percent of net revenue increased 50 basis points to 37.8%. Thank you to all of our people for another strong productivity year. Personnel expenses were up 14.1% in the quarter. This increased personnel expense was due to the additional headcount relating to our acquisition of Freightquote, contributing approximately 9.1% and a 5% increase in our organic headcount. Other SG&A expenses increased 11.4%. This increase again was primarily due to the Freightquote acquisition, including amortization expense of $1.9 million. John mentioned earlier that we had an interest in other expense increase during the quarter by $7.1 million. That expense was partially offset by the related tax liabilities, decreasing earnings per share by $0.02 in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to Slide 11 and other financial information. We had a great cash flow quarter, generating just over $253 million in the period. Year-to-date, cash flow was $718 million, a 40% increase versus last year. Capital expenditures were $11.8 million in the fourth quarter and year-to-date $44 million. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be between $70 million and $80 million, with $30 million coming from our new data center. We finished the fourth quarter with $950 million in debt and just under $170 million in cash.
And finally, before turning it back to John, on to Slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter with approximately $64 million coming from dividends and $66 million in share repurchases. We finished the quarter returning approximately 103% of net income to shareholders. And for the year, we returned 92%, which is in line with our target. Since 2010, we've returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividend and share repurchases. Again, our thanks to everyone at Robinson for a great quarter in 2015, and thank you all as well for listening in. 
With that, I will turn it back to John for his closing comments."

To start with our January, total company net revenue o",1100,"All right. Thanks, Andy. So Slide 14 labeled a look ahead is just some bullet points that we laid out to kind of share with you what we're seeing and what our headline thoughts are heading in to 2016. To start with our January, total company net revenue organic growth rate is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2015. As I mentioned earlier, Freightquote has lapped, so the impact of Freightquote in 2015 would not reoccur again this year. But basically, what we saw in January was a continued soft transactional market and continued margin expansion on our committed freight, very similar to what Andy laid out for Q4 of 2015.
What is our mindset and how are we thinking about 2016? I mentioned in my kickoff comments that our long-term value proposition and how we think about growing the business is to be very focused on taking share, knowing that there's going to be different periods of different environments and different pricing scenarios, but that is absolutely what we're focused on in 2016. We put the word, profitably, on there. It's important from our standpoint that when we think about how we go to market and how we want to grow our business, that when we enter into a committed relationship and are trying to add value to the customers in the marketplace on a longer-term basis, that those relationships are sustainable, and that we're getting compensated for what we're doing and that we're adding value to the customer on a long-term basis. In the transactional world, again, there's not a lot of point in executing transactional business if you can't get a return on it. So when we think about how we go to market, it makes sense for us to think about how we can add value and go after market share in a sustainable way. We think we've done that in our past, and that will continue to be our mindset going forward.
Global forwarding success. Andy touched on the results that we had and why we feel good about our global forwarding team and our global forwarding success. I think as -- the next 2 points really go together around integrated services and global forwarding. But we've talked a lot in the last 3 years. 3 years ago, we weren't as proud or content with our competitive positioning in global forwarding. With the Phoenix acquisition and the further investment over the last 3 years, we've been able to grow our net -- combined net revenues high-single digits over that period of time and really improve our service offering and our capabilities. And it's not only been a good investment, but I think it's been a very important expansion of what Robinson is capable of and allowing our cross-selling services and allowing us to look at other regions of the world and how we can build further on to our network. So we're very focused on that continuation of cross-selling, looking at international air, ocean and customs brokerage in other regions and really leveraging the platform that we've built over the last 3 years as an important part of our thoughts going forward.
The demand for integrated global services is growing. That's probably not a new thought to most people, but just to share with you that when we look at our customer metrics and our business that we do see an escalation of the number of customers that are using multiple services. Andy mentioned that the growth in the pipeline in our managed services division, and we've talked about cross-selling of some of our international and domestic stuff. There's a lot of data points and a lot of metrics that point to our continued success in working on a more global basis and working with more integrated customers. So we do feel that's an important trend that we're going to stay focused on.
Another point related to that, though, that we have emphasized and continued to believe is very important is that all of the services that we offer are very competitive and do require competitive pricing and service levels in order to be successful. So when we think about the pace and how aggressively we expand those services and expand those geographies, it is balanced by wanting to retain our market leadership position and a high quality, high service and competitive price profile as we move into each of those. We also have talked about we do believe it's important to maintain both a transactional and a committed or contractual presence in the marketplace. So as we grow with those bigger, more global and integrated opportunities, we also are staying focused on how to remain competitive in the transactional marketplace and balancing the different types of relationships and segment offerings that we have with our customers.
So that's a little bit of insight into how we're thinking about our offerings and expanding our profile and our platform going into the year and increasing those global integrated services. The last point is really repetitive from things that we've been emphasizing for a long time. We've talked about people, process and technology and really believing that, that is the competitive foundation of the things that really matter in the forwarding and 3PL sector that we're going to continue to focus on. Our people have always been our primary asset and will remain that. Our talent and our account managers and how we go to market are just really what we think makes a difference in whether we succeed or fail at Robinson, will continue to be our primary asset that we invest in. 
Technology is as important as ever, a lot of focus and emphasis around technology disruption and the impact that it's having on our industry. We believe we're a technology leader, and we're going to continue to invest in our Navisphere platform and continue to maintain that competitive advantage that we think is really important in the marketplace.
Our business processes are very important. Sometimes, it's about bringing consistency and discipline to those processes. And at other times, it's about innovation and new ideas that customers are looking to try to make changes or to improve or to take costs out of their supply chain. And that talent, technology and innovation, people process technology focus, we're as convinced as ever that, that is the differentiator at Robinson. And that is what we're going to continue to invest in to make a difference in the marketplace.
Those are our prepared thoughts. With that, I will turn it over to Tim to facilitate some prepared Q&A."

The first question is for Andy around truckload pricing.

Listening to that question, I would say the other thing that probably comes to mind is that from a macro standpoint, we've been trying hard to analyze our business from an industry and vertical standpoint more and more. And probably not surprisingly, when you look across the vertical sectors in Robinson, it is where you would see some of the higher correlations to the economy and where things are at. Anything energy or mining-related obviously are very soft. And even in those regions where that's focused, less activity going on. On the retail world, there's a lot of transition, lot of increase in e-commerce, a lot of store closings, a lot of transition that's going on in the retail world. We're still fairly big in food and beverage, which is a little bit more stable than a lot of the other sectors. Our automotive business is still remaining pretty good in North America, but that industry has continued to do fairly well. So again, not shocking or surprising given the headlines and the types of things that are happening in the U.S. and around the world. But I would say that our freight activities probably validate some of the headlines that you see about what's happening in the overall economy."

And if you go back and look at our activity over the last 5 or 6 years, throughout 2010, '11, '12, '13, we talked a lot about it being a little bit unusual in an extended period of time, where there was a fairly balanced market. That balanced market ended with some weather and some meaningful price increases in late '13, '14. And now what we're seeing in '15 is -- towards the end of the year, some of that double-digit price increase, especially in the transactional market, being given back. So yes, if I look from a standpoint of 2014 being a tighter market and some aggressive price increases and now some of those coming back, we are probably moving back more towards a midpoint around the balance of supply and demand in the marketplace. What I think is different, though, is that a lot of the way we talked about our business back in 2011 and '12 was during a sustained period of a balanced market. There became some different dynamics around route guides and how important it was to be near the top-of-the-route guide and how we have to aggressively go after share in a fairly sustained balanced market for a long period of time. It's too early to know what the rest of even '16 is going to be like, much less '17 and '18. So I don't think it's fair to conclude that we're back into a sustained balanced market. We'll have to see how the rest of '16 plays out and what the next couple of years look like if we're going back into an environment like we saw in '11 and '12."

Almost every committed bid that we work on will have dozens of providers and lots of carriers, lots of other 3PLs and the market remains very competitive. So we continue to see a very competitive marketplace with a lot of people out there. I commented earlier in our prepared comments that we take approach around sustainability and profitability. And whenever somebody is aggressively going after market share with a different attitude towards profitability or sustainability, it can have an impact that we have to try to understand that and make sure that we're not overreacting or mispricing our services or doing things that we don't intend to do because others are taking a different go-to-market strategy in terms of what they're doing. So we do have to watch out for that. But I think for the most part, the vast majority of the competitors have a similar attitude and have continued to work on that. We haven't seen a lot of change this year in the competitive landscape. Again, whenever the market is moving, softening like it has, there will be a lot of transition and a lot of bid activity. But with thousands of competitors in a very fragmented market, it's hard to see any unique changes in a short period of time. So I would say there's nothing really unusual about what we've experienced this year."

We've talked a lot about our intermodal business and the competitive positioning of it over the past several years. What we have today is a capable team. We understand the service, and we compete primarily in that multimodal freight that can typically be served by either truck or intermodal services. We feel like we do a good job of making certain that our customers get exposure to intermodal opportunities and pricing when that's appropriate. What we've confessed in the past is that what we don't have is the density of high-volume committed freight in all intermodal lanes or the dedicated equipment that is sometimes the most effective way to serve those dense corridors and those more committed areas. That's something that we continue to work on and still aspire to be better at in the future. So as our business continues to transition and hopefully strengthen ourselves in terms of dedicated and committed relationships on the intermodal front, we will continue to see more fluctuations in transactional shipments based upon the market conditions."

So when you bring everybody onto one platform, you're able to provide that visibility end-to-end across the globe with all of your customers. And I would argue that there are very few people that can actually -- a lot of people say they can do it, but very few people can actually back that up and do it.

When you think about the years in our history, where we've had really significant growth, it was environments where there was a lot of economic growth and a lot of continued opportunity in the marketplace, where in those longer-term committed relationships, we have a high degree of volume. And we're able to take market share and expand those committed relationships while, at the same time, there's a very robust market of transactional opportunities and unexpected freight that we can help service in the marketplace as well, too. So the very best performance years we've had from a growth and profitability standpoint is when the economies are growing, the markets are very active and there's healthy market share opportunities in both committed and transactional relationships that we have in the marketplace. There's a lot of other market environments like we've talked about earlier, where demand will cycle and capacity will cycle. And so supply and demand will lead to price increases and price decreases. And as I've said a couple of times, we'll continue to add value and take market share and apply our services in whatever environment the marketplace throws at us. But the optimum conditions, which is probably true for a lot of industries and a lot of companies, is overall economic growth and prosperity is a good thing for all of us.

For the past several decades, there's been a lot of speculation around the extra strain on the small carrier and whether or not that was going to impact the marketplace as a whole and whether that would impact our relationships with them. Some of the regulation that's come into the marketplace over the last 6 or 7 years around safety and hours of service and now the electronic logs that are coming in, there is a cost factor that impacts that capacity in the marketplace. But we're pretty comfortable that similar to a lot of the previously implemented legislation that it'll get absorbed over time and that it'll get adapted to by the small carriers. And I think one of the things that is important to understand, too, is that while hours of service and some of the safety ratings and some of the electronic logging regulations that have come or are coming into place, one of the other impacts of that is it really is sort of genericizing the capacity out there, where some of the quality differentiations that maybe some of the larger carriers tried to differentiate within the past are not going to be as prevalent.

There's another step in the process to determine based on market conditions and their service levels around what they would want to do. So for us, it's a very fluid process. There are bids going on at any point during the year. There are more of them going on this time of year than in others, but there really is no single bellwether or month. It's very much of an ongoing evolution based on supply and demand conditions as to when either providers are giving 30-day notice and opting out or when shippers are choosing to rebid the contracts in the marketplace."

We do have metrics that establish that we have been successful with that. There's measured net revenue in relationships that have come in both ways. And as I commented my prepared comments about the numbers of customers with multiple services and our cross-selling success from our joint account managers, we do feel very good that that's real and that we've been successful in doing that. With the Freightquote acquisition, there's probably less specific cross-selling. The business is very transactional. I think the theme that we've talked more about there is really more us having a clearer segmentation strategy that in our LTL business, while we've been very comfortable with how we've grown it over the last decade, we have gravitated more towards committed relationships with higher-volume shippers because that was really our expertise and capability. And our account management structure really didn't facilitate an efficient interface with a small shipper, who wanted to spend a lot of time price-shopping and doing other things that a more typical smaller transactional customer would do. So what's been positive about the Phoenix -- or I'm sorry about the Freightquote acquisition this year is really helping us evolve into a clearer segmentation strategy, where the true transactional smaller shippers, especially the LTL, but also truckload, are leads and opportunities that we can put more under the Freightquote brand that has established a very efficient front end and interface with customers for doing that, and then allowing the traditional Robinson network to focus more on the medium and larger customers, where we're investing our account management resources in a little bit more cost-intensive approach to provide the service that's required for those relationships. So a little bit different in terms of the way we're going after the synergies and the growth, but feeling good about both of them that they've been good additions to the Robinson network and have made it stronger."

And we also have a fair amount of concentration in certain commodities like melons and other stuff that we have unique expertise in that we do a lot of activity. So what will happen in any period of time is that there will be some volatility in the results relative to the weather and the crop yields and just the amount of freight and activity that comes out of it. That Fresh group also provides a lot of temperature control transportation within the Robinson network. So at any point in time, we're working with those retailers and food service companies to not only provide temp control transportation, but also product for them, where we can source and supply the Fresh product into their network. Because of the customer concentration over the past 6, 7 years, we've had a couple of instances where we knew that larger customers were not going to be sourcing certain commodities from us in the future. So we've cautioned that some of the declines were foreseeable that we can see them. At this point, we do think our Robinson Fresh sourcing business is at a normal activity level. We don't see -- we're not aware of any losses or things that we expect in terms of customer declines. So we hope this type of activity in the fourth quarter would be normal. But again, back to the normal caveat that it is a very weather-sensitive business and a lot of these commodities can fluctuate up and down in unforeseen ways pretty quickly, so there will continue to be a little bit more volatility in the sourcing line item of our revenues."

As you may recall, that acquisition was completed on January 1, 2015. S",781,"Okay thank you, Tim. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the time to listen to our Q1 call. I want to start my prepared comments by talking a little bit about Freightquote. As you may recall, that acquisition was completed on January 1, 2015. So last year during our quarterly earnings calls, we were continuously highlighting the impact of Freightquote and making certain that the impact of that material acquisition was understood. 
As of January 1, 2016, we've lapped a full year comparison of Freightquote, so the results and the schedules that we'll be walking through today represent purely organic growth and comparisons year-over-year that include Freightquote. Again, as you may recall, our plan is that we're managing Freightquote as a separate brand within the C.H. Robinson LTL business so that we will continue to reference Freightquote and Freightquote results but they are included in our overall LTL performance. When Andy gets to that, you'll also see that our overall LTL performance has been good and that one of the things that we do pride ourselves in and try to stayed focus on is when we complete acquisition like that, that both our legacy business as well as the new business improves and continues to grow at an acceptable rate. So we continue to feel very positive about the Freightquote acquisition, again a little less visibility just because the lapping of the year, but we feel very positive about that investment and now incorporating it into our LTL business. 
So with that, back to Slide 3 and looking at our overall results for Q1 of 2016. Our total revenues declined 6.9% to just a little over $3 billion. The headlines and the total revenues are the decline in fuel prices as well as the decline in the pricing of most of our services, which we'll walk through by area. Total net revenues for the quarter increased 7.3%. The story there is while there were price decreases, we did have volume increases in most of our services as well as margin expansion, which we'll talk quite a bit about. Income from operations for the quarter, $198.9 million or an increase of 9.4% over last year. You can see down below in the metrics, our average headcount for the quarter increased 5.5% over the year as well too. When we think about our business from a headline standpoint, we are investing in talent but we also feel very good about the productivity levels and the efficiency levels that we're operating at. We also have very good expense management in the quarter that Andy will talk through as well too. So you'll see income from operations growing faster than net revenue, which is our hope. 
From an earnings per share standpoint, $0.83 for the quarter compared to $0.73 last year or a 13.7% increase, and that also goes with the weighted average shares below that to a decrease of 2% or 143 million shares outstanding. As has been our plan for a while, we continue to invest in share repurchases and capital management strategies that have helped us achieve our plan of growing our EPS slightly faster than our net income or income from operations which did happen again in this quarter. 
So that's kind of the headline financial metrics for the quarter. Overall, we feel very good about them. Our business continues to perform very well and our team is engaged in doing a great job across our network. So that's a positive thing and we feel very good about the overall results. 
In terms of I guess the other headline, before I turn it over to Andy, obviously you'll see and I had a lot of the discussion over the past few quarters, that we are now 2 years or 8 consecutive quarters into overall transportation margin expansion. We'll try to help you understand kind of by area where that's happening and what our thoughts are. Again, it's very difficult to predict the market conditions and where those things might go, but we definitely have had a nice run of margin expansion and favorable margin conditions where that has helped our net revenue growth and our results. 
As we've talked for decades, we view it as our primary job to really help our customers and carrier partners understand the market conditions and manage through those cycles with the right level of execution of service performance, and we continue to feel very good about how we're positioned with that. So those are the overall financial metrics and headline messages that I would share with you. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy to walk through our results by service area."
368470,330918078,963910,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","C.H.

Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to follow up on John comments and commend the Robinson team.

Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to follow up on John comments and commend the Robinson team. Our network continues to perform at a high level, serving both customers and suppliers. The great results are what happens when talented people work together. In 2016, we've had many customer awards recognizing our performance as a top logistics provider to prominent companies like Walmart, Coke, Dollar General, Ocean Spray, Home Shopping Network and Brose North America. These awards are a great example of how our team is adding value with the customers. 
The macro environment remains sluggish. Despite that, we were able to grow our volumes in nearly all services in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on profitably taking market share in this softer environment. The market conditions in the second quarter remained pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. 
And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. Transportation net revenue increased 7.9% to $534 million in the quarter. The drivers for this increase were truckload, less-than-truckload, global forwarding and managed services. First quarter transportation net revenue margin increased 290 basis points to 19.7%. The breakout of the various factors for this change in margin were fuel, which represented an approximate 90 basis point impact. Lower purchase transportation cost in truckload represented approximately 130 basis points and the impact of higher-margin businesses and global forwarding and managed services represented the remaining increase. 
The first quarter is continued evidence of the cyclicality of our industry. The market has had some swings in purchase transportation costs and customer pricing over the past couple of years. And while it is always it is difficult to predict what lies ahead, we know that the comparisons from last year get more challenging as the year goes on. 
To our truckload results on Slide 5. We had another good quarter in our truckload business, growing net revenues 7.8% and North American truckload volume increasing 4% in the quarter. In North America, the linehaul price per mile to our customers excluding the impact of fuel was down 5% on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 7%. Similar to the fourth quarter, we continue to see weak spot market pricing when compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the last 3 quarters, the price to shippers and the price to carriers has been down on a year-over-year basis. 
Our volume growth in the quarter came from our contractual business, which was up double digits. However, as you would expect, transactional volume was down double digits on a year-over-year basis. The spot market environment was tepid in the latter part of March and that trend has continued during the first few weeks of April. We received a lot of questions from investors about bid activity. Our bid activity increased on a year-over-year basis in both the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as the first quarter of 2016. We have seen that bid activity normalize here in the second quarter and we expect that we will see a more typical cadence for the remainder of the year. It is difficult to quantify the year-over-year variance in the bid outcomes, but we believe that the results of our recent bid awards has pricing flat to down slightly versus last year's pricing in our contractual awards. 
Our carrier services team and people in the network had another great quarter adding new carriers to C.H. Robinson. We added over 2,600 new carriers in the first quarter and those carriers moved approximately 17,000 loads. We also continue to see big increases in our connectivity with this carrier base as we surpass 50% in automated updates with carriers for the first time during the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. As John mentioned, we continue to be very happy with the results in our less-than-truckload business, with net revenues increasing 6.9% and volumes increasing 10%. The LTL business continues to perform well and the addition of Freightquote is helping us win more often than the smaller shipper segment. Customer pricing remained flat in the quarter and the results of bid pricing in our contractual business is a bit stronger than in the truckload segment as we are seeing low single-digit increases in contractual bid responses. We continue to build on our industry-leading position as the largest third-party provider of LTL services in North America, and that value proposition is winning across all verticals. 
Transitioning to our intermodal slide results on Page 7. Intermodal net revenue increased -- decreased, pardon me, 11.9% in the first quarter with volumes down 13%. Results have been challenging for the past several quarters as market conditions have less than the demand for rail services amongst our customer portfolio. We had approximately 2,000 customers in our intermodal business in this year's first quarter as compared to nearly 2,500 last year. Most of these lost customers were transactional shippers as our business with our larger customers remain steady. 
Transitioning to Slide 8. We had a strong first quarter in the global forwarding business. Net revenue increased 8.3% for the combined services. Ocean net revenues increased 16.9% with volumes increasing approximately 8%. Internet revenues declined 10.8% as a result of significantly lower pricing versus last year's first quarter. However, we had strong volume growth in air with a 13% increase in our shipment count. Customs net revenue increased 4.5% in the quarter. We continue to see good results from our cross-selling efforts between global forwarding and surface transportation services and are seeing increasing number of opportunities to leverage our full portfolio to assist our customers with their global supply chains. We have talked a lot over the past couple of years about the successful integration of Phoenix International and the strength of our larger business. We are operating in one global system allowing us to focus on growth and efficiency. All global forwarding regions and services are now profitable and we continue to be recognized by our customers for our services. Our global forwarding team is well positioned to continue to build on these great results.
Moving on to other logistic services on Slide 9. The services in this group include transportation management services warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 21.4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Managed services, primarily our TMS offering branded TMC, performed extremely well with strong net revenue growth being the primary driver of the first quarter increase. In the first quarter, we implemented the North American phase of the TMC global control tower from Microsoft. We have already implemented in Vietnam, China, Brazil, Europe and Latin America. Our technology platform will support all of their modes of transport for all regions around the world. The managed services pipeline continues to expand rapidly, and we expect this service to continue to grow nicely throughout the year.
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues decreased 2.3% in the first quarter, while case volume grew 8.4%. The decrease in our sourcing net revenues was primarily driven by the adverse effects of heavy rains in Florida impacting the vegetable crops, which is a high volume and key category for us. This is a category where a high percentage of our business is contracted and we had to source produce from the West Coast to offset the lost crops and we had a much higher cost of goods for that West Coast product. We don't expect this issue to carry forward in the second quarter. So that's a look at the performance in our various services for the quarter. I will now transition to Slide 11 and our summarized income statement. 
Income from operations increased 9.4% in the first quarter and as a percent of net revenues was 35.3%, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter. For the seventh quarter in a row, we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of expenses. Personnel expenses were up 8.8% in the quarter. The increase in personnel expenses was driven primarily by a 5.6% increase in headcount and an additional payroll tax expense in the first quarter of 2016 of approximately $2.6 million. This expense is related to the delivery of previously vested restricted equity awards. It is a one-time event for the year. A good portion of our personal expenses continue to be variable based on the financial performance of our businesses. Other SG&A expense decreased 1.3%. This decrease was driven by a lower provision for bad debt as a result of lower receivables in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in travel expenses.
Moving to Slide 12 and other financial information. We had another very strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $104 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $17.8 million in the first quarter. This increase compared to last year as a result of costs associated with the building of our second data center. We expect capital expenditures for 2016 to be between $60 million and $80 million with the majority of that going to the data center and technology. We finished the quarter with $970 million in debt and just under $180 million in cash. 
And finally, before turning it back to John on Slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We've returned approximately $117 million to shareholders in the quarter with approximately $64 million coming in the form of dividends, approximately $21 million coming in the form of share repurchases, and we also had shares withheld upon delivery of previously vested restricted equity. That totaled approximately $32 million. 
Again, thank you to everyone at Robinson for a solid first quarter. And thank you all as well for listening in. With that, I'll turn it back to John to make some closing comments."

And kind of sticking to form in past calls, what we want to do is just really share what we're seeing currently in the marketplace as well as where we're investing an",1037,"Okay. With regards to wrap-up comments on Slide 14, you can see our bullet points there. And kind of sticking to form in past calls, what we want to do is just really share what we're seeing currently in the marketplace as well as where we're investing and what's on our minds with regards to our company and how we're approaching the marketplace. 
The first bullet point, our April to date total company net revenue growth rate per day is approximately 6% when compared to April last year. Andy commented that the end of March and in April, we continue to see some softening in demand in the marketplace and you see that in our overall net revenue growth in April that the demand in the marketplace remains fairly soft. The North American truckload volume growth thus far in April is around 2% compared to the 4% in the first quarter of 2016. 
With regards to the second bullet point, again already mentioned the contractual bid activity. It's normal activity for us that in the fourth quarter and first quarter of any typical year that we would see some elevated level of activity. As Andy mentioned, that activity was more robust than normal. It'd be very expected in a softening market. The price declines that we referenced that you would see increased bid activity by shippers. That's normal behavior in a softening market. We do believe the lion's share of that has passed and that bid activity is more -- at more normal seasonal levels when we come into the second quarter of 2016. 
Kind of tying into that bullet point 3, the North American truck market continues to have a high level of available capacity. We have currently continue to see a soft market with a lot of available truckload capacity, and that's the continuation of the business trends that Andy described with pricing moving down and the cost of higher decreasing with that. 
So that's what we're seeing from a current marketplace standpoint. There's a few more questions that we'll get into that we'll expand on some of that. But before we jump to the Q&A session, I would like to just talk about strategy update and our investment priorities that we continue to focus on at Robinson. People, process and technology is the phrase and the line that we've used for many decades around how we think about our business and just want to reiterate that we continue to think that is absolutely what drives the competitive advantage and success of our business. From a people standpoint, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we are hiring. We are continuing to invest in our network and we continue to believe that our team of people at Robinson is a very important competitive advantage and will be our #1 priority. 
From a process standpoint, we have a lot of initiatives across the company around business process improvement, network transformation, how we share freight, how we consolidate, deconsolidate. A lot of those things are supporting some of the growth numbers that Andy walked us through, and that will continue to be part of our approach to innovation and how we look at improving things for both our shipper and carrier partners and how we're working in the marketplace. Technology, Navisphere technology platform that won global instance of how we go to market and how we provide our services and integrate them where appropriate, again continues to be something we believe is a competitive advantage and that we're spending significant amounts of money to continue to enhance. There are some questions that get a little more specific about where we're investing in the technology area and what we're doing, so I won't go into that now. But again, just important to understand that approach to being an asset-free high return on invested capital, people process and technology-focused business is as alive as it's ever been at Robinson, and we believe it's working and will continue to drive our success in the future. 
Bullet point 2, expanding and optimizing our global network. While we're proud of our global footprint and it's changing every day, we also acknowledge that it's a significant growth opportunity for us to expand in parts of the world where we don't currently have a presence in our network today. We do have plans to open offices in Europe and Asia that will expand our geographic footprint. There are other parts of the world where we don't have a presence and work through agents that we think we can continue to grow as well as optimizing. When we talk about expanding and optimizing, it's hitting on both the growth and efficiency part of how we think about our network that as proud we are on how we can execute, we have a long list of opportunities that we think we can optimize our global network and continue to improve the outcomes for our business partners as well as our results. So expanding and optimizing our global network continues to be a strategic imperative that we think has a lot of upside in it to continue to both grow our business and make it more effective. 
And lastly, select M&A opportunities. You've heard us talk before about our plan and our approach to the marketplace is to aggressively look at M&A opportunities but to have what we consider a very high filter in terms of the business model fit and the cultural compatibility of the types of organizations that we want to add to the Robinson network. We're carrying on with that approach and we continue to feel that we will be able to add value in the future by finding the right selective M&A deals that come to us with the right level of compatibility and fit into our network. 
So those are the sort of top-of-mind thoughts around the strategic imperatives that we're working on and what we're seeing currently in the marketplace to wrap things up. 
So I'll finish there with just one more time reiterating that we're very happy with the results. We're happy with the execution of the team and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the earnings call."

As most of you who are familiar with us know that if you go back a decade or more",615,"I think this is a really important question in terms of understanding how our business has evolved over time and how it may likely perform in future marketplaces or cycles. As most of you who are familiar with us know that if you go back a decade or more into the past that we were very focused on transactional brokerage services and approaching the market with very fluid activity around changing prices and changing volume activity in the marketplace. Over the last decade plus, it's been longer than that. But for sure, in the last decade, one of the longer-term trends in our business is a much greater concentration of committed or contractual freight commitments with our customers. We've talked in the past about each customer's contracting process and the definition of committed freight, contracted freight, awarded freight, a lot of the terminology that you would use to display the success of results in those bids. The challenge in it is that there's variances and nuances to all of them. I think it is useful to aggregate the concept and talk about our universe of contracted freight and it clearly has increased over the last decade. We're going from being a small percentage of our business more than a decade ago to today, the best that we can quantify it is somewhere north of 50%, probably closer to 60% or 65% of our activity that we're moving in Q1 of 2016 was under some sort of a contracted price arrangement or bid result that we've worked with, with our largest shippers. It is true that in the past, along the lines of the question, that we worried a little bit less about what was happening in the freight cycles and the expansion and contraction of the pricing because in a more transactional world, we could just plan on aggressively selling and taking market share to get that transactional freight and kind of grow through all cycles. As we have become more concentrated and committed and contracted freight, and as we become a much larger entity with $13 billion of revenue rather than $1 billion or $2 billion of revenue, mixing that in with the changing market conditions where we have an economy that's less robust and shippers who are managing their supply chains a lot different than they may be a decade ago with regards to their tolerance for expedited charges or transactional premiums. They're probably managing their inventories much more aggressively today than they were a decade plus ago and then mixing in just the impact of technology and the competitive landscape. There is a difference, I think, in terms of how Robinson will perform in different cycles. There were a lot of questions around what happens when the market starts to tighten and our contractual commitments potentially create more margin pressure for us when the cost of hire starts to increase and it can take a while to pass through those contractual commitments. In the current environment, what that would mean is that we have a higher percentage, a higher concentration of committed relationships that we're going to have to work through and re-price. There could be some delay with that. And at times, the transactional market just hasn't been as robust as it has in the past. So who knows, each market seems to be a little bit unique and a little bit different. Like I said, there's 1 million little nuances and variances around each of these relationships, but I do think as you think forward and analyze our results, that is an important part of understanding our go-to-market and our current mix of business and how those results might happen."

It's core to who we are and what we do. I would expect the headcount, the rate of growth to somewhat moderated as we go through the remainder of the year, but we talk a lot about people, process, technology. And I'll cite a very specific example of why we've invested -- have and continue to invest in talented people. We mentioned Microsoft and our ability to manage our global supply chain. So it requires a state-of-the-art global technology platform, which we've made a lot of great investments in, and we continue to hire IT people and program that but enhance that. And then you take and marry that up with really talented logistics professionals not just based here in North America but based throughout the world, they're managing one of the largest technology global supply chain. And so kind of maybe also to answer another question around the utilization, all the technology that goes into that, the technology companies that are very clearly say that we value your technology but we also value the talent and the people that you have and the processes that you run help us manage our global supply chain across all modes, across all regions. As to -- as I mentioned earlier, for 7 quarters in a row, we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of o your operating expenses. And clearly, a portion of that is driven by the fact that our compensation personnel expenses, there's a good portion of that that's variable. So we were awarded on a variable basis for the performance of the business. So I would tell you, it doesn't always work out that way, but all of us are focused -- every person in this company is focused on growing net revenues in excess of operating expenses."

So you can look at that 2 ways I guess in terms of last April on an organic basis being an easier comparison or you can look at it as last year April started out weak and May and June improved quite as well too. It gets challenging. We think we want to share what we know and we want to share what's in our mind.

We continue to aggressively grow volume and margin, particularly with new customer wins, and that's flat-out taking market share because our business with our existing customers is flat. Some of that new customer wins are the result of cross-selling, and we talk a lot about that but a lot of the success of global forwarding, surface transportation and surface transportation to global forwarding. We're really pleased with the work that we're doing there, but part of it is also just the global forwarding team going out and sourcing new business across the globe. So yes, it has been a very challenging pricing environment in the ocean side, quite frankly as well as the air. But the team is highly motivated, highly energized and being very successful in going out there and growing the business. And to the question around are we needing to?

It's one of the areas of the business that we're very excited about. The pipeline looks very good and we think we have a lot of upside there. The customer contracts and relationships are also longer term than in the freight business, so that gives us kind of greater assurance to that. IT's sustainable from that standpoint. It's a good add-on to ask how this revenue stream helps the other areas of the business because, to some degree, a lot of those services are premised around independents that we are creating firewalls and separating information and providing a lot of those other logistic services with complete independence from any provider including the Robinson freight networks. However, when you think about Robinson expanding its relationships and services around more complex supply chain perspectives, it's important from a number of reasons. One, our technology solution really encompasses the capabilities to do a lot of things. So it really helps broaden our minds and our cultural -- our capabilities around execution. Beyond that, there's a very important cultural thing, too, that when you strengthen your relationships and your trust level with customers and you understand their supply chain challenges and are able to look at their business more holistically, it absolutely helps you be a more intelligent provider and helps you to bid more intelligently on independent opportunities, an example being if a customer has significant inventory management initiatives and we're working with them from a supply chain standpoint to really better understand their movements and their inventory levels, we also know that on the freight side, there probably are opportunities around consolidation and deconsolidation that, while separately priced and executed, are an important part of achieving some of those strategies. So it's part of a cultural thing of expanding our mindset, expanding our account managers' capabilities, expanding our technology platform. And from a go-to-market standpoint, very often, the services are very independent in terms of how they're priced and achieved."

From a long-term perspective, a typical pattern in our transportation business was that years would begin in January and February with a lot less demand and greater margins in the marketplace. And then as the spring season would come, particularly with our concentration in produce and a lot of activity ramping up, that we often talked in the past about how it would be normal that margins would compress a little bit moving into the spring and comparing to kind of software January, February seasons. Over the past several years, there's been a lot of change in the marketplace that we've talked about, a lot of change in the mix of our business around the length of haul, changes in fuel prices, some of the things that Andy highlighted that can have a pretty important impact on those margins. And then add to that some of the weather impacts that we've seen over the last couple of years, where there's been a pretty material movement on the market. So it's all that, that kind of makes us nervous to kind of forecast or guide to where we think margins are going to go, but there is an element of the freight that does have some kind of normal downward pressure on it from Q1 to Q2 just around seasonality."

So yes, we're looking at all those areas. We have a particular focus, but really our filters that we deploy are pretty rigorous. And I guess I would follow up and use John's words to describe the M&A environment, which is selective. And we think that it actually mirrors kind of our philosophy that there are still good buyers, there are still quality buyers and sellers out there, but both are being more selective. And maybe that's a result of recent market discipline among companies that have been making acquisitions and making sure, I think, the market is saying, let's make sure you have the right strategy and are able to effectively integrate those deals. And clearly, if you look at what we've done since 2012 with both Phoenix, with Freightquote and the like, we've had a pretty successful track record of doing that."

Is there anything company-specific that you were doing to help drive growth and/or net margin in that segment after a few challenging quarters?"

Our focus, as we've often talked about is, with the multimodal shipper, where freight moves between truck and rail opportunities. And our primary go-to-market strategy has been to make sure that those customers that want to and are able to take advantage of intermodal savings and service offerings that we're exposing that to them and making sure that our customers are getting the benefit of a multimodal approach. We feel like we're very good at that and we've executed on it well over the years and have become a very significant transactional intermodal provider in the network. We work with our rail partners to adjust to the market conditions and help them go after market share when they want to do that, and we sacrifice market share when pricing, and market conditions dictate that as you go back the other way. So we feel good about kind of that core offering that we've been doing for several decades. The limitation with that, obviously, is that a high percentage of the intermodal freight that moves on the rails is more committed or more contractual freight, and we've acknowledged in the past that we are subscale on some of that, and without our own dedicated asset commitments and contractual pricing for some of the line haul services, there are situations where we're not competitive on some of the more committed or contractual activities. We have been, for several years and we will continue going forward, to try to strengthen our presence in committed or contracted relationships by investing in limited amounts of assets, where that's appropriate, by partnering with our rails to make sure that they understand and want the types of opportunities that we're bringing to them, and by continuing to enhance our Navisphere system to make sure that it provides value to shippers and that we continue very high service levels regardless of what type of intermodal freight we're working on. So we do have plans to continue to diversify our presence in intermodal. We are open to investments or acquisitions, as we've said many times in the past. But it sort of comes down from a standpoint of, if we're going to experience these ups and downs in our growth rate as long as we're primarily a transactional provider and we do need to continue to focus on a broader presence with more committed relationships. We had a little bit of success with that, the last few years. You don't see it over the last couple of quarters because of the significant changes in the transactional marketplace but we do have some optimism about what we think we can achieve in the future there."

It has been our view and remains our view that, over time, all those costs pass through and will normalize and that it's not something that we necessarily fear or think is going to create any sort of permanent material shifts in the landscape of who's competitive or what happens. It does, however, add some pressure around how and when those costs get added, who adds them, when and exactly how and when they get put into the rates. When you combine the sort of normal capitalistic turn of supply and demand and the fact that carriers are always kind of coming and going in a very fragmented marketplace, yes, probably the soft market probably adds some pressure to how and when people recover the incremental cost that ELDs will drive over time. And the fact that some carriers have had them for a while and others need to add them, it certainly -- there's some dynamic there that's probably real. But from our standpoint, with each of these cost drivers and regulatory type changes, they're sort of hard to understand and try to quantify the impact when they come, but they all seem to work their way into the marketplace without any major reorganization of what's happening."

I think we've shared in the past that when we analyzed that over time, we actually feel very comfortable with our committed relationships on both the shipper side and the carrier side than those increases have been very similar overall a longer period of time. They just move at different rates, which could have an impact. So if you strip that out and just say, hey, what's the longer-term secular challenges around growing market share and expanding the 3PL presence in both truckload and LTL, that comes back to kind of some of our core value added things and I talked about in my prepared comments. We think when we have better people and better account managers that bring insight those relationships; when we have a better business process for consolidating and deconsolidating, when we have better analytics, when we have better information and a better system that helps customers manage their freight better and understand their costs and go to market more effectively, those are all things that drive the long-term value. So staying competitive and evolving our competitive advantages and all of those kind of core competency areas are what gives us the confidence and gives us the focus of how we'll continue to take share across both the TL and LTL segment. And at the same time, we -- like i mentioned many times at this call, we got to work through those contraction and expansion cycles on pricing and margins to make sure that we're adapting the market conditions and helping our partners do the same."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the time to listen to our Q1 call. I want to start my prepared comments by talking a little bit about Freightquote. As you may recall, that acquisition was completed on January 1, 2015.",786,"Okay. Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the time to listen to our Q1 call. I want to start my prepared comments by talking a little bit about Freightquote. As you may recall, that acquisition was completed on January 1, 2015. So last year during our quarterly earnings calls, we were continuously highlighting the impact of Freightquote and making certain that the impact of that material acquisition was understood. 
As of January 1, 2016, we've lapped a full year comparison of Freightquote, so the results and the schedules that we'll be walking through today represent purely organic growth and comparisons year-over-year that include Freightquote. Again, as you may recall, our plan is that we're managing Freightquote as a separate brand within the C.H. Robinson LTL business so that we will continue to reference Freightquote and Freightquote results but they are included in our overall LTL performance. When Andy gets to that, you'll also see that our overall LTL performance has been good and that one of the things that we do pride ourselves in and try to stay focused on is when we complete acquisitions like that, that both our legacy business as well as the new business improves and continues to grow at an acceptable rate. So we continue to feel very positive about the Freightquote acquisition. It will get a little less visibility just because the lapping of the year, but we feel very positive about that investment and now incorporating it into our LTL business. 
So with that, back to Slide 3 and looking at our overall results for Q1 of 2016. Our total revenues declined 6.9% to just a little over $3 billion. The headlines and the total revenues are the decline in fuel prices as well as the decline in the pricing of most of our services, which we'll walk through by area. Total net revenues for the quarter increased 7.3%. The story there is while there were price decreases, we did have volume increases in most of our services as well as margin expansion, which we'll talk quite a bit about. 
Income from operations for the quarter, $198.9 million or an increase of 9.4% over last year. You can see down below in the metrics, our average headcount for the quarter increased 5.5% over the year as well too. When we think about our business from a headline standpoint, we are investing in talent, but we also feel very good about the productivity levels and the efficiency levels that we're operating at. We also had very good expense management in the quarter that Andy will talk through as well, too. So you'll see income from operations growing faster than net revenue, which is our hope. 
From an earnings per share standpoint, $0.83 for the quarter compared to $0.73 last year or a 13.7% increase, and that also goes with the weighted average shares below that to a decrease of 2% or 143 million shares outstanding. As has been our plan for a while, we continue to invest in share repurchases and capital management strategies that have helped us achieve our plan of growing our EPS slightly faster than our net income or income from operations, which did happen again in this quarter. 
So those are the kind of the headline financial metrics for the quarter. Overall, we feel very good about them. Our business continues to perform very well, and our team is engaged in doing a great job across our network. So that's a positive thing and we feel very good about the overall results. 
In terms of, I guess, the other headline, before I turn it over to Andy. Obviously you'll see and I had a lot of the discussion over the past few quarters, that we are now 2 years or 8 consecutive quarters into overall transportation margin expansion. We'll try to help you understand kind of by area where that's happening and what our thoughts are. Again, it gets very difficult to predict the market conditions and where those things might go. But we definitely have had a nice run of margin expansion and favorable margin conditions where that has helped our net revenue growth and our results. 
As we've talked for decades, we view it as our primary job to really help our customers and carrier partners understand the market conditions and manage through those cycles with the right level of execution of service performance. And we continue to feel very good about how we're positioned with that. So those are the overall financial metrics and headline messages that I would share with you. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy to walk through our results by service area."

Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to follow up on John comments and commend the Robinson team. 
Our network continues to perform at a high level, serving both customers and suppliers. The great results are what happens when talented people work together. In 2016, we've had many customer awards recognizing our performance as a top logistics provider to prominent companies like Walmart, Coke, Dollar General, Ocean Spray, Home Shopping Network and Brose North America. These awards are a great example of how our team is adding value with the customers. 
The macro environment remains sluggish. Despite that, we were able to grow our volumes in nearly all services in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on profitably taking market share in this softer environment. The market conditions in the second quarter remained pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. 
And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. Transportation net revenue increased 7.9% to $534 million in the quarter. The drivers for this increase were truckload, less-than-truckload, global forwarding and managed services. First quarter transportation net revenue margin increased 290 basis points to 19.7%. The breakout of the various factors for this change in margin were fuel, which represented an approximate 90 basis point impact. Lower purchase transportation cost in truckload represented approximately 130 basis points and the impact of higher-margin businesses and global forwarding and managed services represented the remaining increase. 
The first quarter is continued evidence of the cyclicality of our industry. The market has had some swings in purchase transportation costs and customer pricing over the past couple of years. And while it is always difficult to predict what lies ahead, we know that the comparisons from last year get more challenging as the year goes on. 
To our truckload results on Slide 5. We had another good quarter in our truckload business, growing net revenues 7.8% and North American truckload volume increasing 4% in the quarter. In North America, the line-haul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was down 5% on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 7%. Similar to the fourth quarter, we continue to see weak spot market pricing when compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the last 3 quarters, the price to shippers and the price to carriers has been down on a year-over-year basis. 
Our volume growth in the quarter came from our contractual business, which was up double digits. However, as you would expect, transactional volume was down double digits on a year-over-year basis. The spot market environment was tepid in the latter part of March and that trend has continued during the first few weeks of April. We received a lot of questions from investors about bid activity. Our bid activity increased on a year-over-year basis in both the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as the first quarter of 2016. We have seen that bid activity normalize here in the second quarter, and we expect that we will see a more typical cadence for the remainder of the year. It is difficult to quantify the year-over-year variance in the bid outcomes, but we believe that the results of our recent bid awards has pricing flat to down slightly versus last year's pricing in our contractual awards. 
Our carrier services team and people in the network had another great quarter adding new carriers to C.H. Robinson. We added over 2,600 new carriers in the first quarter, and those carriers moved approximately 17,000 loads. We also continue to see big increases in our connectivity with this carrier base as we surpass 50% in automated updates with carriers for the first time during the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. As John mentioned, we continue to be very happy with the results in our less-than-truckload business with net revenues increasing 6.9% and volumes increasing 10%. The LTL business continues to perform well, and the addition of Freightquote is helping us win more often than the smaller shipper segment. Customer pricing remained flat in the quarter and the results of bid pricing in our contractual business is a bit stronger than in the truckload segment as we are seeing low single-digit increases in contractual bid responses. We continue to build on our industry-leading position as the largest third-party provider of LTL services in North America, and that value proposition is winning across all verticals. 
Transitioning to our intermodal slide results on Page 7. Intermodal net revenue increased -- decreased, pardon me, 11.9% in the first quarter with volumes down 13%. Results have been challenging for the past several quarters as market conditions have less than the demand for rail services amongst our customer portfolio. We had approximately 2,000 customers in our intermodal business in this year's first quarter as compared to nearly 2,500 last year. Most of these lost customers were transactional shippers as our business with our larger customers remain steady. 
Transitioning to Slide 8. We had a strong first quarter in the global forwarding business. Net revenue increased 8.3% for the combined services. Ocean net revenues increased 16.9% with volumes increasing approximately 8%. Air net revenues declined 10.8% as a result of significantly lower pricing versus last year's first quarter. However, we had strong volume growth in air with a 13% increase in our shipment count. Customs net revenue increased 4.5% in the quarter. We continue to see good results from our cross-selling efforts between global forwarding and surface transportation services and are seeing an increasing number of opportunities to leverage our full portfolio to assist our customers with their global supply chains. We have talked a lot over the past couple of years about the successful integration of Phoenix International and the strength of our larger business. We are operating in one global system allowing us to focus on growth and efficiency. All global forwarding regions and services are now profitable and we continue to be recognized by our customers for our services. Our global forwarding team is well positioned to continue to build on these great results.
Moving on to other logistics services on Slide 9. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 21.4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Managed services, primarily our TMS offering branded TMC, performed extremely well with strong net revenue growth being the primary driver of the first quarter increase. In the first quarter, we implemented the North American phase of the TMC global control tower from Microsoft. We have already implemented in Vietnam, China, Brazil, Europe and Latin America. Our technology platform will support all of their modes of transport for all regions around the world. The managed services pipeline continues to expand rapidly, and we expect this service to continue to grow nicely throughout the year.
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues decreased 2.3% in the first quarter, while case volume grew 8.4%. The decrease in our sourcing net revenues was primarily driven by the adverse effects of heavy rains in Florida impacting the vegetable crops, which is a high volume and key category for us. This is a category where a high percentage of our business is contracted, and we had to source produce from the West Coast to offset the lost crops. And we had a much higher cost of goods for that West Coast product. We don't expect this issue to carry forward into the second quarter. So that's a look at the performance on our various services for the quarter. 
I will now transition to Slide 11 and our summarized income statement. Income from operations increased 9.4% in the first quarter, and as a percent of net revenues was 35.3%, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter. For the seventh quarter in a row, we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of expenses. Personnel expenses were up 8.8% in the quarter. The increase in personnel expenses was driven primarily by a 5.6% increase in headcount and an additional payroll tax expense in the first quarter of 2016 of approximately $2.6 million. This expense is related to the delivery of previously vested restricted equity awards. It is a onetime event for the year. A good portion of our personal expenses continue to be variable based on the financial performance of our businesses. Other SG&A expense decreased 1.3%. This decrease was driven by a lower provision for bad debt as a result of lower receivables in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in travel expenses.
Moving to Slide 12 and other financial information. We had another very strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $104 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $17.8 million in the first quarter. This increased compared to last year, as a result of costs associated with the building of our second data center. We expect capital expenditures for 2016 to be between $60 million and $80 million with the majority of that going to the data center and technology. We finished the quarter with $970 million in debt and just under $180 million in cash. 
And finally, before turning it back to John on Slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $117 million to shareholders in the quarter with approximately $64 million coming in the form of dividends, approximately $21 million coming in the form of share repurchases. And we also had shares withheld upon delivery of previously vested restricted equity. That totaled approximately $32 million. 
Again, thank you to everyone at Robinson for a solid first quarter. And thank you all as well for listening in. With that, I'll turn it back to John to make some closing comments."

With regards to wrap-up comments on Slide 14, you can see our bullet points there and kind of sticking to form in past calls, what we want to do is just really share what we're seeing currently in the marketplace as well as where we're investing and",1043,"Okay. With regards to wrap-up comments on Slide 14, you can see our bullet points there and kind of sticking to form in past calls, what we want to do is just really share what we're seeing currently in the marketplace as well as where we're investing and what's on our minds with regards to our company and how we're approaching the marketplace. 
The first bullet point, our April to date total company net revenue growth rate per day is approximately 6% when compared to April last year. Andy commented that the end of March or in April, we continue to see some softening in demand in the marketplace. And you see that in our overall net revenue growth in April that the demand in the marketplace remains fairly soft. The North American truckload volume growth thus far in April is around 2% compared to the 4% in the first quarter of 2016. 
With regards to the second bullet point, again we already mentioned the contractual bid activity. It's normal activity for us that in the fourth quarter and first quarter of any typical year that we would see some elevated level of activity. As Andy mentioned, that activity was more robust than normal. It'd be very expected in a softening market, the price declines that we referenced that you would see increased bid activity by shippers. That's normal behavior in a softening market. We do believe the lion's share of that has passed, and that bid activity is more -- at more normal seasonal levels when we come into the second quarter of 2016. 
Kind of tying into that bullet point 3, the North American truck market continues to have a high level of available capacity. We have currently continue to see a soft market with a lot of available truckload capacity. And that's the continuation of the business trends that Andy described with pricing moving down and the cost of higher decreasing with that. 
So that's what we're seeing from a current marketplace standpoint. There's a few more questions that we'll get into that we'll expand on some of that. But before we jump to the Q&A session, I would like to just talk about strategy update and our investment priorities that we continue to focus on at Robinson. People, process and technology is the phrase and the line that we've used for many decades around how we think about our business. I just want to reiterate that we continue to think that is absolutely what drives the competitive advantage and success of our business. 
From a people standpoint, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we are hiring. We are continuing to invest in our network and we continue to believe that our team of people at Robinson is a very important competitive advantage and will be our #1 priority. 
From a process standpoint, we have a lot of initiatives across the company around business process improvement, network transformation, how we share freight, how we consolidate, deconsolidate. A lot of those things are supporting some of the growth numbers that Andy walked us through. And that will continue to be part of our approach to innovation on how we look at improving things for both our shipper and carrier partners and how we're working in the marketplace. Technology, our Navisphere technology platform, that one global instance of how we go to market and how we provide our services and integrate them where appropriate, again continues to be something that we believe is a competitive advantage and that we're spending significant amounts of money to continue to enhance. There are some questions that get a little more specific around where we're investing in the technology area and what we're doing. So I won't go into that now. But again, just important to understand that, that approach to being an asset-free high return on invested capital, people process and technology-focused business is as alive as it has ever been at Robinson. And we believe it's working and will continue to drive our success in the future. 
Bullet point 2, expanding and optimizing our global network. While we're proud of our global footprint and it's changing every day, we also acknowledge that it's a significant growth opportunity for us to expand in parts of the world where we don't currently have a presence in our network today. We do have plans to open offices in Europe and Asia that will expand our geographic footprint. There are other parts of the world where we don't have a presence and work through agents that we think we can continue to grow, as well as optimizing. When we talk about expanding and optimizing, it's hitting on both the growth and efficiency part of how we think about our network that as proud as we are on how we can execute, we have a long list of opportunities that we think we can optimize our global network and continue to improve the outcomes for our business partners as well as our results. So expanding and optimizing our global network continues to be a strategic imperative that we think has a lot of upside in it to continue to both grow our business and make it more effective. 
And lastly, select M&A opportunities. You've heard us talk before about our plan and our approach to the marketplace is to aggressively look at M&A opportunities, but to have what we consider a very high filter in terms of the business model fit and the cultural compatibility of the types of organizations that we want to add to the Robinson network. We're carrying on with that approach, and we continue to feel that we will be able to add value in the future by finding the right selective M&A deals that come to us with the right level of compatibility and fit into our network. 
So those are the sort of top-of-mind thoughts around the strategic imperatives that we're working on and what we're seeing currently in the marketplace to wrap things up. So I'll finish there with just, one more time, reiterating that we're very happy with the results. We're happy with the execution of the team. And we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the earnings call."

So Robinson is participating in more bids on a year-over-year basis as our people out are selling and taking market share. So it's not that the bids -- we're continuing to grow the amount. It's just the rate in which they had increased in the -- versus the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year is more normalized to a normal rate of increase."

As most of you who are familiar with us know that if you go back a decade or more into the past, that we were very focused on transactional brokerage services and approaching the market with very fluid activity around changing prices and changing volume activity in the marketplace. Over the last decade -- plus it's been longer than that. But for sure, in the last decade, one of the longer-term trends in our business is a much greater concentration of committed or contractual freight commitments with our customers. We've talked in the past about each customer's contracting process and the definition of committed freight, contracted freight, awarded freight, a lot of the terminology that you would use to display the success of results in those bids. The challenge in it is that there's variances and nuances to all of them. I think it is useful to aggregate the concept and talk about our universe of contracted freight. And it clearly has increased over the last decade. We're going from being a small percentage of our business more than a decade ago to today, the best that we can quantify. It is somewhere north of 50%, probably closer to 60% or 65% of our activity that we're moving in Q1 of 2016 was under some sort of a contracted price arrangement or bid result that we've worked with, with our large shippers. It is true that in the past, along the lines of the question, that we worried a little bit less about what was happening in the freight cycles and the expansion and contraction of the pricing because in a more transactional world, we could just plan on aggressively selling and taking market share to get that transactional freight and kind of grow through all cycles. As we have become more concentrated and committed in contracted freight and as we've become a much larger entity with $13 billion of revenue rather than $1 billion or $2 billion of revenue, mixing that in with the changing market conditions where we have an economy that's less robust and shippers who are managing their supply chains a lot different than they may be were a decade ago with regards to their tolerance for expedited charges or transactional premiums and probably managing their inventories much more aggressively today than they were a decade plus ago and then mixing in just the impact of technology and the competitive landscape. There is a difference, I think, in terms of how Robinson will perform in different cycles. There were a lot of questions around what happens when the market starts to tighten and our contractual commitments potentially create more margin pressure for us when the cost of hire starts to increase and it can take a while to pass through those contractual commitments. In the current environment, what that would mean is that we have a higher percentage, a higher concentration of committed relationships that we're going to have to work through and reprise. And there could be some delay with that. And at times, the transactional market just hasn't been as robust as it has in the past. So who knows, each market seems to be a little bit unique and a little bit different. Like I said, there's 1 million little nuances and variances around each of these relationships. But I do think, as you think forward and analyze our results, that is an important part of understanding our go-to-market and our current mix of business and how those results might happen."

And I'll cite a very specific example of why we've invested -- have and continue to invest in talented people. So we mentioned Microsoft and our ability to manage our global supply chain. So it requires a state-of-the-art global technology platform, which we've made a lot of great investments in. And we continue to hire IT people to not only program that, but enhance that. And then you take and marry that up with really talented logistics professionals not just based here in North America, but based throughout the world that are managing one of the largest technology global supply chain. And so kind of -- maybe also to answer another question around the organization, the technology that goes into that. If a technology company is very clearly saying that we value your technology, but we also value the talent and the people that you have and the processes that you run help us manage our global supply chain across all modes, across all regions. As to -- as I mentioned earlier, for 7 quarters in a row, we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of our operating expenses. And clearly, a portion of that is driven by the fact that our compensation, personnel expenses, there's a good portion of that, that's variable. So we were rewarded on a variable basis for the performance of the business. So I would tell you, it doesn't always work out that way. But all of us are focused. Every person in this company is focused on growing net revenues in excess of operating expenses."

We continue to aggressively grow volume and margin, particularly with new customer wins. And that's flat-out taking market share because our business with our existing customers is flat. Some of that new customer wins are the result of cross-selling, and we talk a lot about that, talked a lot about the success of global forwarding, surface transportation and surface transportation to global forwarding. So we're really pleased with the work that we're doing there, but part of it is also just the global forwarding team going out and sourcing new business across the globe. So yes, it has been a very challenging pricing environment in the ocean side, quite frankly as well as the air. But the team is highly motivated, highly energized and being very successful in going out there and growing the business. And to the question around, are we needing to? Yes, the fact of the matter is rates are down so -- and they're volatile. So we're quoting rates to remain competitive in that marketplace."

It's one of the areas of the business that we're very excited about. The pipeline looks very good, and we think we have a lot of upside there. The customer contracts and relationships are also longer term than in the freight business, so that gives us kind of greater assurance to that. It's sustainable from that standpoint. It's a good add-on to ask how this revenue stream helps the other areas of the business because, to some degree, a lot of those services are premised around independents that we are creating firewalls and separating information and providing a lot of those other logistic services with complete independence from any provider including the Robinson freight networks. However, when you think about Robinson expanding its relationships and services around more complex supply chain perspectives, it's important from a number of reasons: One, our technology solution really encompasses the capabilities to do a lot of things. So it just, it really helps broaden our minds and our cultural -- our capabilities around execution. Beyond that, there's a very important cultural thing, too, that when you strengthen your relationships and your trust level with customers and you understand their supply chain challenges and are able to look at their business more holistically, it absolutely helps you be a more intelligent provider and helps you to bid more intelligently on independent opportunities. An example being if a customer has significant inventory management initiatives and we're working with them from a supply chain standpoint to really better understand their movements and their inventory levels, we also know that on the freight side, there probably are opportunities around consolidation and deconsolidation that, while separately priced and executed, are an important part of achieving some of those strategies. So it's part of a cultural thing of expanding our mindset, expanding our account managers' capabilities, expanding our technology platform. And from a go-to-market standpoint, very often, the services are very independent in terms of how they're priced and achieved."

It gets more and more dangerous to try to describe what's normal or typical or expect to happen. From a long-term perspective, a typical pattern in our transportation business was that years would begin in January and February with a lot less demand and greater margins in the marketplace. And then as the spring season would come, particularly with our concentration in produce and a lot of activity ramping up, that we often talked in the past about how it would be normal that margins would compress a little bit moving into the spring and comparing to kind of softer January, February seasons. Over the past several years, there's been a lot of change in the marketplace that we've talked about, a lot of change in the mix of our business around the length of haul, changes in fuel prices, some of the things that Andy highlighted that can have a pretty important impact on those margins. And then add to that some of the weather impacts that we've seen over the last couple of years, where there's been a pretty material movement on the market. So it's all that, that kind of makes us nervous to kind of forecast or guide to where we think margins are going to go. But there is an element of the freight that does have some kind of normal downward pressure on it from Q1 to Q2 just around seasonality."

So yes, we're looking at all those areas. We have a particular focus, but really our filters that we deploy are pretty rigorous. And I guess I would follow up and use John's words to describe the M&A environment, which is it's selective. And we think that it actually mirrors kind of our philosophy that there are still good buyers. There are still quality buyers and sellers out there, but both are being more selective. And maybe that's a result of recent market discipline among companies that have been making acquisitions and making sure -- I think the market is saying, let's make sure you have the right strategy and are able to effectively integrate those deals. And clearly, if you look at what we've done since 2012 with both Phoenix with Freightquote and the like, we've had a pretty successful track record of doing that."

Our focus, as we've often talked about is, with the multimodal shipper where freight moves between truck and rail opportunities. And our primary go-to-market strategy has been to make sure that those customers that want to and are able to take advantage of intermodal savings and service offerings that we're exposing that to them and making sure that our customers are getting the benefit of a multimodal approach. We feel like we're very good at that. And we've executed on it well over the years and have become a very significant transactional intermodal provider in the network. We work with our rail partners to adjust to the market conditions and help them go after market share when they want to do that. And we sacrifice market share when pricing, and market conditions dictate that as you go back the other way. So we feel good about kind of that core offering that we've been doing for several decades. The limitation with that, obviously, is that a high percentage of the intermodal freight that moves on the rails is more committed or more contractual freight. And we've acknowledged in the past that we are subscale on some of that. And without our own dedicated asset commitments and contractual pricing for some of the line-haul services, there are situations where we're not competitive on some of the more committed or contractual activities. We have been, for several years and we will continue going forward, to try to strengthen our presence in committed or contracted relationships by investing in limited amounts of assets where that's appropriate, by partnering with our rails to make sure that they understand and want the types of opportunities that we're bringing to them and by continuing to enhance our Navisphere system to make sure that it provides value to shippers and that we continue very high service levels regardless of what type of intermodal freight we're working on. So we do have plans to continue to diversify our presence in intermodal. We are open to investments or acquisitions, as we've said many times in the past, but it sort of comes down from a standpoint of, if we're going to experience these ups and downs in our growth rate as long as we're primarily a transactional provider. And we do need to continue to focus on a broader presence with more committed relationships. We had a little bit of success with that the last few years. You don't see it over the last couple of quarters because of the significant changes in the transactional marketplace. But we do have some optimism about what we think we can achieve in the future there."

It has been our view and remains our view that, over time, all those costs pass through and will normalize and that it's not something that we necessarily fear or think is going to create any sort of permanent material shifts in the landscape of who's competitive or what happens. It does, however, add some pressure around how and when those costs get added, who adds them, when and exactly how and when they get put into the rates? When you combine the sort of normal capitalistic turn of supply and demand and the fact that carriers are always kind of coming and going in a very fragmented marketplace, yes, probably the soft market probably adds some pressure to how and when people recover the incremental cost that ELDs will drive over time. And the fact that some carriers have had them for a while and others need to add them, it certainly can -- there's some dynamic there that's probably real. But from our standpoint, with each of these cost drivers and regulatory type changes, they're sort of hard to understand and try to quantify the impact when they come. But they all seem to work their way into the marketplace without any major reorganization of what's happening."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the time to listen to our Q1 call. I want to start my prepared comments by talking a little bit about Freightquote. As you may recall, that acquisition was completed on January 1, 2015.",786,"Okay. Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the time to listen to our Q1 call. I want to start my prepared comments by talking a little bit about Freightquote. As you may recall, that acquisition was completed on January 1, 2015. So last year during our quarterly earnings calls, we were continuously highlighting the impact of Freightquote and making certain that the impact of that material acquisition was understood. 
As of January 1, 2016, we've lapped a full year comparison of Freightquote, so the results and the schedules that we'll be walking through today represent purely organic growth and comparisons year-over-year that include Freightquote. Again, as you may recall, our plan is that we're managing Freightquote as a separate brand within the C.H. Robinson LTL business so that we will continue to reference Freightquote and Freightquote results but they are included in our overall LTL performance. When Andy gets to that, you'll also see that our overall LTL performance has been good and that one of the things that we do pride ourselves in and try to stay focused on is when we complete acquisitions like that, that both our legacy business as well as the new business improves and continues to grow at an acceptable rate. So we continue to feel very positive about the Freightquote acquisition. It will get a little less visibility just because the lapping of the year, but we feel very positive about that investment and now incorporating it into our LTL business. 
So with that, back to Slide 3 and looking at our overall results for Q1 of 2016. Our total revenues declined 6.9% to just a little over $3 billion. The headlines and the total revenues are the decline in fuel prices as well as the decline in the pricing of most of our services, which we'll walk through by area. Total net revenues for the quarter increased 7.3%. The story there is while there were price decreases, we did have volume increases in most of our services as well as margin expansion, which we'll talk quite a bit about. 
Income from operations for the quarter, $198.9 million or an increase of 9.4% over last year. You can see down below in the metrics, our average headcount for the quarter increased 5.5% over the year as well too. When we think about our business from a headline standpoint, we are investing in talent, but we also feel very good about the productivity levels and the efficiency levels that we're operating at. We also had very good expense management in the quarter that Andy will talk through as well, too. So you'll see income from operations growing faster than net revenue, which is our hope. 
From an earnings per share standpoint, $0.83 for the quarter compared to $0.73 last year or a 13.7% increase, and that also goes with the weighted average shares below that to a decrease of 2% or 143 million shares outstanding. As has been our plan for a while, we continue to invest in share repurchases and capital management strategies that have helped us achieve our plan of growing our EPS slightly faster than our net income or income from operations, which did happen again in this quarter. 
So those are the kind of the headline financial metrics for the quarter. Overall, we feel very good about them. Our business continues to perform very well, and our team is engaged in doing a great job across our network. So that's a positive thing and we feel very good about the overall results. 
In terms of, I guess, the other headline, before I turn it over to Andy. Obviously you'll see and I had a lot of the discussion over the past few quarters, that we are now 2 years or 8 consecutive quarters into overall transportation margin expansion. We'll try to help you understand kind of by area where that's happening and what our thoughts are. Again, it gets very difficult to predict the market conditions and where those things might go. But we definitely have had a nice run of margin expansion and favorable margin conditions where that has helped our net revenue growth and our results. 
As we've talked for decades, we view it as our primary job to really help our customers and carrier partners understand the market conditions and manage through those cycles with the right level of execution of service performance. And we continue to feel very good about how we're positioned with that. So those are the overall financial metrics and headline messages that I would share with you. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy to walk through our results by service area."
368470,330918078,964190,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and thank you all for listening in. Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to follow up on John comments and commend the Robinson team. Our network continues to perform at a high level, serving both customers and suppliers",1658,"Thank you, John, and thank you all for listening in. Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to follow up on John comments and commend the Robinson team. 
Our network continues to perform at a high level, serving both customers and suppliers. The great results are what happens when talented people work together. In 2016, we've had many customer awards recognizing our performance as a top logistics provider to prominent companies like Walmart, Coke, Dollar General, Ocean Spray, Home Shopping Network and Brose North America. These awards are a great example of how our team is adding value with the customers. 
The macro environment remains sluggish. Despite that, we were able to grow our volumes in nearly all services in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on profitably taking market share in this softer environment. The market conditions in the second quarter remained pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. 
And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. Transportation net revenue increased 7.9% to $534 million in the quarter. The drivers for this increase were truckload, less-than-truckload, global forwarding and managed services. First quarter transportation net revenue margin increased 290 basis points to 19.7%. The breakout of the various factors for this change in margin were fuel, which represented an approximate 90 basis point impact. Lower purchase transportation cost in truckload represented approximately 130 basis points and the impact of higher-margin businesses and global forwarding and managed services represented the remaining increase. 
The first quarter is continued evidence of the cyclicality of our industry. The market has had some swings in purchase transportation costs and customer pricing over the past couple of years. And while it is always difficult to predict what lies ahead, we know that the comparisons from last year get more challenging as the year goes on. 
To our truckload results on Slide 5. We had another good quarter in our truckload business, growing net revenues 7.8% and North American truckload volume increasing 4% in the quarter. In North America, the line-haul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was down 5% on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 7%. Similar to the fourth quarter, we continue to see weak spot market pricing when compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the last 3 quarters, the price to shippers and the price to carriers has been down on a year-over-year basis. 
Our volume growth in the quarter came from our contractual business, which was up double digits. However, as you would expect, transactional volume was down double digits on a year-over-year basis. The spot market environment was tepid in the latter part of March and that trend has continued during the first few weeks of April. We received a lot of questions from investors about bid activity. Our bid activity increased on a year-over-year basis in both the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as the first quarter of 2016. We have seen that bid activity normalize here in the second quarter, and we expect that we will see a more typical cadence for the remainder of the year. It is difficult to quantify the year-over-year variance in the bid outcomes, but we believe that the results of our recent bid awards has pricing flat to down slightly versus last year's pricing in our contractual awards. 
Our carrier services team and people in the network had another great quarter adding new carriers to C.H. Robinson. We added over 2,600 new carriers in the first quarter, and those carriers moved approximately 17,000 loads. We also continue to see big increases in our connectivity with this carrier base as we surpass 50% in automated updates with carriers for the first time during the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. As John mentioned, we continue to be very happy with the results in our less-than-truckload business with net revenues increasing 6.9% and volumes increasing 10%. The LTL business continues to perform well, and the addition of Freightquote is helping us win more often than the smaller shipper segment. Customer pricing remained flat in the quarter and the results of bid pricing in our contractual business is a bit stronger than in the truckload segment as we are seeing low single-digit increases in contractual bid responses. We continue to build on our industry-leading position as the largest third-party provider of LTL services in North America, and that value proposition is winning across all verticals. 
Transitioning to our intermodal slide results on Page 7. Intermodal net revenue increased -- decreased, pardon me, 11.9% in the first quarter with volumes down 13%. Results have been challenging for the past several quarters as market conditions have less than the demand for rail services amongst our customer portfolio. We had approximately 2,000 customers in our intermodal business in this year's first quarter as compared to nearly 2,500 last year. Most of these lost customers were transactional shippers as our business with our larger customers remain steady. 
Transitioning to Slide 8. We had a strong first quarter in the global forwarding business. Net revenue increased 8.3% for the combined services. Ocean net revenues increased 16.9% with volumes increasing approximately 8%. Air net revenues declined 10.8% as a result of significantly lower pricing versus last year's first quarter. However, we had strong volume growth in air with a 13% increase in our shipment count. Customs net revenue increased 4.5% in the quarter. We continue to see good results from our cross-selling efforts between global forwarding and surface transportation services and are seeing an increasing number of opportunities to leverage our full portfolio to assist our customers with their global supply chains. We have talked a lot over the past couple of years about the successful integration of Phoenix International and the strength of our larger business. We are operating in one global system allowing us to focus on growth and efficiency. All global forwarding regions and services are now profitable and we continue to be recognized by our customers for our services. Our global forwarding team is well positioned to continue to build on these great results.
Moving on to other logistics services on Slide 9. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 21.4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Managed services, primarily our TMS offering branded TMC, performed extremely well with strong net revenue growth being the primary driver of the first quarter increase. In the first quarter, we implemented the North American phase of the TMC global control tower from Microsoft. We have already implemented in Vietnam, China, Brazil, Europe and Latin America. Our technology platform will support all of their modes of transport for all regions around the world. The managed services pipeline continues to expand rapidly, and we expect this service to continue to grow nicely throughout the year.
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues decreased 2.3% in the first quarter, while case volume grew 8.4%. The decrease in our sourcing net revenues was primarily driven by the adverse effects of heavy rains in Florida impacting the vegetable crops, which is a high volume and key category for us. This is a category where a high percentage of our business is contracted, and we had to source produce from the West Coast to offset the lost crops. And we had a much higher cost of goods for that West Coast product. We don't expect this issue to carry forward into the second quarter. So that's a look at the performance on our various services for the quarter. 
I will now transition to Slide 11 and our summarized income statement. Income from operations increased 9.4% in the first quarter, and as a percent of net revenues was 35.3%, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter. For the seventh quarter in a row, we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of expenses. Personnel expenses were up 8.8% in the quarter. The increase in personnel expenses was driven primarily by a 5.6% increase in headcount and an additional payroll tax expense in the first quarter of 2016 of approximately $2.6 million. This expense is related to the delivery of previously vested restricted equity awards. It is a onetime event for the year. A good portion of our personal expenses continue to be variable based on the financial performance of our businesses. Other SG&A expense decreased 1.3%. This decrease was driven by a lower provision for bad debt as a result of lower receivables in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in travel expenses.
Moving to Slide 12 and other financial information. We had another very strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $104 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $17.8 million in the first quarter. This increased compared to last year, as a result of costs associated with the building of our second data center. We expect capital expenditures for 2016 to be between $60 million and $80 million with the majority of that going to the data center and technology. We finished the quarter with $970 million in debt and just under $180 million in cash. 
And finally, before turning it back to John on Slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $117 million to shareholders in the quarter with approximately $64 million coming in the form of dividends, approximately $21 million coming in the form of share repurchases. And we also had shares withheld upon delivery of previously vested restricted equity. That totaled approximately $32 million. 
Again, thank you to everyone at Robinson for a solid first quarter. And thank you all as well for listening in. With that, I'll turn it back to John to make some closing comments."

With regards to wrap-up comments on Slide 14, you can see our bullet points there and kind of sticking to form in past calls, what we want to do is just really share what we're seeing currently in the marketplace as well as where we're investing and",1043,"Okay. With regards to wrap-up comments on Slide 14, you can see our bullet points there and kind of sticking to form in past calls, what we want to do is just really share what we're seeing currently in the marketplace as well as where we're investing and what's on our minds with regards to our company and how we're approaching the marketplace. 
The first bullet point, our April to date total company net revenue growth rate per day is approximately 6% when compared to April last year. Andy commented that the end of March or in April, we continue to see some softening in demand in the marketplace. And you see that in our overall net revenue growth in April that the demand in the marketplace remains fairly soft. The North American truckload volume growth thus far in April is around 2% compared to the 4% in the first quarter of 2016. 
With regards to the second bullet point, again we already mentioned the contractual bid activity. It's normal activity for us that in the fourth quarter and first quarter of any typical year that we would see some elevated level of activity. As Andy mentioned, that activity was more robust than normal. It'd be very expected in a softening market, the price declines that we referenced that you would see increased bid activity by shippers. That's normal behavior in a softening market. We do believe the lion's share of that has passed, and that bid activity is more -- at more normal seasonal levels when we come into the second quarter of 2016. 
Kind of tying into that bullet point 3, the North American truck market continues to have a high level of available capacity. We have currently continue to see a soft market with a lot of available truckload capacity. And that's the continuation of the business trends that Andy described with pricing moving down and the cost of higher decreasing with that. 
So that's what we're seeing from a current marketplace standpoint. There's a few more questions that we'll get into that we'll expand on some of that. But before we jump to the Q&A session, I would like to just talk about strategy update and our investment priorities that we continue to focus on at Robinson. People, process and technology is the phrase and the line that we've used for many decades around how we think about our business. I just want to reiterate that we continue to think that is absolutely what drives the competitive advantage and success of our business. 
From a people standpoint, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we are hiring. We are continuing to invest in our network and we continue to believe that our team of people at Robinson is a very important competitive advantage and will be our #1 priority. 
From a process standpoint, we have a lot of initiatives across the company around business process improvement, network transformation, how we share freight, how we consolidate, deconsolidate. A lot of those things are supporting some of the growth numbers that Andy walked us through. And that will continue to be part of our approach to innovation on how we look at improving things for both our shipper and carrier partners and how we're working in the marketplace. Technology, our Navisphere technology platform, that one global instance of how we go to market and how we provide our services and integrate them where appropriate, again continues to be something that we believe is a competitive advantage and that we're spending significant amounts of money to continue to enhance. There are some questions that get a little more specific around where we're investing in the technology area and what we're doing. So I won't go into that now. But again, just important to understand that, that approach to being an asset-free high return on invested capital, people process and technology-focused business is as alive as it has ever been at Robinson. And we believe it's working and will continue to drive our success in the future. 
Bullet point 2, expanding and optimizing our global network. While we're proud of our global footprint and it's changing every day, we also acknowledge that it's a significant growth opportunity for us to expand in parts of the world where we don't currently have a presence in our network today. We do have plans to open offices in Europe and Asia that will expand our geographic footprint. There are other parts of the world where we don't have a presence and work through agents that we think we can continue to grow, as well as optimizing. When we talk about expanding and optimizing, it's hitting on both the growth and efficiency part of how we think about our network that as proud as we are on how we can execute, we have a long list of opportunities that we think we can optimize our global network and continue to improve the outcomes for our business partners as well as our results. So expanding and optimizing our global network continues to be a strategic imperative that we think has a lot of upside in it to continue to both grow our business and make it more effective. 
And lastly, select M&A opportunities. You've heard us talk before about our plan and our approach to the marketplace is to aggressively look at M&A opportunities, but to have what we consider a very high filter in terms of the business model fit and the cultural compatibility of the types of organizations that we want to add to the Robinson network. We're carrying on with that approach, and we continue to feel that we will be able to add value in the future by finding the right selective M&A deals that come to us with the right level of compatibility and fit into our network. 
So those are the sort of top-of-mind thoughts around the strategic imperatives that we're working on and what we're seeing currently in the marketplace to wrap things up. So I'll finish there with just, one more time, reiterating that we're very happy with the results. We're happy with the execution of the team. And we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the earnings call."

As most of you who are familiar with us know that if you go back a decade or more",618,"I think this is a really important question in terms of understanding how our business has evolved over time and how it may likely perform in future marketplaces or cycles. As most of you who are familiar with us know that if you go back a decade or more into the past, that we were very focused on transactional brokerage services and approaching the market with very fluid activity around changing prices and changing volume activity in the marketplace. Over the last decade -- plus it's been longer than that. But for sure, in the last decade, one of the longer-term trends in our business is a much greater concentration of committed or contractual freight commitments with our customers. We've talked in the past about each customer's contracting process and the definition of committed freight, contracted freight, awarded freight, a lot of the terminology that you would use to display the success of results in those bids. The challenge in it is that there's variances and nuances to all of them. I think it is useful to aggregate the concept and talk about our universe of contracted freight. And it clearly has increased over the last decade. We're going from being a small percentage of our business more than a decade ago to today, the best that we can quantify. It is somewhere north of 50%, probably closer to 60% or 65% of our activity that we're moving in Q1 of 2016 was under some sort of a contracted price arrangement or bid result that we've worked with, with our large shippers. It is true that in the past, along the lines of the question, that we worried a little bit less about what was happening in the freight cycles and the expansion and contraction of the pricing because in a more transactional world, we could just plan on aggressively selling and taking market share to get that transactional freight and kind of grow through all cycles. As we have become more concentrated and committed in contracted freight and as we've become a much larger entity with $13 billion of revenue rather than $1 billion or $2 billion of revenue, mixing that in with the changing market conditions where we have an economy that's less robust and shippers who are managing their supply chains a lot different than they may be were a decade ago with regards to their tolerance for expedited charges or transactional premiums and probably managing their inventories much more aggressively today than they were a decade plus ago and then mixing in just the impact of technology and the competitive landscape. There is a difference, I think, in terms of how Robinson will perform in different cycles. There were a lot of questions around what happens when the market starts to tighten and our contractual commitments potentially create more margin pressure for us when the cost of hire starts to increase and it can take a while to pass through those contractual commitments. In the current environment, what that would mean is that we have a higher percentage, a higher concentration of committed relationships that we're going to have to work through and reprise. And there could be some delay with that. And at times, the transactional market just hasn't been as robust as it has in the past. So who knows, each market seems to be a little bit unique and a little bit different. Like I said, there's 1 million little nuances and variances around each of these relationships. But I do think, as you think forward and analyze our results, that is an important part of understanding our go-to-market and our current mix of business and how those results might happen."

I would expect the headcount rate of growth is somewhat moderated as we go through the remainder of the year. But we talk a lot about people, process, technology. And I'll cite a very specific example of why we've invested -- have and continue to invest in talented people. So we mentioned Microsoft and our ability to manage our global supply chain. So it requires a state-of-the-art global technology platform, which we've made a lot of great investments in. And we continue to hire IT people to not only program that, but enhance that. And then you take and marry that up with really talented logistics professionals not just based here in North America, but based throughout the world that are managing one of the largest technology global supply chain. And so kind of -- maybe also to answer another question around the organization, the technology that goes into that. If a technology company is very clearly saying that we value your technology, but we also value the talent and the people that you have and the processes that you run help us manage our global supply chain across all modes, across all regions. As to -- as I mentioned earlier, for 7 quarters in a row, we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of our operating expenses. And clearly, a portion of that is driven by the fact that our compensation, personnel expenses, there's a good portion of that, that's variable. So we were rewarded on a variable basis for the performance of the business. So I would tell you, it doesn't always work out that way. But all of us are focused. Every person in this company is focused on growing net revenues in excess of operating expenses."

It gets challenging.

Some of that new customer wins are the result of cross-selling, and we talk a lot about that, talked a lot about the success of global forwarding, surface transportation and surface transportation to global forwarding. So we're really pleased with the work that we're doing there, but part of it is also just the global forwarding team going out and sourcing new business across the globe.

It's one of the areas of the business that we're very excited about. The pipeline looks very good, and we think we have a lot of upside there. The customer contracts and relationships are also longer term than in the freight business, so that gives us kind of greater assurance to that. It's sustainable from that standpoint. It's a good add-on to ask how this revenue stream helps the other areas of the business because, to some degree, a lot of those services are premised around independents that we are creating firewalls and separating information and providing a lot of those other logistic services with complete independence from any provider including the Robinson freight networks. However, when you think about Robinson expanding its relationships and services around more complex supply chain perspectives, it's important from a number of reasons: One, our technology solution really encompasses the capabilities to do a lot of things. So it just, it really helps broaden our minds and our cultural -- our capabilities around execution. Beyond that, there's a very important cultural thing, too, that when you strengthen your relationships and your trust level with customers and you understand their supply chain challenges and are able to look at their business more holistically, it absolutely helps you be a more intelligent provider and helps you to bid more intelligently on independent opportunities. An example being if a customer has significant inventory management initiatives and we're working with them from a supply chain standpoint to really better understand their movements and their inventory levels, we also know that on the freight side, there probably are opportunities around consolidation and deconsolidation that, while separately priced and executed, are an important part of achieving some of those strategies. So it's part of a cultural thing of expanding our mindset, expanding our account managers' capabilities, expanding our technology platform. And from a go-to-market standpoint, very often, the services are very independent in terms of how they're priced and achieved."

It gets more and more dangerous to try to describe what's normal or typical or expect to happen. From a long-term perspective, a typical pattern in our transportation business was that years would begin in January and February with a lot less demand and greater margins in the marketplace. And then as the spring season would come, particularly with our concentration in produce and a lot of activity ramping up, that we often talked in the past about how it would be normal that margins would compress a little bit moving into the spring and comparing to kind of softer January, February seasons. Over the past several years, there's been a lot of change in the marketplace that we've talked about, a lot of change in the mix of our business around the length of haul, changes in fuel prices, some of the things that Andy highlighted that can have a pretty important impact on those margins. And then add to that some of the weather impacts that we've seen over the last couple of years, where there's been a pretty material movement on the market. So it's all that, that kind of makes us nervous to kind of forecast or guide to where we think margins are going to go.

And we think that it actually mirrors kind of our philosophy that there are still good buyers. There are still quality buyers and sellers out there, but both are being more selective.

Our focus, as we've often talked about is, with the multimodal shipper where freight moves between truck and rail opportunities. And our primary go-to-market strategy has been to make sure that those customers that want to and are able to take advantage of intermodal savings and service offerings that we're exposing that to them and making sure that our customers are getting the benefit of a multimodal approach. We feel like we're very good at that. And we've executed on it well over the years and have become a very significant transactional intermodal provider in the network. We work with our rail partners to adjust to the market conditions and help them go after market share when they want to do that. And we sacrifice market share when pricing, and market conditions dictate that as you go back the other way. So we feel good about kind of that core offering that we've been doing for several decades. The limitation with that, obviously, is that a high percentage of the intermodal freight that moves on the rails is more committed or more contractual freight. And we've acknowledged in the past that we are subscale on some of that. And without our own dedicated asset commitments and contractual pricing for some of the line-haul services, there are situations where we're not competitive on some of the more committed or contractual activities. We have been, for several years and we will continue going forward, to try to strengthen our presence in committed or contracted relationships by investing in limited amounts of assets where that's appropriate, by partnering with our rails to make sure that they understand and want the types of opportunities that we're bringing to them and by continuing to enhance our Navisphere system to make sure that it provides value to shippers and that we continue very high service levels regardless of what type of intermodal freight we're working on. So we do have plans to continue to diversify our presence in intermodal. We are open to investments or acquisitions, as we've said many times in the past, but it sort of comes down from a standpoint of, if we're going to experience these ups and downs in our growth rate as long as we're primarily a transactional provider. And we do need to continue to focus on a broader presence with more committed relationships. We had a little bit of success with that the last few years. You don't see it over the last couple of quarters because of the significant changes in the transactional marketplace. But we do have some optimism about what we think we can achieve in the future there."

It has been our view and remains our view that, over time, all those costs pass through and will normalize and that it's not something that we necessarily fear or think is going to create any sort of permanent material shifts in the landscape of who's competitive or what happens. It does, however, add some pressure around how and when those costs get added, who adds them, when and exactly how and when they get put into the rates? When you combine the sort of normal capitalistic turn of supply and demand and the fact that carriers are always kind of coming and going in a very fragmented marketplace, yes, probably the soft market probably adds some pressure to how and when people recover the incremental cost that ELDs will drive over time. And the fact that some carriers have had them for a while and others need to add them, it certainly can -- there's some dynamic there that's probably real. But from our standpoint, with each of these cost drivers and regulatory type changes, they're sort of hard to understand and try to quantify the impact when they come. But they all seem to work their way into the marketplace without any major reorganization of what's happening."

I think we've shared in the past that when we analyzed that over time, we actually feel very comfortable with our committed relationships on both the shipper side and the carrier side that those increases have been very similar overall a longer period of time. They just move at different rates, which could have an impact. So if you strip that out and just say, ""Hey, what's the longer-term secular challenges around growing market share and expanding the 3PL presence in both truckload and LTL?"" That comes back to kind of some of our core value-added things and I talked about in my prepared comments. We think when we have better people and better account managers that bring insight into those relationships, when we have a better business process for consolidating and deconsolidating, when we have better analytics, when we have better information and a better system that helps customers manage their freight better and understand their costs and go to market more effectively, those are all things that drive the long-term value. So staying competitive and evolving our competitive advantages and all of those kind of core competency areas are what gives us the confidence and gives us the focus of how we'll continue to take share across both the TL and LTL segment. And at the same time, we -- like I mentioned many times at this call, we've got to work through those contraction and expansion cycles on pricing and margins to make sure that we're adapting the market conditions and helping our partners do the same."

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the time to listen to our Q1 call. I want to start my prepared comments by talking a little bit about Freightquote. As you may recall, that acquisition was completed on January 1, 2015.",786,"Okay. Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the time to listen to our Q1 call. I want to start my prepared comments by talking a little bit about Freightquote. As you may recall, that acquisition was completed on January 1, 2015. So last year during our quarterly earnings calls, we were continuously highlighting the impact of Freightquote and making certain that the impact of that material acquisition was understood. 
As of January 1, 2016, we've lapped a full year comparison of Freightquote, so the results and the schedules that we'll be walking through today represent purely organic growth and comparisons year-over-year that include Freightquote. Again, as you may recall, our plan is that we're managing Freightquote as a separate brand within the C.H. Robinson LTL business so that we will continue to reference Freightquote and Freightquote results but they are included in our overall LTL performance. When Andy gets to that, you'll also see that our overall LTL performance has been good and that one of the things that we do pride ourselves in and try to stay focused on is when we complete acquisitions like that, that both our legacy business as well as the new business improves and continues to grow at an acceptable rate. So we continue to feel very positive about the Freightquote acquisition. It will get a little less visibility just because the lapping of the year, but we feel very positive about that investment and now incorporating it into our LTL business. 
So with that, back to Slide 3 and looking at our overall results for Q1 of 2016. Our total revenues declined 6.9% to just a little over $3 billion. The headlines in the total revenues are the decline in fuel prices as well as the decline in the pricing of most of our services, which we'll walk through by area. Total net revenues for the quarter increased 7.3%. The story there is while there were price decreases, we did have volume increases in most of our services as well as margin expansion, which we'll talk quite a bit about. 
Income from operations for the quarter, $198.9 million or an increase of 9.4% over last year. You can see down below in the metrics, our average headcount for the quarter increased 5.5% over the year as well too. When we think about our business from a headline standpoint, we are investing in talent, but we also feel very good about the productivity levels and the efficiency levels that we're operating at. We also had very good expense management in the quarter that Andy will talk through as well, too. So you'll see income from operations growing faster than net revenue, which is our hope. 
From an earnings per share standpoint, $0.83 for the quarter compared to $0.73 last year or a 13.7% increase, and that also goes with the weighted average shares below that to a decrease of 2% or 143 million shares outstanding. As has been our plan for a while, we continue to invest in share repurchases and capital management strategies that have helped us achieve our plan of growing our EPS slightly faster than our net income or income from operations, which did happen again in this quarter. 
So those are the kind of the headline financial metrics for the quarter. Overall, we feel very good about them. Our business continues to perform very well, and our team is engaged in doing a great job across our network. So that's a positive thing and we feel very good about the overall results. 
In terms of, I guess, the other headline, before I turn it over to Andy. Obviously you'll see and I had a lot of the discussion over the past few quarters, that we are now 2 years or 8 consecutive quarters into overall transportation margin expansion. We'll try to help you understand kind of by area where that's happening and what our thoughts are. Again, it gets very difficult to predict the market conditions and where those things might go. But we definitely have had a nice run of margin expansion and favorable margin conditions where that has helped our net revenue growth and our results. 
As we've talked for decades, we view it as our primary job to really help our customers and carrier partners understand the market conditions and manage through those cycles with the right level of execution of service performance. And we continue to feel very good about how we're positioned with that. So those are the overall financial metrics and headline messages that I would share with you. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Andy to walk through our results by service area."
368470,330918078,964376,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and thank you all for listening in. Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to follow up on John comments and commend the Robinson team. Our network continues to perform at a high level, serving both customers and suppliers",1657,"Thank you, John, and thank you all for listening in. Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to follow up on John comments and commend the Robinson team. 
Our network continues to perform at a high level, serving both customers and suppliers. The great results are what happens when talented people work together. In 2016, we've had many customer awards recognizing our performance as a top logistics provider to prominent companies like Walmart, Coke, Dollar General, Ocean Spray, Home Shopping Network and Brose North America. These awards are a great example of how our team is adding value with the customers. 
The macro environment remains sluggish. Despite that, we were able to grow our volumes in nearly all services in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on profitably taking market share in this softer environment. The market conditions in the second quarter remained pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. 
And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. Transportation net revenue increased 7.9% to $534 million in the quarter. The drivers for this increase were truckload, less-than-truckload, global forwarding and managed services. First quarter transportation net revenue margin increased 290 basis points to 19.7%. The breakout of the various factors for this change in margin were fuel, which represented an approximate 90 basis point impact. Lower purchase transportation cost in truckload represented approximately 130 basis points and the impact of higher-margin businesses and global forwarding and managed services represented the remaining increase. 
The first quarter is continued evidence of the cyclicality of our industry. The market has had some swings in purchase transportation costs and customer pricing over the past couple of years. And while it is always difficult to predict what lies ahead, we know that the comparisons from last year get more challenging as the year goes on. 
To our truckload results on Slide 5. We had another good quarter in our truckload business, growing net revenues 7.8% and North American truckload volume increasing 4% in the quarter. In North America, the line-haul price per mile to our customers, excluding the impact of fuel, was down 5% on a year-over-year basis, while the cost paid to carriers decreased approximately 7%. Similar to the fourth quarter, we continue to see weak spot market pricing when compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the last 3 quarters, the price to shippers and the price to carriers has been down on a year-over-year basis. 
Our volume growth in the quarter came from our contractual business, which was up double digits. However, as you would expect, transactional volume was down double digits on a year-over-year basis. The spot market environment was tepid in the latter part of March and that trend has continued during the first few weeks of April. We received a lot of questions from investors about bid activity. Our bid activity increased on a year-over-year basis in both the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as the first quarter of 2016. We have seen that bid activity normalize here in the second quarter, and we expect that we will see a more typical cadence for the remainder of the year. It is difficult to quantify the year-over-year variance in the bid outcomes, but we believe that the results of our recent bid awards has pricing flat to down slightly versus last year's pricing in our contractual awards. 
Our carrier services team and people in the network had another great quarter adding new carriers to C.H. Robinson. We added over 2,600 new carriers in the first quarter, and those carriers moved approximately 17,000 loads. We also continue to see big increases in our connectivity with this carrier base as we surpass 50% in automated updates with carriers for the first time during the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 6 and the less-than-truckload results. As John mentioned, we continue to be very happy with the results in our less-than-truckload business with net revenues increasing 6.9% and volumes increasing 10%. The LTL business continues to perform well, and the addition of Freightquote is helping us win more often in the smaller shipper segment. Customer pricing remained flat in the quarter and the results of bid pricing in our contractual business is a bit stronger than in the truckload segment as we are seeing low single-digit increases in contractual bid responses. We continue to build on our industry-leading position as the largest third-party provider of LTL services in North America, and that value proposition is winning across all verticals. 
Transitioning to our intermodal slide results on Page 7. Intermodal net revenue increased -- decreased, pardon me, 11.9% in the first quarter with volumes down 13%. Results have been challenging for the past several quarters as market conditions have lessened the demand for rail services amongst our customer portfolio. We had approximately 2,000 customers in our intermodal business in this year's first quarter as compared to nearly 2,500 last year. Most of these lost customers were transactional shippers as our business with our larger customers remain steady. 
Transitioning to Slide 8. We had a strong first quarter in the global forwarding business. Net revenue increased 8.3% for the combined services. Ocean net revenues increased 16.9% with volumes increasing approximately 8%. Air net revenues declined 10.8% as a result of significantly lower pricing versus last year's first quarter. However, we had strong volume growth in air with a 13% increase in our shipment count. Customs net revenue increased 4.5% in the quarter. We continue to see good results from our cross-selling efforts between global forwarding and surface transportation services and are seeing an increasing number of opportunities to leverage our full portfolio to assist our customers with their global supply chains. We have talked a lot over the past couple of years about the successful integration of Phoenix International and the strength of our larger business. We are operating in one global system allowing us to focus on growth and efficiency. All global forwarding regions and services are now profitable and we continue to be recognized by our customers for our services. Our global forwarding team is well positioned to continue to build on these great results.
Moving on to other logistics services on Slide 9. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 21.4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Managed services, primarily our TMS offering branded TMC, performed extremely well with strong net revenue growth being the primary driver of the first quarter increase. In the first quarter, we implemented the North American phase of the TMC global control tower from Microsoft. We have already implemented in Vietnam, China, Brazil, Europe and Latin America. Our technology platform will support all of their modes of transport for all regions around the world. The managed services pipeline continues to expand rapidly, and we expect this service to continue to grow nicely throughout the year.
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 10. Our sourcing net revenues decreased 2.3% in the first quarter, while case volume grew 8.4%. The decrease in our sourcing net revenues was primarily driven by the adverse effects of heavy rains in Florida impacting the vegetable crops, which is a high volume and key category for us. This is a category where a high percentage of our business is contracted, and we had to source produce from the West Coast to offset the lost crops. And we had a much higher cost of goods for that West Coast product. We don't expect this issue to carry forward into the second quarter. So that's a look at the performance on our various services for the quarter. 
I will now transition to Slide 11 and our summarized income statement. Income from operations increased 9.4% in the first quarter, and as a percent of net revenues was 35.3%, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter. For the seventh quarter in a row, we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of expenses. Personnel expenses were up 8.8% in the quarter. The increase in personnel expenses was driven primarily by a 5.6% increase in headcount and an additional payroll tax expense in the first quarter of 2016 of approximately $2.6 million. This expense is related to the delivery of previously vested restricted equity awards. It is a onetime event for the year. A good portion of our personal expenses continue to be variable based on the financial performance of our businesses. Other SG&A expense decreased 1.3%. This decrease was driven by a lower provision for bad debt as a result of lower receivables in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in travel expenses.
Moving to Slide 12 and other financial information. We had another very strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $104 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $17.8 million in the first quarter. This increased compared to last year, as a result of costs associated with the building of our second data center. We expect capital expenditures for 2016 to be between $60 million and $80 million with the majority of that going to the data center and technology. We finished the quarter with $970 million in debt and just under $180 million in cash. 
And finally, before turning it back to John on Slide 13 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $117 million to shareholders in the quarter with approximately $64 million coming in the form of dividends, approximately $21 million coming in the form of share repurchases. And we also had shares withheld upon delivery of previously vested restricted equity. That totaled approximately $32 million. 
Again, thank you to everyone at Robinson for a solid first quarter. And thank you all as well for listening in. With that, I'll turn it back to John to make some closing comments."

With regards to wrap-up comments on Slide 14, you can see our bullet points there and kind of sticking to form in past calls, what we want to do is just really share what we're seeing currently in the marketplace as well as where we're investing and",1043,"Okay. With regards to wrap-up comments on Slide 14, you can see our bullet points there and kind of sticking to form in past calls, what we want to do is just really share what we're seeing currently in the marketplace as well as where we're investing and what's on our minds with regards to our company and how we're approaching the marketplace. 
The first bullet point, our April to date total company net revenue growth rate per day is approximately 6% when compared to April last year. Andy commented that the end of March or in April, we continue to see some softening in demand in the marketplace. And you see that in our overall net revenue growth in April that the demand in the marketplace remains fairly soft. The North American truckload volume growth thus far in April is around 2% compared to the 4% in the first quarter of 2016. 
With regards to the second bullet point, again we already mentioned the contractual bid activity. It's normal activity for us that in the fourth quarter and first quarter of any typical year that we would see some elevated level of activity. As Andy mentioned, that activity was more robust than normal. It'd be very expected in a softening market, the price declines that we referenced that you would see increased bid activity by shippers. That's normal behavior in a softening market. We do believe the lion's share of that has passed, and that bid activity is more -- at more normal seasonal levels when we come into the second quarter of 2016. 
Kind of tying into that bullet point 3, the North American truck market continues to have a high level of available capacity. We have currently continue to see a soft market with a lot of available truckload capacity. And that's the continuation of the business trends that Andy described with pricing moving down and the cost of hire decreasing with that. 
So that's what we're seeing from a current marketplace standpoint. There's a few more questions that we'll get into that we'll expand on some of that. But before we jump to the Q&A session, I would like to just talk about strategy update and our investment priorities that we continue to focus on at Robinson. People, process and technology is the phrase and the line that we've used for many decades around how we think about our business. I just want to reiterate that we continue to think that is absolutely what drives the competitive advantage and success of our business. 
From a people standpoint, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we are hiring. We are continuing to invest in our network and we continue to believe that our team of people at Robinson is a very important competitive advantage and will be our #1 priority. 
From a process standpoint, we have a lot of initiatives across the company around business process improvement, network transformation, how we share freight, how we consolidate, deconsolidate. A lot of those things are supporting some of the growth numbers that Andy walked us through. And that will continue to be part of our approach to innovation on how we look at improving things for both our shipper and carrier partners and how we're working in the marketplace. Technology, our Navisphere technology platform, that one global instance of how we go to market and how we provide our services and integrate them where appropriate, again continues to be something that we believe is a competitive advantage and that we're spending significant amounts of money to continue to enhance. There are some questions that get a little more specific around where we're investing in the technology area and what we're doing. So I won't go into that now. But again, just important to understand that, that approach to being an asset-free high return on invested capital, people process and technology-focused business is as alive as it has ever been at Robinson. And we believe it's working and will continue to drive our success in the future. 
Bullet point 2, expanding and optimizing our global network. While we're proud of our global footprint and it's changing every day, we also acknowledge that it's a significant growth opportunity for us to expand in parts of the world where we don't currently have a presence in our network today. We do have plans to open offices in Europe and Asia that will expand our geographic footprint. There are other parts of the world where we don't have a presence and work through agents that we think we can continue to grow, as well as optimizing. When we talk about expanding and optimizing, it's hitting on both the growth and efficiency part of how we think about our network that as proud as we are on how we can execute, we have a long list of opportunities that we think we can optimize our global network and continue to improve the outcomes for our business partners as well as our results. So expanding and optimizing our global network continues to be a strategic imperative that we think has a lot of upside in it to continue to both grow our business and make it more effective. 
And lastly, select M&A opportunities. You've heard us talk before about our plan and our approach to the marketplace is to aggressively look at M&A opportunities, but to have what we consider a very high filter in terms of the business model fit and the cultural compatibility of the types of organizations that we want to add to the Robinson network. We're carrying on with that approach, and we continue to feel that we will be able to add value in the future by finding the right selective M&A deals that come to us with the right level of compatibility and fit into our network. 
So those are the sort of top-of-mind thoughts around the strategic imperatives that we're working on and what we're seeing currently in the marketplace to wrap things up. So I'll finish there with just, one more time, reiterating that we're very happy with the results. We're happy with the execution of the team. And we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the earnings call."

So Robinson is participating in more bids on a year-over-year basis as our people out are selling and taking market share. So it's not that the bids -- we're continuing to grow the amount. It's just the rate in which they had increased in the -- versus the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year is more normalized to a normal rate of increase."

As most of you who are familiar with us know that if you go back a decade or more",618,"I think this is a really important question in terms of understanding how our business has evolved over time and how it may likely perform in future marketplaces or cycles. As most of you who are familiar with us know that if you go back a decade or more into the past, that we were very focused on transactional brokerage services and approaching the market with very fluid activity around changing prices and changing volume activity in the marketplace. Over the last decade -- plus it's been longer than that. But for sure, in the last decade, one of the longer-term trends in our business is a much greater concentration of committed or contractual freight commitments with our customers. We've talked in the past about each customer's contracting process and the definition of committed freight, contracted freight, awarded freight, a lot of the terminology that you would use to display the success of results in those bids. The challenge in it is that there's variances and nuances to all of them. I think it is useful to aggregate the concept and talk about our universe of contracted freight. And it clearly has increased over the last decade. We're going from being a small percentage of our business more than a decade ago to today, the best that we can quantify. It is somewhere north of 50%, probably closer to 60% or 65% of our activity that we're moving in Q1 of 2016 was under some sort of a contracted price arrangement or bid result that we've worked with, with our large shippers. It is true that in the past, along the lines of the question, that we worried a little bit less about what was happening in the freight cycles and the expansion and contraction of the pricing because in a more transactional world, we could just plan on aggressively selling and taking market share to get that transactional freight and kind of grow through all cycles. As we have become more concentrated and committed in contracted freight and as we've become a much larger entity with $13 billion of revenue rather than $1 billion or $2 billion of revenue, mixing that in with the changing market conditions where we have an economy that's less robust and shippers who are managing their supply chains a lot different than they may be were a decade ago with regards to their tolerance for expedited charges or transactional premiums and probably managing their inventories much more aggressively today than they were a decade plus ago and then mixing in just the impact of technology and the competitive landscape. There is a difference, I think, in terms of how Robinson will perform in different cycles. There were a lot of questions around what happens when the market starts to tighten and our contractual commitments potentially create more margin pressure for us when the cost of hire starts to increase and it can take a while to pass through those contractual commitments. In the current environment, what that would mean is that we have a higher percentage, a higher concentration of committed relationships that we're going to have to work through and reprice. And there could be some delay with that. And at times, the transactional market just hasn't been as robust as it has in the past. So who knows, each market seems to be a little bit unique and a little bit different. Like I said, there's 1 million little nuances and variances around each of these relationships. But I do think, as you think forward and analyze our results, that is an important part of understanding our go-to-market and our current mix of business and how those results might happen."

And I'll cite a very specific example of why we've invested -- have and continue to invest in talented people. So we mentioned Microsoft and our ability to manage our global supply chain. So it requires a state-of-the-art global technology platform, which we've made a lot of great investments in. And we continue to hire IT people to not only program that, but enhance that. And then you take and marry that up with really talented logistics professionals not just based here in North America, but based throughout the world that are managing one of the largest technology global supply chain. And so kind of -- maybe also to answer another question around the organization, the technology that goes into that. You have a technology company is very clearly saying that we value your technology, but we also value the talent and the people that you have and the processes that you run help us manage our global supply chain across all modes, across all regions. As to -- as I mentioned earlier, for 7 quarters in a row, we've been able to grow net revenue in excess of our operating expenses. And clearly, a portion of that is driven by the fact that our compensation, personnel expenses, there's a good portion of that, that's variable. So we were rewarded on a variable basis for the performance of the business. So I would tell you, it doesn't always work out that way. But all of us are focused.

So you can look at that 2 ways, I guess, in terms of last April on an organic basis being an easier comparison, or you can look at it as last year April started out weak and May and June improved quite a bit as well too. It gets challenging.

Some of that new customer wins are the result of cross-selling, and we talk a lot about that, talked a lot about the success of global forwarding, surface transportation and surface transportation to global forwarding.

It's one of the areas of the business that we're very excited about. The pipeline looks very good, and we think we have a lot of upside there. The customer contracts and relationships are also longer term than in the freight business, so that gives us kind of greater assurance to that. It's sustainable from that standpoint. It's a good add-on to ask how this revenue stream helps the other areas of the business because, to some degree, a lot of those services are premised around independence that we are creating firewalls and separating information and providing a lot of those other logistic services with complete independence from any provider including the Robinson freight networks. However, when you think about Robinson expanding its relationships and services around more complex supply chain perspectives, it's important from a number of reasons: One, our technology solution really encompasses the capabilities to do a lot of things. So it just, it really helps broaden our minds and our cultural -- our capabilities around execution. Beyond that, there's a very important cultural thing, too, that when you strengthen your relationships and your trust level with customers and you understand their supply chain challenges and are able to look at their business more holistically, it absolutely helps you be a more intelligent provider and helps you to bid more intelligently on independent opportunities. An example being if a customer has significant inventory management initiatives and we're working with them from a supply chain standpoint to really better understand their movements and their inventory levels, we also know that on the freight side, there probably are opportunities around consolidation and deconsolidation that, while separately priced and executed, are an important part of achieving some of those strategies. So it's part of a cultural thing of expanding our mindset, expanding our account managers' capabilities, expanding our technology platform. And from a go-to-market standpoint, very often, the services are very independent in terms of how they're priced and achieved."

It gets more and more dangerous to try to describe what's normal or typical or expect to happen. From a long-term perspective, a typical pattern in our transportation business was that years would begin in January and February with a lot less demand and greater margins in the marketplace. And then as the spring season would come, particularly with our concentration in produce and a lot of activity ramping up, that we often talked in the past about how it would be normal that margins would compress a little bit moving into the spring and comparing to kind of softer January, February seasons. Over the past several years, there's been a lot of change in the marketplace that we've talked about, a lot of change in the mix of our business around the length of haul, changes in fuel prices, some of the things that Andy highlighted that can have a pretty important impact on those margins. And then add to that some of the weather impacts that we've seen over the last couple of years, where there's been a pretty material movement on the market. So it's all that, that kind of makes us nervous to kind of forecast or guide to where we think margins are going to go. But there is an element of the freight that does have some kind of normal downward pressure on it from Q1 to Q2 just around seasonality."

Let me start off by just reiterating what we've stated, and quite frankly, what we've executed on in the past, which is we look to deploy capital in ways that create long term and sustainable shareholder value. The filters we use to evaluate deals are pretty rigorous. And as a result, we end up passing on a pretty high percentage of them. The areas that we look to continue to invest in are ones where we think combining companies and cultures makes sense. Global forwarding, Europe, managed services, all present interesting opportunities. But let's not forget about the opportunities that are available in North America Surface Transportation. So yes, we're looking at all those areas. We have a particular focus, but really our filters that we deploy are pretty rigorous. And I guess I would follow up and use John's words to describe the M&A environment, which is it's selective. And we think that it actually mirrors kind of our philosophy that there are still good buyers. There are still quality buyers and sellers out there, but both are being more selective. And maybe that's a result of recent market discipline among companies that have been making acquisitions and making sure -- I think the market is saying, let's make sure you have the right strategy and are able to effectively integrate those deals. And clearly, if you look at what we've done since 2012 with both Phoenix with Freightquote and the like, we've had a pretty successful track record of doing that."

Our focus, as we've often talked about is, with the multimodal shipper where freight moves between truck and rail opportunities. And our primary go-to-market strategy has been to make sure that those customers that want to and are able to take advantage of intermodal savings and service offerings that we're exposing that to them and making sure that our customers are getting the benefit of a multimodal approach. We feel like we're very good at that. And we've executed on it well over the years and have become a very significant transactional intermodal provider in the network. We work with our rail partners to adjust to the market conditions and help them go after market share when they want to do that. And we sacrifice market share when pricing, and market conditions dictate that it should go back the other way. So we feel good about kind of that core offering that we've been doing for several decades. The limitation with that, obviously, is that a high percentage of the intermodal freight that moves on the rails is more committed or more contractual freight. And we've acknowledged in the past that we are subscale on some of that. And without our own dedicated asset commitments and contractual pricing for some of the line-haul services, there are situations where we're not competitive on some of the more committed or contractual activities. We have been, for several years and we will continue going forward, to try to strengthen our presence in committed or contracted relationships by investing in limited amounts of assets where that's appropriate, by partnering with our rails to make sure that they understand and want the types of opportunities that we're bringing to them and by continuing to enhance our Navisphere system to make sure that it provides value to shippers and that we continue very high service levels regardless of what type of intermodal freight we're working on. So we do have plans to continue to diversify our presence in intermodal. We are open to investments or acquisitions, as we've said many times in the past, but it sort of comes down from a standpoint of, if we're going to experience these ups and downs in our growth rate as long as we're primarily a transactional provider. And we do need to continue to focus on a broader presence with more committed relationships. We had a little bit of success with that the last few years. You don't see it over the last couple of quarters because of the significant changes in the transactional marketplace. But we do have some optimism about what we think we can achieve in the future there."

It has been our view and remains our view that, over time, all those costs pass through and will normalize and that it's not something that we necessarily fear or think is going to create any sort of permanent material shifts in the landscape of who's competitive or what happens. It does, however, add some pressure around how and when those costs get added, who adds them, when and exactly how and when they get put into the rates? When you combine the sort of normal capitalistic turn of supply and demand and the fact that carriers are always kind of coming and going in a very fragmented marketplace, yes, probably the soft market probably adds some pressure to how and when people recover the incremental cost that ELDs will drive over time. And the fact that some carriers have had them for a while and others need to add them, it certainly can -- there's some dynamic there that's probably real. But from our standpoint, with each of these cost drivers and regulatory type changes, they're sort of hard to understand and try to quantify the impact when they come. But they all seem to work their way into the marketplace without any major reorganization of what's happening."

I think we've shared in the past that when we analyzed that over time, we actually feel very comfortable with our committed relationships on both the shipper side and the carrier side that those increases have been very similar overall a longer period of time. They just move at different rates, which could have an impact. So if you strip that out and just say, ""Hey, what's the longer-term secular challenges around growing market share and expanding the 3PL presence in both truckload and LTL?"" That comes back to kind of some of our core value-added things and I talked about in my prepared comments. We think when we have better people and better account managers that bring insight into those relationships, when we have a better business process for consolidating and deconsolidating, when we have better analytics, when we have better information and a better system that helps customers manage their freight better and understand their costs and go to market more effectively, those are all things that drive the long-term value. So staying competitive and evolving our competitive advantages in all of those kind of core competency areas are what gives us the confidence and gives us the focus of how we'll continue to take share across both the TL and LTL segment.

Similar to past quarters, I'd like to start our prepared comments by highlighting some of the key financial metrics. Total revenues decreased 6.9% in the second quarter. The decrease in total revenues was primarily the result of lower pricing in the truckload, air and ocean services. Lower fuel prices on a year-over-year basis was again impactful to the reduced pricing. Net revenues increased 1.7% to $594 million in the second quarter. Net revenue growth slowed as the quarter progressed. Per business day, net revenue growth in each of the months was 9%, 0% and negative 3% for April through June. The primary reason for the sequential results was the fact that the change in truckload pricing and cost per mile crossed over in June and now into July as our price per mile to the customers is going down more than our cost on a year-over-year basis. Andy will talk more to this in a few slides. 
Though net revenue slowed compared with the past several quarters, our network performed well, achieving a 4.3% net income growth and a 6.4% earnings per share increase. We had earnings per share of $1 in the quarter compared to $0.94 last year. EPS of $1.83 for the first 6 months of the year is a 9.6% increase over the first half of 2015. 
In terms of some of the highlights for the second quarter, we were able to take market share as we grew volumes across nearly all of our services. Growing our volumes and taking market share in the various cycles continues to be an important part of our long-term strategy. Serving our customers while adjusting to market changes is a strength of ours. We remain very confident in the strength of our model and the ability to react and succeed. We continue to invest in people, technology and our networks. Our variable expense model is working well. Pay-for-performance programs and effective capital management help us to grow our EPS in challenging environments like this quarter. Our global headcount grew 4.8% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We've often mentioned that headcount will grow in alignment with our activity or volume and this was the case in the second quarter. Our long-term strategy is working and we continue with our initiatives to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. 
With that overview, I'm going to now turn it over to Andy to go through results by service offering."

The Robinson team did a great job of taking market share in the quarter as we increased our global shipment count by over 200,000. We are proud of this statistic as it demonstrates that customers are voting for our services. Volume growth was driven across multiple modes and through several industry verticals, with e-commerce, automotive and telecom being a few of the areas with large increases in volume and net revenue. We continue to receive accolades from our customers and in the industry. As we were recently named the #1 3PL by inbound logistics for the sixth year in a row, we were also named the best logistic provider of air freight at the 2016 Asia Freight Logistics and Supply Chain Awards. These distinctions are a credit to the more than 13,500 Robinson employees across the globe who work every day to help our customers win. 
Though it is a challenging environment, the network continues to connect with more and more companies around the world. During the quarter, we had nearly 20 million web and mobile interactions with customers and carriers. This is a sequential increase of over 30% from the beginning of the year. Transportation net revenues increased 1.5% to $556.5 million in the quarter. Net revenue margin increased 180 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily the result of lower purchase transportation costs including the lower cost of fuel. Additionally, we have seen the mix shift in the type of freight we are moving to the higher-margin businesses and the services we provide. As we have discussed in the past, our net revenue margin is an output and there are many variables that influence it. The second quarter is a good example of that as we saw our net revenue growth slow while the margin increased. As John mentioned, lower pricing in some of our key services makes it more challenging to grow net revenues. 
Moving on to Slide 5. We have taken information that we have been publicly providing since 2008 and put it into a graphical form. Hopefully, it will be additive to the commentary about the secular and cyclical aspects of our business and industry. The light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North America in truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers net of fuel costs over time. The orange line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. There has been a lot of commentary from analysts and transportation providers in regards to the cyclical and secular changes. This visual illustrates in our results that change is a rather constant factor in our business. Part of the value that we bring to customers and carriers is helping them manage the rate of change that occurs. 
When we think about this chart in our business from a secular perspective, there are many factors to consider. One of the most interesting is that during the time period presented, the average price and cost net of fuel have increased approximately 2%. So with all the ups and downs, the truckload pricing has been inflationary. We have talked a lot about the fact that our business has become more committed with now between 50% and 60% of our truckload volume contracted. Both shippers and purchasers of logistics services value our ability to understand the market and manage their transportation spend for their budgeting and planning initiatives. You may notice that the price and cost lines have moved closer together over time. The access to information about pricing and equipment availability has led to faster responses in many ways, which certainly include pricing. We feel like our network has done an excellent job adjusting to the markets and adapting quickly to these changes. 
And finally, the chart illustrates that over the past 8.5 years, we have had nearly an equal number of quarters, where the percent change and purchase transportation cost exceeded the percent change in price and vice versa. These changes are one of the factors that impact margins, which have also varied over time. 
Slide 6 covers our truckload results. Truckload net revenue decreased 1.4% in the second quarter as volumes increased 3%. Pricing was again down in the quarter, as you saw in the previous slide as customer pricing net of fuel decreased 7.5% versus last year's second quarter, and purchase transportation cost net of fuel fell 8%. Truckload market condition changed throughout the quarter, and in June, these lines actually inverted. For the first time in the last 2 years, the percent change in price per mile to carriers decreased less than the percent change cost to customers. For the quarter, our net revenue decreased $0.02 per mile, which is the primary reason our truckload net revenue fell when compared to last year. 
All that being said, there are many positives in the quarter and we achieved 3% truckload volume growth in a market where overall demand was down. We captured more share in June, and thus far in July, we have seen volume growth accelerate. June volumes increased 4%, and to date in July, truckload volume is up 7% on a per-day basis. Kudos to the team for reacting to the current market dynamics. 
Our carrier services team again did another great job by adding 4,400 new carriers in the quarter. This is a record high for us coming off a very successful 2015. These new carriers moved over 25,000 loads. We had nearly 40,000 active carriers in the quarter and we continue to see a lot of diversity in our carrier base. Carriers with less than 100 trucks moved just over 80% of our shipments and larger carriers moved about 20%. So the key indicators for our truckload business in terms of carrier relationships and customers choosing Robinson look very good. We do have some tough comparables in the back half of the year, but we knew that was the case and have been preparing. Our network will focus on servicing our customers and adapting to the market conditions. 
Onto Slide 7 and our less-than-truckload results. Our LTL business had another strong growth quarter. Net revenues increased 9% to just shy of $100 million. Volumes increased 7% when compared to the second quarter of last year. Pricing was down slightly, as one would expect, with fuel being down, and net revenue margins increased again. Temperature control was a standout area as that portion of the LTL business grew 60%. This specialized service has been growing even faster than the overall service line and that team is doing a great job expanding the service within our portfolio of customers. 
We have received a lot of questions about the growth drivers in our truck LTL business. The team and network have made tremendous strides over the past years and the strength of our program centers around: one, our vast carrier network; two, our ability to execute all shipment sizes from parcel to pallets; and probably three, most importantly, our people and technology allow us to optimize and cater the LTL offering to the unique needs of each of our customers. We are able to deliver comprehensive solutions to clients that cover their needs across a broad range from final mile delivery of small packages and parcels to the consolidation and distribution of dry, fresh and frozen products. We are adding new customers in this service line faster than any other in North America, and we expect this trend to continue. We continue to build on our industry-leading position in LTL and feel good about our opportunities going forward. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 8. Intermodal net revenue decreased 21.8% in the quarter as volumes decreased 13%. Net revenue margins decreased in the quarter as a higher percent of our volume is in lower-margin contractual business. The team has worked really hard to grow this service but we are fighting a tough industry trend. Our successes in the quarter came from our committed business as volumes in this area increased as we have been winning some large contractual bids over the past couple of quarters. Those wins, however, have not been enough to offset the losses in transactional volume on a year-over-year basis. The low truckload pricing and available truckload capacity environment will be a headwind for the business into the third quarter. 
Transitioning to Slide 9 in our global forwarding services business. Second quarter net revenue in global forwarding services were $91.8 million, an increase of 2.4% from 2015's second quarter. We are pleased with our cross-selling initiatives as they yielded many new customers and new net revenue. Further, we are proud of maintaining our status as the #1 NVOCC from China to the U.S. Ocean net revenue was up 1.7%, air net revenues increased 2.7% and customs grew 5.8%. During the quarter, ocean shipments increased approximately 6% and air shipments were up 20%, which is a clear indication of our team's strong performance and ability to take market share. Pricing continued to be down in the quarter with total revenue per shipment down over 20% in both ocean and air services. 
Slide 10 covers our other logistics services. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 24% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. TMC, which is our managed services business, represents approximately 60% of the net revenue in this area. TMC net revenue increased 30% in the second quarter and is currently on pace to service over $3 billion in freight under management in 2016. This business is another one of our fast-growing segments. Customers continue to look for new and better ways to execute their supply chains, and TMC is a great example of how we are able to add services to meet the increased demand for outsourced solutions by combining our Navisphere TMS technology and 3PL outsourcing. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 11. Sourcing net revenues increased 5.7% in the second quarter. Congratulations to the entire Robinson fresh team. The net revenue growth was primarily the results of 3% case volume growth across a variety of commodities and services and an increase in net revenue per case. Net revenue margin increased 40 basis points in the quarter which was primarily the result of a change in the mix of commodities and services sold. 
I will now transition to Slide 11 and a review of our summarized income statement. Personnel expenses increased 2.4%, primarily driven by an average headcount growth of 5.2% in the quarter. Our headcount growth is often closely correlated to the activity and volume growth, and this was again the case in the second quarter. As I mentioned in a previous slide, our ability to combine electronic customer and carrier connectivity with talented professionals will continue to allow us to drive productivity improvements. SG&A expenses decreased 0.8% in the second quarter. As John said earlier, the Robinson business model worked well as a reduction in variable compensation and lower SG&A expenses on a year-over-year bases helped us to achieved higher net income growth and net revenue growth which is always our goal. We were also able to convert revenue to profits at a higher rate of 39.3%, a 10% -- pardon me, a 10 basis point improvement from the same period last year. 
Moving on to Slide 13 and other financial information. We had another strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $143 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $26.2 million in the second quarter and $44 million year-to-date. We continue to expect capital expenditures to finish the year between $70 million and $80 million. The increase on a year-over-year basis is the result of the cost associated with the building of our second data center. We finished the quarter with $965 million in debt and $207 million in cash. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, Slide 14 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $88 million to our shareholders in the quarter with $63.6 million in dividends and $23.9 million in share repurchases. Again, thank you very much to everyone at Robinson for a solid second quarter, and thank you all as well for listening in. 
With that, I will now turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions."

Before we move on to the pre-submitted questions, I'll take just a couple of minutes to wrap up with some final comments. Coming end of the year, we plan that we would continue to add to our team and be aggressive going after market share, and that's exactly what we're doing. We're growing our volume in nearly all of our services. As Andy mentioned, our truckload volume growth has increased the past 2 months and is pacing at a 7% per-day business increase in July. Europe's growth in both service transportation and global forwarding is accelerating. The Freightquote team continues to perform well and deliver strong results. Our outsource services, including TMC, are delivering consistent double-digit growth. There are a lot of bright spots across our business, and we feel good about how we are executing and our long-term opportunities for growth. 
Our July-to-date total company net revenue has decreased approximately 2% per business day. This decrease is primarily the result of lower net revenue per shipment in the truckload service line. Andy's comments covered what we're seeing in truckload pricing. We also know that the truckload net revenue margins for the second half of 2015 were on the high sight of our historic ranges, making for challenging comparisons. 
As I shared in my opening comments, we pride ourselves on maintaining great execution while we adjust to the market cycles. However, net revenue growth in truckload services is more challenging in this environment. 
If you look at our historical performance, we've been very consistent at delivering EPS growth that approximate or exceeds our net revenue growth. We achieve this through variable cost, productivity gains and efficient capital management. We continue to focus on all of these components of our business model as we believe this is the right combination to motivate our team, serve customers and carriers more efficiently and create shareholder value. 
With that, we'll now move to the Q&A part of our call."

I believe that's up 7, up 5, up 8 so that from a comparability standpoint, July is probably fairly typical of what we're going to see in the third quarter from a comparison standpoint. In Andy and in my prepared comments, we talked about that chart that we added and the fact that volumes have accelerated during the months of June and July and that with that has come the margin compression and the turn in those cost and price comparisons that the graph shows. So we don't really know where we go from here in terms of have we hit bottom.

We believe the space for outsourced managed services is both large and growing. More companies today understand that their supply chains are global, they're complex and they're ever-changing. They further understand that in many ways, internally hiring people, buying technology and negotiating with the managing a carrier base isn't core to what they do. Also it doesn't allow them to scale because they only have their business volumes to leverage, and we discussed in our first quarter earnings call the success we're having with Microsoft. I think us managing their global supply chain is a great example of the overall trend in the market today. They can leverage our people, our process and our technology. And as it relates to the growth rate segment, we're very happy with the growth of TMC and managed services overall. Our ability to sustain double-digit growth rates is dependent on our ability to continue to execute, and we have a high degree of confidence in our team's ability to do so."

Effective July 1, so at the beginning of Q3 here, there were some global rules that went in place. I think there's more than 150 countries involved and a lot of complexity in terms of how it's being implemented, but the basic idea is just to capture more accurate and better information about the weights in all of these containers. We have done a fair amount of work leading up to July 1 to make sure that all of our global forwarding customers are prepared to be compliant, and we do feel good about the status of our compliance at this point. Because it's a complex rule with a lot of implementation and a lot of different interpretation and enforcement practices around the world in all these various countries, we do think it's a topic that's going to continue to evolve and require some further conversation and some further modification and evolution of how that goes. But it's been in place for several weeks now. It's been very similar to some of the domestic regulation changes that we've seen over the last 5 or 6 years that it is focused largely on safety and data gathering and information around that. So the impact on us becomes the data gathering and the process management to make sure that we and all of our customers are compliant with it, and so far, we feel very good about that."

In the prepared comments, I mentioned that we approached this year and did approach the contractual opportunities and the committed relationships that we have throughout the first half of '16 by being aggressive and trying to stay involved in that freight. So we're seeing growth with those long-term committed relationships. I think it's also been fairly well publicized that the spot market activity in June and July has increased pretty meaningfully as well too, and we certainly are seeing that and participating in it. As the world has gotten more sophisticated and more participants have more data, there's a lot of opportunity for people to route their freight within contracts or go within spot marks. So we're always trying to do the best that we can to understand our freight relationships and monitoring what is committed, what is spot market and making sure that we're adapting to the pricing properly. But through June and July, the short answer is that we did see increases in both of those categories."

Our best estimates today and for the second quarter of 2016 would be that we're about 60% committed and about 40% spot market or more transactional in our North America truckload business. The longer-term trend on that is if you go back a couple of decades, we were in the 90-plus-percent spot market. We were much more of a transactional truck broker in the marketplace. Over the last couple of decades, we've evolved into the scale and the capabilities to handle those larger committed relationships with generally the larger shippers that are out there in the marketplace. As we've grown into that capability of being a core carrier and working on committed freight, that has become a larger and larger percentage of our business. Our best estimate based on tracking the types of shipments that we do, like I said, is that 60-40 relationship with committed freight probably being a little bit more than half of it now. I've said this in the past, but as a reminder, one of the reasons why these are estimates and it's hard is because there are unique customer contracts and there are thousands of them across their networks and there are different definitions of commitment and what commitment means and what the pricing relationships are. So what may seem like a fairly simple concept then able to quantify it, when you get into the weeds on this, there is quite a variation of contracts and what commitments mean. They don't all start and stop at the same date as well too. And with many of those customer relationships, we're interacting with them in different lanes on a variety of committed and spot market activity. So the actual execution and quantification of these is more complex than it might sound, but at a very high level, it's about a 60-40 relationship."

And through the Phoenix acquisition, about 3.5 years ago, we've been successful at not only really increasing the size and substance of our global forwarding division, but over that period of time integrating and improving the operations so that our combined global forwarding business over the last several quarters has reached the level of profitability that we think is sustainable and is contributing nicely to the value that we're creating. So what that means is when we think shorter term about the question around second half of '16 and kind of what's the outlook for our global forwarding business, today it's sort of down to similar to North America, where, if the net revenue growth is there, we feel like there's a fairly predictable amount of operating income and results that will come from that. So we have good momentum in growing our global forwarding activity right now. So we feel positive about the second half outlook and the taking of market share and the continued growth of our global forwarding network. As most of you probably know, the macro environment around pricing in the ocean area, in particular, is pretty challenging right now. And so similar to the truckload side of it, it'll probably more about margins and margin fluctuations in the second half going forward depending upon overall market conditions now that we have a more stable and mature global forwarding activity. So just like on the truckload side, we feel good about our execution, we feel good about our market share and volume gains. Margin comparisons and margin activity in global forwarding on the second half of the year will likely be the challenge."

When prices are declining, as they have for the last couple of years, historically, and what would logically end a cycle like that is when the capacity side finds the bottom begins to say no to price reductions or further price decreases and or some of them fail or go out of business or make the decision the it's no longer economically viable to operate at those rates. So there have been data points in the marketplace about increased bankruptcy or increased churn in the supply side. So the data points that we monitor around that is we're constantly looking for new sources of capacity. And as you saw, our new carriers sign-ups in the quarter were very healthy. That could be a byproduct of our efforts to reach out and find capacity. It can also be a byproduct of capacity that's looking for freight more aggressively and checking for more sites or more shippers or more third parties to look for that capacity. So similar to many of the other comments that we've made, there are some data points that would suggest that the churn and the capacity is ticking up a little bit or maybe starting to happen. We have not seen kind of widespread tightness or shortness of capacity that oftentimes comes at this part of the cycle. While we have seen volume increases and margin compression, there has generally been available capacity. It's still more around the pricing metric at this time than just where you might see a complete absence of capacity and have to wait a day or 2 to ship freight that you would have otherwise preferred to ship on that date. So that's the color that we can add about what we're seeing on the capacity side and the relationships with our carriers."

That kind of core premise of the business model is that we're going to earn and grow as much net revenue as we can, and that net revenue gets shared variably to the team at Robinson as well as profitability and shareholder value. We're constantly looking at productivity gains to try to make sure that, hopefully, our operating income and our earnings grow as fast or faster than our net revenue, and our track record on that has been pretty positive. We also focus on capital management and share repurchases to make sure that, hopefully, our EPS is growing faster than our net income. So if you look at our historical results, I think that's one of them very positive attributes of our business model is that constant productivity and efficiency, that constant high return of capital that allows us to repurchase shares and allows us to grow our EPS faster. So those are the key kind of macro levers that we can pull in terms of how we're going to attempt to grow our earnings and continue to grow our EPS regardless of where the net revenue might shake out. I also said on that call, though, that in our prepared comments, that when you get into that part of the cycle that we might be experiencing on the truckload side, as you've seen in our past, it does make for shorter periods of time in the cycle. We're growing that. North America truckload net revenue is more challenging. And when that happens, since it's such a material part of our business, it does create challenges growing the net revenue. So we've been doing this for many decades and we think we're pretty good at it, and I think the track record speaks for itself in terms of creating shareholder value and we will continue to work on those pillars of our model to do that going forward."

There is some seasonality to the summertime and there is repricing with some of that committed freight and changes in the spot market. It's tough to -- with all those moving parts to know exactly what contribution each of those made to the changes or where the market's going to go from here, but hopefully, we've been transparent in sharing the combination of things that are impacting all of that."

To Andy, for a little more clarity on the new Slide 5. Not sure what the commentary will be by John, but is the gist of this chart to illustrate that the recent rise in gross margins has been more a function of structural things like the addition of Freightquote and fuel that's not a symmetry between the rate of change in buy and sell rates? If this is the case, that is there any way to quantify what the structural uplift has been from Freightquote and how much fuel has impacted gross margins versus, say, 2014?"

We've been publishing it for years. We just wanted to put it in a graphical form to, hopefully, explain it and really show a couple of the key themes as well as the trends. And what we hope the chart shows is a couple of things: one, the cyclical and overall inflationary nature of pricing, right? Since 2008, as John mentioned, it's been up on average 2%, both the price to the customers as well as the cost of the carriers. And you can see the fluctuations that have happened within that. The second is the fact that pricing can change rapidly. There are periods in which it's gone up double digits and there are periods in which it's gone down double digits from a quarter-to-quarter basis. Third issue is the question of reference is the cosmetic impact of fuel. When fuel is lower, the margin is higher and vice versa, but it's a purely cosmetic impact to the net revenue margin percentage. Another key theme is that those lines tend to converge. As information becomes more readily available, the lines converge between pricing to customers and the cost of the carriers. Our customers are smart as well as our carriers are smart. What we do, as we mentioned earlier, we help them manage their rate of change and the pace of change on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And then I would say, finally, on that net revenue margin comment, that margin has trended up over time versus traditional truckload. So we've added higher margin relative to truckload services such as LTL, such as global forwarding and you see the impact that it has going back to 2012 all the way now to 2016. There is a shift change with higher-margin business, higher margin being relative to truckload."

Congrats on another quarter of impressive net revenue margin expansion. Just wondering how sustainable you think that is. Given the aggressive pricing environment we've been hearing about and customers' options to renegotiate pricing, how much of your 2016 pricing has already been set with customers? And has there been any pressure to renegotiate those rates downward given the current loose market conditions? A similar question could relate to margins in forwarding as well."

Again, as we talked in the past there is not a set date or a certain pattern around how and when those contacts renew. So even though there is a decent component of our freight that has more of an annual pricing expectation to it, there is a constant renewal or an annual process to that, that results with maybe more like an effective 6 months duration around what type of committed pricing is out there. Also, when you get into the relationship between committed pricing and spot market pricing, a lot of the relationships that we work with, we may have committed rates in place, but be accepting volumes above and beyond the committed volume activity that went with that committed pricing. So as we've talked in the past, if we do continue to see more of a floor and we do continue to see a shift in the marketplace around the supply and demand cycle in that, the same things that have always happened in the past will continue to happen. I mentioned the carrier churn in the previous question. All parties will start to tighten their contractual monitoring in terms of making sure that only the committed volume is moving at committed pricing and making sure that spot market activity is better identified and better priced separately, and shippers will be reacting to those as well too. One of the many reasons why we charted out some of the information that we've been sharing over the last 8 or 9 years was to show you and, hopefully, give you a sense that while the markets have become more volatile and that prices are probably moving up and down a little bit more aggressively over the last 8 or 9 years than they did prior to that, that our relationship between price to customer and cost of capacity have stayed relatively tight and maybe even arguably have stayed closer together over this period of time. So in our comments around being proud about how we react to the market and how we are able to serve customers while balancing these various commitments into the marketplace, that is clearly one of the messages that we're trying to deliver on this call."

We look at every company that comes out with a website and a mobile app. And yes, there's aspects of it that they claim to be this and they claim to be that. And what we've seen is that, for the most part, the models they're trying to emulate are like Uber, but Uber, let's remember, took on a very heavily regulated industry. Our industry transportation logistics has been deregulated since 1980. And so we're coming out -- in fact, what was traditionally called CHR Trucks, a mobile app for years. We've rebranded that to Navisphere and just recently released both on the Apple as well as the Android stores for our carriers to download, and it's a very rich and it's a very robust mobile application. It allows those trucks and the partners that we have out there in the carrier space to connect to things like paperwork, to things like submit billing, find loads because we have a very rich and robust technology platform that they're able to plug into. I guess when we think about it, in terms of sure, there are some really slick apps and I'm sure some really slick websites that are out there, but I guess the question that we have and the questions that I think is out there is we connect over 150,000 customers and carriers. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have over 20 million electronic touches this quarter. We have 13,500 global employees, right, that have the knowledge and the relationships with the customers and the carriers. So it's our one thing to go out and on the quarter and get a cab or get a black car to the airport because 5 years ago, it was a regulated industry and they just want as many of them out there. But it is entirely another thing to connect a global supply chain with hundreds of thousands of participants and hundreds of thousands of variables and variations that go along with that. So we feel very comfortable our track record of disintermediating in this space because, again, we've been doing it since 1980."

So that's the reason -- the core of why we don't give guidance. What we do feel good about is the things I discussed earlier around our variable cost model and our ability to generate operating income and EPS growth that comes out of that net revenue. So really the key for the second half of the year is what happens with the net revenue and we have pretty high confidence around our business model and EPS that will follow from that. So we're going to be focused on maintaining those disciplines but also managing those buy rates, managing those margins and seeing what kind of market activity happens in the second half of the year. We have not given up on the concept of growing our EPS in the second half of the year, but again, it will have a lot to do with what happens in the cyclicality and the pricing of that margin on net revenue side."

Similar to past quarters, I'd like to start our prepared comments by highlighting some of the key financial metrics. Total revenues decreased 6.9% in the second quarter. The decrease in total revenues was primarily the result of lower pricing in the truckload, air and ocean services. Lower fuel prices on a year-over-year basis was again impactful to the reduced pricing. Net revenues increased 1.7% to $594 million in the second quarter. Net revenue growth slowed as the quarter progressed. Per business day, net revenue growth in each of the months was 9%, 0% and negative 3% for April through June. The primary reason for the sequential results was the fact that the change in truckload pricing and cost per mile crossed over in June and now into July, as our price per mile to the customers is going down more than our cost on a year-over-year basis. Andy will talk more to this in a few slides. 
Though net revenue slowed compared with the past several quarters, our network performed well, achieving a 4.3% net income growth and a 6.4% earnings per share increase. We had earnings per share of $1 in the quarter compared to $0.94 last year. EPS of $1.83 for the first 6 months of the year is a 9.6% increase over the first half of 2015. In terms of some of the highlights for the second quarter, we were able to take market share as we grew volumes across nearly all of our services. Growing our volumes and taking market share in the various cycles continues to be an important part of our long-term strategy. Serving our customers, while adjusting to market changes, is a strength of ours. We remain very confident in the strength of our model and the ability to react and succeed. We continue to invest in people, technology and our networks. Our variable expense model is working well. Pay-for-performance programs and effective capital management help us to grow our EPS in challenging environments like this quarter. Our global headcount grew 4.8% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We've often mentioned that headcount will grow in alignment with our activity or volume and this was the case in the second quarter. Our long-term strategy is working, and we continue with our initiatives to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. 
With that overview, I'm going to now turn it over to Andy to go through results by service offering."

The Robinson team did a great job of taking market share in the quarter, as we increased our global shipment count by over 200,000. We are proud of this statistic, as it demonstrates that customers are voting for our services. Volume growth was driven across multiple modes and through several industry verticals with e-commerce, automotive and telecom being a few of the areas with large increases in volume and net revenue. We continue to receive accolades from our customers and in the industry, as we were recently named the #1 3PL by Inbound Logistics for the sixth year in a row. We were also named the Best Logistic Provider of Air Freight at the 2016 Asia Freight Logistics and Supply Chain Awards. These distinctions are a credit to the more than 13,500 Robinson employees across the globe, who work every day to help our customers win. 
Though it is a challenging environment, the network continues to connect with more and more companies around the world. During the quarter, we had nearly 20 million web and mobile interactions with customers and carriers. This is a sequential increase of over 30% from the beginning of the year. Transportation net revenues increased 1.5% to $556.5 million in the quarter. Net revenue margin increased 180 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily the result of lower purchase transportation cost, including the lower cost of fuel. Additionally, we have seen the mix shift in the type of freight we are moving to the higher-margin businesses and the services we provide. As we have discussed in the past, our net revenue margin is an output, and there are many variables that influence it. The second quarter is a good example of that, as we saw our net revenue growth slow, while the margin increased. As John mentioned, lower pricing in some of our key services makes it more challenging to grow net revenues. 
Moving on to Slide 5. We have taken information that we have been publicly providing since 2008, and put it into a graphical form. Hopefully, it will be additive to the commentary about the secular and cyclical aspects of our business and industry. The light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North America in truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers net of fuel cost over time. The orange line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. There has been a lot of commentary from analysts and transportation providers in regards to the cyclical and secular changes. This visual illustrates in our results that change is a rather constant factor in our business. Part of the value that we bring to customers and carriers is helping them manage the rate of change that occurs. 
When we think about this chart in our business from a secular perspective, there are many factors to consider. One of the most interesting is that during the time period presented, the average price and cost net of fuel have increased approximately 2%. So with all the ups and downs, the truckload pricing has been inflationary. We have talked a lot about the fact that our business has become more committed with now between 50% and 60% of our truckload volume contracted. Both shippers and purchasers of logistics services value our ability to understand the market, and manage their transportation spend for their budgeting and planning initiatives. You may notice that the price and cost lines have moved closer together over time. The access to information about pricing and equipment availability has led to faster responses in many ways, which certainly include pricing. We feel like our network has done an excellent job adjusting to the markets and adapting quickly to these changes. And finally, the chart illustrates that over the past 8.5 years, we have had nearly an equal number of quarters, where the percent change and purchase transportation cost exceeded the percent change in price and vice versa. These changes are one of the factors that impact margins, which have also varied over time. 
Slide 6 covers our truckload results. Truckload net revenue decreased 1.4% in the second quarter, as volumes increased 3%. Pricing was again down in the quarter, as you saw in the previous slide, as customer pricing net of fuel decreased 7.5% versus last year's second quarter, and purchase transportation cost net of fuel fell 8%. Truckload market condition changed throughout the quarter, and in June, these lines actually inverted. For the first time in the last 2 years, the percent change in price per mile to carriers decreased less than the percent change cost to customers. For the quarter, our net revenue decreased $0.02 per mile, which is the primary reason our truckload net revenue fell when compared to last year. 
All that being said, there are many positives in the quarter, and we achieved 3% truckload volume growth in a market where overall demand was down. We captured more share in June, and thus far, in July, we have seen volume growth accelerate. June volumes increased 4%, and to date, in July, truckload volume is up 7% on a per-day basis. Kudos to the team for reacting to the current market dynamics. 
Our carrier services team again did another great job by adding 4,400 new carriers in the quarter. This is a record high for us, coming off a very successful 2015. These new carriers moved over 25,000 loads. We had nearly 40,000 active carriers in the quarter and we continue to see a lot of diversity in our carrier base. Carriers with less than 100 trucks moved just over 80% of our shipments, and larger carriers moved about 20%. So the key indicators for our truckload business in terms of carrier relationship and customers choosing Robinson look very good. We do have some tough comparables in the back half of the year, but we knew that was the case and have been preparing. Our network will focus on servicing our customers and adapting to the market conditions. 
Onto Slide 7 and our Less than Truckload results. Our LTL business had another strong growth quarter. Net revenues increased 9% to just shy of $100 million. Volumes increased 7% when compared to the second quarter of last year. Pricing was down slightly, as one would expect, with fuel being down, and net revenue margins increased again. Temperature control was a standout area, as that portion of the LTL business grew 60%. This specialized service has been growing even faster than the overall service line, and that team is doing a great job, expanding the service within our portfolio of customers. 
We have received a lot of questions about the growth drivers in our truck LTL business. The team and network have made tremendous strides over the past years, and the strength of our program centers around: one, our vast carrier network; two, our ability to execute all shipment sizes from parcel to pallets; and probably three, most importantly, our people and technology allow us to optimize and cater the LTL offering to the unique needs of each of our customers. We are able to deliver comprehensive solutions to clients that cover their needs across a broad range from final mile delivery of small packages and parcels to the consolidation and distribution of dry, fresh and frozen products. We are adding new customers in this service line faster than any other in North America, and we expect this trend to continue. We continue to build on our industry-leading position in LTL, and feel good about our opportunities going forward. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 8. Intermodal net revenue decreased 21.8% in the quarter, as volumes decreased 13%. Net revenue margins decreased in the quarter, as a higher percent of our volume is in lower-margin contractual business. The team has worked really hard to grow this service, but we are fighting a tough industry trend. Our successes in the quarter came from our committed business, as volumes in this area increased, as we have been winning some large contractual bids over the past couple of quarters. Those wins, however, have not been enough to offset the losses in transactional volume on a year-over-year basis. The low truckload pricing and available truckload capacity environment will be a headwind for the business into the third quarter. 
Transitioning to Slide 9 in our global forwarding services business. Second quarter net revenue in global forwarding services were $91.8 million, an increase of 2.4% from 2015's second quarter. We are pleased with our cross-selling initiatives as they yielded many new customers and new net revenue. Further, we are proud of maintaining our status as the #1 NVOCC from China to the U.S. Ocean net revenue was up 1.7%. Air net revenues increased 2.7% and customs grew 5.8%. During the quarter, ocean shipments increased approximately 6%, and air shipments were up 20%, which is a clear indication of our team's strong performance and ability to take market share. Pricing continued to be down in the quarter, with total revenue per shipment down over 20% in both ocean and air services. 
Slide 10 covers our other logistics services. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 24% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. TMC, which is our managed services business, represents approximately 60% of the net revenue in this area. TMC net revenue increased 30% in the second quarter and is currently on pace to service over $3 billion in freight under management in 2016. This business is another one of our fast-growing segments. Customers continue to look for new and better ways to execute their supply chains, and TMC is a great example of how we are able to add services to meet the increased demand for outsourced solutions by combining our Navisphere TMS technology and 3PL outsourcing. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 11. Sourcing net revenues increased 5.7% in the second quarter. Congratulations to the entire Robinson fresh team. The net revenue growth was primarily the results of 3% case volume growth across a variety of commodities and services, and an increase in net revenue per case. Net revenue margin increased 40 basis points in the quarter, which was primarily the result of a change in the mix of commodities and services sold. 
I will now transition to Slide 11 and a review of our summarized income statement. Personnel expenses increased 2.4%, primarily driven by an average headcount growth of 5.2% in the quarter. Our headcount growth is often closely correlated to the activity and volume growth, and this was again the case in the second quarter. As I mentioned in a previous slide, our ability to combine electronic customer and carrier connectivity with talented professionals will continue to allow us to drive productivity improvements. SG&A expenses decreased 0.8% in the second quarter. As John said earlier, the Robinson business model worked well, as a reduction in variable compensation and lower SG&A expenses on a year-over-year basis helped us to achieved higher net income growth and net revenue growth which is always our goal. We were also able to convert revenue to profits at a higher rate of 39.3%, a 10% -- pardon me, a 10 basis point improvement from the same period last year. 
Moving on to Slide 13 and other financial information. We had another strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $143 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $26.2 million in the second quarter and $44 million year-to-date. We continue to expect capital expenditures to finish the year between $70 million and $80 million. The increase on a year-over-year basis is the result of the cost associated with the building of our second data center. We finished the quarter with $965 million in debt and $207 million in cash. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, Slide 14 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $88 million to our shareholders in the quarter, with $63.6 million in dividends and $23.9 million in share repurchases. Again, thank you very much to everyone at Robinson for a solid second quarter, and thank you, all, as well for listening in. 
With that, I will now turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions."

Coming end of the year, we plan that we would continue to add to our team and be aggressive going after market share",330,"Thank you, Andy. Before we move on to the pre-submitted questions, I'll take just a couple of minutes to wrap up with some final comments. Coming end of the year, we plan that we would continue to add to our team and be aggressive going after market share, and that's exactly what we're doing. We're growing our volume in nearly all of our services. As Andy mentioned, our truckload volume growth has increased the past 2 months and is pacing at a 7% per-day business increase in July. Europe's growth in both service transportation and global forwarding is accelerating. The Freightquote team continues to perform well and deliver strong results. Our outsource services, including TMC, are delivering consistent double-digit growth. There are a lot of bright spots across our business, and we feel good about how we are executing and our long-term opportunities for growth. 
Our July to date total company net revenue has decreased approximately 2% per business day. This decrease is primarily the result of lower net revenue per shipment in the truckload service line. Andy's comments covered what we're seeing in truckload pricing. We also know that the truckload net revenue margins for the second half of 2015 were on the high side of our historic ranges, making for challenging comparisons. As I shared in my opening comments, we pride ourselves on maintaining great execution, while we adjust to the market cycles. However, net revenue growth in truckload services is more challenging in this environment. 
If you look at our historical performance, we've been very consistent at delivering EPS growth that approximate or exceeds our net revenue growth. We achieve this through variable cost, productivity gains and efficient capital management. We continue to focus on all of these components of our business model, as we believe this is the right combination to motivate our team, serve customers and carriers more efficiently and create shareholder value. 
With that, we'll now move to the Q&A part of our call."

As we discussed previously on our last call, in the first quarter of this year, we elected APB 23, and asserted that we will indefinitely reinvest the earnings of those foreign subsidiaries to support the expansion of our international business, where the opportunities are large and the tax rates are lower. As a result, our effective tax rate is now lower. Our foreign operations in the aggregate continue to perform well, and therefore, we expect the effective tax rate to remain in the low 37% range."

So that from a comparability standpoint, July is probably fairly typical of what we're going to see in the third quarter from a comparison standpoint. In Andy and my prepared comments, we talked about that chart that we added and the fact that volumes have accelerated during the months of June and July, and that with that has come the margin compression and the turn in those cost and price comparisons that the graph shows. So we don't really know where we go from here in terms of have we hit bottom.

Effective July 1, so at the beginning of Q3 here, there were some global rules that went in place. I think there's more than 150 countries involved and a lot of complexity in terms of how it's being implemented, but the basic idea is to capture more accurate and better information about the weights in all of these containers. We have done a fair amount of work leading up to July 1 to make sure that all of our global forwarding customers are prepared to be compliant, and we do feel good about the status of our compliance at this point. Because it's a complex rule with a lot of implementation, a lot of different interpretation and enforcement practices around the world in all these various countries, we do think it's a topic that's going to continue to evolve and require some further conversation and some further modification and evolution of how that goes, but it's been in place for several weeks now. It's been very similar to some of the domestic regulation changes that we've seen over the last 5 or 6 years that it is focused largely on safety and data gathering and the information around that.

Our best estimates today and for the second quarter of 2016 would be that we're about 60% committed and about 40% spot market or more transactional in our North America truckload business. The longer-term trend on that is if you go back a couple of decades, we were in the 90-plus-percent spot market. We were much more of a transactional truck broker in the marketplace. Over the last couple of decades, we've evolved into the scale and the capabilities to handle those larger committed relationships with generally the larger shippers that are out there in the marketplace. As we've grown into that capability of being a core carrier and working on committed freight, that has become a larger and larger percentage of our business. Our best estimate based on tracking the types of shipments that we do, like I said, is that 60-40 relationship with committed freight probably being a little bit more than half of it now. I've said this in the past, but as a reminder, one of the reasons why these are estimates and it's hard is because there are unique customer contracts, and there are thousands of them across our networks, and there are different definitions of commitment and what commitment means and what the pricing relationships are. So what may seem like a fairly simple concept, then able to quantify it, when you get into the weeds on this, there is quite a variation of contracts and what commitments mean.

And through the Phoenix acquisition, about 3.5 years ago, we've been successful at not only really increasing the size and substance of our global forwarding division, but over that period of time, integrating and improving the operations so that our combined global forwarding business over the last several quarters has reached the level of profitability that we think is sustainable and is contributing nicely to the value that we're creating. So what that means is when we think shorter term about the question around second half of '16 and kind of what's the outlook for our global forwarding business, today, it's sort of down to similar to North America, where if the net revenue growth is there, we feel like there's a fairly predictable amount of operating income and results that will come from that. So we have good momentum in growing our global forwarding activity right now. So we feel positive about the second half outlook and the taking of market share and the continued growth of our global forwarding network. As most of you probably know, the macro environment around pricing in the ocean area, in particular, is pretty challenging right now. And so similar to the truckload side of it, it will probably be more about margins and margin fluctuation in the second half going forward, depending upon overall market conditions, now that we have a more stable and mature global forwarding activity. So just like the truckload side, we feel good about our execution. We feel good about market share and volume gains. Margin comparisons and margin activity in global forwarding on the second half of the year will likely be the challenge."

When prices are declining, as they have for the last couple of years, historically, and what would logically end a cycle like that is when the capacity side finds the bottom, begins to say no to price reductions or further price decreases and or some of them fail or go out of business or make the decision that it's no longer economically viable to operate at those rates. So there have been data points in the marketplace about increased bankruptcy or increased churn in the supply side. So the data points that we monitor around that is we're constantly looking for new sources of capacity. And as you saw, our new carrier sign-ups in the quarter were very healthy. That could be a byproduct of our efforts to reach out and find capacity. It can also be a byproduct of capacity that's looking for freight more aggressively and checking for more sites or more shippers or more third parties to look for that capacity. So similar to many of the other comments that we've made, there are some data points that would suggest that the churn and the capacity is ticking up a little bit or maybe starting to happen. We have not seen kind of widespread tightness or shortness of capacity that oftentimes comes at this part of the cycle. While we have seen volume increases and margin compression, there has generally been available capacity. It's still more around the pricing metric at this time than just where you might see a complete absence of capacity and have to wait 1 day or 2 to ship freight that you would have otherwise preferred to ship on that date. So that's the color that we can add about what we're seeing on the capacity side and the relationships with our carriers."

That kind of core premise of the business model is that we're going to earn and grow as much net revenue as we can, and that net revenue gets shared variably to the team at Robinson, as well as profitability and shareholder value. We're constantly looking at productivity gains to try to make sure that, hopefully, our operating income and our earnings grow as fast or faster than our net revenue, and our track record on that has been pretty positive. We also focus on capital management and share repurchases to make sure that, hopefully, our EPS is growing faster than our net income. So if you look at our historical results, I think that's one of the very positive attributes of our business model is that constant productivity and efficiency, that constant high return on capital that allows us to repurchase shares and allows us to grow our EPS faster. So those are the key kind of macro levers that we can pull in terms of how we're going to attempt to grow our earnings and continue to grow our EPS regardless of where the net revenue might shake out. I also said on that call, though, that in our prepared comments, that when you get into that part of the cycle that we might be experiencing on the truckload side, as you've seen in our past, it does make for shorter periods of time in the cycle. We're growing that. North America truckload net revenue is more challenging. And when that happens, since it's such a material part of our business, it does create challenge in growing the net revenue. So we've been doing this for many decades, and we think we're pretty good at it, and I think the track record speaks for itself in terms of creating shareholder value and we will continue to work on those pillars of our model to do that going forward."

We've been publishing it for years. We just wanted to put it in a graphical form to, hopefully, explain it and really show a couple of the key themes as well as the trends. And what we hope the chart shows is a couple of things: one, the cyclical and overall inflationary nature of pricing, right. Since 2008, as John mentioned, it's been up on average 2%, both the price to the customers as well as the cost of the carriers, and you can see the fluctuations that have happened within that. The second is the fact that pricing can change rapidly. There are periods in which it's gone up double digits and there are periods in which it's gone down double digits from a quarter-to-quarter basis. Third issue is the question of reference, the cosmetic impact of fuel. When fuel is lower, the margin is higher and vice versa, but it's a purely cosmetic impact to the net revenue margin percentage. Another key theme is that those lines tend to converge. As information becomes more readily available, the lines converge between pricing to customers and the cost of the carriers. Our customers are smart as well as our carriers are smart. What we do, as I mentioned earlier, we helped them manage the rate of change and the pace of change on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And then I would say, finally, on that net revenue margin comment, that margin has trended up over time versus traditional truckload. So we've added higher margin relative to truckload services such as LTL, such as global forwarding, and you see the impact that it has going back to 2012 all the way now to 2016. There is a shift change with higher-margin business, higher margin being relative to truckload."

Again, as we've talked in the past, there's not a set date or a certain pattern around how and when those contacts renew. So even though there is a decent component of our freight that has more of an annual pricing expectation to it, there is a constant renewal or an annual process to that, that results with maybe more like an effective 6 months duration around what type of committed pricing is out there. Also, when you get into the relationship between committed pricing and spot market pricing, a lot of the relationships that we work with, we may have committed rates in place, but be accepting volumes above and beyond the committed volume activity that went with that committed pricing. So as we've talked in the past, if we do continue to see more of a floor and we do continue to see a shift in the marketplace around the supply and demand cycle in that, the same things that have always happened in the past will continue to happen. I mentioned the carrier churn in the previous question. All parties will start to tighten their contractual monitoring in terms of making sure that only the committed volume is moving at committed pricing and making sure that spot market activity is better identified and better priced separately, and shippers will be reacting to those as well too. One of the many reasons why we charted out some of the information that we've been sharing over the last 8 or 9 years was to show you, and hopefully, give you a sense that while the markets have become more volatile and that prices are probably moving up and down a little bit more aggressively over the last 8, 9 years than they did prior to that, that our relationship between price to customer and cost of capacity have stayed relatively tight and maybe even arguably have stayed closer together over this period of time. So in our comments around being proud about how we react to the market and how we are able to serve customers while balancing these various commitments into the marketplace, that is clearly one of the messages that we're trying to deliver on this call."

We look at every company that comes out with a website and a mobile app. And there's aspects of it that they claim to be this or they claim to be that. And what we've seen is that, for the most part, the models they're trying to emulate are like Uber. But Uber, let's remember, took on a very heavily regulated industry. Our industry transportation logistics has been deregulated since 1980, and so we're coming out -- in fact, we've had what was traditionally called CHRWTrucks, a mobile app for years. We've rebranded that to Navisphere, and it's just been recently released both on the Apple, as well as the Android stores for our carriers to download, and it's a very rich and it's a very robust mobile application. It allows those trucks and the partners that we have out there in the carrier space to connect to things like paperwork, to things like submit billing, find loads because we have a very rich and robust technology platform that they're able to plug into. I guess when we think about it, in terms of sure, there's some really slick apps, and I'm sure there's some really slick websites that are out there, but I guess the question that we have and the question that I think is out there is we connect over 150,000 customers and carriers. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have over 20 million electronic touches this quarter. We have 13,500 global employees, right, and they have the knowledge and the relationships with the customers and the carriers. And so it's one thing to go out and stand on the corner and get a cab or get a black car to the airport because 5 years ago, it's a regulated industry, and they just want as many of them out there. But it's entirely another thing to connect a global supply chain with hundreds of thousands of participants and hundreds of thousands of variables and variations that go along with that. So we feel very comfortable of our track record of dis-intermediating the space because, again, we've been doing it since 1980."

So we're going to be focused on maintaining those disciplines, but also managing those buy rates, managing those margins and seeing what kind of market activity happens in the second half of the year. We have not given up on the concept of growing our EPS in the second half of the year, but again, it will have a lot to do with what happens in the cyclicality and the pricing of the margin on the net revenue side."

Similar to past quarters, I'd like to start our prepared comments by highlighting some of the key financial metrics. Total revenues decreased 6.9% in the second quarter. The decrease in total revenues was primarily the result of lower pricing in the truckload, air and ocean services. Lower fuel prices on a year-over-year basis was again impactful to the reduced pricing. Net revenues increased 1.7% to $594 million in the second quarter. Net revenue growth slowed as the quarter progressed. Per business day, net revenue growth in each of the months was 9%, 0% and negative 3% for April through June. The primary reason for the sequential results was the fact that the change in truckload pricing and cost per mile crossed over in June and now into July, as our price per mile to the customers is going down more than our costs on a year-over-year basis. Andy will talk more to this in a few slides. 
Though net revenue slowed compared with the past several quarters, our network performed well, achieving a 4.3% net income growth and a 6.4% earnings per share increase. We had earnings per share of $1 in the quarter compared to $0.94 last year. EPS of $1.83 for the first 6 months of the year is a 9.6% increase over the first half of 2015. In terms of some of the highlights for the second quarter, we were able to take market share as we grew volumes across nearly all of our services. Growing our volumes and taking market share in the various cycles continues to be an important part of our long-term strategy. Serving our customers while adjusting to market changes is a strength of ours. We remain very confident in the strength of our model and the ability to react and succeed. We continue to invest in people, technology and our network. Our variable expense model is working well. Pay-for-performance programs and effective capital management help us to grow our EPS in challenging environments like this quarter. Our global headcount grew 4.8% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We've often mentioned that headcount will grow in alignment with our activity or volume and this was the case in the second quarter. Our long-term strategy is working, and we continue with our initiatives to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. 
With that overview, I'm going to now turn it over to Andy to go through results by service offering."

The Robinson team did a great job of taking market share in the quarter, as we increased our global shipment count by over 200,000. We are proud of this statistic, as it demonstrates that customers are voting for our services. Volume growth was driven across multiple modes and through several industry verticals with e-commerce, automotive and telecom being a few of the areas with large increases in volume and net revenue. We continue to receive accolades from our customers and in the industry, as we were recently named the #1 3PL by Inbound Logistics for the sixth year in a row. We were also named Best Logistic Provider of Air Freight at the 2016 Asia Freight Logistics and Supply Chain Awards. These distinctions are a credit to the more than 13,500 Robinson employees across the globe, who work every day to help our customers win. 
Though it is a challenging environment, the network continues to connect with more and more companies around the world. During the quarter, we had nearly 20 million web and mobile interactions with customers and carriers. This is a sequential increase of over 30% from the beginning of the year. Transportation net revenues increased 1.5% to $556.5 million in the quarter. Net revenue margin increased 180 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily the result of lower purchase transportation cost, including the lower cost of fuel. Additionally, we have seen the mix shift in the type of freight we are moving to the higher-margin businesses and the services we provide. As we have discussed in the past, our net revenue margin is an output, and there are many variables that influence it. The second quarter is a good example of that, as we saw our net revenue growth slow, while the margin increased. As John mentioned, lower pricing in some of our key services makes it more challenging to grow net revenues. 
Moving on to Slide 5. We have taken information that we have been publicly providing since 2008, and put it into a graphical form. Hopefully, it will be additive to the commentary about the secular and cyclical aspects of our business and industry. The light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North American truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers net of fuel cost over time. The orange line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. There has been a lot of commentary from analysts and transportation providers in regards to the cyclical and secular changes. This visual illustrates in our results that change is a rather constant factor in our business. Part of the value that we bring to customers and carriers is helping them manage the rate of change that occurs. 
When we think about this chart in our business from a secular perspective, there are many factors to consider. One of the most interesting is that during the time period presented, the average price and cost net of fuel have increased approximately 2%. So with all the ups and downs, the truckload pricing has been inflationary. We have talked a lot about the fact that our business has become more committed with now between 50% and 60% of our truckload volume contracted. Both shippers and purchasers of logistic services value our ability to understand the market, and manage their transportation spend for their budgeting and planning initiatives. You may notice that the price and cost lines have moved closer together over time. The access to information about pricing and equipment availability has led to faster responses in many ways, which certainly include pricing. We feel like our network has done an excellent job adjusting to the markets and adapting quickly to these changes. And finally, the chart illustrates that over the past 8.5 years, we have had nearly an equal number of quarters where the percent change and purchase transportation cost exceeded the percent change in price and vice versa. These changes are one of the factors that impact margins, which have also varied over time. 
Slide 6 covers our truckload results. Truckload net revenue decreased 1.4% in the second quarter, as volumes increased 3%. Pricing was again down in the quarter, as you saw in the previous slide, as customer pricing net of fuel decreased 7.5% versus last year's second quarter, and purchase transportation cost net of fuel fell 8%. Truckload market condition changed throughout the quarter, and in June, these lines actually inverted. For the first time in the last 2 years, the percent change in price per mile to carriers decreased less than the percent change cost to customers. For the quarter, our net revenue decreased $0.02 per mile, which is the primary reason our truckload net revenue fell when compared to last year. 
All that being said, there are many positives in the quarter, and we achieved 3% truckload volume growth in a market where overall demand was down. We captured more share in June, and thus far in July, we have seen volume growth accelerate. June volumes increased 4%, and to date in July, truckload volume is up 7% on a per-day basis. Kudos to the team for reacting to the current market dynamics. 
Our carrier services team again did another great job by adding 4,400 new carriers in the quarter. This is a record high for us, coming off a very successful 2015. These new carriers moved over 25,000 loads. We had nearly 40,000 active carriers in the quarter and we continued to see a lot of diversity in our carrier base. Carriers with less than 100 trucks moved just over 80% of our shipments, and larger carriers moved about 20%. So the key indicators for our truckload business in terms of carrier relationships and customers choosing Robinson look very good. We do have some tough comparables in the back half of the year, but we knew that was the case and have been preparing. Our network will focus on servicing our customers and adapting to the market conditions. 
Onto Slide 7 and our Less than Truckload results. Our LTL business had another strong growth quarter. Net revenues increased 9% to just shy of $100 million. Volumes increased 7% when compared to the second quarter last year. Pricing was down slightly, as one would expect, with fuel being down, and net revenue margins increased again. Temperature control was a standout area, as that portion of the LTL business grew 60%. This specialized service has been growing even faster than the overall service line, and that team is doing a great job, expanding the service within our portfolio of customers. 
We have received a lot of questions about the growth drivers in our truck LTL business. The team and network have made tremendous strides over the past years, and the strength of our program centers around: one, our vast carrier network; two, our ability to execute all shipment sizes from parcel to pallets; and probably three, most importantly, our people and technology allow us to optimize and cater the LTL offering to the unique needs of each of our customers. We are able to deliver comprehensive solutions to clients that cover their needs across a broad range from final mile delivery of small packages and parcels to the consolidation and distribution of dry, fresh and frozen products. We are adding new customers in this service line faster than any other in North America, and we expect this trend to continue. We continue to build on our industry-leading position in LTL, and feel good about our opportunities going forward. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 8. Intermodal net revenue decreased 21.8% in the quarter, as volumes decreased 13%. Net revenue margins decreased in the quarter, as a higher percent of our volume is in lower-margin contractual business. The team has worked really hard to grow this service, but we are fighting a tough industry trend. Our successes in the quarter came from our committed business, as volumes in this area increased, as we have been winning some large contractual bids over the past couple of quarters. Those wins, however, have not been enough to offset the losses in transactional volume on a year-over-year basis. The low truckload pricing and available truckload capacity environment will be a headwind for the business into the third quarter. 
Transitioning to Slide 9 and our global forwarding services business. Second quarter net revenue in global forwarding services were $91.8 million, an increase of 2.4% from 2015's second quarter. We are pleased with our cross-selling initiatives as they yielded many new customers and new net revenue. Further, we are proud of maintaining our status as the #1 NVOCC from China to the U.S. Ocean net revenue was up 1.7%. Air net revenues increased 2.7% and customs grew 5.8%. During the quarter, ocean shipments increased approximately 6%, and air shipments were up 20%, which is a clear indication of our team's strong performance and ability to take market share. Pricing continued to be down in the quarter, with total revenue per shipment down over 20% in both ocean and air services. 
Slide 10 covers our other logistics services. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 24% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. TMC, which is our managed services business, represents approximately 60% of the net revenue in this area. TMC net revenue increased 30% in the second quarter and is currently on pace to service over $3 billion in freight under management in 2016. This business is another one of our fast-growing segments. Customers continue to look for new and better ways to execute their supply chains, and TMC is a great example of how we are able to add services to meet the increased demand for outsourced solutions by combining our Navisphere TMS technology and 3PL outsourcing. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 11. Sourcing net revenues increased 5.7% in the second quarter. Congratulations to the entire Robinson Fresh team. The net revenue growth was primarily the result of 3% case volume growth across a variety of commodities and services and an increase in net revenue per case. Net revenue margin increased 40 basis points in the quarter, which was primarily the result of a change in the mix of commodities and services sold. 
I will now transition to Slide 11 and a review of our summarized income statement. Personnel expenses increased 2.4%, primarily driven by an average headcount growth of 5.2% in the quarter. Our headcount growth is often closely correlated to the activity and volume growth, and this was again the case in the second quarter. As I mentioned in a previous slide, our ability to combine electronic customer and carrier connectivity with talented professionals will continue to allow us to drive productivity improvements. SG&A expenses decreased 0.8% in the second quarter. As John said earlier, the Robinson business model worked well, as a reduction in variable compensation and lower SG&A expenses on a year-over-year basis helped us to achieved higher net income growth than net revenue growth which is always our goal. We were also able to convert revenue to profits at a higher rate of 39.3%, a 10% -- pardon me, a 10 basis point improvement from the same period last year. 
Moving on to Slide 13 and other financial information. We had another strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $143 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $26.2 million in the second quarter and $44 million year-to-date. We continue to expect capital expenditures to finish the year between $70 million and $80 million. The increase on a year-over-year basis is the result of the cost associated with the building of our second data center. We finished the quarter with $965 million in debt and $207 million in cash. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, Slide 14 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $88 million to our shareholders in the quarter, with $63.6 million in dividends and $23.9 million in share repurchases. Again, thank you very much to everyone at Robinson for a solid second quarter, and thank you, all, as well for listening in. 
With that, I will now turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions."

Before we move on to the pre-submitted questions, I'll take just a couple of minutes to wrap up with some final comments. Coming into the year, we planned that we would continue to add to our team and be aggressive going after market share, and that's exactly what we're doing. We're growing our volume in nearly all of our services. As Andy mentioned, our truckload volume growth has increased the past 2 months and is pacing at a 7% per-day business increase in July. Europe's growth in both service transportation and global forwarding is accelerating. The Freightquote team continues to perform well and deliver strong results. Our outsource services, including TMC, are delivering consistent double-digit growth. There are a lot of bright spots across our business, and we feel good about how we are executing and our long-term opportunities for growth. 
Our July to date total company net revenue has decreased approximately 2% per business day. This decrease is primarily the result of lower net revenue per shipment in the truckload service line. Andy's comments covered what we're seeing in truckload pricing. We also know that the truckload net revenue margins for the second half of 2015 were on the high side of our historic ranges, making for challenging comparisons. As I shared in my opening comments, we pride ourselves on maintaining great execution, while we adjust to the market cycles. However, net revenue growth in truckload services is more challenging in this environment. 
If you look at our historical performance, we've been very consistent at delivering EPS growth that approximate or exceeds our net revenue growth. We achieve this through variable cost, productivity gains and efficient capital management. We continue to focus on all of these components of our business model, as we believe it's the right combination to motivate our team, serve customers and carriers more efficiently and create shareholder value. 
With that, we'll now move to the Q&A part of our call."

In Andy and my prepared comments, we talked about that chart that we added and the fact that volumes have accelerated during the months of June and July, and that with that has come the margin compression and the turn in those cost and price comparisons that the graph showed. So we don't really know where we go from here in terms of have we hit bottom.

And our hiring patterns, while the long-term objective is to mirror them with our volume or activity, we are planning our hiring on more of a calendar or annual basis around the schools, the graduation rates and the hiring cycles. So we look at that. We look at our market expectations. We look at our productivity expectations, and we're making decisions about how we're going to add to the team. In the prepared remarks I commented that we did set out this year with a plan to add to the team, and we do plan to continue to do that throughout the remainder of the-year, probably at that low- to mid-single-digit range that we experienced throughout the first half of the year. The fact that our volumes are accelerating: we have been for several years now, and really, it's a permanent part of our culture to be looking at our productivity, our business practices and our job families around being ready to handle that additional volume when the market makes it available to us. So we will be adjusting our hiring thoughts and plans over time as we always do, but we'll be executing what we set out to do at the beginning of the year to keep building the team. And if we do have continued volume increases throughout the second half of 2016, we're confident that we'll be able to handle them."

They further understand that in many ways, internally hiring people, buying technology and negotiating with and managing a carrier base isn't core to what they do. Also, it doesn't allow them to scale because they only have their business volumes to leverage, and we discussed in our first quarter earnings call the success we're having with Microsoft.

Effective July 1, so at the beginning of Q3 here, there were some global rules that went in place. I think there's more than 150 countries involved and a lot of complexity in terms of how it's being implemented, but the basic idea is to capture more accurate and better information about the weights in all of these containers. We have done a fair amount of work leading up to July 1 to make sure that all of our global forwarding customers are prepared to be compliant, and we do feel good about the status of our compliance at this point. Because it's a complex rule with a lot of implementation, a lot of different interpretation and enforcement practices around the world in all these various countries, we do think it's a topic that's going to continue to evolve and require some further conversation and some further modification and evolution of how that goes, but it's been in place for several weeks now. It's been very similar to some of the domestic regulation changes that we've seen over the last 5 or 6 years that it is focused largely on safety and data gathering and the information around that. So the impact on us becomes the data gathering and the process management to make sure that we and all of our customers are compliant with it, and so far, we feel very good about that."

So we are seeing growth with those long-term committed relationships. I think it's also been fairly well publicized that the spot market activity in June and July has increased pretty meaningfully as well too, and we certainly are seeing that and participating in it. As the world has gotten more sophisticated and more participants have more data, there's a lot of opportunity for people to route their freight within contracts or go within spotted marks. So we're always trying to do the best that we can to understand our freight relationships and monitoring what is committed, what is spot market and making sure that we're adapting to the pricing properly. But through June and July, the short answer is that we did see increases in both of those categories."

Our best estimates today and for the second quarter of 2016 would be that we're about 60% committed and about 40% spot market or more transactional in our North America truckload business. The longer-term trend on that is if you go back a couple of decades, we were in the 90-plus-percent spot market. We were much more of a transactional truck broker in the marketplace. Over the last couple of decades, we've evolved into the scale and the capabilities to handle those larger committed relationships with, generally, the larger shippers that are out there in the marketplace. As we've grown into that capability of being a core carrier and working on committed freight, that has become a larger and larger percentage of our business. Our best estimate based on tracking the types of shipments that we do, like I said, is that 60-40 relationship with committed freight probably being a little bit more than half of it now. I've said this in the past, but as a reminder, one of the reasons why these are estimates and it's hard is because there are unique customer contracts, and there are thousands of them across our networks. And there are different definitions of commitment and what commitment means and what the pricing relationships are. So what may seem like a fairly simple concept, then able to quantify it, when you get into the weeds on this, there is quite a variation of contracts and what commitments mean. They don't all start and stop at the same date as well too. And with many of those customer relationships, we're interacting with them in different lanes on a variety of committed and spot market activity. So the actual execution and quantification of these is more complex than it might sound, but at a very high level, it's about a 60-40 relationship."

And through the Phoenix acquisition, about 3.5 years ago, we've been successful at not only really increasing the size and substance of our global forwarding division, but over that period of time, integrating and improving the operation so that our combined global forwarding business over the last several quarters has reached the level of profitability that we think is sustainable and is contributing nicely to the value that we're creating. So what that means is when we think shorter term about the question around second half of '16 and kind of what's the outlook for our global forwarding business, today, it's sort of down to similar to North America, where if the net revenue growth is there, we feel like there's a fairly predictable amount of operating income and results that will come from that. So we have good momentum in growing our global forwarding activity right now. So we feel positive about the second half outlook and the taking of market share and the continued growth of our global forwarding network. As most of you probably know, the macro environment around pricing in the ocean area, in particular, is pretty challenging right now. And so similar to the truckload side of it, it will probably be more about margins and margin fluctuation in the second half going forward, depending upon overall market conditions, now that we have a more stable and mature global forwarding activity. So just like the truckload side, we feel good about our execution. We feel good about market share and volume gains. Margin comparisons and margin activity in global forwarding on the second half of the year will likely be the challenge."

When prices are declining, as they have for the last couple of years, historically, and what would logically end a cycle like that is when the capacity side finds the bottom: begins to say no to price reductions or further price decreases and/or some of them fail or go out of business or make the decision that it's no longer economically viable to operate at those rates. So there have been data points in the marketplace about increased bankruptcy or increased churn in the supply side. So the data points that we monitor around that is we're constantly looking for new sources of capacity. And as you saw, our new carrier sign-ups in the quarter were very healthy. That could be a byproduct of our efforts to reach out and find capacity. It can also be a byproduct of capacity that's looking for freight more aggressively and checking for more sites or more shippers or more third parties to look for that capacity. So similar to many of the other comments that we've made, there are some data points that would suggest that the churn in the capacity is ticking up a little bit or maybe starting to happen. We have not seen kind of widespread tightness or shortness of capacity that oftentimes comes at this part of the cycle. While we have seen volume increases and margin compression, there has generally been available capacity. It's still more around the pricing metric at this time than just where you might see a complete absence of capacity and have to wait 1 day or 2 to ship freight that you would have otherwise preferred to ship on that date. So that's the color that we can add about what we're seeing on the capacity side and the relationships with our carriers."

That the kind of core premise of the business model is that we're going to earn and grow as much net revenue as we can, and that net revenue gets shared variably to the team at Robinson, as well as profitability and shareholder value. We're constantly looking at productivity gains to try to make sure that, hopefully, our operating income and our earnings grow as fast or faster than our net revenue, and our track record on that has been pretty positive. We also focus on capital management and share repurchases to make sure that, hopefully, our EPS is growing faster than our net income. So if you look at our historical results, I think that's one of the very positive attributes of our business model is that constant productivity and efficiency, that constant high return on capital that allows us to repurchase shares and allows us to grow our EPS faster. So those are the key kind of macro levers that we can pull in terms of how we're going to attempt to grow our earnings and continue to grow our EPS regardless of where the net revenue might shake out. I also said on that call, though, that in our prepared comments, that when you get into that part of the cycle that we might be experiencing on the truckload side, as you've seen in our past, it does make for shorter periods of time in the cycle where growing that North America truckload net revenue is more challenging. And when that happens, since it's such a material part of our business, it does create challenge in growing the net revenue. So we've been doing this for many decades, and we think we're pretty good at it, and I think the track record speaks for itself in terms of creating shareholder value and we will continue to work on those pillars of our model to do that going forward."

We've been publishing it for years. We just wanted to put it in a graphical form to, hopefully, explain and really show a couple of the key themes as well as the trends. And what we hope the chart shows is a couple of things: one, the cyclical and overall inflationary nature of pricing, right? Since 2008, as John mentioned, it's been up on average 2%, both the price to the customers as well as the cost to the carriers, and you can see the fluctuations that have happened within that. The second is the fact that pricing can change rapidly. There are periods in which it's gone up double digits and there are periods in which it's gone down double digits from a quarter-to-quarter basis. Third issue is, as the question referenced, there's a cosmetic impact of fuel. When fuel is lower, the margin is higher and vice versa, but it's a purely cosmetic impact to the net revenue margin percentage. Another key theme is that those lines tend to converge. As information becomes more readily available, the lines converge between pricing to customers and the cost to the carriers. Our customers are smart as well as our carriers are smart. What we do, as I mentioned earlier, we help them manage the rate of change and the pace of change on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And then I would say, finally, on that net revenue margin comment, that margin has trended up over time versus traditional truckload. So we've added higher margin relative to truckload services such as LTL, such as global forwarding, and you see the impact that it has going back to 2012 all the way now to 2016. There is a shift change with higher-margin business, higher margin being relative to truckload."

Congrats on another quarter of impressive net revenue margin expansion. Just wondering how sustainable you think that is. Given the aggressive pricing environment we've been hearing about and customers' option to renegotiate pricing, how much of your 2016 pricing has already been set with customers? And has there been any pressure to renegotiate those rates downward given the current loose market conditions? A similar question could relate to margins in forwarding as well."

Starting with kind of the 60-40 mix that there is about 60% of the North America truckload business that is prepriced or through a committed relationship where there's generally a 1-year price expectation. Again, as we've talked in the past, there is not a set date or a certain pattern around how and when those contacts renew. So even though there is a decent component of our freight that has more of an annual pricing expectation to it, there is a constant renewal or an annual process to that, that results with maybe more like an effective 6 months duration around what type of committed pricing is out there. Also, when you get into the relationship between committed pricing and spot market pricing, a lot of the relationships that we work with, we may have committed rates in place but be accepting volumes above and beyond the committed volume activity that went with that committed pricing. So as we've talked in the past, if we do continue to see more of a floor and we do continue to see a shift in the marketplace around the supply and demand cycle in that, the same things that have always happened in the past will continue to happen. I mentioned the carrier churn in the previous question. All parties will start to tighten their contractual monitoring in terms of making sure that only the committed volume is moving at committed pricing and making sure that spot market activity is better identified and better priced separately, and shippers will be reacting to those as well too. One of the many reasons why we charted out some of the information that we've been sharing over the last 8 or 9 years was to show you, and hopefully, give you a sense that while the markets have become more volatile and that prices are probably moving up and down a little bit more aggressively over the last 8, 9 years than they did prior to that, that our relationship between price to customer and cost of capacity have stayed relatively tight and maybe even arguably have stayed closer together over this period of time. So in our comments around being proud about how we react to the market and how we are able to serve customers while balancing these various commitments into the marketplace, that is clearly one of the messages that we're trying to deliver on this call."

We look at every company that comes out with a website and a mobile app. And there's aspects of it that they claim to be this or they claim to be that. And what we've seen is that, for the most part, the models they're trying to emulate are like Uber. But Uber, let's remember, took on a heavily regulated industry. Our industry, transportation logistics, has been deregulated since 1980. And so we're coming out -- in fact, we've had what was traditionally called CHRWTrucks, a mobile app for years. We've rebranded that to Navisphere, and it's just been recently released both on the Apple, as well as the Android stores for our carriers to download. And it's a very rich and it's a very robust mobile application. It allows those trucks and the partners that we have out there in the carrier space to connect, do things like paperwork, do things like submit billing, find loads because we have a very rich and robust technology platform that they're able to plug into. I guess when we think about it, in terms of sure, there are some really slick apps, and I'm sure there are some really slick websites that are out there. But I guess the question that we have and the question that I think is out there is we connect over 150,000 customers and carriers. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have over 20 million electronic touches this quarter. We have 13,500 global employees, right, and they have the knowledge and the relationships with the customers and the carriers. And so it's one thing to go out and stand on the corner and get a cab or get a black car to the airport because 5 years ago, it was a regulated industry and there just weren't as many of them out there. But it's entirely another thing to connect a global supply chain with hundreds of thousands of participants and hundreds of thousands of variables and variations that go along with that. So we feel very comfortable of our track record of disintermediating the space because, again, we've been doing it since 1980."

What we do feel good about is the things I discussed earlier around our variable cost model and our ability to generate operating income and EPS growth that comes out of that net revenue. So really, the key for the second half of the year is what happens with the net revenue and -- pretty high confidence around our business model and the EPS that will follow from that. So we're going to be focused on maintaining those disciplines, but also managing those buy rates, managing those margins and seeing what kind of market activity happens in the second half of the year.

Similar to past quarters, I'd like to start our prepared comments by highlighting some of the key financial metrics. Total revenues decreased 6.9% in the second quarter. The decrease in total revenues was primarily the result of lower pricing in the truckload, air and ocean services. Lower fuel prices on a year-over-year basis was again impactful to the reduced pricing. Net revenues increased 1.7% to $594 million in the second quarter. Net revenue growth slowed as the quarter progressed. Per business day, net revenue growth in each of the months was 9%, 0% and negative 3% for April through June. The primary reason for the sequential results was the fact that the change in truckload pricing and cost per mile crossed over in June and now into July, as our price per mile to the customers is going down more than our costs on a year-over-year basis. Andy will talk more to this in a few slides. 
Though net revenue slowed compared with the past several quarters, our network performed well, achieving a 4.3% net income growth and a 6.4% earnings per share increase. We had earnings per share of $1 in the quarter compared to $0.94 last year. EPS of $1.83 for the first 6 months of the year is a 9.6% increase over the first half of 2015. In terms of some of the highlights for the second quarter, we were able to take market share as we grew volumes across nearly all of our services. Growing our volumes and taking market share in the various cycles continues to be an important part of our long-term strategy. Serving our customers while adjusting to market changes is a strength of ours. We remain very confident in the strength of our model and the ability to react and succeed. We continue to invest in people, technology and our network. Our variable expense model is working well. Pay-for-performance programs and effective capital management help us to grow our EPS in challenging environments like this quarter. Our global headcount grew 4.8% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We've often mentioned that headcount will grow in alignment with our activity or volume and this was the case in the second quarter. Our long-term strategy is working, and we continue with our initiatives to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. 
With that overview, I'm going to now turn it over to Andy to go through results by service offering."

The Robinson team did a great job of taking market share in the quarter, as we increased our global shipment count by over 200,000. We are proud of this statistic, as it demonstrates that customers are voting for our services. Volume growth was driven across multiple modes and through several industry verticals with e-commerce, automotive and telecom being a few of the areas with large increases in volume and net revenue. We continue to receive accolades from our customers and in the industry, as we were recently named the #1 3PL by Inbound Logistics for the sixth year in a row. We were also named Best Logistic Provider of Air Freight at the 2016 Asia Freight Logistics and Supply Chain Awards. These distinctions are a credit to the more than 13,500 Robinson employees across the globe, who work every day to help our customers win. 
Though it is a challenging environment, the network continues to connect with more and more companies around the world. During the quarter, we had nearly 20 million web and mobile interactions with customers and carriers. This is a sequential increase of over 30% from the beginning of the year. Transportation net revenues increased 1.5% to $556.5 million in the quarter. Net revenue margin increased 180 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily the result of lower purchase transportation cost, including the lower cost of fuel. Additionally, we have seen the mix shift in the type of freight we are moving to the higher-margin businesses and the services we provide. As we have discussed in the past, our net revenue margin is an output, and there are many variables that influence it. The second quarter is a good example of that, as we saw our net revenue growth slow, while the margin increased. As John mentioned, lower pricing in some of our key services makes it more challenging to grow net revenues. 
Moving on to Slide 5. We have taken information that we have been publicly providing since 2008, and put it into a graphical form. Hopefully, it will be additive to the commentary about the secular and cyclical aspects of our business and industry. The light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North American truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers net of fuel cost over time. The orange line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. There has been a lot of commentary from analysts and transportation providers in regards to the cyclical and secular changes. This visual illustrates in our results that change is a rather constant factor in our business. Part of the value that we bring to customers and carriers is helping them manage the rate of change that occurs. 
When we think about this chart in our business from a secular perspective, there are many factors to consider. One of the most interesting is that during the time period presented, the average price and cost net of fuel have increased approximately 2%. So with all the ups and downs, the truckload pricing has been inflationary. We have talked a lot about the fact that our business has become more committed with now between 50% and 60% of our truckload volume contracted. Both shippers and purchasers of logistic services value our ability to understand the market, and manage their transportation spend for their budgeting and planning initiatives. You may notice that the price and cost lines have moved closer together over time. The access to information about pricing and equipment availability has led to faster responses in many ways, which certainly include pricing. We feel like our network has done an excellent job adjusting to the markets and adapting quickly to these changes. And finally, the chart illustrates that over the past 8.5 years, we have had nearly an equal number of quarters where the percent change and purchase transportation cost exceeded the percent change in price and vice versa. These changes are one of the factors that impact margins, which have also varied over time. 
Slide 6 covers our truckload results. Truckload net revenue decreased 1.4% in the second quarter, as volumes increased 3%. Pricing was again down in the quarter, as you saw in the previous slide, as customer pricing net of fuel decreased 7.5% versus last year's second quarter, and purchase transportation cost net of fuel fell 8%. Truckload market condition changed throughout the quarter, and in June, these lines actually inverted. For the first time in the last 2 years, the percent change in price per mile to carriers decreased less than the percent change cost to customers. For the quarter, our net revenue decreased $0.02 per mile, which is the primary reason our truckload net revenue fell when compared to last year. 
All that being said, there are many positives in the quarter, and we achieved 3% truckload volume growth in a market where overall demand was down. We captured more share in June, and thus far in July, we have seen volume growth accelerate. June volumes increased 4%, and to date in July, truckload volume is up 7% on a per-day basis. Kudos to the team for reacting to the current market dynamics. 
Our carrier services team again did another great job by adding 4,400 new carriers in the quarter. This is a record high for us, coming off a very successful 2015. These new carriers moved over 25,000 loads. We had nearly 40,000 active carriers in the quarter and we continued to see a lot of diversity in our carrier base. Carriers with less than 100 trucks moved just over 80% of our shipments, and larger carriers moved about 20%. So the key indicators for our truckload business in terms of carrier relationships and customers choosing Robinson look very good. We do have some tough comparables in the back half of the year, but we knew that was the case and have been preparing. Our network will focus on servicing our customers and adapting to the market conditions. 
Onto Slide 7 and our Less than Truckload results. Our LTL business had another strong growth quarter. Net revenues increased 9% to just shy of $100 million. Volumes increased 7% when compared to the second quarter last year. Pricing was down slightly, as one would expect, with fuel being down, and net revenue margins increased again. Temperature control was a standout area, as that portion of the LTL business grew 60%. This specialized service has been growing even faster than the overall service line, and that team is doing a great job, expanding the service within our portfolio of customers. 
We have received a lot of questions about the growth drivers in our truck LTL business. The team and network have made tremendous strides over the past years, and the strength of our program centers around: one, our vast carrier network; two, our ability to execute all shipment sizes from parcel to pallets; and probably three, most importantly, our people and technology allow us to optimize and cater the LTL offering to the unique needs of each of our customers. We are able to deliver comprehensive solutions to clients that cover their needs across a broad range from final mile delivery of small packages and parcels to the consolidation and distribution of dry, fresh and frozen products. We are adding new customers in this service line faster than any other in North America, and we expect this trend to continue. We continue to build on our industry-leading position in LTL, and feel good about our opportunities going forward. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 8. Intermodal net revenue decreased 21.8% in the quarter, as volumes decreased 13%. Net revenue margins decreased in the quarter, as a higher percent of our volume is in lower-margin contractual business. The team has worked really hard to grow this service, but we are fighting a tough industry trend. Our successes in the quarter came from our committed business, as volumes in this area increased, as we have been winning some large contractual bids over the past couple of quarters. Those wins, however, have not been enough to offset the losses in transactional volume on a year-over-year basis. The low truckload pricing and available truckload capacity environment will be a headwind for the business into the third quarter. 
Transitioning to Slide 9 and our global forwarding services business. Second quarter net revenue in global forwarding services were $91.8 million, an increase of 2.4% from 2015's second quarter. We are pleased with our cross-selling initiatives as they yielded many new customers and new net revenue. Further, we are proud of maintaining our status as the #1 NVOCC from China to the U.S. Ocean net revenue was up 1.7%. Air net revenues increased 2.7% and customs grew 5.8%. During the quarter, ocean shipments increased approximately 6%, and air shipments were up 20%, which is a clear indication of our team's strong performance and ability to take market share. Pricing continued to be down in the quarter, with total revenue per shipment down over 20% in both ocean and air services. 
Slide 10 covers our other logistics services. The services in this group include transportation management services, warehousing, parcel and small package. Net revenues increased 24% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. TMC, which is our managed services business, represents approximately 60% of the net revenue in this area. TMC net revenue increased 30% in the second quarter and is currently on pace to service over $3 billion in freight under management in 2016. This business is another one of our fast-growing segments. Customers continue to look for new and better ways to execute their supply chains, and TMC is a great example of how we are able to add services to meet the increased demand for outsourced solutions by combining our Navisphere TMS technology and 3PL outsourcing. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 11. Sourcing net revenues increased 5.7% in the second quarter. Congratulations to the entire Robinson Fresh team. The net revenue growth was primarily the result of 3% case volume growth across a variety of commodities and services and an increase in net revenue per case. Net revenue margin increased 40 basis points in the quarter, which was primarily the result of a change in the mix of commodities and services sold. 
I will now transition to Slide 11 and a review of our summarized income statement. Personnel expenses increased 2.4%, primarily driven by an average headcount growth of 5.2% in the quarter. Our headcount growth is often closely correlated to the activity and volume growth, and this was again the case in the second quarter. As I mentioned in a previous slide, our ability to combine electronic customer and carrier connectivity with talented professionals will continue to allow us to drive productivity improvements. SG&A expenses decreased 0.8% in the second quarter. As John said earlier, the Robinson business model worked well, as a reduction in variable compensation and lower SG&A expenses on a year-over-year basis helped us to achieved higher net income growth than net revenue growth which is always our goal. We were also able to convert revenue to profits at a higher rate of 39.3%, a 10% -- pardon me, a 10 basis point improvement from the same period last year. 
Moving on to Slide 13 and other financial information. We had another strong cash flow quarter, generating just over $143 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $26.2 million in the second quarter and $44 million year-to-date. We continue to expect capital expenditures to finish the year between $70 million and $80 million. The increase on a year-over-year basis is the result of the cost associated with the building of our second data center. We finished the quarter with $965 million in debt and $207 million in cash. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, Slide 14 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $88 million to our shareholders in the quarter, with $63.6 million in dividends and $23.9 million in share repurchases. Again, thank you very much to everyone at Robinson for a solid second quarter, and thank you, all, as well for listening in. 
With that, I will now turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions."

Before we move on to the pre-submitted questions, I'll take just a couple of minutes to wrap up with some final comments. Coming into the year, we planned that we would continue to add to our team and be aggressive going after market share, and that's exactly what we're doing. We're growing our volume in nearly all of our services. As Andy mentioned, our truckload volume growth has increased the past 2 months and is pacing at a 7% per-day business increase in July. Europe's growth in both service transportation and global forwarding is accelerating. The Freightquote team continues to perform well and deliver strong results. Our outsource services, including TMC, are delivering consistent double-digit growth. There are a lot of bright spots across our business, and we feel good about how we are executing and our long-term opportunities for growth. 
Our July to date total company net revenue has decreased approximately 2% per business day. This decrease is primarily the result of lower net revenue per shipment in the truckload service line. Andy's comments covered what we're seeing in truckload pricing. We also know that the truckload net revenue margins for the second half of 2015 were on the high side of our historic ranges, making for challenging comparisons. As I shared in my opening comments, we pride ourselves on maintaining great execution, while we adjust to the market cycles. However, net revenue growth in truckload services is more challenging in this environment. 
If you look at our historical performance, we've been very consistent at delivering EPS growth that approximate or exceeds our net revenue growth. We achieve this through variable cost, productivity gains and efficient capital management. We continue to focus on all of these components of our business model, as we believe it's the right combination to motivate our team, serve customers and carriers more efficiently and create shareholder value. 
With that, we'll now move to the Q&A part of our call."

As we discussed previously on our last call, in the first quarter of this year, we elected APB 23, and asserted that we will indefinitely reinvest the earnings of those foreign subsidiaries to support the expansion of our international business, where the opportunities are large and the tax rates are lower. As a result, our effective tax rate is now lower. Our foreign operations in the aggregate continue to perform well, and therefore, we expect the effective tax rate to remain in the low 37% range."

So that from a comparability standpoint, July is probably fairly typical of what we're going to see in the third quarter from a comparison standpoint. In Andy and my prepared comments, we talked about that chart that we added and the fact that volumes have accelerated during the months of June and July, and that with that has come the margin compression and the turn in those cost and price comparisons that the graph showed. So we don't really know where we go from here in terms of have we hit bottom. We know that the months of June and July felt different and that it's a normal part of the cycle when we start to see volume accelerating and margins starting to turn.

The fact that our volumes are accelerating: we have been for several years now, and really, it's a permanent part of our culture to be looking at our productivity, our business practices and our job families around being ready to handle that additional volume when the market makes it available to us.

Effective July 1, so at the beginning of Q3 here, there were some global rules that went in place. I think there's more than 150 countries involved and a lot of complexity in terms of how it's being implemented, but the basic idea is to capture more accurate and better information about the weights in all of these containers. We have done a fair amount of work leading up to July 1 to make sure that all of our global forwarding customers are prepared to be compliant, and we do feel good about the status of our compliance at this point. Because it's a complex rule with a lot of implementation, a lot of different interpretation and enforcement practices around the world in all these various countries, we do think it's a topic that's going to continue to evolve and require some further conversation and some further modification and evolution of how that goes, but it's been in place for several weeks now. It's been very similar to some of the domestic regulation changes that we've seen over the last 5 or 6 years that it is focused largely on safety and data gathering and the information around that.

So we are seeing growth with those long-term committed relationships. I think it's also been fairly well publicized that the spot market activity in June and July has increased pretty meaningfully as well too, and we certainly are seeing that and participating in it. As the world has gotten more sophisticated and more participants have more data, there's a lot of opportunity for people to route their freight within contracts or go within spotted marks.

Our best estimates today and for the second quarter of 2016 would be that we're about 60% committed and about 40% spot market or more transactional in our North America truckload business. The longer-term trend on that is if you go back a couple of decades, we were in the 90-plus-percent spot market. We were much more of a transactional truck broker in the marketplace. Over the last couple of decades, we've evolved into the scale and the capabilities to handle those larger committed relationships with, generally, the larger shippers that are out there in the marketplace. As we've grown into that capability of being a core carrier and working on committed freight, that has become a larger and larger percentage of our business. Our best estimate based on tracking the types of shipments that we do, like I said, is that 60-40 relationship with committed freight probably being a little bit more than half of it now. I've said this in the past, but as a reminder, one of the reasons why these are estimates and it's hard is because there are unique customer contracts, and there are thousands of them across our networks. And there are different definitions of commitment and what commitment means and what the pricing relationships are. So what may seem like a fairly simple concept, then able to quantify it, when you get into the weeds on this, there is quite a variation of contracts and what commitments mean. They don't all start and stop at the same date as well too. And with many of those customer relationships, we're interacting with them in different lanes on a variety of committed and spot market activity. So the actual execution and quantification of these is more complex than it might sound, but at a very high level, it's about a 60-40 relationship."

And through the Phoenix acquisition, about 3.5 years ago, we've been successful at not only really increasing the size and substance of our global forwarding division, but over that period of time, integrating and improving the operation so that our combined global forwarding business over the last several quarters has reached the level of profitability that we think is sustainable and is contributing nicely to the value that we're creating. So what that means is when we think shorter term about the question around second half of '16 and kind of what's the outlook for our global forwarding business, today, it's sort of down to similar to North America, where if the net revenue growth is there, we feel like there's a fairly predictable amount of operating income and results that will come from that. So we have good momentum in growing our global forwarding activity right now. So we feel positive about the second half outlook and the taking of market share and the continued growth of our global forwarding network. As most of you probably know, the macro environment around pricing in the ocean area, in particular, is pretty challenging right now. And so similar to the truckload side of it, it will probably be more about margins and margin fluctuation in the second half going forward, depending upon overall market conditions, now that we have a more stable and mature global forwarding activity. So just like the truckload side, we feel good about our execution. We feel good about market share and volume gains. Margin comparisons and margin activity in global forwarding on the second half of the year will likely be the challenge."

When prices are declining, as they have for the last couple of years, historically, and what would logically end a cycle like that is when the capacity side finds the bottom: begins to say no to price reductions or further price decreases and/or some of them fail or go out of business or make the decision that it's no longer economically viable to operate at those rates. So there have been data points in the marketplace about increased bankruptcy or increased churn in the supply side. So the data points that we monitor around that is we're constantly looking for new sources of capacity. And as you saw, our new carrier sign-ups in the quarter were very healthy. That could be a byproduct of our efforts to reach out and find capacity. It can also be a byproduct of capacity that's looking for freight more aggressively and checking for more sites or more shippers or more third parties to look for that capacity. So similar to many of the other comments that we've made, there are some data points that would suggest that the churn in the capacity is ticking up a little bit or maybe starting to happen. We have not seen kind of widespread tightness or shortness of capacity that oftentimes comes at this part of the cycle. While we have seen volume increases and margin compression, there has generally been available capacity. It's still more around the pricing metric at this time than just where you might see a complete absence of capacity and have to wait 1 day or 2 to ship freight that you would have otherwise preferred to ship on that date. So that's the color that we can add about what we're seeing on the capacity side and the relationships with our carriers."

That the kind of core premise of the business model is that we're going to earn and grow as much net revenue as we can, and that net revenue gets shared variably to the team at Robinson as well as profitability and shareholder value. We're constantly looking at productivity gains to try to make sure that, hopefully, our operating income and our earnings grow as fast or faster than our net revenue, and our track record on that has been pretty positive. We also focus on capital management and share repurchases to make sure that, hopefully, our EPS is growing faster than our net income. So if you look at our historical results, I think that's one of the very positive attributes of our business model is that constant productivity and efficiency, that constant high return on capital that allows us to repurchase shares and allows us to grow our EPS faster. So those are the key kind of macro levers that we can pull in terms of how we're going to attempt to grow our earnings and continue to grow our EPS regardless of where the net revenue might shake out. I also said on that call, though, that in our prepared comments, that when you get into that part of the cycle that we might be experiencing on the truckload side, as you've seen in our past, it does make for shorter periods of time in the cycle where growing that North America truckload net revenue is more challenging. And when that happens, since it's such a material part of our business, it does create challenge in growing the net revenue. So we've been doing this for many decades, and we think we're pretty good at it, and I think the track record speaks for itself in terms of creating shareholder value and we will continue to work on those pillars of our model to do that going forward."

We've been publishing it for years. We just wanted to put it in a graphical form to, hopefully, explain and really show a couple of the key themes as well as the trends. And what we hope the chart shows is a couple of things: one, the cyclical and overall inflationary nature of pricing, right? Since 2008, as John mentioned, it's been up on average 2%, both the price to the customers as well as the cost to the carriers, and you can see the fluctuations that have happened within that. The second is the fact that pricing can change rapidly. There are periods in which it's gone up double digits and there are periods in which it's gone down double digits from a quarter-to-quarter basis. Third issue is, as the question referenced, there's a cosmetic impact of fuel. When fuel is lower, the margin is higher and vice versa, but it's a purely cosmetic impact to the net revenue margin percentage. Another key theme is that those lines tend to converge. As information becomes more readily available, the lines converge between pricing to customers and the cost to the carriers. Our customers are smart as well as our carriers are smart. What we do, as I mentioned earlier, we help them manage the rate of change and the pace of change on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And then I would say, finally, on that net revenue margin comment, that margin has trended up over time versus traditional truckload. So we've added higher margin relative to truckload services such as LTL, such as global forwarding, and you see the impact that it has going back to 2012 all the way now to 2016. There is a shift change with higher-margin business, higher margin being relative to truckload."

Starting with kind of the 60-40 mix that there is about 60% of the North America truckload business that is prepriced or through a committed relationship where there's generally a 1-year price expectation. Again, as we've talked in the past, there is not a set date or a certain pattern around how and when those contacts renew. So even though there is a decent component of our freight that has more of an annual pricing expectation to it, there is a constant renewal or an annual process to that, that results with maybe more like an effective 6 months duration around what type of committed pricing is out there. Also, when you get into the relationship between committed pricing and spot market pricing, a lot of the relationships that we work with, we may have committed rates in place but be accepting volumes above and beyond the committed volume activity that went with that committed pricing. So as we've talked in the past, if we do continue to see more of a floor and we do continue to see a shift in the marketplace around the supply and demand cycle in that, the same things that have always happened in the past will continue to happen. I mentioned the carrier churn in the previous question. All parties will start to tighten their contractual monitoring in terms of making sure that only the committed volume is moving at committed pricing and making sure that spot market activity is better identified and better priced separately, and shippers will be reacting to those as well too. One of the many reasons why we charted out some of the information that we've been sharing over the last 8 or 9 years was to show you, and hopefully, give you a sense that while the markets have become more volatile and that prices are probably moving up and down a little bit more aggressively over the last 8, 9 years than they did prior to that, that our relationship between price to customer and cost of capacity have stayed relatively tight and maybe even arguably have stayed closer together over this period of time. So in our comments around being proud about how we react to the market and how we are able to serve customers while balancing these various commitments into the marketplace, that is clearly one of the messages that we're trying to deliver on this call."

We've rebranded that to Navisphere, and it's just been recently released both on the Apple as well as the Android stores for our carriers to download.

And so it's one thing to go out and stand on the corner and get a cab or get a black car to the airport because 5 years ago, it was a regulated industry and there just weren't as many of them out there. But it's entirely another thing to connect a global supply chain with hundreds of thousands of participants and hundreds of thousands of variables and variations that go along with that. So we feel very comfortable of our track record of disintermediating the space because, again, we've been doing it since 1980."

So that's the reason -- the core of why we don't give guidance. What we do feel good about is the things I discussed earlier around our variable cost model and our ability to generate operating income and EPS growth that comes out of that net revenue. So really, the key for the second half of the year is what happens with the net revenue and -- pretty high confidence around our business model and the EPS that will follow from that. So we're going to be focused on maintaining those disciplines, but also managing those buy rates, managing those margins and seeing what kind of market activity happens in the second half of the year. We have not given up on the concept of growing our EPS in the second half of the year, but again, it will have a lot to do with what happens in the cyclicality and the pricing of that margin on the net revenue side."

I want to start by referencing a few of our key financial metrics on that Slide 3. Total revenues of $3.3 billion for the quarter were down 1.9% compared to last year. Total net revenues of $558 million were down 5% from a year ago. Inco",1232,"Thank you, Tim. I want to start by referencing a few of our key financial metrics on that Slide 3. Total revenues of $3.3 billion for the quarter were down 1.9% compared to last year. Total net revenues of $558 million were down 5% from a year ago. 
Income from operations of $211 million was down 9% from a year ago, and our earnings per share of $0.90 compares to $0.96 a year ago or a 6% decline. 
Year-to-date, earnings per share of $2.73 is up 4% from $2.63 a year ago. 
Despite some quarterly decreases in some of our key financial metrics, we do believe that we're making good progress towards achieving our long-term goals. I want to start my prepared comments by discussing a few of the themes that impacted both our third quarter results but also reflect the progress that we're making on those long-term goals. 
 
First topic I want to start with is margin compression. On our second quarter call, we discussed the fact that in the months of June and July, our net revenue had begun to decline due to margin compression. Unfortunately, that margin compression carried on through the third quarter and impacted our results for the third quarter of 2016. Most all of our services had margin decreases versus a year ago during the third quarter. But the point that we want to emphasize is that our margins are within the ranges of what we expect in our long-term planning, and we do accept the cyclicality of our markets as one of the things that we have to manage. 
A big part of the 3PL value, particularly with our committed relationships, is managing the cycles and managing the price variations and margin compression that can occur in the marketplace, and we do feel that we did a good job this quarter of honoring our committed relationships and servicing our customers in a way that was very valuable to the market. So we talk a lot about margin compression internally, and you'll hear a lot about margin compression on the call today impacting our results. 
The next topics regard to market share gains and volume metrics. Andy will cover and you will see a lot of metrics throughout our presentation about shipper growth and volume growth in our freight activity as well as share gains in most of our services. We've talked in the past that a lot of ways this is one of the most important metrics in our business as we have to make sure that we remain relevant in providing increased service levels to our customers and our carrier providers. We'll share the metrics around our shipment activity as well as our capacity sign-up. We feel pretty good about the relevancy of our network in the marketplace and the fact that carriers sign-ups are at very high levels and the services that we're offering around all the choices that those carriers have to interact with our network via mobile application or the Internet or telephone calls or any way that, that capacity deems the right way to interact with our network. So we did have market share gains and volume growth in a lot of our metrics that we'll share today, and that's something that we continue to feel very good about as a foundation for continuing to add value. 
When we think about the margin compression and the relationship to the volume gains and the market share achievements that we've had, we also talked about the fact that we knew we were coming into this year with some challenging comparisons. 
There is a relationship between volume and margin in the second half of 2014 and 2015. We did have some very good results with double-digit net revenue and earnings per share growths in both of those periods of time. And we've talked in the past that our portfolio of business, the vast majority of it, does reprice on an annual basis. And when we think about going after those market share gains and that volume activity, it's important that we're successful doing that during the periods of margin compression and when prices are cycling down because the market is very fluid and, as I said earlier, a lot of our business reprices on an annual basis. 
So overall, when you put those 3 things together, we had challenging comparisons coming into the year. The market cycled down, creating some -margin compression, but we feel very good about our network, our relevancy to our shippers and our capacity providers and the fact that we were able to achieve some good volume growth and market share gains. 
Just a couple of other topics that I want to highlight before I turn it over to Andy, again things that both impacted the third quarter as well as topics that are important to our long-term success. 
We do continue to invest in the most important part of our network, which is our people. We had around a 5% increase in our headcount from the third quarter versus a year ago. And as we invest in those people, we continue to feel very confident about the job families that we have and our approach of how we go to market to make those people successful. 
You'll see that we did have a decrease in personnel costs due to the variable nature of our business model. So that despite the fact that we're continuing to invest in the people that we need to execute our services, we also feel our model is working with regards to how it reacts during different environments. 
The caliber of our people are extremely important, and we've talked in the past that the additions of headcount do tend to correlate more with volume and shipment activities than our net revenue growth. So this -- again, the third quarter reflects our ongoing investment in our network by hiring people and investing in the future capabilities of that network. 
The last topic I would touch on is the acquisition of APC that closed on September 30. In terms of the third quarter impact, it's really mostly the balance sheet numbers that you'll see because of closing on the last day of the quarter. However, it's an important part of our long-term plan that we continue to look at our capital strategies and invest in our network through the right types of M&A activity that we feel can enhance our network. 
We feel really good about this acquisition from a variety of perspective. We had a long operating history with APC through the Phoenix relationship and working as an agent. We feel very good about the cultural compatibility and the capability of the company. There were some very positive things that Andy and his team did around the structure and the capital deployment to make sure that we're reinvesting our capital outside of the United States, just like we had represented that we intended to do. So that also is another important element of how we invested in our network during the quarter and believe that we're positioning ourselves for good success in terms of achieving those long-term goals. 
Those are some of the overall highlights of impact on the quarter that I wanted to share with you. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Andy to walk through the results by service area."
368470,403179123,1061257,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. As John mentioned, we anticipated a challenging pricing and execution environment coming into the second half of this year. I knew last year's comparables would be difficult. Our peo",1968,"Thank you, John. And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. 
As John mentioned, we anticipated a challenging pricing and execution environment coming into the second half of this year. I knew last year's comparables would be difficult. Our people and our network did a great job managing through the environment by being proactive in serving customers in order to be the provider of choice at a time when routing guides are performing largely as planned. 
Total transportation revenues were down slightly in the quarter to just under $3 billion. However, total revenues were up on a year-over-year basis in both August and September, and that positive trend has continued into October. The growth month-to-date in October is a result of our significant volume improvements as well as the fact that fuel is normalizing on a year-over-year basis. In October, our truckload volumes are up over 12%, clearly outperforming the market. 
Transportation net revenue margin decreased approximately 80 basis points from last year's third quarter. Though below last year, this margin is on the upper end of our historical third quarter margins over the last 5 to 6 years. 
The decrease in net revenue margin was primarily the result of truckload pricing falling more than purchased transportation cost, impacting margins by approximately 140 basis points. That decrease was partially offset by the positive impact of fuel of approximately 20 basis points and then the change of our mix of services of approximately 40 basis points. 
As we did in last quarter's presentation, we have included Slide 5, which provides a longer historical perspective of pricing and costs and their respective impact on our margins and results. 
On this graph, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North America truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers, net of fuel costs over time. The orange line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. 
You can see by looking at the light and dark blue lines that in this year's third quarter, there is a separation where the rate of change in our price to customers fell faster than the rate paid to carriers. In last year's third quarter in comparison, the opposite was true, where our costs were falling at a faster rate than price. 
This chart also highlights the volatility of our business. This year's third quarter also represents the first time in 9 quarters where the cost line was above the price line, which has impacted business results over the past couple of years. 
One of the many things our customers ask us to do is provide contractual rates and access to capacity to avoid some of the highs and lows in the markets so they're better able to plan their transportation spend. There are times when this contractual commitment will benefit our results and other times when they will not. Our ability to provide this type of service is one of the reasons shippers choose Robinson as a core provider in their businesses. During the quarter, our committed or contractual business represented approximately 62% of our truckload volume, which is in line with the past several quarters. 
We often speak about the uncertainty of how the market will perform looking ahead. We're not sure if we have reached the bottom of the decreased pricing environment that we have seen this year, but the third quarter did see some improvement in pricing. We don't feel like there has been a big change in the market as demand continues to be tepid, but things do seem a little bit better sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter to date. 
Moving on this Slide 6 and our truckload results. Truckload net revenues were $309 million, a decrease of 10.4% in the third quarter. Truckload volumes, however, increased 7.5%, and this growth was a result of an increase in shipments across all of our services from dry van, flatbed to temperature controlled. We also saw volume increase growth across all of our mileage bands from short to long haul segments. 
As mentioned earlier, for the first time in 9 quarters, customer pricing was down more than carrier cost. Customer pricing, net of fuel, was down 5.5% versus last year's third quarter. And purchase transportation cost, net of fuel, was down 3.5%. 
We again added 4,200 new carriers in the third quarter. These new carriers moved nearly 18,000 shipments for us in the quarter. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of the fourth quarter and into 2017, we don't expect a significant change in the North American market. And we will remain focused on growing our volumes and executing a balanced approach to taking profitable market share. 
Moving to Slide 7 in the less than truckload results. Net revenues in our LTL business grew 2.4% to $96.4 million. Volumes increased 5% when compared to the third quarter of last year. Pricing, however, was down slightly, and net revenue margins held flat during the quarter. 
This quarter's growth slowed a bit when compared to the first 2 quarters of the year as the size of our shipments were down on a year-over-year basis and the lower-priced truckload market is having an impact on LTL demand. We continue to be confident in our leading position in LTL and our ability to offer a compelling solution for our customers. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 8. Intermodal net revenues decreased 24.5% in the quarter while volumes were approximately flat. As has been the case for 4 quarters, the overall intermodal market has been challenged by the loose truck market and volumes have suffered. We did achieve approximately 15% volume growth in the quarter with our large strategic customers. The trend has been positive for the past few quarters with these larger, more committed customers. The transactional opportunities, however, continue to be scarce, which is the primary reason for our net revenue decrease in the quarter. As we have mentioned in previous quarters, the lower truckload pricing is limiting the long-haul intermodal opportunities. 
Moving on to the global forwarding business on Slide 9. Third quarter net revenues in our global forwarding services were $88.7 million, a 2.1% decrease from 2015's third quarter. Ocean net revenues were down 3.1%, air net revenues decreased 1.7% while customs grew 2.6%. 
Ocean shipments increased approximately 5% in the quarter, and pricing continued to be down with total revenue per shipment off double digits in the ocean service line. The pricing environment, especially in the trans-Pacific lane, did change in September as a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy filing.  Hanjin is not a core carrier for Robinson, so we were able to provide great service to our customers. I think [ph] what surprised us and the rest of the industry was the degree to which the remaining carriers raised their rates over the short term, sometimes as much a $750 to $900 per container. This situation did pressure our ocean margins in September, and it took a few weeks for our account managers to revise pricing with customers. 
As John mentioned earlier, we made an investment in the global forwarding business at the end of the quarter with the acquisition of APC Logistics. We are very excited to have APC as part of the Robinson global forwarding team. The addition of 9 offices and 313 employees in Australia and New Zealand strengthens our global value proposition. The integration is proceeding quickly and smoothly, and we are excited about our combined ability to grow with their customers in Asia and Europe. 
We had a strong quarter, growing air shipment volume approximately 18%. This has been a strategic focus for us, and the double-digit volume increase is a result of an environment where demand is generally soft. Despite the strong volume growth, we continue to see weak pricing, down double digits, that led to a decrease in net revenue. 
Moving to other logistic services on Slide 10. Net revenues increased 31% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year, led by the continued strong performance at TMC. The managed services business represents approximately 65% of the net revenue in this category. Managed services net revenue increased 29% in the third quarter and is currently on pace to service over $4 billion in freight under management in 2016. 
The growth we are seeing in the managed services is a result of our global investments over the past decade. We are seeing double-digit growth in Europe, Asia and South America in addition to the 24% growth in North America. 
The managed services business leverages our Navisphere technology platform, providing visibility, control and deep integration across supply chain partners while providing process management and consulting services to drive continuous improvement in our customers' supply chains. Congratulations to the TMC and IT teams involved in onboarding Microsoft. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 11. Congratulations to the Robinson team for growing sourcing net revenues 4.7% in the third quarter. The net revenue growth was primarily the result of a 6.4% case volume growth, offset by a decrease in net revenue per case. The 6.4% case growth was driven by strong performance in the food service segment and our strategic and key commodities. 
I will now transition to Slide 12 and a review of our summarized income statement. For the third quarter, operating expenses decreased 2.4% to $347 million. Personal expenses decreased 2.7%, primarily driven by lower variable compensation, incentives and partially offset by an average headcount growth of 4.5% in the quarter. As John mentioned, we've been making strategic investments in headcount throughout the year to grow volumes. 
SG&A expenses decreased 1.6% in the third quarter primarily due to a lower provision for bad debt and lower claims in this year's third quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. The combined impact of these 2 expense items were approximately $6 million in the quarter. We are pleased with our credit and finance results as they reflect the quality of our customers and receivable balance. 
Our operating income as a percent of net revenue was 37.8%, a decrease of 170 basis points from last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 36.7% versus 38.5% last year. We did have a onetime tax benefit from an item related to the Freightquote acquisition that increased the earnings per share by approximately $0.01. The remainder of the improvement versus last year was the election of APB 23 in the first quarter of this year. 
On to Slide 13 and other financial information. We generated nearly $130 million in cash in the quarter and had just over $27 million in capital expenditures. 
Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $377 million, and year-to-date capital expenditures were approximately $71 million, reflecting the build-out of our second data center. 
We finished the quarter with $224 million in cash, and our debt balance is $1.225 billion with $500 million at 4.28% and $725 million on the revolver with a current rate of 1.52%. The debt balance increased at the end of the quarter as we utilized the revolver for a portion of the purchase price of APC, which closed on September 30. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, Slide 14 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter with $63 million in dividends and approximately $67 million in share repurchases. In the third quarter, we returned 101% of our net income to shareholders. And year-to-date, we have returned 86%. 
Again, our thanks to everyone at Robinson for a solid third quarter in a challenging environment. Thank you all as well for listening in. 
With that, I will turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions."

In terms of wrapping up our prepared remarks on Slide 15 with regards to our final comments, really the first 2 bullet points tie into the opening messages around margin compression and volume growth. As you see there, we continue to have strong North America truckload volume growth at 12% that Andy mentioned as well as some ongoing margin compression, resulting in a net revenue decrease of approximately 4% per business day so far in October. 
Once again, we do have some strong comparisons from the fourth quarter of a year ago that we'll be dealing with that are helping make that net revenue growth a little bit more challenging. But overall, the major themes carry forward in that we continue to feel very good about our service levels, the relevance of our offering in the marketplace and the mixture of volume and margin compression that we're dealing with in the marketplace. 
On the bottom of Slide 15, just a couple of other topics to share a few thoughts with before we get into the Q&A. We've hit on this theme a couple of times but just wanted to share that we are very excited and feel very good about the initial interactions on APC integration. I mentioned earlier that we do have a long-standing relationship with them through our agency agreement. The companies of APC and Robinson have worked together successfully for a long time, but integrating our businesses is going to provide yet another opportunity to share information and to kind of jointly market what we think is a more effective way. 
There are some agent relationships, both within C.H. Robinson and APC, that are transitioning during the fourth quarter of 2016, so there is a lot of activity associated with that. But we feel very good about our approach to the market and the progress that we're making on that thus far. 
There will also be some additional IT integration that we'll be accomplishing in the next few quarters to come. But overall, again, just something that we feel very good as the perfect type of network investment and capital allocation that we want to do to continue to strengthen our network and wanted to share with you that we're off to a great start with some early customer wins and feeling about how we're progressing with that. 
In addition, the results of APC are not included in the comments above with regards to the net revenue today, so the results of APC, when included in the fourth quarter, hopefully will improve our net revenue by a couple of percent. We do believe the acquisition will be modestly accretive going forward in each of the periods. 
The last bullet point on here about confidence in our network is something that we talk about frequently, but I think it's worth mentioning to just call out again both the confidence that we do have in our team and the relevance of the 3PL model. 
When you think about the changes in the marketplace and the lack of the predictability that happens within the transportation marketplace, some of the things that just sort of go unnoticed at times are things like a significant hurricane in the Southeast this quarter, the large ocean carrier bankruptcy that was mentioned and all of the rerouting and service opportunities that had to come from that. There's every quarter some good examples of how the 3PL model and how the Robinson network really plays an important role in the marketplace to absorb some of that volatility and improve services and react to a lot of things that happen in the marketplace that are important to the shippers and the providers out there that we do that. 
So I just wanted to close again by saying that there's a lot of change going on, there's going to be a lot of pricing activity, there's a lot of volume happening in the network, a lot of changes. And we just feel really good about our network and our ability to react and succeed in any of those environments and re-establishing the value and relevance of our network to the marketplace. 
So with that, that concludes our prepared comments. And I would like to turn it back to Tim to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

If you start with the long-term perspective, the part of what we have said is that we accept the cyclicality and the margin expansion and compression that happens in our model, particularly as we move into more committed relationships, where we have fixed pricing on the shippers side for a period of time and often more transaction or fluid procurement costs. So it's very fundamental, as we've said in the prepared comments, to how we approach the market and how we try to add value. And the way we think about margin expansion and compression is kind of monitoring it over the long term to make sure that we're within the parameters and boundaries of what we've set as expectations around how things are going to cycle. So from a long-term perspective, we don't get concerned when we see margin expansion and compression. We just focus on our business processes and making sure that we're reacting in what we think is the proper way to make sure that we're adjusting, much along the chart that Andy talked us through around how customer pricing and carrier pricing are changing and making sure that those blue lines stay close together over time to manage that. So from a long-term perspective, we're not concerned about it in terms of it happening because we do plan for it and it's part of our business model. From a short-term perspective, we are concerned about it. We have a lot of things that we do to adjust pricing and a lot of management processes that are very focused on making sure that we are adapting and managing prices. And we talked about comparisons and we try to share as much as we can about what is happening with margin compression or margin expansion. So hopefully, we've shared what we know about that and whether or not somebody should be more or less concerned about it. In the short term, I think we're doing all that we can to manage through it. In the long term, we feel like it's part of our business model that we've dealt with for decades."

So that's the month-by-month of the double-digit net revenue growth that I mentioned from a year ago that we're comparing to. You may also remember that those 2015 numbers did have some Freightquote growth in there that I think we quantified at about 3% contribution to the growth. But still double digit without the acquisition of Freightquote from a year ago. So that's month by month and the growth that we referenced with regards to the comparisons coming into this quarter of -- in 2016. When are the contractual agreements typically renegotiated? We've talked about this quite a bit. So most of the contracts will have 30-day outs for either side so that there's an expectation of an annual commitment from a pricing standpoint, and typically with 30-day notice from either party in terms of if you want to terminate the arrangement. The vast majority of the business gets repriced when a shippers originates a new bid process to take a look at that price or when the providers come up and say that they can no longer service the business under those price arrangements. We do have a disproportionate amount of bid activity typically in the springtime, so there's more of an annual cycle to that. So as we said in our prepared comments, we are constantly looking at pricing, looking at committed arrangements versus transactional arrangements. There's always bid activity happening in the marketplace, and we'll see more of it around year-end and in the springtime as everybody looks at their pricing arrangements and thinks about what's appropriate going forward."

And I guess one of the things to reiterate is that very much like earnings season, the -- part of the challenge in this is that there's an element of what's expected versus what's actually occurring. When you come into a year like 2015, we've mentioned -- or 2016, we've mentioned a couple of times that shipper expectations were generally for fairly meaningful price reductions. So if you look at bid activity a year ago, these bids typically have lots of parties, they're very efficient, there might be multiple rounds of electronic bidding. And it's not any one person or any one expectation, but there's a consensus that comes out of those bid processes around what a shipper is expecting and how the market responds to it. A year ago, there were many bid activities that achieved mid-single or high single-digit rate decreases as a result of those bid processes. You can see during our third quarter here we had a 5.5% decrease in terms of the pricing that we charged to shippers. As the year goes on then, what we're experiencing is a more fluid or transactional procurement of a lot of those truckload costs. So while during the quarter they were down 3.5%, they were not down the 5.5% that was achieved in the lot of the committed bid relationships that we work with on the shipper side. So when we get into the third quarter and we have committed pricing from bids and you mix that in with a current transactional market that again is softer than a year ago but maybe not quite as soft as people expected, that's when those blue lines on our margin graph get some separation and we see the margin compression. So the -- really, the bottom, if you will, or the tipping point that may have occurred during the third -- second and third quarter of this year is really a function not so much of prices starting to go up versus a year ago but cost increases being more than were expected when a lot of those committed relationships were entered into. So it's challenging. It's part of the reason why it's difficult to predict because you're dealing with a lot of changes in the marketplace and the management of expectations and bid processes versus what then ultimately occurs. But as I said in the previous question, we view it as one of our strengths that we have, the types of account management processes and relationships to adjust to how the market does actually change. And we focus on that 10-year graph of showing that over time, we've been very successful at making sure that our pricing relationships and our cost relationships do adjust together."

We will also then redeploy those earnings in areas outside the United States. The APC deal is a great example of this reallocation of capital because Australia's corporate tax rate is 30%, which is lower than U.S. tax rate. So as more of our earnings are generated outside of the United States, the effective tax rate will go down. Now mind you, we still generate a significant amount of our earnings and that income inside the United States. But as more capital is deployed outside the United States, where the tax rates are lower, the effective tax rate of our organization will continue to go down. So we do expect it to be below the 38.5% into the range of 37%."

As I mentioned in the prepared comments, because we do look at our hiring practice as very much correlated around volume and growth of shipment metrics, we do expect to continue to add to our team in the remainder of 2016 and likely going into 2017 as well. When we have periods of margin compression, we do get a little bit more conservative in terms of thinking about our headcounts and just like so far this year where we've had headcount growth less than our volume growth, I would expect that in Q4 in 2017 as well, too. The combination of productivity initiatives, using technology to automate and just managing our expectations more aggressively when we're in a period of margin compression, all of those lead to probably slightly more conservative hiring practices. However, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, when we feel good about the market share gains that we're having and investing in the network, we will continue to look at how we build on our team and add to it."

Our people are in front of our customers everyday and staying relevant to them. Now, are we making as much as we did last year? No, but that's part of our business model, part of our cycle. As to the sustainability, well, that depends. We'll emphasize as we always have balance and profitable growth. I just want to take a step back for a moment and reflect on some of our key year-to-date performances. Truckload volumes up 5%, and that's off of a very large base; LTL volume is up 7%, again, off a very large base; ocean volumes up 6%, we're still the #1 NVOCC from China to the U.S.; our air volume is up 18%; managed services revenue is up 29%; and sourcing volume is up 6% -- pardon me, 7%. The point is that while this quarter is not stellar, I think it's helpful to take a slightly longer-term view and look at the trends as well."

And we've all discussed the fact that ocean pricing in many of the lanes had dropped down to levels that clearly were not sustainable for the steamship lines. The fact that a bankruptcy occurred fairly abruptly and prices moved somewhat abruptly, similar to comments in truckload, we are seeing some examples like that of volatility and aggressive movement of margin that maybe didn't occur quite the same 10 or 20 years ago. But all of that activity is typical in terms of the reduction or addition of supply as the marketplace waivers. So similar to the broad comments I made about the enterprise, the fact that there's volatility and margins are moving around is well within the boundaries of what we think we're going to need to do in our long-term plans. Since the additional investment in Phoenix 4 years ago and now followed on with APC, our team has had great momentum in terms of leveraging the increased scale that we've had to become that #1 NVO from China to North America and really looking at how you leverage scale in a global forwarding business to be more competitive and to provide better service. We've mentioned several times over last year, our additional initiatives in the Airfreight world where again the margins are heavily driven by scale and density, we have to build up your volume and build full pallets to kind of build industry norms around profitability. So our long-term outlook is that we hope to be able to continue to gain scale and improve our margins on Airfreight by building that density. On the ocean freight standpoint, we do feel like we've reached a level of competitiveness and scale where our margins are very good but there are a lot of opportunities to expand corridors like Asia to Europe and North America to Europe where we don't have that same level of volume and activity today. So overall, the team is in a good spot. We like our network, we like the scale and competitiveness as we reach in the some of the primary ocean corridors and we're investing aggressively in other areas and other services to try out to build up with that. So all in all, a very positive outlook for our forwarding business going forward."

Some of the guys are not our customer, so there's no accrual for Hanjin. And then back to the first part, which is overall, Robinson's receivables are down versus last year. The reason they show as being up on the balance sheet is that we closed the APC acquisition on September 30, and we have an opening balance sheet, which is reflected of their numbers. But traditional C.H. Robinson, receivables are downs. So that's the first reason why the reserve is down. The second reason is the quality of the receivables are up. So each our customers receive a D&B rating. And today, there are more dollars in the -- what we call the low risk category of customers. There are more dollars in that low risk category today than there were last year. So therefore, that lowers your reserves. The final category is the agent. And it's it does below 60 and above 60 in terms of our aging categories, there are more dollars today in the less than 60 category than there were last year. Again, if you take high-quality receivables where the amount that is less than 60 is higher than last year, therefore, we have low receivables. As far as looking forward into the future, it's certainly hard to determine or give an accurate prediction as to whether we will take more customers in the low to medium or high risk category or whether those customers will be paying 30, 40 or beyond 60 days.

The color is, we're really excited to have them part of the Robinson global forwarding network. Prior to the acquisition, I think they were the sixth largest forwarder in Australia. The mix of their business, because it's an Asian-based business which primarily ocean and forward customs with a little air import mixed in. I think if you were to categorize, it's roughly 1/3 of it was coming from North America, 1/3 from Europe and 1/3 from Asia. And so because they were an agent-based network, and they were focused primarily on the import, they didn't focus as much on the export market which Australia does have a pretty strong export market. Now that they're part of a global network of company-owned stores that are branded Robinson, they can begin to really sell, as John mentioned, the initial interaction have been incredibly positive, an Australian expert service. And we got teams in the U.S., we've got teams in Europe and teams in Asia that are working on it. Additionally, and we talked a little bit about this, is that we're able to pick up that business that they were traditionally running through agents in Europe and Asia, roughly that was -- for a magnitude 2/3 of the business. So we're excited about the initial returns on picking up their agent businesses in those markets because we have teams on the ground that are working on it today. I would just finally close, it's usually it's very rare to find an acquisition like this where the cultural fit is exceptionally high. They run their operations incredibly tight and incredibly successful, and they fit very well into the Robinson culture and the Robinson team. There are a lot of it incremental and additional opportunities that we look to explore with them. So the color is very positive."

It is tendering it to a traditional asset-based LTL network where they're executing the freight. So from our standpoint, the question becomes how much more of the market can we prove our value proposition to be involved in the transaction to use our technology, to use our routing, to use our tools that help both the shipper and the carrier with a better outcome around doing that. We do feel good about that. We think we can continue to take market share and grow faster than the overall market just by continuing to penetrate our services that are out there. So yes, we do feel very positive about it. And in terms of competitive market, there are some additional LTL third parties or brokers today that maybe there weren't 10 or 15 years ago. But again, as I commented earlier, I think that in some ways provide validation to our business model and how we're adding value, and we'll have to continue to evolve with a more competitive landscape just like we do in all of our other services."

But that being said, our mix between contractual and spot remains fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. When we see disruption, whether it's significant or not, and either supply or demand, that mix shifts. So if we were to see a significant impact capacity to ELDs, which by the way, we don't anticipate, we would expect to see more higher-margin opportunities in the spot market while we will continue to honor our commitments our contractual customers to the terms of the agreement, which usually resets every 160-plus days. So obviously, volume would increase of there's a disruption, and we would take advantage of the spot market I would continue to honor those contracts on the contractual side, but we would also take advantage of in the situation like that where routing guides failed, the further down you go, the more opportunities there are for margin expansion."

I want to start by referencing a few of our key financial metrics on that Slide 3. Total revenues of $3.3 billion for the quarter were down 1.9% compared to last year. Total net revenues of $558 million were down 5% from a year ago. Inco",1232,"Thank you, Tim. I want to start by referencing a few of our key financial metrics on that Slide 3. Total revenues of $3.3 billion for the quarter were down 1.9% compared to last year. Total net revenues of $558 million were down 5% from a year ago. 
Income from operations of $211 million was down 9% from a year ago, and our earnings per share of $0.90 compares to $0.96 a year ago or a 6% decline. 
Year-to-date, earnings per share of $2.73 is up 4% from $2.63 a year ago. 
Despite some quarterly decreases in some of our key financial metrics, we do believe that we're making good progress towards achieving our long-term goals. I want to start my prepared comments by discussing a few of the themes that impacted both our third quarter results but also reflect the progress that we're making on those long-term goals. 
 
First topic I want to start with is margin compression. On our second quarter call, we discussed the fact that in the months of June and July, our net revenue had begun to decline due to margin compression. Unfortunately, that margin compression carried on through the third quarter and impacted our results for the third quarter of 2016. Most all of our services had margin decreases versus a year ago during the third quarter. But the point that we want to emphasize is that our margins are within the ranges of what we expect in our long-term planning, and we do accept the cyclicality of our markets as one of the things that we have to manage. 
A big part of the 3PL value, particularly with our committed relationships, is managing the cycles and managing the price variations and margin compression that can occur in the marketplace, and we do feel that we did a good job this quarter of honoring our committed relationships and servicing our customers in a way that was very valuable to the market. So we talk a lot about margin compression internally, and you'll hear a lot about margin compression on the call today impacting our results. 
The next topics regard to market share gains and volume metrics. Andy will cover and you will see a lot of metrics throughout our presentation about shipper growth and volume growth in our freight activity as well as share gains in most of our services. We've talked in the past that a lot of ways this is one of the most important metrics in our business as we have to make sure that we remain relevant in providing increased service levels to our customers and our carrier providers. We'll share the metrics around our shipment activity as well as our capacity sign-up. We feel pretty good about the relevancy of our network in the marketplace and the fact that carriers sign-ups are at very high levels and the services that we're offering around all the choices that those carriers have to interact with our network via mobile application or the Internet or telephone calls or any way that, that capacity deems the right way to interact with our network. So we did have market share gains and volume growth in a lot of our metrics that we'll share today, and that's something that we continue to feel very good about as a foundation for continuing to add value. 
When we think about the margin compression and the relationship to the volume gains and the market share achievements that we've had, we also talked about the fact that we knew we were coming into this year with some challenging comparisons. 
There is a relationship between volume and margin in the second half of 2014 and 2015. We did have some very good results with double-digit net revenue and earnings per share growths in both of those periods of time. And we've talked in the past that our portfolio of business, the vast majority of it, does reprice on an annual basis. And when we think about going after those market share gains and that volume activity, it's important that we're successful doing that during the periods of margin compression and when prices are cycling down because the market is very fluid and, as I said earlier, a lot of our business reprices on an annual basis. 
So overall, when you put those 3 things together, we had challenging comparisons coming into the year. The market cycled down, creating some -margin compression, but we feel very good about our network, our relevancy to our shippers and our capacity providers and the fact that we were able to achieve some good volume growth and market share gains. 
Just a couple of other topics that I want to highlight before I turn it over to Andy, again things that both impacted the third quarter as well as topics that are important to our long-term success. 
We do continue to invest in the most important part of our network, which is our people. We had around a 5% increase in our headcount from the third quarter versus a year ago. And as we invest in those people, we continue to feel very confident about the job families that we have and our approach of how we go to market to make those people successful. 
You'll see that we did have a decrease in personnel costs due to the variable nature of our business model. So that despite the fact that we're continuing to invest in the people that we need to execute our services, we also feel our model is working with regards to how it reacts during different environments. 
The caliber of our people are extremely important, and we've talked in the past that the additions of headcount do tend to correlate more with volume and shipment activities than our net revenue growth. So this -- again, the third quarter reflects our ongoing investment in our network by hiring people and investing in the future capabilities of that network. 
The last topic I would touch on is the acquisition of APC that closed on September 30. In terms of the third quarter impact, it's really mostly the balance sheet numbers that you'll see because of closing on the last day of the quarter. However, it's an important part of our long-term plan that we continue to look at our capital strategies and invest in our network through the right types of M&A activity that we feel can enhance our network. 
We feel really good about this acquisition from a variety of perspective. We had a long operating history with APC through the Phoenix relationship and working as an agent. We feel very good about the cultural compatibility and the capability of the company. There were some very positive things that Andy and his team did around the structure and the capital deployment to make sure that we're reinvesting our capital outside of the United States, just like we had represented that we intended to do. So that also is another important element of how we invested in our network during the quarter and believe that we're positioning ourselves for good success in terms of achieving those long-term goals. 
Those are some of the overall highlights of impact on the quarter that I wanted to share with you. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Andy to walk through the results by service area."
368470,403179123,1061374,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. As John mentioned, we anticipated a challenging pricing and execution environment coming into the second half of this year. I knew last year's comparables would be difficult. Our peo",1967,"Thank you, John. And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. 
As John mentioned, we anticipated a challenging pricing and execution environment coming into the second half of this year. I knew last year's comparables would be difficult. Our people and our network did a great job managing through the environment by being proactive in serving customers in order to be the provider of choice at a time when routing guides are performing largely as planned. 
Total transportation revenues were down slightly in the quarter to just under $3 billion. However, total revenues were up on a year-over-year basis in both August and September, and that positive trend has continued into October. The growth month-to-date in October is a result of our significant volume improvements as well as the fact that fuel is normalizing on a year-over-year basis. In October, our truckload volumes are up over 12%, clearly outperforming the market. 
Transportation net revenue margin decreased approximately 80 basis points from last year's third quarter. Though below last year, this margin is on the upper end of our historical third quarter margins over the last 5 to 6 years. 
The decrease in net revenue margin was primarily the result of truckload pricing falling more than purchased transportation cost, impacting margins by approximately 140 basis points. That decrease was partially offset by the positive impact of fuel of approximately 20 basis points and then the change of our mix of services of approximately 40 basis points. 
As we did in last quarter's presentation, we have included Slide 5, which provides a longer historical perspective of pricing and costs and their respective impact on our margins and results. 
On this graph, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North America truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers, net of fuel costs over time. The orange line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. 
You can see by looking at the light and dark blue lines that in this year's third quarter, there is a separation where the rate of change in our price to customers fell faster than the rate paid to carriers. In last year's third quarter in comparison, the opposite was true, where our costs were falling at a faster rate than price. 
This chart also highlights the volatility of our business. This year's third quarter also represents the first time in 9 quarters where the cost line was above the price line, which has impacted business results over the past couple of years. 
One of the many things our customers ask us to do is provide contractual rates and access to capacity to avoid some of the highs and lows in the markets so they're better able to plan their transportation spend. There are times when this contractual commitment will benefit our results and other times when they will not. Our ability to provide this type of service is one of the reasons shippers choose Robinson as a core provider in their businesses. During the quarter, our committed or contractual business represented approximately 62% of our truckload volume, which is in line with the past several quarters. 
We often speak about the uncertainty of how the market will perform looking ahead. We're not sure if we have reached the bottom of the decreased pricing environment that we have seen this year, but the third quarter did see some improvement in pricing. We don't feel like there has been a big change in the market as demand continues to be tepid, but things do seem a little bit better sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter to date. 
Moving on this Slide 6 and our truckload results. Truckload net revenues were $309 million, a decrease of 10.4% in the third quarter. Truckload volumes, however, increased 7.5%, and this growth was a result of an increase in shipments across all of our services from dry van, flatbed to temperature controlled. We also saw volume increase growth across all of our mileage bands from short to long haul segments. 
As mentioned earlier, for the first time in 9 quarters, customer pricing was down more than carrier cost. Customer pricing, net of fuel, was down 5.5% versus last year's third quarter. And purchase transportation cost, net of fuel, was down 3.5%. 
We again added 4,200 new carriers in the third quarter. These new carriers moved nearly 18,000 shipments for us in the quarter. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of the fourth quarter and into 2017, we don't expect a significant change in the North American market. And we will remain focused on growing our volumes and executing a balanced approach to taking profitable market share. 
Moving to Slide 7 in the less than truckload results. Net revenues in our LTL business grew 2.4% to $96.4 million. Volumes increased 5% when compared to the third quarter of last year. Pricing, however, was down slightly, and net revenue margins held flat during the quarter. 
This quarter's growth slowed a bit when compared to the first 2 quarters of the year as the size of our shipments were down on a year-over-year basis and the lower-priced truckload market is having an impact on LTL demand. We continue to be confident in our leading position in LTL and our ability to offer a compelling solution for our customers. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 8. Intermodal net revenues decreased 24.5% in the quarter while volumes were approximately flat. As has been the case for 4 quarters, the overall intermodal market has been challenged by the loose truck market and volumes have suffered. We did achieve approximately 15% volume growth in the quarter with our large strategic customers. The trend has been positive for the past few quarters with these larger, more committed customers. The transactional opportunities, however, continue to be scarce, which is the primary reason for our net revenue decrease in the quarter. As we have mentioned in previous quarters, the lower truckload pricing is limiting the long-haul intermodal opportunities. 
Moving on to the global forwarding business on Slide 9. Third quarter net revenues in our global forwarding services were $88.7 million, a 2.1% decrease from 2015's third quarter. Ocean net revenues were down 3.1%, air net revenues decreased 1.7% while customs grew 2.6%. 
Ocean shipments increased approximately 5% in the quarter, and pricing continued to be down with total revenue per shipment off double digits in the ocean service line. The pricing environment, especially in the trans-Pacific lane, did change in September as a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy filing.  Hanjin is not a core carrier for Robinson, so we were able to provide great service to our customers. I think what surprised us and the rest of the industry was the degree to which the remaining carriers raised their rates over the short term, sometimes as much a $750 to $900 per container. This situation did pressure our ocean margins in September, and it took a few weeks for our account managers to revise pricing with customers. 
As John mentioned earlier, we made an investment in the global forwarding business at the end of the quarter with the acquisition of APC Logistics. We are very excited to have APC as part of the Robinson global forwarding team. The addition of 9 offices and 313 employees in Australia and New Zealand strengthens our global value proposition. The integration is proceeding quickly and smoothly, and we are excited about our combined ability to grow with their customers in Asia and Europe. 
We had a strong quarter, growing air shipment volume approximately 18%. This has been a strategic focus for us, and the double-digit volume increase is a result of an environment where demand is generally soft. Despite the strong volume growth, we continue to see weak pricing, down double digits, that led to a decrease in net revenue. 
Moving to other logistic services on Slide 10. Net revenues increased 31% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year, led by the continued strong performance at TMC. The managed services business represents approximately 65% of the net revenue in this category. Managed services net revenue increased 29% in the third quarter and is currently on pace to service over $4 billion in freight under management in 2016. 
The growth we are seeing in the managed services is a result of our global investments over the past decade. We are seeing double-digit growth in Europe, Asia and South America in addition to the 24% growth in North America. 
The managed services business leverages our Navisphere technology platform, providing visibility, control and deep integration across supply chain partners while providing process management and consulting services to drive continuous improvement in our customers' supply chains. Congratulations to the TMC and IT teams involved in onboarding Microsoft. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 11. Congratulations to the Robinson team for growing sourcing net revenues 4.7% in the third quarter. The net revenue growth was primarily the result of a 6.4% case volume growth, offset by a decrease in net revenue per case. The 6.4% case growth was driven by strong performance in the food service segment and our strategic and key commodities. 
I will now transition to Slide 12 and a review of our summarized income statement. For the third quarter, operating expenses decreased 2.4% to $347 million. Personal expenses decreased 2.7%, primarily driven by lower variable compensation, incentives and partially offset by an average headcount growth of 4.5% in the quarter. As John mentioned, we've been making strategic investments in headcount throughout the year to grow volumes. 
SG&A expenses decreased 1.6% in the third quarter primarily due to a lower provision for bad debt and lower claims in this year's third quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. The combined impact of these 2 expense items were approximately $6 million in the quarter. We are pleased with our credit and finance results as they reflect the quality of our customers and receivable balance. 
Our operating income as a percent of net revenue was 37.8%, a decrease of 170 basis points from last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 36.7% versus 38.5% last year. We did have a onetime tax benefit from an item related to the Freightquote acquisition that increased the earnings per share by approximately $0.01. The remainder of the improvement versus last year was the election of APB 23 in the first quarter of this year. 
On to Slide 13 and other financial information. We generated nearly $130 million in cash in the quarter and had just over $27 million in capital expenditures. 
Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $377 million, and year-to-date capital expenditures were approximately $71 million, reflecting the build-out of our second data center. 
We finished the quarter with $224 million in cash, and our debt balance is $1.225 billion with $500 million at 4.28% and $725 million on the revolver with a current rate of 1.52%. The debt balance increased at the end of the quarter as we utilized the revolver for a portion of the purchase price of APC, which closed on September 30. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, Slide 14 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter with $63 million in dividends and approximately $67 million in share repurchases. In the third quarter, we returned 101% of our net income to shareholders. And year-to-date, we have returned 86%. 
Again, our thanks to everyone at Robinson for a solid third quarter in a challenging environment. Thank you all as well for listening in. 
With that, I will turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions."

In terms of wrapping up our prepared remarks on Slide 15 with regards to our final comments, really the first 2 bullet points tie into the opening messages around margin compression and volume growth. As you see there, we continue to have strong North America truckload volume growth at 12% that Andy mentioned as well as some ongoing margin compression, resulting in a net revenue decrease of approximately 4% per business day so far in October. 
Once again, we do have some strong comparisons from the fourth quarter of a year ago that we'll be dealing with that are helping make that net revenue growth a little bit more challenging. But overall, the major themes carry forward in that we continue to feel very good about our service levels, the relevance of our offering in the marketplace and the mixture of volume and margin compression that we're dealing with in the marketplace. 
On the bottom of Slide 15, just a couple of other topics to share a few thoughts with before we get into the Q&A. We've hit on this theme a couple of times but just wanted to share that we are very excited and feel very good about the initial interactions on APC integration. I mentioned earlier that we do have a long-standing relationship with them through our agency agreement. The companies of APC and Robinson have worked together successfully for a long time, but integrating our businesses is going to provide yet another opportunity to share information and to kind of jointly market what we think is a more effective way. 
There are some agent relationships, both within C.H. Robinson and APC, that are transitioning during the fourth quarter of 2016, so there is a lot of activity associated with that. But we feel very good about our approach to the market and the progress that we're making on that thus far. 
There will also be some additional IT integration that we'll be accomplishing in the next few quarters to come. But overall, again, just something that we feel very good as the perfect type of network investment and capital allocation that we want to do to continue to strengthen our network and wanted to share with you that we're off to a great start with some early customer wins and feeling about how we're progressing with that. 
In addition, the results of APC are not included in the comments above with regards to the net revenue today, so the results of APC, when included in the fourth quarter, hopefully will improve our net revenue by a couple of percent. We do believe the acquisition will be modestly accretive going forward in each of the periods. 
The last bullet point on here about confidence in our network is something that we talk about frequently, but I think it's worth mentioning to just call out again both the confidence that we do have in our team and the relevance of the 3PL model. 
When you think about the changes in the marketplace and the lack of the predictability that happens within the transportation marketplace, some of the things that just sort of go unnoticed at times are things like a significant hurricane in the Southeast this quarter, the large ocean carrier bankruptcy that was mentioned and all of the rerouting and service opportunities that had to come from that. There's every quarter some good examples of how the 3PL model and how the Robinson network really plays an important role in the marketplace to absorb some of that volatility and improve services and react to a lot of things that happen in the marketplace that are important to the shippers and the providers out there that we do that. 
So I just wanted to close again by saying that there's a lot of change going on, there's going to be a lot of pricing activity, there's a lot of volume happening in the network, a lot of changes. And we just feel really good about our network and our ability to react and succeed in any of those environments and re-establishing the value and relevance of our network to the marketplace. 
So with that, that concludes our prepared comments. And I would like to turn it back to Tim to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

If you start with the long-term perspective, the part of what we have said is that we accept the cyclicality and the margin expansion and compression that happens in our model, particularly as we move into more committed relationships, where we have fixed pricing on the shippers side for a period of time and often more transaction or fluid procurement costs. So it's very fundamental, as we've said in the prepared comments, to how we approach the market and how we try to add value. And the way we think about margin expansion and compression is kind of monitoring it over the long term to make sure that we're within the parameters and boundaries of what we've set as expectations around how things are going to cycle. So from a long-term perspective, we don't get concerned when we see margin expansion and compression. We just focus on our business processes and making sure that we're reacting in what we think is the proper way to make sure that we're adjusting, much along the chart that Andy talked us through around how customer pricing and carrier pricing are changing and making sure that those blue lines stay close together over time to manage that. So from a long-term perspective, we're not concerned about it in terms of it happening because we do plan for it and it's part of our business model. From a short-term perspective, we are concerned about it. We have a lot of things that we do to adjust pricing and a lot of management processes that are very focused on making sure that we are adapting and managing prices. And we talked about comparisons and we try to share as much as we can about what is happening with margin compression or margin expansion. So hopefully, we've shared what we know about that and whether or not somebody should be more or less concerned about it. In the short term, I think we're doing all that we can to manage through it. In the long term, we feel like it's part of our business model that we've dealt with for decades."

So that's the month-by-month of the double-digit net revenue growth that I mentioned from a year ago that we're comparing to. You may also remember that those 2015 numbers did have some Freightquote growth in there that I think we quantified at about 3% contribution to the growth. But still double digit without the acquisition of Freightquote from a year ago. So that's month by month and the growth that we referenced with regards to the comparisons coming into this quarter of -- in 2016. When are the contractual agreements typically renegotiated? We've talked about this quite a bit. So most of the contracts will have 30-day outs for either side so that there's an expectation of an annual commitment from a pricing standpoint, and typically with 30-day notice from either party in terms of if you want to terminate the arrangement. The vast majority of the business gets repriced when a shippers originates a new bid process to take a look at that price or when the providers come up and say that they can no longer service the business under those price arrangements. We do have a disproportionate amount of bid activity typically in the springtime, so there's more of an annual cycle to that. So as we said in our prepared comments, we are constantly looking at pricing, looking at committed arrangements versus transactional arrangements. There's always bid activity happening in the marketplace, and we'll see more of it around year-end and in the springtime as everybody looks at their pricing arrangements and thinks about what's appropriate going forward."

And I guess one of the things to reiterate is that very much like earnings season, the -- part of the challenge in this is that there's an element of what's expected versus what's actually occurring. When you come into a year like 2015, we've mentioned -- or 2016, we've mentioned a couple of times that shipper expectations were generally for fairly meaningful price reductions. So if you look at bid activity a year ago, these bids typically have lots of parties, they're very efficient, there might be multiple rounds of electronic bidding. And it's not any one person or any one expectation, but there's a consensus that comes out of those bid processes around what a shipper is expecting and how the market responds to it. A year ago, there were many bid activities that achieved mid-single or high single-digit rate decreases as a result of those bid processes. You can see during our third quarter here we had a 5.5% decrease in terms of the pricing that we charged to shippers. As the year goes on then, what we're experiencing is a more fluid or transactional procurement of a lot of those truckload costs. So while during the quarter they were down 3.5%, they were not down the 5.5% that was achieved in the lot of the committed bid relationships that we work with on the shipper side. So when we get into the third quarter and we have committed pricing from bids and you mix that in with a current transactional market that again is softer than a year ago but maybe not quite as soft as people expected, that's when those blue lines on our margin graph get some separation and we see the margin compression. So the -- really, the bottom, if you will, or the tipping point that may have occurred during the third -- second and third quarter of this year is really a function not so much of prices starting to go up versus a year ago but cost increases being more than were expected when a lot of those committed relationships were entered into. So it's challenging. It's part of the reason why it's difficult to predict because you're dealing with a lot of changes in the marketplace and the management of expectations and bid processes versus what then ultimately occurs. But as I said in the previous question, we view it as one of our strengths that we have, the types of account management processes and relationships to adjust to how the market does actually change. And we focus on that 10-year graph of showing that over time, we've been very successful at making sure that our pricing relationships and our cost relationships do adjust together."

When we have periods of margin compression, we do get a little bit more conservative in terms of thinking about our headcounts. And just like so far this year, where we've had headcount growth less than our volume growth, I would expect that in Q4 in 2017 as well, too. The combination of productivity initiatives, using technology to automate and just managing our expectations more aggressively when we're in a period of margin compression, all of those lead to probably slightly more conservative hiring practices.

Truckload volume is up 5%, and that's off of a very large base; LTL volume is up 7%, again off a very large base; ocean volume is up 6%, and we're still the #1 NVOCC from China to the U.S.; our air volume is up 18%; managed services revenue is up 29%; and sourcing volume is up 6% -- pardon me, 7%. The point is that while this quarter is not stellar, I think it's helpful to take a slightly longer-term view and look at the trends as well."

And we've all discussed the fact that ocean pricing in many of the lanes had dropped down to levels that clearly were not sustainable for the steamship lines. The fact that a bankruptcy occurred fairly abruptly and prices moved somewhat abruptly, similar to comments in truckload, we are seeing some examples like that of volatility and aggressive movement of margin that maybe didn't occur quite the same 10 or 20 years ago. But all of that activity is typical in terms of the reduction or addition of supply as the marketplace waivers. So similar to the broad comments I made about the enterprise, the fact that there's volatility and margins are moving around is well within the boundaries of what we think we're going to need to do in our long-term plans. Since the additional investment in Phoenix 4 years ago and now followed on with APC, our team has had great momentum in terms of leveraging the increased scale that we've had to become that #1 NVO from China to North America and really looking at how you leverage scale in the global forwarding business to be more competitive and to provide better service. We've mentioned several times over the last year our additional initiatives in the airfreight world, where, again, the margins are heavily driven by scale and density, where you have to build up your volume and build full pallets in order to get to kind of industry norms around profitability. So our long-term outlook is that we hope to be able to continue to gain scale and improve our margins on airfreight by building that density. On the ocean freight standpoint, we do feel like we've reached a level of competitiveness and scale where our margins are very good, but there are a lot of opportunities to expand corridors like Asia to Europe and North America to Europe where we don't have that same level of volume and activity today. So overall, the team is in a good spot. We like our network. We like the scale and competitiveness that we've reached in some of the primary ocean corridors, and we're investing aggressively in other areas and other services to try to build up with that. So all in all, a very positive outlook for our forwarding business going forward."

First, we don't have exposure to Hanjin. Some of the guys are not our customer. So there's no accrual for Hanjin. And then back to the first part, which is overall, Robinson's receivables are down versus last year. The reason they show as being up in -- on the balance sheet is that we closed the APC acquisition on September 30, and we have an opening balance sheet which is reflective of their numbers. But traditional C.H. Robinson, receivables are down. So that's the first reason why the reserve was down. The second reason is the quality of the receivables are up. So each of our customers receive a D&B rating. And today, there are more dollars in the what we call the low-risk category of customers. There are more dollars in that low-risk category today than there were last year. So therefore, that lowers your reserves. The final category is the aging. And again, it goes below 60 and above 60. In terms of our aging categories, there are more dollars today in the less-than-60 category than there were last year. Again, if you take higher-quality receivables where the amount that is less than 60 is higher than last year, therefore you have a low receivables. As far as looking forward into the future, it's certainly hard to determine or give an accurate prediction as to whether we will take more customers in the low- to medium- or high-risk category or whether those customers will be paying in 30, 45 or beyond 50 days. So we are very happy with our credit and finance team, our credit and finance policies. So we do expect to continue to drive good results on our receivables balance."

The color is, we're really excited to have them part of the Robinson global forwarding network. Prior to the acquisition, I think they were the sixth largest forwarder in Australia. The mix of their business, because it's an agent-based business, was primarily ocean and forward to customs with a little air import mixed in. I think if you were to categorize, it is roughly 1/3 of it was coming from North America, 1/3 from Europe and 1/3 from Asia. And so -- but because they were an agent-based network and they were focused primarily on the import, they didn't focus as much on the export market, which Australia does have a pretty strong export market. Now that they're part of a global network of company-owned stores that are branded Robinson, they can begin to really sell. And as John mentioned, the initial interactions have been incredibly positive, an Australia export service. And we've got teams in the U.S., we've got teams in Europe and teams in Asia that are working on it. Additionally, and we talked a little bit about this, is that we're able to pick up that business that they were traditionally running through agents in Europe and Asia. Roughly, that was, order of magnitude, 2/3 of the business. So we're excited about the initial returns on picking up their agent businesses in those markets because we have teams on the ground that are working on it today. I would just finally close. It's -- usually, it's very rare to find an acquisition like this where the cultural fit is exceptionally high. They run their operations incredibly tight and incredibly successful, and they fit very well into the Robinson culture and the Robinson team. There are a lot of incremental and additional opportunities that we look to explore with them. So the color is very positive."

We think we can continue to take market share and grow faster than the overall market just by continuing to penetrate our services that are out there. So yes, we do feel very positive about it. And in terms of the competitive market, there are some additional LTL third parties or brokers today that maybe there weren't 10 or 15 years ago.

When we see disruption, whether it's significant or not, on either supply or demand, that mix shift shifts. So if we were to see a significant impact to capacity to ELDs, which, by the way, we don't anticipate, we would expect to see more higher-margin opportunities in the spot market while we would continue to honor our commitments to our contractual customers through the terms of the agreement, which usually resets every 160-plus days.

I want to start by referencing a few of our key financial metrics on that Slide 3. Total revenues of $3.3 billion for the quarter were down 1.9% compared to last year. Total net revenues of $558 million were down 5% from a year ago. Inco",1234,"Thank you, Tim. I want to start by referencing a few of our key financial metrics on that Slide 3. Total revenues of $3.3 billion for the quarter were down 1.9% compared to last year. Total net revenues of $558 million were down 5% from a year ago. 
Income from operations of $211 million was down 9% from a year ago, and our earnings per share of $0.90 compares to $0.96 a year ago or a 6% decline. 
Year-to-date, earnings per share of $2.73 is up 4% from $2.63 a year ago. 
Despite some quarterly decreases in some of our key financial metrics, we do believe that we're making good progress towards achieving our long-term goals. I want to start my prepared comments by discussing a few of the themes that impacted both our third quarter results but also reflect the progress that we're making on those long-term goals. 
 
First topic I want to start with is margin compression. On our second quarter call, we discussed the fact that in the months of June and July, our net revenue had begun to decline due to margin compression. Unfortunately, that margin compression carried on through the third quarter and impacted our results for the third quarter of 2016. Most all of our services had margin decreases versus a year ago during the third quarter. But the point that we want to emphasize is that our margins are within the ranges of what we expect in our long-term planning, and we do accept the cyclicality of our markets as one of the things that we have to manage. 
A big part of the 3PL value, particularly with our committed relationships, is managing the cycles and managing the price variations and margin compression that can occur in the marketplace, and we do feel that we did a good job this quarter of honoring our committed relationships and servicing our customers in a way that was very valuable to the market. So we talk a lot about margin compression internally, and you'll hear a lot about margin compression on the call today impacting our results. 
The next topics regard to market share gains and volume metrics. Andy will cover and you will see a lot of metrics throughout our presentation about shipper growth and volume growth in our freight activity as well as share gains in most of our services. We've talked in the past that in a lot of ways this is one of the most important metrics in our business as we have to make sure that we remain relevant in providing increased service levels to our customers and our carrier providers. We'll share the metrics around our shipment activity as well as our capacity sign-up. We feel pretty good about the relevancy of our network in the marketplace and the fact that carrier sign-ups are at very high levels and the services that we're offering around all the choices that those carriers have to interact with our network via mobile application or the Internet or telephone calls or any way that, that capacity deems the right way to interact with our network. So we did have market share gains and volume growth in a lot of our metrics that we'll share today, and that's something that we continue to feel very good about as a foundation for continuing to add value. 
When we think about the margin compression and the relationship to the volume gains and the market share achievements that we've had, we also talked about the fact that we knew we were coming into this year with some challenging comparisons. 
There is a relationship between volume and margin, and in the second half of 2014 and 2015, we did have some very good results with double-digit net revenue and earnings per share growths in both of those periods of time. And we've talked in the past that our portfolio of business, the vast majority of it, does reprice on an annual basis. And when we think about going after those market share gains and that volume activity, it's important that we're successful doing that during the periods of margin compression and when prices are cycling down because the market is very fluid and, as I said earlier, a lot of our business reprices on an annual basis. 
So overall, when you put those 3 things together, we had challenging comparisons coming into the year. The market cycled down, creating some margin compression, but we feel very good about our network, our relevancy to our shippers and our capacity providers and the fact that we were able to achieve some good volume growth and market share gains. 
Just a couple of other topics that I want to highlight before I turn it over to Andy, again, things that both impacted the third quarter as well as topics that are important to our long-term success. 
We do continue to invest in the most important part of our network, which is our people. We had around a 5% increase in our headcount from the third quarter versus a year ago. And as we invest in those people, we continue to feel very confident about the job families that we have and our approach of how we go to market to make those people successful. 
You'll see that we did have a decrease in personnel costs due to the variable nature of our business model. So that despite the fact that we're continuing to invest in the people that we need to execute our services, we also feel our model is working with regards to how it reacts during different environments. 
The caliber of our people are extremely important, and we've talked in the past that the additions of headcount do tend to correlate more with volume and shipment activities than our net revenue growth. So this, again, in the third quarter reflects our ongoing investment in our network by hiring people and investing in the future capabilities of that network. 
The last topic I would touch on is the acquisition of APC that closed on September 30. In terms of the third quarter impact, it's really mostly the balance sheet numbers that you'll see because of closing on the last day of the quarter. However, it's an important part of our long-term plan that we continue to look at our capital strategies and invest in our network through the right types of M&A activity that we feel can enhance our network. 
We feel really good about this acquisition from a variety of perspectives. We had a long operating history with APC through the Phoenix relationship and working as an agent. We feel very good about the cultural compatibility and the capability of the company. There were some very positive things that Andy and his team did around the structure and the capital deployment to make sure that we're reinvesting our capital outside of the United States, just like we had represented that we intended to do. So that also is another important element of how we invested in our network during the quarter and believe that we're positioning ourselves for good success in terms of achieving those long-term goals. 
Those are some of the overall highlights of impact on the quarter that I wanted to share with you. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Andy to walk through the results by service area."
368470,403179123,1061564,"CH Robinson Worldwide Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. As John mentioned, we anticipated a challenging pricing and execution environment coming into the second half of this year. I knew last year's comparables would be difficult. Our peo",1966,"Thank you, John. And now on to Slide 4 and our transportation results. 
As John mentioned, we anticipated a challenging pricing and execution environment coming into the second half of this year. I knew last year's comparables would be difficult. Our people and our network did a great job managing through the environment by being proactive in serving customers in order to be the provider of choice at a time when routing guides are performing largely as planned. 
Total transportation revenues were down slightly in the quarter to just under $3 billion. However, total revenues were up on a year-over-year basis in both August and September, and that positive trend has continued into October. The growth month-to-date in October is a result of our significant volume improvements as well as the fact that fuel is normalizing on a year-over-year basis. In October, our truckload volumes are up over 12%, clearly outperforming the market. 
Transportation net revenue margin decreased approximately 80 basis points from last year's third quarter. Though below last year, this margin is on the upper end of our historical third quarter margins over the last 5 to 6 years. 
The decrease in net revenue margin was primarily the result of truckload pricing falling more than purchased transportation cost, impacting margins by approximately 140 basis points. That decrease was partially offset by the positive impact of fuel of approximately 20 basis points and then the change of our mix of services of approximately 40 basis points. 
As we did in last quarter's presentation, we have included Slide 5, which provides a longer historical perspective of pricing and costs and their respective impact on our margins and results. 
On this graph, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North America truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers, net of fuel costs over time. The orange line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. 
You can see by looking at the light- and dark-blue lines that in this year's third quarter, there is a separation where the rate of change in our price to customers fell faster than the rate paid to carriers. In last year's third quarter in comparison, the opposite was true, where our costs were falling at a faster rate than price. 
This chart also highlights the volatility of our business. This year's third quarter also represents the first time in 9 quarters where the cost line was above the price line, which has impacted business results over the past couple of years. 
One of the many things our customers ask us to do is provide contractual rates and access to capacity to avoid some of the highs and lows of the markets so they're better able to plan their transportation spend. There are times when this contractual commitment will benefit our results and other times when they will not. Our ability to provide this type of service is one of the reasons shippers choose Robinson as a core provider in their businesses. During the quarter, our committed or contractual business represented approximately 62% of our truckload volume, which is in line with the past several quarters. 
We often speak about the uncertainty of how the market will perform looking ahead. We're not sure if we have reached the bottom of the decreased pricing environment that we have seen this year, but the third quarter did see some improvement in pricing. We don't feel like there has been a big change in the market as demand continues to be tepid, but things do seem a little bit better sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter to date. 
Moving on to Slide 6 and our truckload results. Truckload net revenues were $309 million, a decrease of 10.4% in the third quarter. Truckload volumes, however, increased 7.5%, and this growth was a result of an increase in shipments across all of our services from dry van, flatbed to temperature controlled. We also saw volume increase growth across all of our mileage bands, from short to long haul segments. 
As mentioned earlier, for the first time in 9 quarters, customer pricing was down more than carrier cost. Customer pricing, net of fuel, was down 5.5% versus last year's third quarter. And purchase transportation cost, net of fuel, was down 3.5%. 
We again added 4,200 new carriers in the third quarter. These new carriers moved nearly 18,000 shipments for us in the quarter. 
As we look ahead to the remainder of the fourth quarter and into 2017, we don't expect a significant change in the North American market. And we will remain focused on growing our volumes and executing a balanced approach to taking profitable market share. 
Moving to Slide 7 in the less than truckload results. Net revenues in our LTL business grew 2.4% to $96.4 million. Volumes increased 5% when compared to the third quarter of last year. Pricing, however, was down slightly, and net revenue margins held flat during the quarter. 
This quarter's growth slowed a bit when compared to the first 2 quarters of the year as the size of our shipments were down on a year-over-year basis and the lower-priced truckload market is having an impact on LTL demand. We continue to be confident in our leading position in LTL and our ability to offer a compelling solution for our customers. 
Transitioning to our intermodal results on Slide 8. Intermodal net revenues decreased 24.5% in the quarter while volumes were approximately flat. As has been the case for 4 quarters, the overall intermodal market has been challenged by the loose truck market and volumes have suffered. We did achieve approximately 15% volume growth in the quarter with our large strategic customers. The trend has been positive for the past few quarters with these larger, more committed customers. The transactional opportunities, however, continue to be scarce, which is the primary reason for our net revenue decrease in the quarter. As we have mentioned in previous quarters, the lower truckload pricing is limiting the long-haul intermodal opportunities. 
Moving on to the global forwarding business on Slide 9. Third quarter net revenues in our global forwarding services were $88.7 million, a 2.1% decrease from 2015's third quarter. Ocean net revenues were down 3.1%, air net revenues decreased 1.7%, while customs grew 2.6%. 
Ocean shipments increased approximately 5% in the quarter, and pricing continued to be down with total revenue per shipment off double digits in the ocean service line. The pricing environment, especially in the trans-Pacific lane, did change in September as a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy filing.  Hanjin is not a core carrier for Robinson, so we were able to provide great service to our customers. I think what surprised us and the rest of the industry was the degree to which the remaining carriers raised their rates over the short term, sometimes as much a $750 to $900 per container. This situation did pressure our ocean margins in September, and it took a few weeks for our account managers to revise pricing with customers. 
As John mentioned earlier, we made an investment in the global forwarding business at the end of the quarter with the acquisition of APC Logistics. We are very excited to have APC as part of the Robinson global forwarding team. The addition of 9 offices and 313 employees in Australia and New Zealand strengthens our global value proposition. The integration is proceeding quickly and smoothly, and we are excited about our combined ability to grow with their customers in Asia and Europe. 
We had a strong quarter, growing air shipment volume approximately 18%. This has been a strategic focus for us, and the double-digit volume increase is a result of an environment where demand is generally soft. Despite the strong volume growth, we continue to see weak pricing, down double digits, that led to a decrease in net revenue. 
Moving to other logistic services on Slide 10. Net revenues increased 31% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period last year, led by the continued strong performance at TMC. The managed services business represents approximately 65% of the net revenue in this category. Managed services net revenue increased 29% in the third quarter and is currently on pace to service over $4 billion in freight under management in 2016. 
The growth we are seeing in the managed services is a result of our global investments over the past decade. We are seeing double-digit growth in Europe, Asia and South America in addition to the 24% growth in North America. 
The managed services business leverages our Navisphere technology platform, providing visibility, control and deep integration across supply chain partners while providing process management and consulting services to drive continuous improvement in our customers' supply chains. Congratulations to the TMC and IT teams involved in onboarding Microsoft. 
Transitioning to our sourcing business on Slide 11. Congratulations to the Robinson team for growing sourcing net revenues 4.7% in the third quarter. The net revenue growth was primarily the result of a 6.4% case volume growth, offset by a decrease in net revenue per case. The 6.4% case growth was driven by strong performance in the food service segment and our strategic and key commodities. 
I will now transition to Slide 12 and a review of our summarized income statement. For the third quarter, operating expenses decreased 2.4% to $347 million. Personnel expenses decreased 2.7%, primarily driven by lower variable compensation, incentives and partially offset by an average headcount growth of 4.5% in the quarter. As John mentioned, we've been making strategic investments in headcount throughout the year to grow volumes. 
SG&A expenses decreased 1.6% in the third quarter primarily due to a lower provision for bad debt and lower claims in this year's third quarter when compared to the same period in 2015. The combined impact of these 2 expense items were approximately $6 million in the quarter. We are pleased with our credit and finance results as they reflect the quality of our customers and receivable balance. 
Our operating income as a percent of net revenue was 37.8%, a decrease of 170 basis points from last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 36.7% versus 38.5% last year. We did have a onetime tax benefit from an item related to the Freightquote acquisition that increased the earnings per share by approximately $0.01. The remainder of the improvement versus last year was the election of APB 23 in the first quarter of this year. 
On to Slide 13 and other financial information. We generated nearly $130 million in cash in the quarter and had just over $27 million in capital expenditures. 
Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $377 million, and year-to-date capital expenditures were approximately $71 million, reflecting the build-out of our second data center. 
We finished the quarter with $224 million in cash, and our debt balance is $1.225 billion, with $500 million at 4.28% and $725 million on the revolver with a current rate of 1.52%. The debt balance increased at the end of the quarter as we utilized the revolver for a portion of the purchase price of APC, which closed on September 30. 
And finally, before turning it back to John, Slide 14 and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately $130 million to shareholders in the quarter, with $63 million in dividends and approximately $67 million in share repurchases. In the third quarter, we returned 101% of our net income to shareholders. And year-to-date, we have returned 86%. 
Again, our thanks to everyone at Robinson for a solid third quarter in a challenging environment. Thank you all as well for listening in. 
With that, I will turn it back to John to make some closing comments before we answer some of your questions."

In terms of wrapping up our prepared remarks on Slide 15 with regards to our final comments, really the first 2 bullet points tie into the opening messages around margin compression and volume growth. As you see there, we continue to have strong North America truckload volume growth, that 12% that Andy mentioned, as well as some ongoing margin compression, resulting in a net revenue decrease of approximately 4% per business day so far in October. 
Once again, we do have some strong comparisons from the fourth quarter of a year ago that we'll be dealing with that are helping make that net revenue growth a little bit more challenging. But overall, the major themes carry forward in that we continue to feel very good about our service levels, the relevance of our offering in the marketplace and the mixture of volume and margin compression that we're dealing with in the marketplace. 
On the bottom of Slide 15, just a couple of other topics to share a few thoughts with before we get into the Q&A. We've hit on this theme a couple of times but just wanted to share that we are very excited and feel really good about the initial interactions on APC integration. I mentioned earlier that we do have a long-standing relationship with them through our agency agreement. The companies of APC and Robinson have worked together successfully for a long time, but integrating our businesses is going to provide yet another opportunity to share information and to kind of jointly market what we think is a more effective way. 
There are some agent relationships, both within C.H. Robinson and APC, that are transitioning during the fourth quarter of 2016, so there is a lot of activity associated with that. But we feel very good about our approach to the market and the progress that we're making on that thus far. 
There will also be some additional IT integration that we'll be accomplishing in the next few quarters to come. But overall, again, just something that we feel very good as the perfect type of network investment and capital allocation that we want to do to continue to strengthen our network and wanted to share with you that we're off to a great start, with some early customer wins, in feeling about how we're progressing with that. 
In addition, the results of APC are not included in the comments above with regards to the net revenue today, so the results of APC, when included in the fourth quarter, hopefully will improve our net revenue by a couple of percent. We do believe the acquisition will be modestly accretive going forward in each of the periods. 
The last bullet point on here about confidence in our network is something that we talk about frequently, but I think it's worth mentioning to just call out again both the confidence that we do have in our team and the relevance of the 3PL model. 
When you think about the changes in the marketplace and the lack of the predictability that happens within the transportation marketplace, some of the things that just sort of go unnoticed at times are things like a significant hurricane in the Southeast this quarter, the large ocean carrier bankruptcy that was mentioned and all of the rerouting and service opportunities that had to come from that. There's, every quarter, some good examples of how the 3PL model and how the Robinson network really plays an important role in the marketplace to absorb some of that volatility and improve services and react to a lot of the things that happen in the marketplace that are important to the shippers and the providers out there and that we do that. 
So I just wanted to close again by saying that there's a lot of change going on, there's going to be a lot of pricing activity, there's a lot of volume happening in the network, a lot of changes, and we just feel really good about our network and our ability to react and succeed in any of those environments and re-establishing the value and relevance of our network to the marketplace. 
So with that, that concludes our prepared comments. And I would like to turn it back to Tim to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

If you start with the long-term perspective, the part of what we have said is that we accept the cyclicality and the margin expansion and compression that happens in our model, particularly as we move into more committed relationships, where we have fixed pricing on the shippers' side for a period of time and often more transaction or fluid procurement costs. So it's very fundamental, as we've said in the prepared comments, to how we approach the market and how we try to add value. And the way we think about margin expansion and compression is kind of monitoring it over the long term to make sure that we're within the parameters and boundaries of what we've set as expectations around how things are going to cycle. So from a long-term perspective, we don't get concerned when we see margin expansion and compression. We just focus on our business processes and making sure that we're reacting in what we think is the proper way to make sure that we're adjusting, much along the chart that Andy talked us through around how customer pricing and carrier pricing are changing and making sure that those blue lines stay close together over time to manage that. So from a long-term perspective, we're not concerned about it in terms of it happening, because we do plan for it and it's part of our business model. From a short-term perspective, we are concerned about it. We have a lot of things that we do to adjust pricing and a lot of management processes that are very focused on making sure that we are adapting and managing prices. And we talked about comparisons and we try to share as much as we can about what is happening with margin compression or margin expansion. So hopefully, we've shared what we know about that and whether or not somebody should be more or less concerned about it. In the short term, I think we're doing all that we can to manage through it. In the long term, we feel like it's part of our business model that we've dealt with for decades."

You may also remember that those 2015 numbers did have some Freightquote growth in there that I think we quantified at about 3% contribution to the growth. But still double digit without the acquisition of Freightquote from a year ago. So that's month by month and the growth that we referenced with regards to the comparisons coming into this quarter of -- in 2016. When are the contractual agreements typically renegotiated? We've talked about this quite a bit. So most of the contracts will have 30-day outs for either side, so that there's an expectation of an annual commitment from a pricing standpoint and typically with 30-day notice from either party in terms of if you want to terminate the arrangement. The vast majority of the business gets repriced when a shipper originates a new bid process to take a look at that price or when the providers come up and say that they can no longer service the business under those price arrangements. We do have a disproportionate amount of bid activity typically in the springtime, so there's more of an annual cycle to that. So as we said in our prepared comments, we are constantly looking at pricing, looking at committed arrangements versus transactional arrangements. There's always bid activity happening in the marketplace, and we'll see more of it around year-end and in the springtime as everybody looks at their pricing arrangements and thinks about what's appropriate going forward."

And I guess one of the things to reiterate is that very much like earnings season, the -- part of the challenge in this is that there's an element of what's expected versus what's actually occurring. When you come into a year like 2015, we've mentioned -- or 2016, we've mentioned a couple of times that shipper expectations were generally for fairly meaningful price reductions. So if you look at bid activity a year ago, these bids typically have lots of parties, they're very efficient, there might be multiple rounds of electronic bidding. And it's not any one person or any one expectation, but there's a consensus that comes out of those bid processes around what a shipper is expecting and how the market responds to it. A year ago, there were many bid activities that achieved mid-single or high single-digit rate decreases as a result of those bid processes. You can see during our third quarter here we had a 5.5% decrease in terms of the pricing that we charged to shippers. As the year goes on then, what we're experiencing is a more fluid or transactional procurement of a lot of those truckload costs. So while during the quarter they were down 3.5%, they were not down the 5.5% that was achieved in a lot of the committed bid relationships that we work with on the shipper side. So when we get into the third quarter and we have committed pricing from bids and you mix that in with a current transactional market that again is softer than a year ago but maybe not quite as soft as people expected, that's when those blue lines on our margin graph get some separation and we see the margin compression. So the -- really, the bottom, if you will, or the tipping point that may have occurred during the third -- second and third quarter of this year is really a function not so much of prices starting to go up versus a year ago but cost increases being more than were expected when a lot of those committed relationships were entered into. So it's challenging. It's part of the reason why it's difficult to predict because you're dealing with a lot of changes in the marketplace and the management of expectations and bid processes versus what then ultimately occurs. But as I said in the previous question, we view it as one of our strengths that we have the types of account management processes and relationships to adjust to how the market does actually change. And we focus on that 10-year graph of showing that over time, we've been very successful at making sure that our pricing relationships and our cost relationships do adjust together."

So as more of our earnings are generated outside of the United States, the effective tax rate will go down. Now mind you, we still generate a significant amount of our earnings and that income inside the United States.

When we have periods of margin compression, we do get a little bit more conservative in terms of thinking about our headcounts. And just like so far this year, where we've had headcount growth less than our volume growth, I would expect that in Q4 and 2017 as well, too, the combination of productivity initiatives, using technology to automate and just managing our expectations more aggressively when we're in a period of margin compression, all of those lead to probably slightly more conservative hiring practices.

Our people are in front of our customers every day and staying relevant to them. Now are we making as much as we did last year? No, but that's part of our business model and part of the cycle. As to the sustainability, well, that depends. We'll emphasize, as we always have, balanced and profitable growth. I just want to, like, take a step back for a moment and reflect on some of our key year-to-date performances. Truckload volume is up 5%, and that's off of a very large base; LTL volume is up 7%, again, off a very large base; ocean volume is up 6%, and we're still the #1 NVOCC from China to the U.S.; our air volume is up 18%; managed services revenue is up 29%; and sourcing volume is up 6% -- pardon me, 7%. The point is that while this quarter is not stellar, I think it's helpful to take a slightly longer-term view and look at the trends as well."

And we've all discussed the fact that ocean pricing in many of the lanes had dropped down to levels that clearly were not sustainable for the steamship lines. The fact that a bankruptcy occurred fairly abruptly and prices moved somewhat abruptly, similar to comments in truckload, we are seeing some examples like that of volatility and aggressive movement of margin that maybe didn't occur quite the same 10 or 20 years ago. But all of that activity is typical in terms of the reduction or addition of supply as the marketplace waivers. So similar to the broad comments I made about the enterprise, the fact that there's volatility and margins are moving around is well within the boundaries of what we think we're going to need to do in our long-term plans. Since the additional investment in Phoenix 4 years ago and now followed on with APC, our team has had great momentum in terms of leveraging the increased scale that we've had to become that #1 NVO from China to North America and really looking at how you leverage scale in the global forwarding business to be more competitive and to provide better service. We've mentioned several times over the last year our additional initiatives in the airfreight world, where, again, the margins are heavily driven by scale and density, where you have to build up your volume and build full pallets in order to get to kind of industry norms around profitability. So our long-term outlook is that we hope to be able to continue to gain scale and improve our margins on airfreight by building that density. On the ocean freight standpoint, we do feel like we've reached a level of competitiveness and scale where our margins are very good, but there are a lot of opportunities to expand corridors like Asia to Europe and North America to Europe, where we don't have that same level of volume and activity today. So overall, the team is in a good spot. We like our network. We like the scale and competitiveness that we've reached in some of the primary ocean corridors, and we're investing aggressively in other areas and other services to try to build up with that. So all in all, a very positive outlook for our forwarding business going forward."

First, we don't have exposure to Hanjin simply because they are not a customer. So there's no accrual for Hanjin. And then back to the first part, which is overall, Robinson's receivables are down versus last year. The reason they show as being up in -- on the balance sheet is that we closed the APC acquisition on September 30, and we have an opening balance sheet, which is reflective of their numbers. But traditional C.H. Robinson, receivables are down. So that's the first reason why the reserve is down. The second reason is the quality of the receivables are up. So each of our customers receive a D&B rating. And today, there are more dollars in the what we call the low-risk category of customers. There are more dollars in that low-risk category today than there were last year. So therefore, that lowers your reserves. The final category is the aging. And again, it goes below 60 and above 60. In terms of our aging categories, there are more dollars today in the less-than-60 category than there were last year. Again, if you take higher-quality receivables where the amount that is less than 60 is higher than last year, therefore, you have a low receivable. As far as looking forward into the future, it's certainly hard to determine or give an accurate prediction as to whether we will take more customers in the low- to medium- or high-risk category or whether those customers will be paying in 30, 45 or beyond 60 days. So we are very happy with our credit and finance team, our credit and finance policies. So we do expect to continue to drive good results on our receivables balance."

The color is, we're really excited to have them part of the Robinson global forwarding network. Prior to the acquisition, I think they were the sixth largest forwarder in Australia. The mix of their business, because it's an agent-based business, was primarily ocean and forward to customs with a little air import mixed in. I think if you were to categorize, it is roughly 1/3 of it was coming from North America, 1/3 from Europe and 1/3 from Asia. And so -- but because they were an agent-based network and they were focused primarily on the import, they didn't focus as much on the export market, which Australia does have a pretty strong export market. Now that they're part of a global network of company-owned stores that are branded Robinson, they can begin to really sell. And as John mentioned, the initial interactions have been incredibly positive, an Australia export service. And we've got teams in the U.S.; we've got teams in Europe and teams in Asia that are working on it. Additionally, and we talked a little bit about this, is that we're able to pick up that business that they were traditionally running through agents in Europe and Asia. Roughly, that was, in order of magnitude, 2/3 of the business. So we're excited about the initial returns on picking up their agent businesses in those markets because we have teams on the ground that are working on it today. I would just finally close. It's -- usually, it's very rare to find an acquisition like this where the cultural fit is exceptionally high. They run their operations incredibly tight and incredibly successful, and they fit very well into the Robinson culture and the Robinson team. There are a lot of incremental and additional opportunities that we look to explore with them. So the color is very positive."

They continue to win mandates from new and existing customers and are on track to manage over $4 billion in freight spend. So yes, we're pretty satisfied."

Andy kind of laned out the discussion around ELDs and why we don't think that will be disruptive from our standpoint. In our industry presentations, we talk lot about the last 6 or 7 years and the escalation of regulation around safety and emissions-type themes and hours of service, CSA and different things that have added cost and have added some price inflection to various periods in the truckload portion of it. We've lived through most of those. ELDs is just kind of a big one that everybody's talking about right now, and we don't expect a lot for that. So short answer is no."

We've acknowledged that there are a lot of opportunities where we can invest through M&A and not only accelerate our growth but sometimes bring in management and business processes that we're not as capable at that are really good for us. So we would -- we have not and we do not really look at kind of fixer-upper-type acquisitions. We're generally looking for what we think are well-run and good businesses that are going to add to the strength of our network and add to our competencies because we really don't have the bandwidth or the extra management in place to go around and fix things. We would like to be bigger in the intermodal business. We do remain very open minded about intermodal opportunities and looking at how we can be more relevant to that space in the future. But our approach has generally been around looking for good management teams and well-run businesses that will make us stronger."

And what we've seen and what we've experienced for some time now is customers are looking to secure capacity and they're looking to secure rates, which is part of the reason why we're helping them manage their supply chains and growing their volumes the way they have. So -- but that being said, our mix between contractual and spot remains fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. When we see disruption, whether it's significant or not, on either supply or demand, that mix shift shifts. So if we were to see a significant impact to capacity to ELDs, which, by the way, we don't anticipate, we would expect to see more higher-margin opportunities in the spot market while we would continue to honor our commitments to our contractual customers for the terms of the agreement, which usually resets every 160-plus days. So obviously, volume would increase if there's a disruption, and we would take advantage of it in the spot market. And we would continue to honor those contracts on the contractual side, but we would also take advantage of -- in a situation like that where routing guides failed, the further down you go, the more opportunities there are for margin expansion."
