407172,308383158,942647,"Transocean Ltd., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Brad, and a warm welcome to our employees, customers, investors and analysts participating in today's call. Our performance in the fourth quarter were strong across the board as we reported adjusted net income of $650 million or $1.68 per dilut",1131,"Thank you, Brad, and a warm welcome to our employees, customers, investors and analysts participating in today's call. Our performance in the fourth quarter were strong across the board as we reported adjusted net income of $650 million or $1.68 per diluted share. On $1.9 billion of revenues. For the full year, our adjusted net income was $1.7 billion or $4.74 per diluted share on $7.4 billion in revenue.
During the quarter, our strong revenue efficiency, our intense focus and our cost structure and the proceeds from some early contract terminations resulted in an operating margin, including G&A, of approximately 54%. For the full year, excluding the impact of the Macondo settlement, our adjusted operating margin was 47%. These results reflect the unwavering commitment of the entire Transocean team to delivering the best operational performance in the industry. So to those Transocean employees who may be listening to today's call, thank you for your continued focus and dedication throughout what a very challenging year for our industry.
In addition to delivering strong financial results, I'm pleased report that Transocean for the reduced its total recordable incident rate during the quarter, while simultaneously including uptime and revenue efficiency which was an impressive 95.9% for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, we produced the lowest annual total recordable incident rate and the company's history, while delivering our highest annual average revenue efficiency of 96%, which further solidifies our position that safety and efficiency go hand-in-hand. Once again, I would like to recognize and thank our crews and our shore base personnel for their continued commitment to both protecting each other and the environment in which we operate and maximizing uptime for our customers.
I would also like to take a moment to recognize our marketing and contract teams. Despite the extremely challenging market conditions, by leveraging our excellent operational performance and introducing some new commercial models and alternative solutions for our customers, we added a number of contracts to our backlog late in the fourth quarter. While most of the awards were short duration, we were pleased to secure some longer-term arrangements in Canada, India and the North Sea. Terry will soon provide more detail regarding each of these pictures.
Needless today, we are pleased for the company's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the full year 2015. However, we recognize that there is more to be done. As we move through 2016, we will further define and capitalize on opportunities to reduce our incident rate and improve our uptime performance. We will also take additional action streamline and drive efficiencies into our organization and to our processes and we will continue to high-grade our fleet.
In an effort to further improve our safety and operational performance in 2016, we are investing time and resources into enhancing our tools, procedures and training programs. Once completed and rolled out company-wide, we will be at an even stronger position to drive discipline and consistency of performance across our entire fleet.
While investing in new tools and training programs to drive safety and performance improvements, we are also evaluating our organization and our internal processes and identifying opportunities to optimize each. As discussed in some detail last quarter, we are reorganizing internally. Among other things, we have significantly reduced the layers between senior management and the RIG. As a result, our organization has become flatter and our operational efficiency has improved materially. This organizational change has also resulted in a majority of our support functions that's being centralized in Houston with the downsizing or outright elimination of hub offices on the world. These changes began in late 2015 and should be fully implemented by the end of the second quarter of 2016, which will result in additional cost savings as we've progressed through the year.
In addition to improving the efficiency of our structure, you will remember from the last call that we are also defining and implementing innovative approaches to enhance our maintenance activities and to reduce a bit time and cost required to stack a rig. Well, I'm pleased ro report that we are now realizing the benefit of these approaches and as you will here in Georgia's guidance, we expect recognize for their cost reductions in both areas has removed through the year.
And finally, since we remain confident in the ultimate recovery of commodity prices and the offshore industry, we are continuing to high-grade our fleet. The Deepwater Thalassa, the first of 4 new build ultra-deepwater drillships that will operate for Shell on tendered contract went on dayrate in early February in the Gulf of Mexico. The second new you build drillship for Shell, the Deepwater Pontus, is expected to arrive in Gulf of Mexico in several weeks where it will begin its contract in Shell for the second quarter.
Lastly, the Deepwater Conqueror, which is a 5-year contract with Chevron, is on schedule and due to  be delivered later this year.
While we are certainly excited about these additions to our fleet and the future revenue and earnings that they represent, we also recognize the need to continually revaluate the composition, capability and marketability of individual rigs within our fleet.
Consistent with our fleet renewal strategy, during the quarter, we classified 2 additional rigs, the Deepwater Navigator, and the GSF Rig Grand Banks was held for sale. For those keeping score, since the start of the downturn, we are now 24 floaters, either scrapped or held for sale. As we move forward, we will continue to objectively evaluate both our rigs coming off a contract as well as our currently stacked rigs to quickly determine whether or not each individual assets still supports our long-term asset strategy.
Before I hand the call over to Mark, he will provide you with additional comment on the company's financial performance and then Terry, who will provide an update on the market. I would just like to take a moment to stress that the Deepwater floater market is the most challenging it's ever been. To overcome this challenge, we will continue with approach of managing those things within our control, such as continue to improve on safety and operational performance, streamlining the business and our processes and high-grading our fleet and our crews. Our customers needs superior execution and our ability to distinguish Transocean and these area is what will keep our rigs working and allow us to build our reputation as the industry's preferred contract driller.
With our $15.5 billion backlog, of which is approximately 89% this with investment-grade companies and our more than $5 billion of liquidity, we have the platform we need to imagine this downturn in a much stronger leadership position, and I have every confidence that we will.
With that, let me hand it over to Mark."
407172,308383158,942647,"Transocean Ltd., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Jeremy, and good day, to all. As we provided expensive detail in the fourth quarter results in our and introduce, well, let me briefly touch on quarter's financial performance during this call. I will focus instead of providing you with an upda",1457,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day, to all. As we provided expensive detail in the fourth quarter results in our and introduce, well, let me briefly touch on quarter's financial performance during this call. I will focus instead of providing you with an update to our 2016 guidance and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
For the fourth quarter, 2015, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $611 million or $1.66 per diluted share. These results included $4 million or $0.02 per share in net attributable items that are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $615 million were $1.68 per diluted share.
Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased by $243 million sequentially to $1.85 billion. Other revenue increased $356 million due to the early terminations of [indiscernible] Pioneer, Discovery Americas and Rig 714. Contract drilling revenue decreased $130 million due to reduced activity and rig retirement, partially offset by higher ultra-deepwater revenue efficiency and higher demobilization revenue. The demobilization revenue during the period was associated with the lump sum revenue recognized in the product and the completion of the trailer to contract in December.
We recognized approximately 80% of the product by reduce lump sum payment as revenue in 2015. The remaining portion associated with the demobilization of the rig would like to be recognized as contract drilling revenue in 2016.
Fourth quarter fleet utilization was 60%, down from 70% in the prior quarter. This is also this 632 operating days mainly attributable to fewer recontracting opportunities for a harsh environment and mid-water Semites. As Jeremy mentioned, we achieved either quarter of outstanding revenue efficiency of 95.9% with will year 2015 averaging 96%. So that's 2 conservative use of efficiency at or above 95%.
And so for our 2016, the uptime performance for our rigs remains strong. This is attributable to the exceptional focus and execution for operational and technical teams worldwide.
Fourth quarter operating and maintenance expense decreased by $86 million sequentially to $794 million. Although within our full year guidance, fourth quarter O&M was slightly higher than the forecasted due to unplanned demobilization costs, which will offset by increased revenue just discussed. The quarter was also impacted by lower activity due to 632 operating days during the quarter and the company's actions to reduce onshore and offshore process. Janne expenses decreased sequentially by $30 million to $58 million. As discussed during last quarter's call, fourth quarter G&A include restructuring costs associated with employee severance payments and office these termination charges. Operating margin, including G&A expense, was approximately 54% in the quarter, driven higher by the impact of early contract terminations included in other revenue mentioned above. Adjusted for this additional revenue, our operating margins were approximately 43% and in line with the prior quarter.
The fourth quarter annual effective tax rate was 15.1%, or 7.5% in the prior quarter. The increase was due largely to changes in adjusted pretax income, currency exchange rate and the impact of jurisdictional and operational structure changes in certain rigs implemented this quarter.
The annual effective tax rate for 2015 were 16.4%, low guided you to largely revenue associated with contract terminations during the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.34 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This includes cash from operations of $960 million. Capital expenditures totaled $665 million related to a second delivery repeat order produce and other new book CapEx payments during the quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $207 million of debt at a cost of $196 million, bringing our total 2015 repurchases of $503 million, at a cost of $473 million. About 85% of the early debt repurchases were mid-dated maturities. Cash interest for the repurchases amounted to approximately $84 million over the remaining term. The vast majority of which benefit cash flows over the next 3 years. As part of the organizational streamline encouraging underway, we announced our intention to Swiss stock exchange. The last days March 30. The companyshares will continue to be traded from a in the New York Stock Exchange. I will now provide an update on our financial expectations 2016, which reflect our confidence and continued strong uptime performance and more efficient cost structure. I will also update our liquidity's expectations through 2017.
Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 were expected to be between $60 million and $70 million, this includes customer reimbursables, but excludes $200 million of early termination fee as a shared with the contract insulations recognized to date in 2016.
As we compute our annual budgeting process, we could not update our preliminary cost guidance provided during the previous earnings call. We expect full year upgrading and maintenance expense to range between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. This is about of percent lower than hourly expectations due to fewer forecast operating days associated with early part of terminations and some of our rigs and limited opportunities for re-contracting some of these assets in 2016.
The updated 2016 O&M guidance is also above 40% lower on an adjusted 2015 O&M costs. Of this reduction, approximately 70% is associated with reduced activity and lower ultra-deepwater cost and about 10% from lower out-of-service costs.
The remaining 2016 Pontus cost decrease is related to more streamlined operating, overheads support models. As we discussed, last quarter, we're implementing structural changes to organization which will improve operating margin, earnings and related cash flow. These cost reductions are largely offset by reactivation of the Henry Goodrich, which will commence his 2-year contract with husky in the second quarter 2016. The contract commencement of the 3 -- of our 3 new build ultra-deepwater drillship Deepwater Thalassa, which Jeremy mentioned, as well as the Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Conqueror in second and third quarters, respectively.
Our G&A expense for 2016 is full expected to be approximately $155 million. The reduced expense applications are due mainly to smaller corporate structures and related office closures. This guidance excludes approximately $5 million in restructuring costs. We expect annual depreciation expense 2016 to the between $875 million and $925 million. Full year 2016 net interest expense is expected to be between $365 million and $380 million. The year-over-year decrease is mainly associated with the increased levels of capitalized interest due largely to the changes in the construction and risk balances.
Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $175 million and $10 million, respectively. Full year 2016 annual effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be between 20% and 32%. The increase is a result of the lower level of pretax income. Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, excluding $1.15 billion of Deepwater Conqueror, Deepwater Champion and Deepwater Poseidon and $180 million for capitalized interest. Maintenance CapEx is estimated to be approximately $100 million. This reduced level of maintenance capital expenditures is it with our estimate for a limited number out of service days.
Turning now to our cash position. We have made the following assumptions and updated liquidity forecast through 2017. This include revenue efficiency of 95%; a limited number of new contract awards that resumes at or near cash price given; existing drilling contracts in mining tax and working capital release of approximately $600 million in total for the years 2016, 2017.
Related to 2017, we expect total Capex of approximately $600 million. This includes $175 million in new build payment, $150 million in capitalized interest and approximately $250 million in maintenance CapEx.
This maintenance CapEx provides exclusive maintenance of rigs for potential future contract rowers. Based upon our current at December 31, 2017, remains in the range $4 billion to $5 billion. It's the vast majority of the contract termination payments received, approximate forecasted operating cash flow under this contract. An exception to the recent cancellation of the DP 1 contract, unfortunately, we will not receive a termination payment, the customer has the contractual option to cancel the convenience. We estimated, this contract installation will reduce cash flow by approximately $56 million and 2016 and 2017. Jeremy will discuss this in more detail during his prepared comment. After Jason continues to improve our $3 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that is available to us for mid-2019.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our operational results including exceptional revenue business and improvements in our cost structure. This we become an ideal organization, we are doing more with more with Eclairs, but the quality of our service remain high. We are not satisfied, however, and we'll continue to challenge [indiscernible] mentioned, strive to for even greater performance to out-mitigate the reduced fleet utilization.
This concludes my prepared comments. I will now turn the call over to Terry. Terry?"

To simply say the offshore drilling market continues to be challenging is an understatement. Yet in the fourth quarter, our teams, onshore and offshore, fired on all cylinders to deliver multiple contracts when opportunities were scarce. But oil prices recently fallen as low as the mid-20s and continuing to harbor around $30 a barrel, contract terminations that began accelerating in December has continued. Fortunately, because of our strong contract and relationships, we do not have other contract in our backlog that permit uncompensated cancellation for convenience like the termination we recently announced related to the global NFA development driller 1. I will reiterate what I said in our last earnings call, although demand is limited, we continue to fight for every opportunity in this highly competitive market. As a testament to our safety and operational performance and the creativity and tenacity of our marketing team, we've added $378 million of contract backlog since the last earnings call, bringing our total 2015 to $763 million. We have contracted to reactivate the Henry Goodrich Canada for 2 years; secure contracts to retun the RIG 140 in India and the hume to work. We have also extended the contract for the Jack Bates in Australia and rewarded over 80 days for the caging express in the Ivory Coast. While signing new contracts for active rigs, the [indiscernible] has 704 in U.K. and the Transocean Arctic in Norway. Our global footprint is vast and our ability to compete for work with our diverse fleet of rigs while capitalizing on our operational excellence is strong. As evidenced of our competitive positioning, I am especially pleased to report that since issuing our Fleet Status Report earlier this month, we were awarded a 6-month contract for the KG2 with undisclosed operator and we expect to come from a several additional contracts in the near term. However, due to the negotiations not yet being final and the competitiveness of the current market, we will refrain from commenting specifically on these today.
Our backlog as of February 11, was $15.5 billion dollars, the strongest in the industry comprising primarily of IOC's with strong balance sheet. This balance sheet provides for solid cash flow generation with 78% of revenues contracted with the IOC's, 15% contracted with independent and 7% contracted with that NOC. Turning to the current market. Charging conditions are not likely to continue into 2017. Negatively impacting both utilization and day rates while limiting rig contracting opportunities for all classes of rigs. Ultra-depwater rigs for newer your cash operating cost breakeven in most areas, and marketing utilization. And market utilizations, down 79%, between 27 rigs idled and 21 coal stacks. To provided a little more perspective on the competitiveness of the market, that longest term contracting opportunity currently in the Indian market, has attracted 14 rigs from 10 different competitors. The associated rig classes range for fourth 6th generation units with very competitive pricing expected.
Deepwater market utilization is down to 70% with only 3 fixtures year-to-date being recorded. This is coming off a total of 10 fixtures in '15, primarily, in Australia and Asia. There are currently 10 idle and 11 cold stacked Deepwater rigs.
In India, the second ONG CT are tender attracted 8 rigs from 7 different contractors ranging from second to fourth generation rigs. Submitting on these opportunities will also be very competitive. Mid warning utilization is at 69% with 3 fixtures contracted year-to-date for U.K. and Norway. This adds to a total of 19 fixtures in 2015. Currently, there are 16 idle midwater rigs in the 15 units coal stacked. There are 47 coal stacked units plus 48 floaters that are retired of being held for sale. The Transocean accounting for over 40% of the combined total. We expect these numbers to continue to increase with the overcapacity of supply and near term lack of demand, forcing the retirement of more asset. The difficult macro conditions are also resulting in more customers terminating contracts early. This further exacerbate the oversupply floater market and is a direct result of customers curtailing part of their offshore programs to preserve liquidity. Despite the severity of the downturn, there are some emerging opportunities we are discussing with customers. Some are taking the countercyclical approach, a contracting local solutions with their programs later in '16 and into ''17, realized the benefit of the reduced day rates to their overall project economics.
The jackup market continues to deteriorate as a result of increased market oversupply. This is also being exacerbated by a few rigs being cold stacked for scrap and the newbuild deliveries continue unabated. Utilization and day rates are rapidly declining. Marketed utilization is approximately 72%, but 119 rigs currently warm stacked in 65 coal stacked. With a relatively low cost associated with stacking your jackup breaks, scrapping activity is expected to be slower. Unlike the floater market, NOCs are leveraging the local market dominant and renegotiated day rates lower based on the decline; in oil prices. Industry delays that new build deliveries for both ultra-deepwater asset and jack-ups provides the medium-term relief in the excess rigs apply but continued industry attrition and stacking will contribute the most to permanently correcting the global oversupply situation. Overall, our customers are focused on reducing costs but remain keenly focused on improving operational and safety performance. Additionally, with the duration of this downturn increasing, balance sheets strength and drilling contractors in their long-term viability are becoming key criteria for our operators. With our strong liquidity come a industry-leading backlog, diverse fleet and excellent safety and operational track record, we are positioning Transocean to increase our market leading position. As such, we are keenly focused on extending both our customer and stakeholder expectations.
This concludes my overview of the market. So I will turn it over to Brad."

I will say, we have obviously, we're been in conversation with various equipment providers. And I don't know if it's the same model that DE, Adidas, Diamond and GE entered into, but My guess is they're probably fairly similar. For us, we see some positives and some negative. On the positive side, there's, obviously, an in near term liquidity for the drilling contractor the any impact on near-term liquidity for the drilling contractor, which is good. And we also think it's positive to align critical equipment providers with drilling contractors with, ultimately the operators to improve up their performance. Those are 2 good things and thing's that we'd certainly considered. For us, there appeared to be 2 challenges. One is, while we recognize the benefit of near-term liquidity when you fell the BOP and the associated spares, the ongoing cost from the equipment provider, the healthcare contracted, if you will, is a bit prohibitive. And so that's a concern for us. And the other piece of it, I mean, well, if you think about that cost of the contract, it really increases your total cost to ownership. So while you get the benefit near-term, the total cost of ownership longer term, becomes a bit of a challenge for us. The other thing for us is we have been unbelievably successful in improving our uptime performance for all subsidy-related equipment. And so when you at the associated with service agreements plus we don't see a lot of incremental opportunity of improvement that this could potentially bring, for. For us, we're not quite sure that model works as we understand it today. Having said that, we are working with our equipment providers to look at other ways to go line differnet model that may make sense for more of us and also improve our uptime performance on our equipment. So it's not the net we're pursuing, we're talking to divider, my guess is the model would a different than what was announced by diamond, but it is something we're looking at."

407172,308383158,942934,"Transocean Ltd., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Brad, and a warm welcome to our employees, customers, investors and analysts participating in today's call. Our performance in the fourth quarter was strong across the board as we reported adjusted net income of $615 million or $1.68 per dilute",1137,"Thank you, Brad, and a warm welcome to our employees, customers, investors and analysts participating in today's call. Our performance in the fourth quarter was strong across the board as we reported adjusted net income of $615 million or $1.68 per diluted share on $1.9 billion in revenues. For the full year, our adjusted net income was $1.7 billion or $4.74 per diluted share on $7.4 billion in revenue.
During the quarter, our strong revenue efficiency, our intense focus on our cost structure and the proceeds from some early contract terminations resulted in an operating margin, including G&A, of approximately 54%. For the full year, excluding the impact of the Macondo settlement, our adjusted operating margin was 47%.
These results reflect the unwavering commitment of the entire Transocean team to delivering the best operational performance in the industry. So to those Transocean employees who may be listening to today's call, thank you for your continued focus and dedication throughout what was a very challenging year for our industry.
In addition to delivering strong financial results, I'm pleased report that Transocean further reduced its total recordable incident rate during the quarter while simultaneously improving uptime and revenue efficiency, which was an impressive 95.9% for the fourth quarter.
For the full year of 2015, we produced the lowest annual total recordable incident rate in the company's history while delivering our highest annual average revenue efficiency of 96%, which further solidifies our position that safety and efficiency go hand in hand.
Once again, I would like to recognize and thank our crews and our shore-based personnel for their continued commitment to both protecting each other and the environments in which we operate and maximizing uptime for our customers.
I would also like to take a moment to recognize our marketing and contract teams, despite the extremely challenging market conditions. By leveraging our excellent operational performance and introducing some new commercial models and alternative solutions for our customers, we added a number of contracts to our backlog late in the fourth quarter. While most of the awards were short duration, we were pleased to secure some longer-term arrangements in Canada, India and the North Sea. Terry will soon provide more detail regarding each of these pictures.
Needless to say, we are pleased with the company's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the full year of 2015. However, we recognize that there is more to be done. As we move through 2016, we will further define and capitalize on opportunities to reduce our incident rate and improve our uptime performance. We will also take additional actions to streamline and drive efficiencies into our organization and our processes, and we will continue to high-grade our fleet.
In an effort to further improve our safety and operational performance in 2016, we are investing time and resources into enhancing our tools, procedures and training programs. Once completed and rolled out company-wide, we will be at an even stronger position to drive procedural discipline and consistency of performance across our entire fleet.
While investing in new tools and training programs to drive safety and performance improvements, we are also reevaluating our organization and our internal processes and identifying opportunities to optimize each. As discussed in some detail last quarter, we are reorganizing internally. Among other things, we have significantly reduced the layers between senior management and the rig. As a result, our organization has become flatter and our operational efficiency has improved materially. This organizational change has also resulted in the majority of our support functions being centralized in Houston with the downsizing or outright elimination of hub offices around the world. These changes began in late 2015 and should be fully implemented by the end of the second quarter of 2016, which will result in additional cost savings as we progress through the year.
In addition to improving the efficiency of our structure, you will remember from the last call that we are also defining and implementing innovative approaches to enhance our maintenance activities and to reduce the time and cost required to stack a rig. Well, I'm pleased to report that we are now realizing the benefit of these approaches. And as you will here in Mark's guidance, we expect to recognize further cost reductions in both areas as we move through the year.
And finally, since we remain confident in the ultimate recovery of commodity prices and the offshore industry, we are continuing to high-grade our fleet. The Deepwater Thalassa, the first of 4 new-build ultra-deepwater drillships that will operate for Shell on 10-year contracts went on day rate in early February in the Gulf of Mexico. The second newbuild drillship for Shell, the Deepwater Proteus, is expected to arrive in the Gulf of Mexico in several weeks, where it will begin its contract for Shell in the second quarter.
Lastly, the Deepwater Conqueror, which is a 5-year contract with Chevron, is on schedule and due to be delivered later this year.
While we are certainly excited about these additions to our fleet and the future revenue and earnings that they represent, we also recognize the need to continually reevaluate the composition, capability and marketability of individual rigs within our fleet.
Consistent with our fleet renewal strategy, during the quarter, we classified 2 additional rigs, the Deepwater Navigator and the GSF Grand Banks, as held for sale.
For those keeping score, since the start of this downturn, we have now 24 floaters either scrapped or held for sale. As we move forward, we will continue to objectively evaluate both our rigs coming off of contracts as well as our currently stacked rigs to quickly determine whether or not each individual assets still supports our long-term asset strategy.
Before I hand the call over to Mark, who will provide you with additional comments on the company's financial performance; and then Terry, who will provide an update on the market, I would just like to take a moment to stress that the Deepwater floater market is the most challenged it has ever been. To overcome this challenge, we will continue with the approach of managing those things within our control, such as continuing to improve on safety and operational performance, streamlining the business and our processes and high-grading our fleet and our crews. Our customers need superior execution, and our ability to distinguish Transocean in these area is what will keep our rigs working and allow us to build on our reputation as the industry's preferred contract driller.
With our $15.5 billion backlog, of which approximately 89% is with investment-grade companies, and our more than $5 billion of liquidity, we have the platform that we need to emerge from this downturn in a much stronger leadership position, and I have every confidence that we will.
With that, let me hand it over to Mark."
407172,308383158,942934,"Transocean Ltd., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. As we provided extensive detail on the fourth quarter's results in our earnings release, I'll only briefly touch on the quarter's financial performance during this call. I will focus instead of providing you with an",1487,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. As we provided extensive detail on the fourth quarter's results in our earnings release, I'll only briefly touch on the quarter's financial performance during this call. I will focus instead of providing you with an update to our 2016 guidance and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
For the fourth quarter 2015, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $611 million or $1.66 per diluted share. These results included $4 million or $0.02 per share in net unfavorable items that are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $615 million or $1.68 per diluted share.
Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased by $243 million sequentially to $1.85 billion. Other revenue increased $356 million due to the early terminations of the Polar Pioneer, Discoverer Americas and Sedco 714. Contract drilling revenue decreased $113 million due to reduced activity and rig retirement, partially offset by higher ultra-deepwater revenue efficiency and higher demobilization revenue. The demobilization revenue during the period was primarily associated with the lump-sum revenue recognized in the Polar Pioneer and the completion of Development Driller II contract in December.
We recognized approximately 80% of the Polar Pioneer's lump-sum payment as revenue in 2015. The remaining portion associated with the demobilization of the rig will largely be recognized as contract drilling revenue in 2016.
Fourth quarter fleet utilization was 60%, down from 70% in the prior quarter. This results in a 632 operating days mainly attributable to fewer recontracting opportunities for our harsh environment and deepwater semis. As Jeremy mentioned, we achieved another quarter of outstanding revenue efficiency of 95.9% with full year 2015 averaging 96%. So that's 2 consecutive years with revenue efficiency at or above 95%.
And so far in 2016, the uptime performance of our rigs remains strong. This is attributable to the exceptional focus and execution of our operational and technical teams worldwide.
Fourth quarter operating and maintenance expense decreased by $86 million sequentially to $794 million. Although within our full year guidance, fourth quarter O&M was slightly higher than we forecasted due to unplanned demobilization costs, which were offset by increased revenue just discussed. The quarter was also impacted by lower activity due to 632 operating days during the quarter and the company's actions to reduce onshore and offshore process.
G&A expenses increased sequentially by $13 million to $58 million. As discussed during last quarter's call, fourth quarter G&A include restructuring costs associated with employee severance payments and office lease termination charges. Operating margin, including G&A expense, was approximately 54% in the quarter, driven higher by the impact of early contract terminations included in other revenue mentioned above. Adjusted for this additional revenue, our operating margins were approximately 43% and in line with the prior quarter.
The fourth quarter annual effective tax rate was 13.1% compared with 7.5% in the prior quarter. The increase was due largely to changes in adjusted pretax income, currency exchange rates and the impact of jurisdictional and operational structure changes for certain rigs implemented last quarter.
The annual effective tax rate for 2015 was 16.4%, lower than guidance due largely to the revenue associated with contract terminations during the fourth quarter.
We ended the quarter with $2.34 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This includes cash flow from operations of $960 million.
Capital expenditures totaled $665 million related to a second delivery of the Deepwater Proteus and other newbuild CapEx payments during the quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $211 million of debt at a cost of $196 million, bringing our total 2015 repurchases to $503 million at a cost of $473 million. About 85% of the early debt repurchases were near-dated maturities.
Cash interest for the debt repurchases is approximately $84 million over the remaining term. The vast majority of which benefit cash flows over the next 3 years.
As part of the organizational streamlining currently underway, we recently announced our intention to delist with the Swiss Stock Exchange. The last trading day is scheduled for March 30. The company shares will continue to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
I will now provide an update on our financial expectations for 2016, which reflect our confidence and continued strong uptime performance and more efficient cost structure. I will also update our liquidity's expectations through 2017.
Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 is expected to be between $60 million and $70 million. This includes customer reimbursables but excludes $200 million of early termination fees associated with the contract cancellations recognized to date in 2016.
After having completed our annual budgeting process, we can now update our preliminary cost guidance provided during the previous earnings call. We expect full year upgrading and maintenance expense to range between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. This level is about 12% lower than our early expectations due to fewer forecasted operating days associated with the early contract terminations in some of our rigs and limited opportunities for recontracting some of these assets in 2016.
The updated 2016 O&M guidance is also about 40% lower from the adjusted 2015 O&M costs. Of this reduction, approximately 70% is associated with reduced activity and lower ultra-deepwater cold stacking costs and about 10% from lower out-of-service costs.
The remaining 2016 O&M cost decrease is related to more streamlined operating and overhead support models. As we discussed, last quarter, we're implementing structural changes to our organization which will improve operating margins, earnings and related cash flow. These cost reductions are partially offset by the reactivation of the Henry Goodrich, which will commence its 2-year contract with Husky in the second quarter of 2016. The contract commencement of the 3 -- for our 3 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship, the Deepwater Thalassa, which Jeremy mentioned, as well as the Deepwater Proteus and Deepwater Conqueror, in the second and fourth quarters, respectively.
Our G&A expense for 2016 is still expected to be approximately $155 million. The reduced expense expectations are due mainly to our smaller corporate structure and related office closures. This guidance excludes approximately $5 million in restructuring costs.
We expect annual depreciation expense in 2016 to between $875 million and $925 million. Full year 2016 net interest expense is expected to be between $365 million and $380 million. The year-over-year decrease is mainly associated with the increased levels of capitalized interest due largely to the changes in the construction progress balances.
Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $175 million and $10 million, respectively.
Full year 2016 annual effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be between 28% and 32%. The increase is a result of the lower level of pretax income. Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, including $1.15 billion for the Deepwater Conqueror, Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon; and $180 million for capitalized interest. Maintenance CapEx is estimated to approximate $100 million. This reduced level of maintenance capital expenditures is consistent with our estimate for our limited number out-of-service days.
Turning now to our financial position. We have made the following assumptions and updated liquidity forecast through 2017. These include revenue efficiency of 95%, a limited number of new contract awards with day rates assumed at or near cash breakeven, existing drilling contracts remain intact and a working capital release of approximately $600 million in total for the years 2016, 2017.
Related to 2017, we expect total CapEx of approximately $600 million. This includes $175 million in newbuild shipyard payments, $150 million in capitalized interest and approximately $250 million in maintenance CapEx.
This maintenance CapEx guidance excludes the reactivation of the rigs for potential future contract awards. Based upon our current forecast, our projected liquidity at December 31, 2017, remains in the range $4 billion to $5 billion, with the vast majority of the contract termination payments received approximated forecasted operating cash flow under this contract. An exception is the recent cancellation of the DD1 contract. Unfortunately, we will not receive a termination payment as the customer has the contractual option to cancel with convenience. We estimate that this contract installation will reduce cash flow by approximately $56 million in 2016 and 2017. Terry will discuss this in more detail during his prepared comments. Our projection continues to include $3 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that remains available to us through mid-2019.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our operational results, including exceptional revenue efficiency and improvements in our cost structure. As we become a leaner organization, we are doing more with less. But the quality of our services remain high. We are not satisfied, however, and we'll continue to challenge the status quo to build on this momentum and strive for even greater performance to out-mitigate the reduced fleet utilization.
This concludes my prepared comments. I will now turn the call over to Terry. Terry?"

To simply say the offshore drilling market continues to be challenging is an understatement. Yet in the fourth quarter, our teams, onshore and offshore, fired on all cylinders to deliver multiple contracts when opportunities were scarce. With oil prices recently falling as low as the mid-20s and continuing to harbor around $30 a barrel, contract termination that began accelerating in December has continued. Fortunately, because of our strong contracts and relationships, we do not have other contracts in our backlog that permit uncompensated cancellation for convenience like the termination we recently announced related to the GlobalSantaFe Development Driller I.
I will reiterate what I said in our last earnings call, although demand is limited, we continue to fight for every opportunity in this highly competitive market. As a testament to our safety and operational performance and the creativity and tenacity of our marketing teams, we've added $378 million of contract backlog since the last earnings call, bringing our total 2015 to $763 million. We have contracted to reactivate the Henry Goodrich in Canada for 2 years, secured contracts to return the RIG 140 in India and the M.G. Hulme to work. We have also extended the contract for The Jack Bates in Australia and were awarded over 80 days for the Cajun Express in the Ivory Coast, while signing new contracts for active rigs, the Sedco 704 in U.K. and the Transocean Arctic in Norway. Our global footprint is vast and our ability to compete for work with our diverse fleet of rigs while capitalizing on our operational excellence is strong. As evidenced of our competitive positioning, I am especially pleased to report that since issuing our Fleet Status Report earlier this month, we were awarded a 6-month contract for the KG2 with an undisclosed operator and we expect to consummate several additional contracts in the near term. However, due to negotiations not yet being final and the competitiveness of the current market, we will refrain from commenting specifically on these today.
Our backlog as of February 11 was $15.5 billion dollars, the strongest in the industry, comprising primarily of IOCs with strong balance sheets. This balance sheet provides for solid cash flow generation with 78% of revenues contracted with the IOCs, 15% contracted with the independents and 7% contracted with that NOCs.
Turning to the current market. Challenging conditions are now likely to continue into 2017, negatively impacting both utilization and day rates while limiting rig contracting opportunities for all classes of rigs. Ultra-deepwater rates are near cash operating cost breakeven in most areas and market utilizations is down to 79%, with 27 rigs idle and 21 cold stacked.
To provided a little more perspective on the competitiveness of the market, the longest-term contracting opportunity currently in the Indian market has attracted 14 rigs from 10 different competitors. The associated rig classes range for fourth- to sixth-generation units with very competitive pricing expected.
Deepwater market utilization is down to 70% with only 3 fixtures year-to-date being recorded. This is coming off a total of 10 fixtures in '15, primarily in Australia and Asia. There are currently 10 idle and 11 cold-stacked deepwater rigs.
In India, the second ONGC 2-year tender attracted 8 rigs from 7 different contractors ranging from second- to fourth-generation rigs. The bidding on these opportunities will also be very competitive. Mid-water utilization is at 69% with 3 fixtures contracted year-to-date for U.K. and Norway. This adds to a total of 19 fixtures in 2015. Currently, there are 16 idle mid-water rigs and 15 units cold stacked. There are 47 cold-stacked units plus 48 floaters that are retired or being held for sale, with Transocean accounting for over 40% of the combined total. We expect these numbers to continue increasing with the overcapacity of supply and near-term lack of demand, forcing the retirement of more assets. The difficult macro conditions are also resulting in more customers terminating contracts early. This further exacerbates the oversupply floater market and as a direct result of customers curtailing parts of their offshore programs to preserve liquidity.
Despite the severity of the downturn, there are some emerging opportunities we are discussing with customers. Some are taking the countercyclical approach of contracting low-cost solutions for their programs later in '16 and into ''17, realizing the benefit of the reduced day rates to their overall project economics.
The jackup market continues to deteriorate as a result of increased market oversupply. This is also being exacerbated by a few rigs being cold stacked or scrapped, and the newbuild deliveries continue unabated. Utilization and day rates are rapidly declining. Marketed utilization is approximately 72% with 119 rigs currently warm stacked and 65 cold stacked. With the relatively low cost associated with stacking jackup rigs, scrapping activity is expected to be slower.
Unlike the floater market, NOCs are leveraging their local market dominance and renegotiating day rates lower based on the decline in oil prices. Industry delays of newbuild deliveries for both ultra-deepwater assets and jackups provides a medium-term relief in the excess rig supply. But continued industry attrition and stacking will contribute the most to permanently correcting the global oversupply situation.
Overall, our customers are focused on reducing costs but remain keenly focused on improving operational and safety performance. Additionally, with the duration of this downturn increasing, balance sheet strength of drilling contractors and their long-term viability are becoming key selection criteria for operators. With our strong liquidity, industry-leading backlog, diverse fleet and excellent safety and operational track record, we are positioning Transocean to increase our market-leading position. As such, we are keenly focused on extending both our customer and stakeholder expectations.
This concludes my overview of the market. So I will turn it over to Brad."

I will say, we have obviously been in conversations with various equipment providers. And I don't know if it's the same model that DE -- Diamond and GE entered into, but my guess is they're probably fairly similar. For us, we see some positives and some negatives. On the positive side, there's obviously an impact to near-term liquidity for the drilling contractor, which is good. And we also think it's positive to align critical equipment providers with drilling contractors with ultimately the operators to improve uptime performance. So those are 2 good things and things that we've certainly considered. For us, there appeared to be 2 challenges. One is while we recognize the benefit of near-term liquidity when you sell the BOP and the associated spares, the ongoing cost from the equipment provider, the health care contract, if you will, is a bit prohibitive. And so that's a concern for us. And the other piece of it is -- I think -- well, if you think about that cost of the contract, it really increases your total cost of ownership. So while you get the benefit near term, the total cost of ownership longer term becomes a bit of a challenge for us. The other thing for us is we have been unbelievably successful in improving our uptime performance for all subsea-related equipment. And so when you look at the incremental costs associated with the service agreements plus we don't see a lot of incremental opportunity of improvement that this could potentially bring, for us, we're not quite sure that the model works as we understand it today. Having said that, we are working with our equipment providers to look at other ways to align different models that may make more sense for us and also improve our uptime performance on our equipment. So it's something that we're pursuing. We're talking to equipment providers. My guess is the model will be different than what was announced by Diamond, but it's something that we're looking at."

407172,308383158,943083,"Transocean Ltd., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Brad, and a warm welcome to our employees, customers, investors and analysts participating in today's call. Our performance in the fourth quarter was strong across the board as we reported adjusted net income of $615 million or $1.68 per dilute",1138,"Thank you, Brad, and a warm welcome to our employees, customers, investors and analysts participating in today's call. Our performance in the fourth quarter was strong across the board as we reported adjusted net income of $615 million or $1.68 per diluted share on $1.9 billion in revenues. For the full year, our adjusted net income was $1.7 billion or $4.74 per diluted share on $7.4 billion in revenue.
During the quarter, our strong revenue efficiency, our intense focus on our cost structure and the proceeds from some early contract terminations resulted in an operating margin, including G&A, of approximately 54%. For the full year, excluding the impact of the Macondo settlement, our adjusted operating margin was 47%.
These results reflect the unwavering commitment of the entire Transocean team to delivering the best operational performance in the industry. So to those Transocean employees who may be listening to today's call, thank you for your continued focus and dedication throughout what was a very challenging year for our industry.
In addition to delivering strong financial results, I'm pleased report that Transocean further reduced its total recordable incident rate during the quarter while simultaneously improving uptime and revenue efficiency, which was an impressive 95.9% for the fourth quarter.
For the full year of 2015, we produced the lowest annual total recordable incident rate in the company's history while delivering our highest annual average revenue efficiency of 96%, which further solidifies our position that safety and efficiency go hand in hand.
Once again, I would like to recognize and thank our crews and our shore-based personnel for their continued commitment to both protecting each other and the environments in which we operate and maximizing uptime for our customers.
I would also like to take a moment to recognize our marketing and contracts teams. Despite the extremely challenging market conditions, by leveraging our excellent operational performance and introducing some new commercial models and alternative solutions for our customers, we added a number of contracts to our backlog late in the fourth quarter. While most of the awards were of short duration, we were pleased to secure some longer-term arrangements in Canada, India and the North Sea. Terry will soon provide more detail regarding each of these pictures.
Needless to say, we are pleased with the company's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the full year of 2015. However, we recognize that there is more to be done. As we move through 2016, we will further define and capitalize on opportunities to reduce our incident rate and improve our uptime performance. We will also take additional actions to streamline and drive efficiencies into our organization and our processes, and we will continue to high-grade our fleet.
In an effort to further improve our safety and operational performance in 2016, we are investing time and resources into enhancing our tools, procedures and training programs. Once completed and rolled out company-wide, we will be at an even stronger position to drive procedural discipline and consistency of performance across our entire fleet.
While investing in new tools and training programs to drive safety and performance improvements, we are also reevaluating our organization and our internal processes and identifying opportunities to optimize each. As discussed in some detail last quarter, we are reorganizing internally. Among other things, we have significantly reduced the layers between senior management and the rig. As a result, our organization has become flatter and our operational efficiency has improved materially. This organizational change has also resulted in the majority of our support functions being centralized in Houston with the downsizing or outright elimination of hub offices around the world. These changes began in late 2015 and should be fully implemented by the end of the second quarter of 2016, which will result in additional cost savings as we progress through the year.
In addition to improving the efficiency of our structure, you will remember from the last call that we are also defining and implementing innovative approaches to enhance our maintenance activities and to reduce the time and cost required to stack a rig. Well, I'm pleased to report that we are now realizing the benefits of these approaches. And as you will here in Mark's guidance, we expect to recognize further cost reductions in both areas as we move through the year.
And finally, since we remain confident in the ultimate recovery of commodity prices and the offshore industry, we are continuing to high-grade our fleet. The Deepwater Thalassa, the first of 4 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships that will operate for Shell on 10-year contracts went on day rate in early February in the Gulf of Mexico. The second newbuild drillship for Shell, the Deepwater Proteus, is expected to arrive in the Gulf of Mexico in several weeks, where it will begin its contract for Shell in the second quarter. Lastly, the Deepwater Conqueror, which has a 5-year contract with Chevron, is on schedule and due to be delivered later this year.
While we are certainly excited about these additions to our fleet and the future revenue and earnings that they represent, we also recognize the need to continually reevaluate the composition, capability and marketability of individual rigs within our fleet. Consistent with our fleet renewal strategy, during the quarter, we classified 2 additional rigs, the Deepwater Navigator and the GSF Grand Banks, as held for sale.
For those keeping score, since the start of this downturn, we have now 24 floaters either scrapped or held for sale. As we move forward, we will continue to objectively evaluate both our rigs coming off of contract as well as our currently stacked rigs to quickly determine whether or not each individual asset still supports our long-term asset strategy.
Before I hand the call over to Mark, who will provide you with additional comments on the company's financial performance; and then Terry, who will provide an update on the market, I would just like to take a moment to stress that the Deepwater floater market is the most challenged it has ever been. To overcome this challenge, we will continue with the approach of managing those things within our control, such as continuing to improve on safety and operational performance, streamlining the business and our processes and high-grading our fleet and our crews. Our customers need superior execution, and our ability to distinguish Transocean in these area is what will keep our rigs working and allow us to build on our reputation as the industry's preferred contract driller.
With our $15.5 billion backlog, of which approximately 89% is with investment-grade companies, and our more than $5 billion of liquidity, we have the platform that we need to emerge from this downturn in a much stronger leadership position, and I have every confidence that we will.
With that, let me hand it over to Mark."
407172,308383158,943083,"Transocean Ltd., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. As we provided extensive detail on the fourth quarter's results in our earnings release, I'll only briefly touch on our quarter's financial performance during this call. I will focus instead on providing you with an",1490,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. As we provided extensive detail on the fourth quarter's results in our earnings release, I'll only briefly touch on our quarter's financial performance during this call. I will focus instead on providing you with an update to our 2016 guidance and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
For the fourth quarter 2015, we reported net income attributable to controlling interests of $611 million or $1.66 per diluted share. These results included $4 million or $0.02 per share in net unfavorable items that are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $615 million or $1.68 per diluted share.
Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased by $243 million sequentially to $1.85 billion. Other revenue increased $356 million due to the early terminations of the Polar Pioneer, Discoverer Americas and Sedco 714. Contract drilling revenue decreased $113 million due to reduced activity and rig retirement, partially offset by higher ultra-deepwater revenue efficiency and higher demobilization revenue. The demobilization revenue during the period was primarily associated with the lump-sum revenue recognized in the Polar Pioneer and the completion of Development Driller II contract in December.
We recognized approximately 80% of the Polar Pioneer's lump-sum payment as revenue in 2015. The remaining portion associated with the demobilization of the rig will largely be recognized as contract drilling revenue in 2016.
Fourth quarter fleet utilization was 60%, down from 70% in the prior quarter. This resulted in 630 fewer operating days mainly attributable to fewer recontracting opportunities for our harsh environment and midwater semis. As Jeremy mentioned, we achieved another quarter of outstanding revenue efficiency of 95.9% with full year 2015 averaging 96%. So that's 2 consecutive years with revenue efficiency at or above 95%.
And so far in 2016, the uptime performance of our rigs remains strong. This is attributable to the exceptional focus and execution of our operational and technical teams worldwide.
Fourth quarter operating and maintenance expense decreased by $86 million sequentially to $794 million. Although within our full year guidance, fourth quarter O&M was slightly higher than we forecasted due to unplanned demobilization costs, which were offset by increased revenue just discussed. The quarter was also impacted by lower activity due to 630 fewer operating days during the quarter and the company's actions to reduce onshore and offshore costs.
G&A expenses increased sequentially by $13 million to $58 million. As discussed during last quarter's call, fourth quarter G&A included restructuring costs associated with employee severance payments and office lease termination charges. Operating margin, including G&A expense, was approximately 54% in the quarter, driven higher by the impact of early contract terminations included in other revenue mentioned above. Adjusted for this additional revenue, our operating margins were approximately 43% and in line with the prior quarter.
The fourth quarter annual effective tax rate was 13.1% compared with 7.5% in the prior quarter. The increase was due largely to changes in adjusted pretax income, currency exchange rates and the impact of jurisdictional and operational structure changes for certain rigs implemented last quarter.
The annual effective tax rate for 2015 was 16.4%, lower than guided due largely to the revenue associated with contract terminations during the fourth quarter.
We ended the quarter with $2.34 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This includes cash flow from operations of $960 million.
Capital expenditures totaled $665 million related to a second delivery of the Deepwater Proteus and other newbuild CapEx payments during the quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $211 million of debt at a cost of $196 million, bringing our total 2015 repurchases to $503 million at a cost of $473 million. About 85% of the early debt repurchases were near-dated maturities.
Cash interest for the debt repurchases is approximately $84 million over the remaining term. The vast majority of which benefit cash flows over the next 3 years.
As part of the organizational streamlining currently underway, we recently announced our intention to delist with the Swiss Stock Exchange. The last trading day is scheduled for March 30. The company shares will continue to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
I will now provide an update on our financial expectations for 2016, which reflect our confidence and continued strong uptime performance and more efficient cost structure. I will also update our liquidity expectations through 2017.
Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 is expected to be between $60 million and $70 million. This includes customer reimbursables but excludes $200 million of early termination fees associated with the contract cancellations recognized to date in 2016.
After having completed our annual budgeting process, we can now update our preliminary cost guidance provided during the previous earnings call. We expect full year upgrading and maintenance expense to range between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. This level is about 12% lower than our earlier expectations due to fewer forecasted operating days associated with the early contract terminations on some of our rigs and limited opportunities for recontracting some of these assets in 2016.
The updated 2016 O&M guidance is also about 40% lower from the under-adjusted 2015 O&M costs. Of this reduction, approximately 70% is associated with reduced activity and lower ultra-deepwater cold stacking costs and about 10% from lower out-of-service costs.
The remaining 2016 O&M cost decrease is related to more streamlined operating and overhead support models. As we discussed, last quarter, we're implementing structural changes to our organization which will improve operating margins, earnings and related cash flow. These cost reductions are partially offset by the reactivation of the Henry Goodrich, which will commence its 2-year contract with Husky in the second quarter of 2016. The contract commencement of the 3 -- for our 3 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships, the Deepwater Thalassa, which Jeremy mentioned, as well as the Deepwater Proteus and Deepwater Conqueror, in the second and fourth quarters, respectively.
Our G&A expense for 2016 is still expected to be approximately $155 million. The reduced expense expectations are due mainly to our smaller corporate structure and related office closures. This guidance excludes approximately $5 million in restructuring costs.
We expect annual depreciation expense in 2016 to between $875 million and $925 million. Full year 2016 net interest expense is expected to be between $365 million and $380 million. The year-over-year decrease is mainly associated with the increased levels of capitalized interest due largely to the changes in the construction progress balances.
Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $175 million and $10 million, respectively.
Full year 2016 annual effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be between 28% and 32%. The increase is a result of the lower level of pretax income. Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, including $1.15 billion for the Deepwater Conqueror, Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon; and $180 million for capitalized interest. Maintenance CapEx is estimated to approximate $100 million. This reduced level of maintenance capital expenditures is consistent with our estimate for our limited number out-of-service days.
Turning now to our financial position. We have made the following assumptions and updated liquidity forecast through 2017. These include: revenue efficiency of 95%; a limited number of new contract awards with day rates assumed at or near cash breakeven; existing drilling contracts remain intact; and a working capital release of approximately $600 million in total for the years 2016, 2017.
Related to 2017, we expect total CapEx of approximately $600 million. This includes $175 million in newbuild shipyard payments, $150 million in capitalized interest and approximately $250 million in maintenance CapEx.
This maintenance CapEx guidance excludes the reactivation of the rigs for potential future contract awards. Based upon our current forecast, our projected liquidity at December 31, 2017, remains in the range $4 billion to $5 billion, with the vast majority of the contract termination payments received approximate a forecasted operating cash flow under this contract. An exception is the recent cancellation of the DD1 contract. Unfortunately, we will not receive a termination payment as the customer has the contractual option to cancel for convenience. We estimate that this contract cancellation will reduce cash flow by approximately $56 million in 2016 and 2017. Terry will discuss this in more detail during the prepared comments. Our projection continues to include our $3 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that remains available to us through mid-2019.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our operational results, including exceptional revenue efficiency and improvements in our cost structure. As we become a leaner organization, we are doing more with less. But the quality of our services remain high. We are not satisfied, however, and we'll continue to challenge the status quo to build on this momentum and strive for even greater performance to out-mitigate the reduced fleet utilization.
This concludes my prepared comments. I will now turn the call over to Terry. Terry?"

To simply say the offshore drilling market continues to be challenging is an understatement. Yet in the fourth quarter, our teams, onshore and offshore, fired on all cylinders to deliver multiple contracts when opportunities were scarce. With oil prices recently falling as low as the mid-20s and continuing to hover around $30 a barrel, contract terminations that began accelerating in December have continued. Fortunately, because of our strong contracts and relationships, we do not have other contracts in our backlog that permit uncompensated cancellation for convenience like the termination we recently announced related to the GlobalSantaFe Development Driller I.
I will reiterate what I said in our last earnings call. Although demand is limited, we continue to fight for every opportunity in this highly competitive market. As a testament to our safety and operational performance and the creativity and tenacity of our marketing teams, we've added $378 million of contract backlog since the last earnings call, bringing our total 2015 to $763 million. We have contracted to reactivate the Henry Goodrich in Canada for 2 years, secured contracts to return the RIG 140 in India and the M.G. Hulme to work. We have also extended the contract for The Jack Bates in Australia and were awarded over 80 days for the Cajun Express in the Ivory Coast, while signing new contracts for active rigs, the Sedco 704 in U.K. and the Transocean Arctic in Norway. Our global footprint is vast and our ability to compete for work with our diverse fleet of rigs while capitalizing on our operational excellence is strong. As evidence of our competitive positioning, I am especially pleased to report that since issuing our Fleet Status Report earlier this month, we were awarded a 6-month contract for the KG2 with an undisclosed operator and we expect to consummate several additional contracts in the near term. However, due to negotiations not yet being final and the competitiveness of the current market, we will refrain from commenting specifically on these today.
Our backlog as of February 11 was $15.5 billion dollars, the strongest in the industry, comprising primarily of IOCs with strong balance sheets. This [indiscernible] provides for solid cash flow generation with 78% of revenues contracted with the IOCs, 15% contracted with the independents and 7% contracted with the NOCs.
Turning to the current market. Challenging conditions are now likely to continue into 2017, negatively impacting both utilization and day rates while limiting rig contracting opportunities for all classes of rigs. Ultra-deepwater rates are near cash operating cost breakeven in most areas and market utilizations is down to 79%, with 27 rigs idle and 21 cold stacked.
To provide a little more perspective on the competitiveness of the market, the longest-term contracting opportunity currently in the Indian market has attracted 14 rigs from 10 different competitors. The associated rig classes range from fourth- to sixth-generation units with very competitive pricing expected.
Deepwater market utilization is down to 70% with only 3 fixtures year-to-date being recorded. This is coming off a total of 10 fixtures in '15, primarily in Australia and Asia. There are currently 10 idle and 11 cold-stacked deepwater rigs.
In India, the second ONGC 2-year tender attracted 8 rigs from 7 different contractors ranging from second- to fourth-generation rigs. The bidding on these opportunities will also be very competitive. Midwater utilization is at 69% with 3 fixtures contracted year-to-date for U.K. and Norway. This adds to a total of 19 fixtures in 2015. Currently, there are 16 idle midwater rigs and 15 units cold stacked. There are 47 cold-stacked units plus 48 floaters that are retired or being held for sale, with Transocean accounting for over 40% of the combined total. We expect these numbers to continue increasing with the overcapacity of supply and near-term lack of demand, forcing the retirement of more assets. The difficult macro conditions are also resulting in more customers terminating contracts early. This further exacerbates the oversupply floater market and is a direct result of customers curtailing parts of their offshore programs to preserve liquidity.
Despite the severity of the downturn, there are some emerging opportunities we are discussing with customers. Some are taking the countercyclical approach of contracting low-cost solutions for their programs later in '16 and into '17, realizing the benefit of the reduced day rates to their overall project economics.
The jackup market continues to deteriorate as a result of increased market oversupply. This is also being exacerbated by a few rigs being cold stacked or scrapped, and the newbuild deliveries continue unabated. Utilization and day rates are rapidly declining. Marketed utilization is approximately 72% with 119 rigs currently warm stacked and 65 cold stacked. With the relatively low costs associated with stacking jackup rigs, scrapping activity is expected to be slower.
Unlike the floater market, NOCs are leveraging their local market dominance and renegotiating day rates lower based on the decline in oil prices. Industry delays of newbuild deliveries for both ultra-deepwater assets and jackups provides some medium-term relief in the excess rig supply. But continued industry attrition and stacking will contribute the most to permanently correcting the global oversupply situation.
Overall, our customers are focused on reducing costs but remain keenly focused on improving operational and safety performance. Additionally, with the duration of this downturn increasing, balance sheet strength of drilling contractors and their long-term viability are becoming key selection criteria for operators. With our strong liquidity, industry-leading backlog, diverse fleet and excellent safety and operational track record, we are positioning Transocean to increase our market-leading position. As such, we are keenly focused on extending both our customer and stakeholder expectations.
This concludes my overview of the market. So I will turn it over to Brad."

I will say, we have obviously been in conversations with various equipment providers. And I don't know if it's the same model that DE -- Diamond and GE entered into, but my guess is they're probably fairly similar. For us, we see some positives and some negatives. On the positive side, there's obviously an impact to near-term liquidity for the drilling contractor, which is good. And we also think it's positive to align critical equipment providers with drilling contractors with ultimately the operators to improve uptime performance. So those are 2 good things and things that we've certainly considered. For us, though, there appear to be 2 challenges. One is, while we recognize the benefit of near-term liquidity when you sell the BOP and the associated spares, the ongoing cost from the equipment provider, the health care contract, if you will, is a bit prohibitive. And so that's a concern for us. And the other piece of it is -- I mean, well, if you think about that cost of the contract, it really increases your total cost of ownership. So while you get the benefit near term, the total cost of ownership longer term becomes a bit of a challenge for us. The other thing for us is we have been unbelievably successful in improving our uptime performance for all subsea-related equipment. And so when you look at the incremental costs associated with the service agreements plus we don't see a lot of incremental opportunity of improvement that this could potentially bring, for us, we're not quite sure that the model works as we understand it today. Having said that, we are working with our equipment providers to look at other ways to align different models that may make more sense for us and also improve our uptime performance on our equipment. So it's something that we're pursuing. We're talking to equipment providers. My guess is the model will be different than what was announced by Diamond, but it's something that we're looking at."

Joining me today or Mark Mey, Chief Financial Officer, who will later provide the financial overview; and Terry Bonno, Senior Vice President of Marketing, who will then provide an overview of the market. 
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $254 million in the first quarter or $0.69 per diluted share on $1.3 billion of revenue. Although a few puts and takes in the quarter, which Mark will explain, we are very pleased that our underlying operating performance continue to deliver strong revenue efficiency of 95% as well as further cost reduction. Of note, we deliver this high level of performance while breaking in the Deepwater Thalassa, the first of 4 newbuild drillships commencing 10-year contracts with Shell. 
As such, I would like to personally take a moment to thank our newbuild project teams, our crews offshore and our shore-based support for your exemplary work in the first quarter. 
As we move to the balance of 2016, we will continue our intense focus on safety and operational integrity, both of which continue to improve. On uptime performance, which continues to average 95% or better across our fleet; on cost control, which resulted in meaningful sequential reductions in operating and maintenance expense and G&A expense; on the high grading of our fleet, which we demonstrated in the first quarter with the addition of 1 new high-specification ultra-deepwater drillship and the retirement of an older rig; and on the further strengthening of our customer relationship, which helped us to secure additional contracts in a highly competitive implement. 
Speaking first about cost control, we continue to identify and realize opportunities to reduce operating, stacking and overhead costs to maximize our operating margins in the face of declining activity. For rigs under contract, we are streamlining maintenance activities, which are delivering sustainable cost savings while simultaneously increasing uptime. 
In addition to recognizing savings associated with process deficiencies, we continue to work closely with our supply partners to drive cost out of manufacturing, maintenance, service and repair. To date, the realized savings are ranging between 20% and 30% for some of our costliest areas, including riser inspection and certification, engine overhauls and crane maintenance. 
The rigs that need to be stacked, we challenged our teams to look beyond conventional practices especially when it came to our dynamically positioned rigs. To find ways to preserve these assets in the most cost-effective manner. As a direct result of their expertise and ingenuity, we are now clustering these rigs in benign sheltered environments offshore using a temporary mooring system. As part of the process, we are protecting critical equipment and controls use and preservation fluids and dehumidification units to ensure that the rigs are in condition to be reactivated in an expedient and cost-effective manner when market conditions improve. 
As a result of these actions, stacking costs associated with these rigs have decreased by approximately 75% since last year to less than $20,000 a day. For our shore base support and overhead cost, we have almost finalized the restructuring of our organization which includes centralizing our global support functions in Houston. This eliminated or significantly downsized our hub offices around the world while reducing barriers between our management and the rig. While streamlining maintenance processes, stacking rig and restructuring the organization are not necessarily easy and require tough decisions, we are pleased with our progress in these 3 key areas of cost reduction, which will continue to positively impact our operating results going forward. 
Turning to our fleet, we are pleased to welcome the Deepwater Proteus to Transocean. the Deepwater Proteus, which is the second of 4 newbuild drillships contracted to work for Shell, is expected to commence operations in the coming days. In addition to the Deepwater Proteus, in March, we christened the Deepwater Conqueror at the Daiwu shipyard in Korea. This ultra-deepwater drillship is scheduled to commence her 5-year contract with Chevron and the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the year. 
As a reminder, all of these rigs are designed to operate in water depths of up to 12,000 feet and drill wells to a depth of 40,000 feet. They were constructed with Transocean's patented dual activity drilling technology, industry-leading hoisting capacity and dual BOP's. 
These rigs are fully outfitted to be upgraded with 20,000 PSI BOP's, in short, they are excellent additions to our fleet. While discussing the newbuilds, and as previously announced, we have reached agreements to delay the deliveries of our uncontracted floaters and jackups into 2020. 
These deferrals will help us preserve near-term, while continuing with our fleet renewal strategy albeit at a slower pace. In addition to our own new builds bills, we are now seeing more sixth-generation deepwater rigs marketed for sale. As stated in previous calls, we will continue to evaluate these opportunities with our interest limited to those assets that would enhance our overall fleet quality, while furthering our fleet strategy. However, it's important to note that we continue to place a very high priority on liquidity and we'll remain selective in regard to any potential transactions. 
As part of high grading the feet, we also continue to assess capability and marketability of our existing rigs. Through this review, we made a decision in the first quarter to recycle the midwater floater, that Transocean John Shaw, increasing our total rigs recycled or held for sale since the start of the downturn to 25. 
As we move through the year, we will continue this process and we'll remain decisive in determining the future of each rig as the market continues to evolve. 
Before turning the call over to Mark and then Terry, I'd like to take a moment to talk at a high level about the market. As you well know, the near-term market outlook remains very challenging. At this point, we do not expect to see a meaningful recovery in rig activity before 2017 as customer budgets have been set for 2016 and are unlikely to improve until there's further recovery in the price of oil and confidence regarding its sustainability is bolstered. Even so, remain very confident in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development and the drilling industry's inevitable recovery. 
I visit with customers on a regular basis and my recent conversations with them have reinforce our position that future hydrocarbon supply require significant production from offshore and more specifically from deepwater fields. Our largest customers have significant deepwater reserves and they recognized without increased activity, they will face production declines and reserve replacement challenges that will be difficult and costly to reverse and overcome. 
North America, Venezuela, Mexico and the U.K. have all experienced year-over-year production declines and we expect this will only increase as the recent deficiencies and reinvestment continue to impact overall supply. Additionally, in my customer discussions, it's becoming more evident that they recognize the benefits of narrowing their supplier base fourth quarter services to a few select partners that can help them to deliver their operational and financial objectives. This market downturn has allowed them to cherry pick the highest quality contractors and service providers and move toward agreement that should promote direct negotiations on some of their prioritized opportunities. 
Through both pricing concessions and a more collaborative approach between operators, contractors and service providers, the high cost previously associated with much of the Deepwater activity are beginning to abate. The industry is now witnessing sustainable cost reductions that will ultimately drive economic development of large offshore projects well below previous price per barrel requirements. 
As wells are drilled faster and more precisely and production equipment and facilities are engineered using more efficient approaches, the competitiveness of these assets will continue to improve. As oil prices has then recover and the liquidity profile for our customers improves, we expect the offshore drilling activity declines we have experienced will reverse. When that time comes, we are confident that our stacked rigs are not only being preserved in the most cost-effective manner but in ways that will enable their swift reactivation and return to operation. Until that time, we will continue to prudently manage our balance sheet and cost structure while remaining intently focused on operations to ensure we remain the offshore industry's driller of choice. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."
407172,315687557,977390,"Transocean Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I will recap the first quarter results, provide an update to our 2016 guidance and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position. For the first quarter of 2016, we reported net income attri",1238,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I will recap the first quarter results, provide an update to our 2016 guidance and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position. 
For the first quarter of 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $249 million or $0.68 per diluted share. These results included $5 million or $0.01 per diluted share in net unfavorable items that are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $254 million or $0.69 per diluted share. 
Contract drilling revenue for the first quarter of 2016 decreased by $345 million, sequentially to $1.1 billion. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with 634 fewer operating days during the quarter. Our operational and technical teams continued to perform at a very high level, delivering another quarter of 95% revenue efficiency. Other revenue decreased $165 million sequentially to $230 million during the quarter. This included $209 million in early contract termination fees associated with the Discoverer Deep Seas and the Deepwater Millennium. 
When adjusting these early contract termination fees or contract drilling revenues, expected during first quarter, these rigs were as planned, $133 million relate today's beyond March 31, 2016. 
First quarter operating and maintenance expense was $655 million, down from $794 million in the prior quarter. The 16% decrease was largely due to lower activity, cost savings related to operational and restructuring initiatives and reduced cost for our fifth- and sixth-gen DP floaters. This was partially offset by the $45 million of reactivation costs for Henry Goodrich expense during the quarter. The Goodrich begin strategic contract with later this month. 
Additionally, we recognize $18 million of mobilization costs on the geo- shift development driller #1 that was previously anticipated to be recorded in the second quarter. Also, first quarter O&M expenses were negatively impacted by $3 million of restructuring costs associated with employee severances. 
G&A expenses totaled $43 million, down $15 million from the prior quarter, which reflects our ongoing restructuring efforts. Our operating margin including G&A expense was approximately 47% for the quarter, driven higher by the impact of early contract terminations included in other revenue above. 
The first quarter annual effective tax rate was 22.8%, compared with 13.1% in the prior quarter. This increase was due to the lower adjusted pretax income and change in the mix of operating results from certain jurisdictions. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the first quarter of $631 million. This includes our working capital release of $128 million. 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $368 million, largely associated with payments on the newbuilds. Since the last call, we opportunistically repurchased $100 million of debt at a cost of $84 million. As [indiscernible] budgets were settled after the end of the quarter, the first quarter's balance sheet does not reflect these net repurchases. 
Cash interest savings for these debt repurchases is approximately $23 million over the remaining term. This brings our total repurchases for the 3 quarters to $603 million at a cost of $557 million and aggregate interest cost savings of approximately $105 million through maturity of this debt. 
I will now provide an update on our financial expectations for 2016 and our liquidity expectations through 2017. Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 is expected to be between $260 million and $270 million. This includes customer reimbursables and the early contract termination fees recognized to date in 2016. 
We expect full year operating and maintenance expense to raise between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion. The 6% decrease from our previous guidance reflects reduced fleet activity, primarily as a result of early contract terminations. Consistent with activity, O&M cost will be higher in the first half of 2016 and trend lower toward the latter quarters as number of rigs active decline during the year. 
We estimate that O&M expense for the second quarter will be in the range of between $550 million and $570 million. We also expect the second half of the year to benefit from reduced expenses and the beneficial cost impact resulting from a smaller streamlined support organization. 
Full year G&A expenses are expected to be approximately $160 million. So [indiscernible] O&M, this is anticipated to decrease as we progress through the year. We estimate that the second quarter G&A will be approximately $45 million. Full year 2016 net interest expense is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million. 
Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $185 million and $10 million, respectively. Full year 2016 annual effective tax rate is expected to be in the range between 28% and 30% as we expect higher tax rate for the remainder of the year. This is due to a significant reduction in net income from operations as fewer rigs are working and some have lower day rates. 
There are no changes to our expected 2016 depreciation expense. Capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, including approximately $1 billion for the newbuild Deepwater Conqueror, Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon. This amount includes capitalized interest. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $80 million for the remainder of 2016. 
Turning now to our financial position. Since our last call, we have enhanced our liquidity position by announcing 2 separate future newbuild delivery deferrals. In early march, we agreed with to defer delivery and related payments of our 5 high-specification jackups. This defers approximately $735 million from 2018 and 2019 into 2020. 
In April, we amended the construction contracts with Jurong as a late delivery of 2 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships by approximately 6 months each. These 2 proprietary Jurong has began [indiscernible] 3 [indiscernible] design drillships and are now expected to be delivered in the first and third quarter of 2020. This defers approximately $420 million from 2019 into 2020. 
We continue to evaluate the secured financing options in our 5 contracted newbuild drillships. As you are aware, these rigs are highly marketable assets due to the quality of their assets and the respective contracts as well as the contract duration. We'll provide a more update in due course. 
We reiterate our assumptions related to our updated liquidity forecast through 2017. This include revenue efficiency of 95%; a limited number of new contract awards with day rates assumed to be at or near cash breakeven; working capital release of approximately $500 million in total for the years 2016 and 2017. This includes the previously mentioned $128 million of release in the first quarter. 
In 2017, we expect total CapEx of approximately $625 million. This includes $375 million in newbuild CapEx and $250 million for maintenance CapEx. Based on our current forecast, our projected liquidity at December 31, 2017, remains in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion. 
Our projection includes our $3 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that remains available to us through [indiscernible] 2019. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our strong operational results, adequate liquidity and substantial contract backlog. We also believe the quality of our fleet, together with our propriety [indiscernible] focused on efficient rig reactivation, better positions us to win more than our fair share of future drilling contracts, increasing our contract backlog and further reupholstering our financial strength. 
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry."

As you all know, the market remains very challenging despite the recent increase in oil prices from the multiyear lows experienced early in the year, operators remain hesitant to commit to long-term project that requires significant levels of capital, however, as Jeremy mentioned, we continue to have manyfold dialogue with our customers and they remain firmly committed to their deepwater assets as they view this as a necessary source of future reserves. 
The real question is around the velocity with which these customers will ultimately add rigs in response to declines in reserve displacements and production. Even more so than in past cycles, our customers realize that the reduction in offshore drilling is not sustainable, especially considering the fact that the global demand for energy continues to increase. 
In the meantime, as we await the eventual recovery, we will continue to position our fleet to take advantage of opportunities in the market. As stated in previous conference calls, our teams continue to battle for every opportunity in this highly competitive market. 
Looking at ways that we can best align with our customers oil plans and business objectives. This approach has once again, proven to be successful as we signed several new contracts resulting in the addition of $138 million of contract backlog since last earnings call, bringing our 2016 total to $184 million. 
In our ultra-deepwater fleet, we extended the duration on the Deepwater Invictus by adding a 2-well contract at $350,000 a day in Trinidad, with additional bonus opportunity. This contract award highlights our stellar operational performance for BHP and our willingness to work with the customer to best meet their project priorities. We've also secured a 6-month contract on the KG2 returning her to work after being idled. You are like aware of the recent announcement from Hurricane Energy with respect to the Pittsburgh, we've waited to formally announce this contract pending approval of their board early this month. 
In India, we were awarded a 3-year contract of the midwater floater in, also returning her to work after being idle. In total, our fleet and commercial strategy enabled us to return 3 idled rigs to our active fleet and to further extend work for another rig during the quarter. 
As a result, our backlog as of April 21, is an industry leading $14.6 billion. This foundation provides solid future cash flow generation with 79% of the revenues contracted with the super majors, 13% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the national oil companies. And further, we do not have contract in our current backlog that permit cancellation for convenience without compensation. 
Turning to the global market. While we are seeing some positive movement in the macro environment and improve confidence regarding oil prices for the second half of '16, we expect challenging conditions are likely to continue into '17 impacting both utilization and day rates. In order for contacting conditions to improve for next year's budgeting cycle, customers need to see these improved oil prices sustain in the coming months. 
As the supermarket stands today, ultra-deepwater market utilization is down 79% with 32 rigs idled and 23 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, we have seen 11 fixtures that have been executed, mostly in Asia and India, in addition to a few South America and Africa with the majority being short-term work. Longer-term fixtures were largely agreed in '15 but executed in '16. 
With the amount of rig availability in the market, including farmout opportunities, we'll continue to see strong competition for every opportunity. Another example of this is increasing competition as we understand it as the recently announced Chevron Nigeria tender for 2 years, which drew numerous contractors. 
As we wait at the award of the long-term expiration tender in India expected to be within the next 2 weeks, we understand the development work requiring 2 additional 1,500 meter DPs for almost 3 years term per rig commencing in 2017. 
It's encouraging to see some customers are taking advantage of the lower pricing environment to pursue with their project. Deepwater market utilization is down 71%, driven 5 fixtures year-to-date, primarily in Asia and Europe. They're currently 11 idled and 10 cold-stacked deepwater units while we await the result of the ongoing 6-meter tender in India. We're also happy to see another long-term tender about to come to the market. ONGC is expected to release the department tender for 1 more unit for almost 2-year term that will commence in '17. 
Mid-water utilization is at 69% with 6 fixtures contracted year-to-date mainly in India and Norway, currently there are 16 midwater rigs that are idled and 18 units cold-stacked. As previously stated, continued stability and improvement in commodity pricing will increase the number of opportunities for these assets in the U.K. and Norway. 
Industry-wide, there are 151 cold-stacked floaters [indiscernible] 53 [ph] units are retired or being held for sale. We expect these numbers to increase with a relative high level of supply and near-term lack of demand forcing the retirement of most asset. 
The jackup market continues to deteriorate as a result of increased market oversupply. This is being exacerbated by very few rigs being scrapped to their minimal cost associated with cold stacking and the growing supply of newbuild rigs being delivered. Marketing utilization is approximately 71% with 120 rigs currently idle and 69 cold-stacked. 
There have been 21 fixtures year-to-date mainly in the Middle East, Asia and U.K. Unlike the floater market, national oil companies are leveraging their local market dominance and contract terms and either renegotiating day rates or outright canceling the remaining term. Overall, our customers remain focused on cost reduction, operational excellence and safe operation. And they remain committed to delivering their core business, which will undoubtedly include Deepwater exploration and development. Until we experience the uptick in demand for our assets and services, we will move forward with our strong liquidity, industry-leading backlog and excellent operational and safety performance as we continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we progress through the downturn. 
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to Brad."

But in general, you're going to see a significant reduction in operating costs. In addition, as you know, with the first quarter's contract cancellations, we announce that those rigs are going to be cold-stacked. There are certainly cost associated with cold-stacked units which is expense in the first 30 to 60 days.

Joining me today are Mark Mey, Chief Financial Officer, who will later provide the financial overview; and Terry Bonno, Senior Vice President of Marketing, who will then provide an overview of the market.
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $254 million in the first quarter or $0.69 per diluted share on $1.3 billion of revenues. While there are a few puts and takes in the quarter, which Mark will explain, we are very pleased that our underlying operating performance continued to deliver strong revenue efficiency of 95% as well as further cost reductions. Of note, we delivered this high level of performance while breaking in the Deepwater Thalassa, the first of 4 newbuild drillships commencing 10-year contracts with Shell. As such, I would like to personally take a moment to thank our newbuild project teams, our crews offshore and our shore-based support for your exemplary work in the first quarter.
As we move to the balance of 2016, we will continue our intense focus on safety and operational integrity, both of which continued to improve; on uptime performance, which continues to average 95% or better across our fleet; on cost control, which resulted in meaningful sequential reductions in operating and maintenance expense and G&A expense; on the high grading of our fleet, which we demonstrated in the first quarter with the addition of 1 new high-specification ultra-deepwater drillship and the retirement of an older rig; and on the further strengthening of our customer relationships, which helped us to secure additional contracts in a highly competitive environment.
Speaking first about cost control, we continue to identify and realize opportunities to reduce operating, stacking and overhead costs to maximize our operating margins in the face of declining activity. For rigs under contract, we are streamlining maintenance activities, which are delivering sustainable cost savings while simultaneously increasing uptime.
In addition to recognizing savings associated with process deficiencies, we continue to work closely with our supply partners to drive cost out of manufacturing, maintenance, service and repair. To date, the realized savings are ranging between 20% and 30% for some of our costliest areas, including riser inspection and certification, engine overhauls and crane maintenance.
For rigs that need to be stacked, we challenged our teams to look beyond conventional practices, especially when it came to our dynamically positioned rigs, to find ways to preserve these assets in the most cost-effective manner. As a direct result of their expertise and ingenuity, we are now clustering these rigs in benign sheltered environments offshore using a temporary mooring system. As part of the process, we are protecting critical equipment and controls using preservation fluids and dehumidification units to ensure that the rigs are in condition to be reactivated in an expedient and cost-effective manner when market conditions improve.
As a result of these actions, stacking costs associated with these rigs have decreased by approximately 75% since last year to less than $20,000 a day. For our shore-based support and overhead cost, we have almost finalized the restructuring of our organization, which includes centralizing our global support functions in Houston. This eliminated or significantly downsized our hub offices around the world while reducing layers between our management and the rig. While streamlining maintenance processes, stacking rigs and restructuring the organization are not necessarily easy and require tough decisions, we are pleased with our progress in these 3 key areas of cost reduction, which will continue to positively impact our operating results going forward.
Turning to our fleet, we are pleased to welcome the Deepwater Proteus to Transocean. the Deepwater Proteus, which is the second of 4 newbuild drillships contracted to work for Shell, is expected to commence operations in the coming days. In addition to the Deepwater Proteus, in March, we christened the Deepwater Conqueror at the Daewoo shipyard in Korea. This ultra-deepwater drillship is scheduled to commence her 5-year contract with Chevron in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the year.
As a reminder, all of these rigs are designed to operate in water depths of up to 12,000 feet and drill wells to a depth of 40,000 feet. They were constructed with Transocean's patented dual-activity drilling technology, industry-leading hoisting capacity and dual BOPs. These rigs are fully outfitted to be upgraded with 20,000 PSI BOP's. In short, they are excellent additions to our fleet.
While discussing the newbuilds, and as previously announced, we have reached agreements to delay the deliveries of our uncontracted floaters and jackups into 2020. These deferrals will help us preserve near-term while continuing with our fleet renewal strategy albeit at a slower pace. In addition to our own newbuilds, we are now seeing more sixth-generation deepwater rigs marketed for sale. As stated in previous calls, we will continue to evaluate these opportunities with our interest limited to those assets that would enhance our overall fleet quality while furthering our fleet strategy. However, it's important to note that we continue to place a very high priority on liquidity and will remain very selective in regard to any potential transactions.
As part of high grading the feet, we also continue to assess the capability and marketability of our existing rigs. Through this review, we made a decision in the first quarter to recycle the mid-water floater, the Transocean John Shaw, increasing our total rigs recycled or held for sale since the start of the downturn to 25. As we move through the year, we will continue this process and will remain decisive in determining the future of each rig as the market continues to evolve.
Before turning the call over to Mark and then Terry, I'd like to take a moment to talk at a high level about the market. As you well know, the near-term market outlook remains very challenging. At this point, we do not expect to see a meaningful recovery in rig activity before 2017 as customer budgets have been set for 2016 and are unlikely to improve until there's further recovery in the price of oil and confidence regarding its sustainability is bolstered. Even so, we remain very confident in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development and the drilling industry's inevitable recovery.
I visit with customers on a regular basis and my recent conversations with them have reinforced our position that future hydrocarbon supply requires significant production from offshore and more specifically from deepwater fields. Our largest customers have significant deepwater reserves and they recognize without increased activity, they will face production declines and reserve replacement challenges that will be difficult and costly to reverse and overcome.
North America, Venezuela, Mexico and the U.K. have all experienced year-over-year production declines, and we expect this will only increase as the recent deficiencies in reinvestment continue to impact overall supply. Additionally in my customer discussions, it's becoming more evident that they recognize the benefits of narrowing their supplier base for key services to a few select partners that can help them to deliver their operational and financial objectives. This market downturn has allowed them to cherry pick the highest quality contractors and service providers and move toward agreements that should promote direct negotiations on some of their prioritized opportunities.
Through both pricing concessions and a more collaborative approach between operators, contractors and service providers, the high cost previously associated with much of the deepwater activity are beginning to abate. The industry is now witnessing sustainable cost reductions that will ultimately drive economic development of large offshore projects well below previous price per barrel requirements.
As wells are drilled faster and more precisely and production equipment and facilities are engineered using more efficient approaches, the competitiveness of these assets will continue to improve. As oil prices then recover and the liquidity profile for our customers improves, we expect the offshore drilling activity declines we have experienced will reverse. When that time comes, we are confident that our stacked rigs are not only being preserved in the most cost-effective manner but in ways that will enable their swift reactivation and return to operation. Until that time, we will continue to prudently manage our balance sheet and cost structure while remaining intently focused on operations to ensure we remain the offshore industry's driller of choice.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

During today's call, I will recap the first quarter results, provide an update to our 2016 guidance and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.For the first quarter of 2016, we reported net income attrib",1249,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I will recap the first quarter results, provide an update to our 2016 guidance and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
For the first quarter of 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $249 million or $0.68 per diluted share. These results included $5 million or $0.01 per diluted share in net unfavorable items that are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $254 million or $0.69 per diluted share.
Contract drilling revenue for the first quarter of 2016 decreased by $345 million sequentially to $1.1 billion. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with 634 fewer operating days during the quarter. Our operational and technical teams continued to perform at a very high level, delivering another quarter of 95% revenue efficiency. Other revenue decreased $165 million sequentially to $230 million during the quarter. This included $209 million in early contract termination fees primarily associated with the Discoverer Deep Seas and the Deepwater Millennium. When adjusting these early contract termination fees for contract drilling revenues expected during first quarter these rigs worked as planned, $133 million relate to days beyond March 31, 2016.
First quarter operating and maintenance expense was $655 million, down from $794 million in the prior quarter. The 16% decrease was largely due to lower activity, cost savings related to operational and restructuring initiatives and reduced stacking cost for our fifth- and sixth-gen DP floaters. This was partially offset by the $45 million of reactivation costs for the Henry Goodrich expensed during the quarter. The Goodrich begins its strategic contract with Husky later this month.
Additionally, we recognized $18 million of mobilization costs on the GSF Development Driller I that was previously anticipated to be recorded in the second quarter. Also, first quarter O&M expenses were negatively impacted by $3 million of restructuring costs associated with employee severances.
G&A expenses totaled $43 million, down $15 million from the prior quarter, which reflects our ongoing restructuring efforts. Our operating margin, including G&A expense, was approximately 47% for the quarter, driven higher by the impact of early contract terminations included in other revenue above.
The first quarter annual effective tax rate was 22.8% compared with 13.1% in the prior quarter. This increase was due to the lower adjusted pretax income and change in the mix of operating results from certain jurisdictions.
We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the first quarter of $631 million. This includes our working capital release of $128 million.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $368 million, largely associated with payments on the newbuilds. Since the last call, we opportunistically repurchased $100 million of debt at a cost of $84 million. As these debt repurchases were settled after the end of the quarter, the first quarter's balance sheet does not reflect these debt repurchases. Cash interest savings for these debt repurchases is approximately $23 million over the remaining term. This brings our total repurchases for the 3 quarters to $603 million at a cost of $557 million and an aggregate interest cost savings of approximately $105 million through maturity of this debt.
I will now provide an update on our financial expectations for 2016 and our liquidity expectations through 2017. Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 is expected to be between $260 million and $270 million. This includes customer reimbursables and the early contract termination fees recognized to date in 2016.
We expect full year operating and maintenance expense to raise between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion. This 6% decrease from our previous guidance reflects reduced fleet activity, primarily as a result of early contract terminations. Consistent with activity, O&M cost will be higher in the first half of 2016 and trend lower toward the latter quarters as the number of rigs active decline during the year.
We estimate that O&M expense for the second quarter will be in the range of between $550 million and $570 million. We also expect the second half of the year to benefit from reduced stacking expenses and the beneficial cost impact resulting from a smaller, streamlined support organization.
Full year G&A expenses are expected to be approximately $160 million. Similar to O&M, this line is anticipated to decrease as we progress through the year. We estimate that the second quarter G&A will be approximately $45 million.
Full year 2016 net interest expense is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $185 million and $10 million, respectively.
Full year 2016 annual effective tax rate is expected to be in the range between 28% and 30% as we expect higher tax rate for the remainder of the year. This is due to a significant reduction in net income from operations as fewer rigs are working and some have lower day rates.
There are no changes to our expected 2016 depreciation expense. Capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, including approximately $1 billion for the newbuilds Deepwater Conqueror, Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon. This amount includes capitalized interest. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $80 million for the remainder of 2016.
Turning now to our financial position. Since our last call, we have enhanced our liquidity position by announcing 2 separate future newbuild delivery deferrals. In early March, we agreed with Keppel FELS to defer the delivery and related payments of our 5 high-specification jackups. This defers approximately $735 million from 2018 and 2019 into 2020.
In April, we amended the construction contracts with Jurong for the late delivery of 2 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships by approximately 6 months each. These 2 proprietary Jurong Espadon III design drillships are now expected to be delivered in the first and third quarter of 2020. This defers approximately $420 million from 2019 into 2020.
We continue to evaluate the secured financing options in our 5 contracted newbuild drillships. As you're aware, these rigs are highly marketable assets due to the quality of our assets and their respective contracts as well as the contract duration. We'll provide a more fulsome update in due course.
We reiterate our assumptions related to our updated liquidity forecast through 2017. These include: Revenue efficiency of 95%, a limited number of new contract awards with day rates assumed to be at or near cash breakeven, a working capital release of approximately $500 million in total for the years 2016 and 2017. This includes the previously mentioned $128 million of release in the first quarter.
In 2017, we expect total CapEx of approximately $625 million. This includes $375 million in newbuild CapEx and $250 million for maintenance CapEx. Based on our current forecast, our projected liquidity at December 31, 2017, remains in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion. Our projection includes our $3 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that remains available to us through mid-2019.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our strong operational results, adequate liquidity and substantial contract backlog. We also believe the quality of our fleet, together with our propriety rig stacking methodology focused on efficient rig reactivation, better positions us to win more than our fair share of future drilling contracts, increasing our contract backlog and further bolstering our financial strength.
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry."
407172,315687557,977470,"Transocean Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good day to everyone.

As you all know, the market remains very challenging. Despite the recent increase in oil prices from the multiyear lows experienced early in the year, operators remained hesitant to commit to long-term projects that require significant levels of capital. However, as Jeremy mentioned, we continue to have meaningful dialogue with our customers, and they remain firmly committed to their deepwater assets as they view these as a necessary source of future reserves.
The real question is around the velocity with which these customers will ultimately add rigs in response to declines in reserve replacement and production. Even more so than in past cycles, our customers realize that the reduction in offshore drilling is not sustainable, especially considering the fact that the global demand for energy continues to increase.
In the meantime, as we await the eventual recovery, we will continue to position our fleet to take advantage of opportunities in the market. As stated in previous conference calls, our teams continue to battle for every opportunity in this highly competitive market, looking at ways we can best align with our customers' well plans and business objectives. This approach has once again proven to be successful as we signed several new contracts resulting in the addition of $138 million of contract backlog since the last earnings call, bringing our 2016 total to $184 million.
In our ultra-deepwater fleet, we extended the duration on the Deepwater Invictus by adding a 2-well contract at $350,000 a day in Trinidad, with additional bonus opportunity. This contract award highlights our stellar operational performance for BHP and our willingness to work with the customer to best meet their project priorities. We've also secured a 6-month contract on the KG2, returning her to work after being idled. While you are likely aware of the recent announcement from Hurricane Energy with respect to the Spitsbergen, we've waited to formally announce this contract pending approval of their board early this month. In India, we were awarded a 3-year contract on the mid-water floater, Actinia, also returning her to work after being idled. In total, our fleet and commercial strategy enabled us to return 3 idled rigs to our active fleet and to further extend work for another rig during the quarter.
As a result, our backlog as of April 21 is an industry leading $14.6 billion. This foundation provides solid future cash flow generation, with 79% of the revenues contracted with the super majors, 13% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the national oil companies. And further, we do not have contracts in our current backlog that permit cancellation for convenience without compensation.
Turning to the global market. While we are seeing some positive movement in the macro environment and improved confidence regarding oil prices for the second half of '16, we expect challenging conditions are likely to continue into '17, impacting both utilization and day rates. In order for contacting conditions to improve for next year's budgeting cycle, customers need to see these improved oil prices sustained in the coming months.
As the market stands today, ultra-deepwater marketed utilization is down to 79% with 32 rigs idle and 23 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, we've seen 11 fixtures that have been executed, mostly in Asia and India, in addition to a few in South America and Africa, with the majority being short-term work. Longer-term fixtures were largely agreed in '15 but executed in '16.
With the amount of rig availability in the market, including farmout opportunities, we'll continue to see strong competition for every opportunity. Another example of this increasing competition, as we understand it, is the recently announced Chevron Nigeria tender for 2 years, which drew numerous contractors.
As we wait for the award of the long-term exploration tender in India expected to be within the next 2 weeks, we understand the development work requiring 2 additional 1,500 meter DPs for almost 3 years' term per rig commencing in 2017, it is encouraging to see some customers are taking advantage of the lower pricing environment to proceed with their projects. Deepwater marketed utilization is down 71%. There have been 5 fixtures year-to-date, primarily in Asia and Europe. There are currently 11 idle and 10 cold-stacked deepwater units. While we await the result of the ongoing 600 meter tender in India, we're also happy to see another long-term tender about to come to the market. ONGC is expected to release the development tender for 1 more unit for almost 2-year term that will commence in '17.
Mid-water utilization is at 69% with 6 fixtures contracted year-to-date, mainly in India and Norway. Currently there are 16 mid-water rigs that are idle and 18 units cold-stacked. As previously stated, continued stability and improvement in commodity pricing will increase the number of opportunities for these assets in the U.K. and Norway.
Industry-wide, there are 151 cold-stacked floaters plus 53 units that are retired or being held for sale. We expect these numbers to increase with the relative high levels of supply and near-term lack of demand forcing the retirement of most assets.
The jackup market continues to deteriorate as a result of increased market oversupply. This is being exacerbated by very few rigs being scrapped due to minimal cost associated with cold-stacking and the growing supply of newbuild rigs being delivered. Marketed utilization is approximately 71%, with 120 rigs currently idle and 69 cold-stacked. There have been 21 fixtures year-to-date, mainly in the Middle East, Asia and U.K. Unlike the floater market, national oil companies are leveraging their local market dominance and lock contract terms in either renegotiating day rates or outright canceling the remaining term.
Overall, our customers remain focused on cost reduction, operational excellence and safe operations. And they remain committed to delivering their core business, which will undoubtedly include Deepwater exploration and development. Until we experience the uptick in demand for our assets and services, we will move forward with our strong liquidity, industry-leading backlog and excellent operational and safety performance as we continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we progress through the downturn.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to Brad."

The mobilization, which we recognize in the quarter some severance costs. But obviously, that trend is Q1 will be higher, Q4 will be the lowest for the year because as we model out our operating activity with the number of rigs, those decline throughout the year. That being said, we have to factor in the additional, the Thalassa, the Proteus and obviously, the reactivation of the Goodrich, which will go the other direction. But in general, you can -- you're going to see a significant reduction in operating cost. In addition, as you know, with the first quarter's contract cancellations, we've announced that those rigs are going to be cold-stacked. Well, there are certainly cost associated with cold-stacking a unit, which is expense in the first 30 to 60 days. So you'll see that flow through in the February, March and some of it in April time frame as well."

But we're not building the business on that right now. So that was one piece of it. I think, the second piece of it in terms of how quickly can we respond, it's going to depend on the rig, right, and the condition of the rig. We have a team that is both responsible for the stacking the rig and also that same team is responsible for reactivating the rig. So we're doing everything that we possibly can to ensure that we're preserving this equipment, and we're preserving these rigs in a way that we can reactivate them cost-effectively and quickly.

Joining me today are Mark Mey, Chief Financial Officer, who will later provide the financial overview; and Terry Bonno, Senior Vice President of Marketing, who will then provide an overview of the market.
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $254 million in the first quarter or $0.69 per diluted share on $1.3 billion of revenues. While there are a few puts and takes in the quarter, which Mark will explain, we are very pleased that our underlying operating performance continued to deliver strong revenue efficiency of 95% as well as further cost reductions. Of note, we delivered this high level of performance while breaking in the Deepwater Thalassa, the first of 4 newbuild drillships commencing 10-year contracts with Shell. As such, I would like to personally take a moment to thank our newbuild project teams, our crews offshore and our shore-based support for your exemplary work in the first quarter.
As we move through the balance of 2016, we will continue our intense focus on safety and operational integrity, both of which continued to improve; on uptime performance, which continues to average 95% or better across our fleet; on cost control, which resulted in meaningful sequential reductions in operating and maintenance expense and G&A expense; on the high grading of our fleet, which we demonstrated in the first quarter with the addition of one new high-specification ultra-deepwater drillship and the retirement of an older rig; and on the further strengthening of our customer relationships, which helped us to secure additional contracts in a highly competitive environment.
Speaking first about cost control, we continue to identify and realize opportunities to reduce operating, stacking and overhead costs to maximize our operating margins in the face of declining activity. For rigs under contract, we are streamlining maintenance activities, which are delivering sustainable cost savings while simultaneously increasing uptime.
In addition to recognizing savings associated with process efficiencies, we continue to work closely with our supply partners to drive costs out of manufacturing, maintenance, service and repair. To date, the realized savings are ranging between 20% and 30% for some of our costliest areas, including riser inspection and certification, engine overhauls and crane maintenance.
For rigs that need to be stacked, we challenged our teams to look beyond conventional practices, especially when it came to our dynamically positioned rigs, to find ways to preserve these assets in the most cost-effective manner. As a direct result of their expertise and ingenuity, we are now clustering these rigs in benign sheltered environments offshore using a temporary mooring system. As part of the process, we are protecting critical equipment and controls using preservation fluids and dehumidification units to ensure that the rigs are in condition to be reactivated in an expedient and cost-effective manner when market conditions improve.
As a result of these actions, stacking costs associated with these rigs have decreased by approximately 75% since last year to less than $20,000 a day. For our shore-based support and overhead costs, we have almost finalized the restructuring of our organization, which includes centralizing our global support functions in Houston. This eliminated or significantly downsized our hub offices around the world while reducing the layers between our management and the rig. While streamlining maintenance processes, stacking rigs and restructuring the organization are not necessarily easy and require tough decisions, we are pleased with our progress in these 3 key areas of cost reduction, which will continue to positively impact our operating results going forward.
Turning to our fleet, we are pleased to welcome the Deepwater Proteus to Transocean. The Deepwater Proteus, which is the second of 4 newbuild drillships contracted to work for Shell, is expected to commence operations in the coming days. In addition to the Deepwater Proteus, in March, we christened the Deepwater Conqueror at the Daewoo shipyard in Korea. This ultra-deepwater drillship is scheduled to commence her 5-year contract with Chevron in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the year.
As a reminder, all of these rigs are designed to operate in water depths of up to 12,000 feet and drill wells to a depth of 40,000 feet. They were constructed with Transocean's patented dual-activity drilling technology, industry-leading hoisting capacity and dual BOPs. These rigs are fully outfitted to be upgraded with 20,000 PSI BOPs. In short, they are excellent additions to our fleet.
While discussing the newbuilds, and as previously announced, we have reached agreements to delay the deliveries of our uncontracted floaters and jackups into 2020. These deferrals will help us preserve near-term liquidity while continuing with our fleet renewal strategy, albeit at a slower pace. In addition to our own newbuilds, we are now seeing more sixth-generation deepwater rigs marketed for sale. As stated in previous calls, we will continue to evaluate these opportunities with our interests limited to those assets that would enhance our overall fleet quality while furthering our fleet strategy. However, it's important to note that we continue to place a very high priority on liquidity and will remain very selective in regard to any potential transactions.
As part of high grading the feet, we also continue to assess the capability and marketability of our existing rigs. Through this review, we made the decision in the first quarter to recycle the Midwater Floater, the Transocean John Shaw, increasing our total rigs recycled or held for sale since the start of the downturn to 25. As we move through the year, we will continue this process and will remain decisive in determining the future of each rig as the market continues to evolve.
Before I turn the call over to Mark and then Terry, I'd like to take a moment to talk at a high level about the market. As you well know, the near-term market outlook remains very challenging. At this point, we do not expect to see a meaningful recovery in rig activity before 2017 as customer budgets have been set for 2016 and are unlikely to improve until there's further recovery in the price of oil and confidence regarding its sustainability is bolstered. Even so, we remain very confident in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development and the drilling industry's inevitable recovery.
I visit with customers on a regular basis and my recent conversations with them have reinforced our position that future hydrocarbon supply requires significant production from offshore and more specifically from deepwater fields. Our largest customers have significant deepwater reserves, and they recognize without increased activity, they will face production declines and reserve replacement challenges that will be difficult and costly to reverse and overcome.
North America, Venezuela, Mexico and the U.K. have all experienced year-over-year production declines, and we expect this will only increase as the recent deficiencies in reinvestment continue to impact overall supply. Additionally in my customer discussions, it's becoming more evident that they recognize the benefits of narrowing their supplier base for key services to a few select partners that can help them to deliver their operational and financial objectives. This market downturn has allowed them to cherry pick the highest quality contractors and service providers and move toward agreements that should promote direct negotiations on some of their prioritized opportunities.
Through both pricing concessions and a more collaborative approach between operators, contractors and service providers, the high costs previously associated with much of the deepwater activity are beginning to abate. The industry is now witnessing sustainable cost reductions that will ultimately drive economic development of large offshore projects well below previous price per barrel requirements.
As wells are drilled faster and more precisely and production equipment and facilities are engineered using more efficient approaches, the competitiveness of these assets will continue to improve. As oil prices then recover and the liquidity profile for our customers improves, we expect the offshore drilling activity declines we have experienced will reverse. When that time comes, we are confident that our stacked rigs are not only being preserved in the most cost-effective manner but in ways that will enable their swift reactivation and return to operation. Until that time, we will continue to prudently manage our balance sheet and cost structure while remaining intently focused on operations to ensure we remain the offshore industry's driller of choice.
I'll now turn the call over to Mark."

During today's call, I will recap the first quarter results, provide an update to our 2016 guidance and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.For the first quarter of 2016, we reported net income attrib",1250,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I will recap the first quarter results, provide an update to our 2016 guidance and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position.
For the first quarter of 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $249 million or $0.68 per diluted share. These results included $5 million or $0.01 per diluted share in net unfavorable items that are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $254 million or $0.69 per diluted share.
Contract drilling revenue for the first quarter of 2016 decreased by $345 million sequentially to $1.1 billion. The decrease was primarily due to reduced activity associated with 634 fewer operating days during the quarter. Our operational and technical teams continued to perform at a very high level, delivering another quarter of 95% revenue efficiency. Other revenue decreased $165 million sequentially to $230 million during the quarter. This included $209 million in early contract termination fees primarily associated with the Discoverer Deep Seas and the Deepwater Millennium. When adjusting these early contract termination fees for contract drilling revenues expected during the first quarter these rigs worked as planned, $133 million relate to days beyond March 31, 2016.
First quarter operating and maintenance expense was $655 million, down from $794 million in the prior quarter. The 16% decrease was largely due to lower activity, cost savings related to operational and restructuring initiatives and reduced stacking costs for our fifth- and sixth-gen DP floaters. This was partially offset by the $45 million of reactivation costs for the Henry Goodrich expensed during the quarter. The Goodrich begins its 2-year contract with Husky later this month.
Additionally, we recognized $18 million of mobilization costs on the GSF Development Driller I that was previously anticipated to be recorded in the second quarter. Also, first quarter O&M expenses were negatively impacted by $3 million of restructuring costs associated with employee severances.
G&A expenses totaled $43 million, down $15 million from the prior quarter, which reflects our ongoing restructuring efforts. Our operating margin, including G&A expense, was approximately 47% for the quarter, driven higher by the impact of early contract terminations included in other revenue above.
The first quarter annual effective tax rate was 22.8% compared with 13.1% in the prior quarter. This increase was due to the lower adjusted pretax income and change in the mix of operating results from certain jurisdictions.
We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the first quarter of $631 million. This includes our working capital release of $128 million.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $368 million, largely associated with payments on the newbuilds. Since the last call, we opportunistically repurchased $100 million of debt at a cost of $84 million. As these debt repurchases were settled after the end of the quarter, the first quarter's balance sheet does not reflect these debt repurchases. Cash interest savings for these debt repurchases is approximately $23 million over the remaining term. This brings our total repurchases for the 3 quarters to $603 million at a cost of $557 million and an aggregate interest cost savings of approximately $105 million through maturity of this debt.
I will now provide an update on our financial expectations for 2016 and our liquidity expectations through 2017. Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 is expected to be between $260 million and $270 million. This includes customer reimbursables and the early contract termination fees recognized to date in 2016.
We expect full year operating and maintenance expense to range between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion. This 6% decrease from our previous guidance reflects reduced fleet activity, primarily as a result of early contract terminations. Consistent with activity, O&M costs will be higher in the first half of 2016 and trend lower toward the latter quarters as the number of rigs active decline during the year.
We estimate that O&M expense for the second quarter will be in the range of between $550 million and $570 million. We also expect the second half of the year to benefit from reduced stacking expenses and the beneficial cost impacts resulting from our smaller, streamlined support organization.
Full year G&A expenses are expected to be approximately $160 million. Similar to O&M, this amount is anticipated to decrease as we progress through the year. We estimate that the second quarter G&A will be approximately $45 million.
Full year 2016 net interest expense is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $185 million and $10 million, respectively.
Full year 2016 annual effective tax rate is expected to be in a range between 28% and 30% as we expect higher tax rate for the remainder of the year. This is due to a significant reduction in net income from operations as fewer rigs are working and some have lower day rates.
There are no changes to our expected 2016 depreciation expense. Capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, including approximately $1 billion for the newbuilds Deepwater Conqueror, Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon. This amount includes capitalized interest. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $80 million for the remainder of 2016.
Turning now to our financial position. Since our last call, we have enhanced our liquidity position by announcing 2 separate future newbuild delivery deferrals. In early March, we agreed with Keppel FELS to defer the delivery and related payments of our 5 high-specification jackups. This defers approximately $735 million from 2018 and 2019 into 2020.
In April, we amended the construction contracts with Jurong for the late delivery of 2 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships by approximately 6 months each. These 2 proprietary Jurong Espadon III design drillships are now expected to be delivered in the first and third quarter of 2020. This defers approximately $420 million from 2019 into 2020.
We continue to evaluate the secured financing options in our 5 contracted newbuild drillships. As you're aware, these rigs are highly marketable assets due to the quality of their assets and their respective contracts as well as the contract duration. We'll provide a more fulsome update in due course.
We reiterate our assumptions related to our updated liquidity forecast through 2017. These include: Revenue efficiency of 95%, a limited number of new contract awards with day rates assumed to be at or near cash breakeven, a working capital release of approximately $500 million in total for the years 2016 and 2017. This includes the previously mentioned $128 million of release in the first quarter.
In 2017, we expect total CapEx of approximately $625 million. This includes $375 million in newbuild CapEx and $250 million for maintenance CapEx. Based on our current forecast, our projected liquidity at December 31, 2017, remains in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion. Our projection includes our $3 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that remains available to us through mid-2019.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our strong operational results, adequate liquidity and substantial contract backlog. We also believe the quality of our fleet, together with our propriety rig stacking methodology focused on efficient rig reactivation, better positions us to win more than our fair share of future drilling contracts, increasing our contract backlog and further bolstering our financial strength.
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry."
407172,315687557,977495,"Transocean Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good day to everyone.

As you all know, the market remains very challenging. Despite the recent increase in oil prices from the multiyear lows experienced early in the year, operators remain hesitant to commit to long-term projects that require significant levels of capital. However, as Jeremy mentioned, we continue to have meaningful dialogue with our customers, and they remain firmly committed to their deepwater assets as they view these as a necessary source of future reserves.
The real question is around the velocity with which these customers will ultimately add rigs in response to declines in reserve replacement and production. Even more so than in past cycles, our customers realize that the reduction in offshore drilling is not sustainable, especially considering the fact that the global demand for energy continues to increase.
In the meantime, as we await the eventual recovery, we will continue to position our fleet to take advantage of opportunities in the market. As stated in previous conference calls, our teams continue to battle for every opportunity in this highly competitive market, looking at ways we can best align with our customers' well plans and business objectives. This approach has once again proven to be successful as we signed several new contracts resulting in the addition of $138 million of contract backlog since the last earnings call, bringing our 2016 total to $184 million.
In our ultra-deepwater fleet, we extended the duration on the Deepwater Invictus by adding a 2-well contract at $350,000 a day in Trinidad, with additional bonus opportunity. This contract award highlights our stellar operational performance for BHP and our willingness to work with the customer to best meet their project priorities. We've also secured a 6-month contract on the KG2, returning her to work after being idled. While you are likely aware of the recent announcement from Hurricane Energy with respect to the Spitsbergen, we've waited to formally announce this contract pending approval of their board early this month. In India, we were awarded a 3-year contract on the mid-water floater Actinia, also returning her to work after being idled. In total, our fleet and commercial strategy enabled us to return 3 idled rigs to our active fleet and to further extend work for another rig during the quarter.
As a result, our backlog as of April 21 is an industry leading $14.6 billion. This foundation provides solid future cash flow generation, with 79% of the revenues contracted with the super majors, 13% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the national oil companies. And further, we do not have contracts in our current backlog that permit cancellation for convenience without compensation.
Turning to the global market. While we are seeing some positive movement in the macro environment and improved confidence regarding oil prices for the second half of '16, we expect challenging conditions are likely to continue into '17, impacting both utilization and day rates. In order for contacting conditions to improve for next year's budgeting cycle, customers need to see these improved oil prices sustained in the coming months.
As the market stands today, ultra-deepwater marketed utilization is down to 79% with 32 rigs idle and 23 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, we've seen 11 fixtures that have been executed, mostly in Asia and India, in addition to a few in South America and Africa, with the majority being short-term work. Longer-term fixtures were largely agreed in '15 but executed in '16.
With the amount of rig availability in the market, including farm out opportunities, we'll continue to see strong competition for every opportunity. Another example of this increasing competition, as we understand it, is the recently announced Chevron Nigeria tender for 2 years, which drew numerous contractors.
As we wait for the award of the long-term exploration tender in India, expected to be within the next 2 weeks, we understand the development work requiring 2 additional 1,500 meter DPs for almost 3 years' term per rig commencing in 2017, it is encouraging to see some customers are taking advantage of the lower pricing environment to proceed with their projects. Deepwater marketed utilization is down 71%. There have been 5 fixtures year-to-date, primarily in Asia and Europe. There are currently 11 idle and 10 cold-stacked deepwater units. While we await the results of the ongoing 600-meter tender in India, we were also happy to see another long-term tender about to come to the market. ONGC is expected to release the development tender for one more unit for almost 2-year term that will commence in '17.
Mid-water utilization is at 69% with 6 fixtures contracted year-to-date, mainly in India and Norway. Currently, there are 16 mid-water rigs that are idle and 18 units cold-stacked. As previously stated, continued stability in improvement in commodity pricing will increase the number of opportunities for these assets in the U.K. and Norway.
Industry-wide, there are 51 cold-stacked floaters plus 53 units that are retired or being held for sale. We expect these numbers to increase, with the relative high levels of supply and near-term lack of demand forcing the retirement of most assets.
The jackup market continues to deteriorate as a result of increased market oversupply. This is being exacerbated by very few rigs being scrapped due to the minimal costs associated with cold-stacking and the growing supply of newbuild rigs being delivered. Marketed utilization is approximately 71%, with 120 rigs currently idle and 69 cold-stacked. There have been 21 fixtures year-to-date, mainly in the Middle East, Asia and U.K. Unlike the floater market, national oil companies are leveraging their local market dominance and lock [ph] contract terms in either renegotiating day rates or outright canceling the remaining term.
Overall, our customers remain focused on cost reduction, operational excellence and safe operations. And they remain committed to delivering their core business, which will undoubtedly include deepwater exploration and development. Until we experience the uptick in demand for our assets and services, we will move forward with our strong liquidity, industry-leading backlog and excellent operational and safety performance as we continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we progress through the downturn.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to Brad."

But we're not building the business on that right now. So that was one piece of it. I think that the second piece of it, in terms of how quickly can we respond, it's going to depend on the rig, right, and the condition of the rig. We have a team that is both responsible for the stacking of the rig, and also that same team is responsible for reactivating the rig. So we're doing everything that we possibly can to ensure that we're preserving this equipment, and we're preserving these rigs in a way that we can reactivate them cost-effectively and quickly.

Following my prepared remarks, Mark Mey will recap the quarterly financial performance and provide a perspective for the second half of the year. And then, Terry Bonno will provide an overview of the market. As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of [ph] $64 million in the second quarter or $0.17 per diluted share on $943 million in revenues. We are very pleased with our second quarter results and they reflect the organizations unrelenting commitment to delivering incident-free operations, maximizing uptime and performance for our customers and simultaneously streamlining and optimizing every facet of our business.
For the quarter, revenue efficiency increased to 96.5% from 95% in the prior quarter. I would like to thank our crews and our shore-based support personnel for delivering another strong quarter. Due to consistent delivery of 95% or better uptime, we continue to effectively monetize our backlog while further differentiating Transocean in the eyes of our customer. I'm especially proud of this quarter's performance as it included strong contributions from both our latest newbuild drillships, the Deepwater Proteus, which commenced its 10-year contract with Shell in the Gulf of Mexico and the harsh environment semisubmersible in Henry Goodrich, which commits its 2-year contract in Canada with Husky following a successful reactivation after being cold-stacked.
As such, I would like to recognize both our newbuild team for its effort to build the Deepwater Proteus for its inaugural campaign and our reactivation team which successfully reactivated the Henry Goodrich within budget and in fewer than 90 days.
While future rig reactivation's will have different requirements, I have every confidence that we will continue to learn and improve with each project, ultimately resulting in lower cost and a more compressed shipyard schedule.
Our quarterly results also included exemplary performance from our high specification jack-ups in Thailand. This 3 rigs achieved average revenue efficiency of 99% while successfully drilling wells in fewer than 5 days. In addition to the strong uptime performance, our continued focus on organizational and operational efficiencies enabled us to maintain very strong margins in the quarter. As many of you know, Transocean has long been recognized throughout the industry for its technical leadership and its innovative approach to addressing industry challenges. Over the past 12 months, the organization has applied that same innovative approach to identify opportunities to improve efficiencies across the enterprise and drive cost out of the value chain. On past calls, we've talked about streamlining the organization, removing layers and closing and consolidating offices. We've also talked about optimizing our maintenance processes, more closely collaborating with suppliers of critical and costly components in reducing our daily stacking cost.
This quarter, we recognized a step change in the number of days between the moment that one of our dynamically positioned rigs rolls off of contract in the moment that it's preserved in a cold-stacked condition. This, as you might expect, has significantly reduced the overall cost associated with stacking. It's important to note that this compressed timeframe is primarily the result of improved planning and the application of lessons learned. Our approach to the preservation of critical components and control systems has not changed. Therefore, we remain supremely confident that these assets are being well maintained for future operations and can be quickly and cost-effectively reactivated when market conditions improve.
Because we continue to find innovative ways to drive cost out of our business and because we continue to consistently deliver high levels of operating performance, we have better positioned Transocean to work with our customers on contracting solutions that are more aligned with their interest. In the second quarter, we secured a 2-year contract for the jack based with ONGC, enhancing our market position in India. The base will be joining the [indiscernible], which recently returned to work on a 3-year contract. Our longtime presence in the Indian offshore market, coupled with our history of performance, provides us with a stronger position for future opportunities in this market. And our scale, combined with our recent efforts to drive cost out of the business, provide us with a decided cost advantage in this, as well as other markets.
We also recently commit to new contract with the North Sea with an independent EMV. Within this contract, we offered a very competitive base day rate that included performance incentive that will be realized upon the success of the overall drilling program.
Candidly, this project may have never been sanctioned without Transocean's willingness and the willingness of other service providers to consider such performance-driven models. But because our historical performance is as confident that our crews and assets can deliver, we are willing to engage in such contracts and support our customers as they strive to deliver well safer and faster than previously envisioned. Thinking of our assets, during the quarter, we continue to highgrade the fleet to both the announced retirement of the Deepwater Floater Coast 702 and the addition of Deepwater Proteus. Since the start of the downturn, we have identified 26 rigs to be retired and recycled. But on a more positive note, since 2008, we have added 16 new high-specification, ultra-deepwater floaters to our fleet. And with the Deepwater Conqueror during the fleet later this year, the Deepwater Pontus and the Deepwater Poseidon joining the fleet over the next 2 years and our 2 new state-of-the-art rigs being constructed at Jurong shipyard joining the fleet in 2020, that number will grow to 21, further solidifying Transocean's position as the leading provider of high specification, ultra-deepwater drillships. This focus on renewing the fleet through both our newbuild program and the ongoing scrapping of less capable and less marketable assets, continues to enhance our overall high-specification rig composition.
Turning to the macro environment, following the precipitous decline in oil prices in January this year, oil prices rebounded strongly in the second quarter, ultimately exceeding $50 a barrel for the first time this year. While this led to more interest in inquiries from numerous independent and national oil companies, we expect most operators to remain cautious until oil prices are sustained to higher levels. Unfortunately, the recent pullback in oil prices could hinder the likelihood of any meaningful market over the next year. Having said that, we're encouraged with the continued decline in much of the global oil supply and believe that it will ultimately lead to increased oil prices. We're also encouraged by the actions taken by the industry in recent months to drive cost out of the value chain, making Deepwater projects economically viable at lower commodity prices. With us remain very confident in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development and the drilling industry's inevitable recovery.
Supporting this position, our largest customers and significant Deepwater reserves and they recognize that without increased activity, they will face production declines and reserve replacement challenges that will be difficult and costly to reverse and overcome. So while we are still not expecting to experience a meaningful uptick in demand in 2016, we are becoming more hopeful that we could begin to see an increase in both interest and activity as we move through 2017 and into 2018. However, since we are unable to predict the precise timing of that eventual recovery, we continue to take the necessary steps to successfully navigate the downturn regardless of its duration and position Transocean to remained the undisputed leader in this space.
In support of that effort, in early July, we closed an important transaction, a $1.25 billion senior unsecured bond offering and launched a simultaneous tender offer to purchase up to $1 billion of our outstanding debt. And earlier this week, we announced that we've agreed to acquire Transocean Partners. The combination of these actions continues to strengthen Transocean's balance sheet and improve our liquidity position as we look into the next decade.
These actions also provide greater strategic optionality when the right opportunities materialize. In conclusion, by continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, deliver incident-free operations, maximize uptime and performance for our customers, streamline and optimize our business, better align with our customers and high-grade our fleet, we remain confident that we are best positioned to take advantage of the inevitable upturn in offshore activity.
I will now hand the call over to Mark."

During today's call, I'll recap the second quarter results and provide an update to our 2016 guidance.

During today's call, I'll recap the second quarter results and provide an update to our 2016 guidance. I will also expand on our recent senior and unsecured notes offering and tender offer and mandate announcement pending acquisition of Transocean Partners. I also plan to present our end of year 2018 liquidity forecast.
For second quarter 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $77 million or $0.21 per diluted share. These results included $15 million or $0.04 per diluted share in items in [indiscernible] and are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $54 [ph] million or $0.17 per diluted share.
Contract drilling revenue for the second quarter decreased by $193 million sequentially to $918 million due primarily to reduced activity and lower day rates. The second quarter had 214 fewer operating days sequentially, largely attributable to limited recontracting opportunities.
Probably offsetting this reduced activity with the contributions from our new Deepwater Pontus, the Deepwater Proteus and Deepwater Thalassa and the reactivation of the Henry Goodrich. We achieved another quarter of outstanding revenue efficiency at 96.5%, up from 95% in the first quarter. Our strong revenue efficiency performance continuous to have favorable effect in our financial performance by sustaining margins during this very challenging market conditions.
Second quarter operating and maintenance expense was at $500 million, down from $655 million in the prior quarter. In addition to reduced activity, the second quarter [indiscernible] expense was lower than our guidance due primarily to lower prices including auto rigs and the company successful actions sustainably reducing both operating and shore-based expenses.
Our adjusted normalized EBITDA margin was approximately 43% for the second quarter, up from 38% in the prior quarter due to the aforementioned successful cost management efforts.
We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the second quarter of just over $200 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $458 million and are related largely to install base on the newbuilds to Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Conqueror. The Deepwater Conqueror is currently mobilizing in the Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to commence its 5-year contract with Chevron later this year. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $228 million of debt at a cost of $189 million.
This includes the $100 million of debt repurchase during last quarter's conference call and settled after the end of the second quarter. Cash interest savings to maturity of the repurchase debt is approximately $55 million. Over the last 4 [ph] quarters, we opportunistically repurchased debt with principal amount of $751 [ph] million for [ph] $657 [ph] million, setting approximately $140 million in interest expense through the maturity of this debt.
I will now provide an update on our financial expectations for 2016. Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 is unchanged form our prior guidance and is expected to be between $265 million and $275 million. This includes customer reimbursables and the early contract of management fees recognized to date in 2016.
We expect full year operating and maintenance expense to be approximately $2 billion. The 9% decrease from our previous guidance is due to reduced activity, lower stacking costs and the continued benefits of the company's actions to reduce both onshore and offshore expenses.
Third quarter earning expense is expected to range between $425 million and $445 million. Consistent with activity, O&M cost will trend lower over the next 2 quarters as a number of active rigs decline. We continue to expect full-year G&A expenses to be approximately $160 [ph] million. There is no change our full-year 2016 net interest expense which is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million.
Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $185 million and $20 million, respectively. The effective annual -- the annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be between 25% and 27%. This lower updated full-year range incorporates the second quarter results and considers the changes in jurisdictional mix of operating results.
Full year 2016 depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $900 million. Capital expenditures including capitalized interest for the second half 2016, are expected to be approximately $600 million, mainly associated with the contracted of newbuilds. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $50 million for the remainder of 2016.
Turning now to our financial position. In early July, we access debt capital market successfully issuing $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes with a 2023 maturity, receiving net proceeds of $1.21 billion. $886 million of these net proceeds were deployed to repurchase existing senior notes with an aggregate face value of $981 million with maturities ranging between 2020 and 2022.
All excess proceeds from this offering will be added to our liquidity positioned to meet future commitments. These new unsecured notes are senior to the company's existing debt and constitute with a new currency, which along with our substantial existing secured debt capacity, really enhances our financial flexibility and access to debt capital markets.
Regarding the aforementioned tender and consistent with our open-market repurchase program, we targeted bond maturities reported for the quarter as both economic and strategic benefits. We successfully repurchased debt as significant discount to face value and further the company's overall ability management objectives. As mentioned in our earnings press release, this transaction enhances our liquidity runway and increases optionality as industry recovers.
We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our liquidity and strategically address our different [indiscernible] in addition to currently undrawn, unsecured $3 billion revolving credit facility. It does not mature until mid-2019.
Turning now to our liquidity forecast, which is now updated through 2018. We project liquidity at December 31, 2018 in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. This assumes a cash balance of approximately $500 million. This forecast factors in the recent unsecured senior notes issuance and related tender plus any open-market repurchase of debt made with the excess issuance proceeds. Additionally, the forecast assumes the merger with Transocean Partners closes in the fourth quarter of this year.
Other operating assumptions revenue of 95% [ph] for 2019 [ph] including favorables levels 2017 [indiscernible] 2018.[ph] 
[Audio Gap]
We expect total CapEx of $375 million. This includes $150 million new bought CapEx and $245 million for maintenance CapEx. This obviously translates into a very strong liquidity position, which combined with our significant contract backlog, positions us with as the market recovers.
Now I'd like to take a moment to comment on announcement regarding the acquisition of Transocean Partners. We've agreed to acquire the outstanding common units of Transocean Partners in a share per unit exchange of 1.1427 Transocean shares for each Transocean's Partners unit. The price represents a 15% premium to Partners' closing price as of July 29.
As part of this transaction, we expect to issue approximately 22.7 million new Transocean shares. This acquisition provides significant benefits to Transocean in the form of cost savings, simplified governance and enhanced liquidity.
Following the completion of this transaction, the deepwater -- the discovery inspiration clearly there and development drill number 3 will be 100% owned by Transocean. The merger agreement has been approved by a special committee of our board of directors and Transocean Partners conference committee and their Board of Directors. The Transocean Partners conference committee is comprised of 3 independent members whom are unaffiliated with Transocean. This transaction remains subject to approval by majority of Transocean Partners unitholders. We anticipate filing the S-4 in mid-August with a Transocean Partners unitholder votes scheduled to accommodate in early fourth quarter closing.
To conclude today's call, we are very pleased with our strong operational performance, continued cost control and successful liquidity enhancement transactions. We will continue to manage Transocean prudently and opportunities to improve our fleet and simplify our processes. The quality of our rig fleet and Transocean's alignment with our customers interest better positions us to win more than our fair share of future drilling contracts. As we demonstrated throughout this downturn, we continue to add contracts and contract backlogs for the strengthening of our financial position.
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry."

Transocean continues to be very busy on the marketing front despite the most recent dip in commodity pricing. We executed several new contracts since last earnings call, resulting in the addition of a $117 million of contract backlog, bringing our 2016 total to $301 million. Year-to-date, we have announced 13 floater contracts thus far, representing 39% of the global fixtures contracted today. As Jeremy stated, the LNG sees exploration tender was awarded to our deepwater the Jack Bates. This 2-year contract will add approximately $93 million of backlog in India. The rig finished its job in Australia in May and after a brief contract preparation period, the rig will mobilized India and is expected to commence LNG's contract in early October 2016.
Recently, we have increased our presence in India by returning 2 rigs to work for ONGC and 2 other rigs to work with the independent.
We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our market presence in this country. In the U.K. North Sea, we secured 2 contracts for the Transocean's Spitsbergen. The first is one well contract with Hurricane Energy, where we and other service providers align with our customer to support the launch of the program in 2016 by providing a flexible commercial solutions for their drilling program. This contract also includes additional performance incentives that reward us for achieving a great metrics. This is consistent our ongoing focus to align with our customers goal of delivering wells ahead of their planned drilling curbs. The second contract on the Spitsbergen is the one well contract in a Norwegian North Sea with red salt. This contract will begin in March of next year. We also added a 1 well contract for the mid-water floater 704 in the U.K. North Sea with independent oil and gas where we again facilitated a flexible commercial solution providing our customer the ability to execute their program successfully. We are also happy to announce another U.K. program with an unnamed customer that will commence early 2017 for up to 18 months utilizing the 712. The backlog is not included in the reported number above. This was a very competitive tender with 16 rigs offer demonstrating the availability in this market and our ability to successfully execute against our competition.
Our Transocean teams are fighting for every opportunity in this challenged market as we are delivering consistent performance and creative flexible commercial solutions resulting in a winning combination. As a result, our backlog as of July 21 is an industry-leading $13.7 billion. This continues to provide for solid future cash flow generation with 78% of revenues contracted with the IOCs, 13% contracted with the independence and 8% contracted with the NOCs. And further, we do not have contracts in our current backlog that permit cancellation for convenience without some compensation. Although the market remains challenging, oil prices have increased to levels that have increased customer inquiries and inspired many in the industry to call the bottom, only to see oil retreat in the past 3  [ph] weeks. Nevertheless, we have experienced an increase in activity and more productive conversations than in the last few quarters.
We are fast approaching our customers' 2017 budget season, which should provide further clarity on the next year's opportunities. Our customers remain firmly committed to the deepwater assets as they view these as a necessary source of future reserves. The pace with which operators will ultimately add rigs to replace both reserves and production is not clear, but our customers realized that the reduction offshore drilling is not sustainable. A great example of the commitment to increase exposure to deepwater is the recently announced Statoil purchase of the 66% share of Petrobras block in the Santos Basin in Brazil. This is a historical event and clearly demonstrates a positive shift to opening the basin to allow international oil companies development of these important projects. While the increase in activity is not imminent, we know the potential of this significant play in the Golden Triangle. Longer-term, continued price recovery with a stable outlook, bodes very well for significant activity improvements in 2018. As the floater market stands today, market utilization is down to 73% with 59 rigs idle and 56 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, 33 floater fixtures have been announced, mostly in Asia, India and the U.K., Norway. With the majority being short-term work, except for India. As the market challenges persist, we will see more stacking and retirements of the Floater fleet. Under these conditions, we expect reactivations will become economically challenging and lengthy, meaning the real marketed supply, rigs ready to work could be below 200 floaters. And as we know, the demand over the past 5 years well exceeded 200 rigs. As in the past, access to the right hot rig may become challenging. We are encouraged by the upcoming development work requiring 1,500 meter DP rigs for almost 3 years per rig commencing in 2017 in India. Additionally, we see other customers are taking advantage of the lower pricing environment to proceed with their project. We are participating in multiple tenders in Nigeria, Mexico, Myanmar, Canada, Norway and are in advanced discussion on direct award opportunities where we are very excited to be able to announce in the future.
In conclusion, we will continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we progressed to the downturn.
This concludes my overview of the markets, so I will turn it over to you, Brad."

Getting a fleet of ours which is heavily weighted towards the ultra-deepwater more complicated assets, to be able to deliver 96.5%, that is a fantastic quarter. So putting that in the rearview mirror, our cost -- I would say probably about half-half, half is from the stacking. As Jeremy mentioned in his prepared comments, we're getting better at it. [indiscernible] for about a year. So as we get better in drilling this we can share a little more cost out of that.

As we look out to the rest of the year, we see obviously as we see revenues come down, AUR comes down, we'll see more working capital release and it should continue through 2017 as well but to a much smaller amount.

Following my prepared remarks, Mark Mey will recap the quarterly financial performance and provide a perspective for the second half of",1394,"Thank you, Brad, and a warm welcome to our employees, customers, investors and analysts participating in today's call. Following my prepared remarks, Mark Mey will recap the quarterly financial performance and provide a perspective for the second half of the year. And then, Terry Bonno will provide an overview of the market. 
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $64 million in the second quarter or $0.17 per diluted share on $943 million in revenues. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, and they reflect the organization's unrelenting commitment to delivering incident-free operations, maximizing uptime and performance for our customers and simultaneously streamlining and optimizing every facet of our business.
For the quarter, revenue efficiency increased to 96.5% from 95% in the prior quarter. I would like to thank our crews and our shore-based support personnel for delivering another strong quarter. Due to consistent delivery of 95% or better uptime, we continue to effectively monetize our backlog while further differentiating Transocean in the eyes of our customers. 
I'm especially proud of this quarter's performance as it included strong contributions from both our latest newbuild drillship, the Deepwater Proteus, which commenced its 10-year contract with Shell in the Gulf of Mexico; and the harsh environment semisubmersible, Henry Goodrich, which commenced its 2-year contract in Canada with Husky, following a successful reactivation after being cold-stacked.  As such, I would like to recognize both our newbuild team for its effort to prepare the Deepwater Proteus for its inaugural campaign; and our reactivation team, which successfully reactivated the Henry Goodrich within budget and in fewer than 90 days.
While future rig reactivations will have different requirements, I have every confidence that we will continue to learn and improve with each project, ultimately resulting in lower cost and a more compressed shipyard schedule.
Our quarterly results also included exemplary performance from our high-specification jackups in Thailand. This 3 rigs achieved average revenue efficiency of 99% while successfully drilling wells in fewer than 5 days. 
In addition to the strong uptime performance, our continued focus on organizational and operational efficiencies enabled us to maintain very strong margins in the quarter. As many of you know, Transocean has long been recognized throughout the industry for its technical leadership and its innovative approach to addressing industry challenges. Over the past 12 months, the organization has applied that same innovative approach to identify opportunities to improve efficiencies across the enterprise and drive costs out of the value chain. 
On past calls, we've talked about streamlining the organization, removing layers and closing and consolidating offices. We've also talked about optimizing our maintenance processes, more closely collaborating with suppliers of critical and costly components and reducing our daily stacking costs.
This quarter, we recognized a step change in the number of days between the moment that one of our dynamically positioned rigs rolls off of contract in the moment that it's preserved in a cold-stacked condition. This, as you might expect, has significantly reduced the overall costs associated with stacking. 
It's important to note that this compressed time frame is primarily the result of improved planning and the application of lessons learned. Our approach to the preservation of critical components and control systems has not changed. Therefore, we remain supremely confident that these assets are being well maintained for future operations and can be quickly and cost-effectively reactivated when market conditions improve.
Because we continue to find innovative ways to drive costs out of our business and because we continue to consistently deliver high levels of operating performance, we have better positioned Transocean to work with our customers on contracting solutions that are more aligned with their interest. In the second quarter, we secured a 2-year contract for the Jack Bates with ONGC, enhancing our market position in India. The Bates will be joining the Actinia, which recently returned to work on a 3-year contract. Our longtime presence in the Indian offshore market, coupled with our history of performance, provides us with a stronger position for future opportunities in this market. And our scale, combined with our recent efforts to drive costs out of the business, provides us with a decided cost advantage in this as well as other markets.
We also recently committed to new contract in the North Sea with an independent E&P. Within this contract, we offered a very competitive base day rate that included performance incentives that will be realized upon the success of the overall drilling program. Candidly, this project may have never been sanctioned without Transocean's willingness and the willingness of other service providers to consider such performance-driven models. But because our historical performance gives us confidence that our crews and assets can deliver, we are willing to engage in such contracts and support our customers as they strive to deliver well safer and faster than previously envisioned. 
Speaking of our assets, during the quarter, we continued to high-grade the fleet to both the announced retirement of the deepwater floater, Sedco 702, and the addition of the Deepwater Proteus. Since the start of the downturn, we have identified 26 rigs to be retired and recycled. But on a more positive note, since 2008, we have added 16 new high-specification, ultra-deepwater floaters to our fleet. And with the Deepwater Conqueror during the fleet later this year, the Deepwater Pontus and the Deepwater Poseidon joining the fleet over the next 2 years and our 2 new state-of-the-art rigs being constructed at the Jurong Shipyard joining the fleet in 2020, that number will grow to 21, further solidifying Transocean's position as the leading provider of high-specification, ultra-deepwater drillships. This focus on renewing the fleet through both our newbuild program and the ongoing scrapping of less capable and less marketable assets continues to enhance our overall high-specification rig composition.
Turning to the macro environment, following the precipitous decline in oil prices in January this year, oil prices rebounded strongly in the second quarter, ultimately exceeding $50 a barrel for the first time this year. While this led to more interest in inquiries from numerous independent and national oil companies, we expect most operators to remain cautious until oil prices are sustained at higher levels. Unfortunately, the recent pullback in oil prices could hinder the likelihood of any meaningful market recovery over the next year. 
Having said that, we're encouraged by the continued decline in much of the global oil supply and believe that it will ultimately lead to increased oil prices. We're also encouraged by the actions taken by the industry in recent months to drive costs out of the value chain, making deepwater projects economically viable at lower commodity prices. We, thus, remain very confident in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development and the drilling industry's inevitable recovery.
Supporting this position, our largest customers have significant deepwater reserves, and they recognize that without increased activity, they will face production declines and reserve replacement challenges that will be difficult and costly to reverse and overcome. So while we are still not expecting to experience a meaningful uptick in demand in 2016, we are becoming more hopeful that we could begin to see an increase in both interest and activity as we move through 2017 and into 2018. However, since we are unable to predict the precise timing of that eventual recovery, we continue to take the necessary steps to successfully navigate the downturn regardless of its duration and position Transocean to remain the undisputed leader in this space.
In support of that effort, in early July, we closed an important transaction, a $1.25 billion senior unsecured bond offering and launched a simultaneous tender offer to purchase up to $1 billion of our outstanding debt. And earlier this week, we announced that we have agreed to acquire Transocean Partners. The combination of these actions continues to strengthen Transocean's balance sheet and improves our liquidity position as we look into the next decade. These actions also provide greater strategic optionality when the right opportunities materialize. 
In conclusion, by continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, deliver incident-free operations, maximize uptime and performance for our customers, streamline and optimize our business, better align with our customers and high-grade our fleet, we remain confident that we are best positioned to take advantage of the inevitable upturn in offshore activity.
I will now hand the call over to Mark."
407172,323691768,1025224,"Transocean Ltd., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I will recap the second quarter results and provide an update to our 2016 guidance.

During today's call, I will recap the second quarter results and provide an update to our 2016 guidance. I will also expand on our recent senior unsecured notes offering and tender offer and Monday's announcement regarding the pending acquisition of Transocean Partners. I also plan to present our end of year 2018 liquidity forecast.
For the second quarter 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $77 million or $0.21 per diluted share. These results included $18 million or $0.04 per diluted share in net favorable items that are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $64 million or $0.17 per diluted share.
Contract drilling revenue for the second quarter decreased by $193 million sequentially to $918 million due primarily to reduced activity and lower day rates. The second quarter had 214 fewer operating days sequentially, largely attributable to limited recontracting opportunities. Probably offsetting this reduced activity were the contributions from our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships, the Deepwater Proteus and Deepwater Thalassa, and the reactivation of the Henry Goodrich. 
We achieved another quarter of outstanding revenue efficiency at 96.5%, up from 95% in the first quarter. Our strong revenue efficiency performance continues to have a favorable effect in our financial performance by sustaining margins during this very challenging market conditions.
Second quarter operating and maintenance expense was at $500 million, down from $655 million in the prior quarter. In addition to reduced activity, the second quarter O&M expense was lower than our guidance due primarily to lower stacking costs, including accelerated de-manning of other rigs and the company's successful actions, sustainably reducing both operating and shore-based expenses.
Our adjusted normalized EBITDA margin was approximately 43% for the second quarter, up from 38% in the prior quarter due to the aforementioned successful cost management efforts. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the second quarter of just over $200 million. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $458 million and are related largely to installments on the newbuilds, Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Conqueror. The Deepwater Conqueror is currently mobilizing in the Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to commence its 5-year contract with Chevron later this year. 
During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $228 million of debt at a cost of $189 million.  This includes the $100 million of debt repurchases expense during last quarter's conference call that settled after the end of the first quarter. 
Cash interest savings to maturity of the repurchased debt is approximately $55 million. Over the last 4 quarters, we opportunistically repurchased debt with a principal amount of $731 million for $657 million, having approximately $140 million in interest expense through the maturity of this debt.
I will now provide an update on our financial expectations for 2016. Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 is unchanged from our prior guidance and is expected to be between $265 million and $275 million. This includes customer reimbursables and the early contract termination fees recognized to date in 2016.
We expect full year operating and maintenance expense to be approximately $2 billion. The 9% decrease from our previous guidance is due to reduced activity, lower stacking costs and the continued benefits of the company's actions to reduce both onshore and offshore expenses.
Third quarter O&M expense is expected to range between $425 million and $445 million. Consistent with activity, O&M costs will trend lower over the next 2 quarters as a number of active rigs decline. 
We continue to expect full-year G&A expenses to be approximately $160 million. There is no change to our full-year 2016 net interest expense, which is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $185 million and $20 million, respectively. 
The effective annual -- the annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be between 25% and 27%. This lower updated full-year range incorporates the second quarter results and considers the changes in jurisdictional mix of operating results.
Full year 2016 depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $900 million. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest for the second half 2016, are expected to be approximately $600 million, mainly associated with the contracted newbuilds. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $50 million for the remainder of 2016.
Turning now to our financial position. In early July, we accessed debt capital market successfully, issuing $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes with a 2023 maturity, receiving net proceeds of $1.21 billion. $886 million of these net proceeds were deployed to repurchase existing senior notes with an aggregate face value of $981 million with maturities ranging between 2020 and 2022.
All excess proceeds from this offering will be added to our liquidity positioned to meet future commitments. These new unsecured notes are senior to the company's existing debt and constitute a new currency, which, along with our substantial existing secured debt capacity, truly enhances our financial flexibility and access to debt capital markets.
Regarding the aforementioned tender and consistent with our open-market repurchase program, we targeted bond maturities reported as both economic and strategic benefits. We successfully repurchased debt at significant discount to face value and furthered the company's overall ability management objectives. As mentioned in our earnings press release, this transaction enhances our liquidity runway and increases our optionality as the industry recovers.
We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our liquidity and strategically address our debt maturities. As you are aware, we have both unsecured and debt -- and secured debt options available to us. In addition to our currently undrawn, unsecured $3 billion revolving credit facility, it does not mature until mid-2019.
Turning now to our liquidity forecast, which is now updated through 2018. We project liquidity at December 31, 2018 in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. This assumes a cash balance of approximately $500 million. This forecast factors in the recent unsecured senior notes issuance and related tender plus any open-market repurchase of debt made with the excess issuance proceeds. Additionally, the forecast assumes the merger with Transocean Partners closes in the fourth quarter of this year.
Other operating assumptions include revenue efficiency of 95% through 2018; limited new contract awards for day rates assumed to be at or near test breakeven levels through the end of 2017, with a marginal day rate improvement in 2018.
In 2017, we expect total CapEx of approximately $600 million. This includes $450 million in newbuild CapEx and $200 million for maintenance CapEx. In 2018, we expect total CapEx of $375 million. This includes $150 million in newbuild CapEx and $245 million for maintenance CapEx. This obviously translates into a very strong liquidity position, which, combined with our significant contract backlog, positions us to thrive as the market recovers.
Now I'd like to take a moment to comment on Monday's announcement regarding the acquisition of Transocean Partners. We have agreed to acquire the outstanding common units of Transocean Partners in a share per unit exchange of 1.1427 Transocean shares for each Transocean Partners' unit. The price represents a 15% premium to Partners' closing price as of July 29.
As part of this transaction, we expect to issue approximately 22.7 million new Transocean shares. This acquisition provides significant benefits to Transocean in the form of cost savings, simplified governance and enhanced liquidity.
Following the completion of this transaction, the Deepwater -- the Discovery exploration, Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III, will be 100% owned by Transocean. The merger agreement has been approved by a special committee of our Board of Directors and Transocean Partners' conference committee and their Board of Directors. The Transocean Partners' conference committee is comprised of 3 independent members whom are unaffiliated with Transocean. This transaction remains subject to approval by majority of Transocean Partners' unitholders. We anticipate filing the S-4 in mid-August with the Transocean Partners' unitholder votes scheduled to accommodate in early fourth quarter closing.
To conclude today's call, we are very pleased with our strong operational performance, continued cost control and successful liquidity enhancement transactions. We will continue to manage Transocean prudently and toggle opportunities to improve our fleet and simplify our processes. The quality of our rig fleet and Transocean's alignment with our customers interest better positions us to win more than our fair share of future drilling contracts. As we demonstrated throughout this downturn, we continue to add contracts and bolster our contract backlog for the strengthening of our financial position.
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry."

Transocean continues to be very busy on the marketing front despite the most recent dip in commodity pricing. We executed several new contracts since the last earnings call, resulting in the addition of a $117 million of contract backlog, bringing our 2016 total to $301 million. Year-to-date, we have announced 13 floater contracts thus far, representing 39% of the global fixtures contracted to date. 
As Jeremy stated, the ONGC's exploration tender was awarded to our deepwater semi, the Jack Bates. This 2-year contract will add approximately $93 million of backlog in India. The rig finished its job in Australia in May, and after a brief contract preparation period, the rig will mobilize to India and is expected to commence ONGC's contract in early October 2016.
Recently, we have increased our presence in India by returning 2 rigs to work for ONGC and 2 other rigs to work with the independent. We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our market presence in this country. 
In the U.K. North Sea, we secured 2 contracts for the Transocean Spitsbergen. The first is a 1-well contract with Hurricane Energy, where we and other service providers aligned with our customer to support the launch of the program in 2016 by providing a flexible commercial solutions for their drilling program. 
This contract also includes additional performance incentives that reward us for achieving a great metrics. This is consistent with our ongoing focus to align with our customers' goal of delivering wells ahead of their planned drilling curves. 
The second contract on the Spitsbergen is a 1-well contract in a Norwegian North Sea with Repsol. This contract will begin in March of next year. 
We also added a 1-well contract for the mid-water floater, Sedco 704, in the U.K. North Sea with independent oil and gas, where we again facilitated a flexible commercial solution, providing our customer the ability to execute their program successfully. 
We are also happy to announce another U.K. program with an unnamed customer that will commence early 2017 for up to 18 months utilizing the Sedco 712. The backlog is not included in the reported number above. This was a very competitive tender with 16 rigs offer, demonstrating the availability in this market and our ability to successfully execute against our competition.
Our Transocean teams are fighting for every opportunity in this challenged market as we are delivering consistent performance and creative flexible commercial solutions, resulting in a winning combination. As a result, our backlog as of July 21 is an industry-leading $13.7 billion. This continues to provide for solid future cash flow generation, with 78% of revenues contracted with the IOCs, 13% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the NOCs. And further, we do not have contracts in our current backlog that permit cancellation for convenience without some compensation. 
Although the market remains challenging, oil prices have increased to levels that have increased customer inquiries and inspired many in the industry to call the bottom, only to see oil retreat in the past few weeks. Nevertheless, we have experienced an increase in activity and more productive conversations than in the last few quarters.
We are fast approaching our customers' 2017 budget season, which should provide further clarity on next year's opportunities. Our customers remain firmly committed to their deepwater assets as they view these as a necessary source of future reserves. The pace with which operators will ultimately add rigs to replace both reserves and productions is not clear, but our customers realized that the reduction offshore drilling is not sustainable. 
A great example of the commitment to increase exposure to deepwater is the recently announced Statoil purchase of the 66% share of Petrobras' BMS-8 in the Santos Basin in Brazil. This is a historical event and clearly demonstrates a positive shift to opening the basin to allow international oil companies development of these important projects. 
While the increase in activity is not imminent, we know the potential of this significant play in the Golden Triangle. Longer term, continued price recovery with a stable outlook bodes very well for significant activity improvements in 2018. 
As the floater market stands today, market utilization is down to 73%, with 59 rigs idle and 56 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, 33 floater fixtures have been announced, mostly in Asia, India and the U.K., Norway, with the majority being short-term work, except for India. As the market challenges persist, we will see more stacking and retirements of the floater fleet. Under these conditions, we expect reactivations will become economically challenging and lengthy, meaning the real marketed supply, rigs ready to work could be below 200 floaters. And as we know, the demand over the past 5 years well exceeded 200 rigs. 
As in the past, access to the right hot rig may become challenging. We are encouraged by the upcoming development work requiring 1,500 meter DP rigs for almost 3 years per rig commencing in 2017 in India. Additionally, we see other customers are taking advantage of the lower pricing environment to proceed with their project. We are participating in multiple tenders in Nigeria, Mexico, Myanmar, Canada, Norway and are in advanced discussion on direct award opportunities where we are very excited to be able to announce in the future.
In conclusion, we will continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we progressed to the downturn.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to you, Brad."

Or how should we think about how customer demands are changing around contract terms at this point in the cycle?"

Following my prepared remarks, Mark Mey will recap the quarterly financial performance and provide a perspective for the second half of the year. And then, Terry Bonno will provide an overview of the market. 
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $64 million in the second quarter or $0.17 per diluted share on $943 million in revenues. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, as they reflect the organization's unrelenting commitment to delivering incident-free operations, maximizing uptime and performance for our customers and simultaneously streamlining and optimizing every facet of our business.
For the quarter, revenue efficiency increased to 96.5% from 95% in the prior quarter. I would like to thank our crews and our shore-based support personnel for delivering another strong quarter. Due to consistent delivery of 95% or better uptime, we continue to effectively monetize our backlog while further differentiating Transocean in the eyes of our customers. 
I'm especially proud of this quarter's performance as it included strong contributions from both our latest newbuild drillship, the Deepwater Proteus, which commenced its 10-year contract with Shell in the Gulf of Mexico; and the harsh environment semisubmersible, Henry Goodrich, which commenced its 2-year contract in Canada with Husky, following a successful reactivation after being cold-stacked.  As such, I would like to recognize both our newbuild team for its effort to prepare the Deepwater Proteus for its inaugural campaign; and our reactivation team, which successfully reactivated the Henry Goodrich within budget and in fewer than 90 days.
While future rig reactivations will have different requirements, I have every confidence that we will continue to learn and improve with each project, ultimately resulting in lower cost and a more compressed shipyard schedule.
Our quarterly results also included exemplary performance from our high-specification jackups in Thailand. This 3 rigs achieved average revenue efficiency of 99% while successfully drilling wells in fewer than 5 days. 
In addition to the strong uptime performance, our continued focus on organizational and operational efficiencies enabled us to maintain very strong margins in the quarter. As many of you know, Transocean has long been recognized throughout the industry for its technical leadership and its innovative approach to addressing industry challenges. Over the past 12 months, the organization has applied that same innovative approach to identify opportunities to improve efficiencies across the enterprise and drive costs out of the value chain. 
On past calls, we've talked about streamlining the organization, removing layers and closing and consolidating offices. We've also talked about optimizing our maintenance processes, more closely collaborating with suppliers of critical and costly components and reducing our daily stacking costs.
This quarter, we recognized a step change in the number of days between the moment that one of our dynamically positioned rigs rolls off of a contract and the moment that it's preserved in a cold-stacked condition. This, as you might expect, has significantly reduced the overall costs associated with stacking. 
It's important to note that this compressed time frame is primarily the result of improved planning and the application of lessons learned. Our approach to the preservation of critical components and control systems has not changed. Therefore, we remain supremely confident that these assets are being well maintained for future operations and can be quickly and cost-effectively reactivated when market conditions improve.
Because we continue to find innovative ways to drive costs out of our business and because we continue to consistently deliver high levels of operating performance, we have better positioned Transocean to work with our customers on contracting solutions that are more aligned with their interest. In the second quarter, we secured a 2-year contract for the Jack Bates with ONGC, enhancing our market position in India. The Bates will be joining the Actinia, which recently returned to work on a 3-year contract. Our longtime presence in the Indian offshore market, coupled with our history of performance, provides us with a stronger position for future opportunities in this market. And our scale, combined with our recent efforts to drive costs out of the business, provide us with a decided cost advantage in this as well as other markets.
We also recently commenced a new contract in the North Sea with an independent E&P. Within this contract, we offered a very competitive base day rate that included performance incentives that will be realized upon the success of the overall drilling program. Candidly, this project may have never been sanctioned without Transocean's willingness and the willingness of other service providers to consider such performance-driven models. But because our historical performance gives us confidence that our crews and assets can deliver, we are willing to engage in such contracts and support our customers as they strive to deliver wells safer and faster than previously envisioned. 
Speaking of our assets, during the quarter, we continued to high-grade the fleet through both the announced retirement of the deepwater floater, Sedco 702, and the addition of the Deepwater Proteus. Since the start of the downturn, we have identified 26 rigs to be retired and recycled. But on a more positive note, since 2008, we have added 16 new high-specification, ultra-deepwater floaters to our fleet. And with the Deepwater Conqueror joining the fleet later this year, the Deepwater Pontus and the Deepwater Poseidon joining the fleet over the next 2 years and our 2 new state-of-the-art rigs being constructed at the Jurong Shipyard joining the fleet in 2020, that number will grow to 21, further solidifying Transocean's position as the leading provider of high-specification, ultra-deepwater drillships. This focus on renewing the fleet through both our newbuild program and the ongoing scrapping of less capable and less marketable assets continues to enhance our overall high-specification rig composition.
Turning to the macro environment, following the precipitous decline in oil prices in January this year, oil prices rebounded strongly in the second quarter, ultimately exceeding $50 a barrel for the first time this year. While this led to more interest and inquiries from numerous independents and national oil companies, we expect most operators to remain cautious until oil prices are sustained at higher levels. Unfortunately, the recent pullback in oil prices could hinder the likelihood of any meaningful market recovery over the next year. 
Having said that, we're encouraged by the continued decline in much of the global oil supply and believe that it will ultimately lead to increased oil prices. We're also encouraged by the actions taken by the industry in recent months to drive costs out of the value chain, making deepwater projects economically viable at lower commodity prices. We, thus, remain very confident in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development and the drilling industry's inevitable recovery.
Supporting this position, our largest customers have significant deepwater reserves, and they recognize that without increased activity, they will face production declines and reserve replacement challenges that will be difficult and costly to reverse and overcome. So while we are still not expecting to experience a meaningful uptick in demand in 2016, we are becoming more hopeful that we could begin to see an increase in both interest and activity as we move through 2017 and into 2018. However, since we are unable to predict the precise timing of that eventual recovery, we continue to take the necessary steps to successfully navigate the downturn regardless of its duration and position Transocean to remain the undisputed leader in this space.
In support of that effort, in early July, we closed an important transaction, a $1.25 billion senior unsecured bond offering and launched a simultaneous tender offer to purchase up to $1 billion of our outstanding debt. And earlier this week, we announced that we have agreed to acquire Transocean Partners. The combination of these actions continues to strengthen Transocean's balance sheet and improves our liquidity position as we look into the next decade. These actions also provide greater strategic optionality when the right opportunities materialize. 
In conclusion, by continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, deliver incident-free operations, maximize uptime and performance for our customers, streamline and optimize our business, better align with our customers and high-grade our fleet, we remain confident that we are best positioned to take advantage of the inevitable upturn in offshore activity.
I will now hand the call over to Mark."
407172,323691768,1025532,"Transocean Ltd., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I will recap the second quarter results and provide an update to our 2016 guidance.

During today's call, I will recap the second quarter results and provide an update to our 2016 guidance. I will also expand on our recent senior unsecured notes offering and tender offer and Monday's announcement regarding the pending acquisition of Transocean Partners. I also plan to present our end of year 2018 liquidity forecast.
For the second quarter 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $77 million or $0.21 per diluted share. These results included $13 million or $0.04 per diluted share in net favorable items that are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $64 million or $0.17 per diluted share.
Contract drilling revenue for the second quarter decreased by $193 million sequentially to $918 million due primarily to reduced activity and lower day rates. The second quarter had 214 fewer operating days sequentially, largely attributable to limited recontracting opportunities. [indiscernible] offsetting this reduced activity were the contributions from our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships, the Deepwater Proteus and Deepwater Thalassa, and the reactivation of the Henry Goodrich. 
We achieved another quarter of outstanding revenue efficiency at 96.5%, up from 95% in the first quarter. Our strong revenue efficiency performance continues to have a favorable effect on our financial performance by sustaining margins during this very challenging market conditions.
Second quarter operating and maintenance expense was at $500 million, down from $655 million in the prior quarter. In addition to reduced activity, the second quarter O&M expense was lower than our guidance due primarily to lower stacking costs, including accelerated de-manning of other rigs and the company's successful actions, sustainably reducing both operating and shore-based expenses.
Our adjusted normalized EBITDA margin was approximately 43% for the second quarter, up from 38% in the prior quarter due to the aforementioned successful cost management efforts. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the second quarter of just over $200 million. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $458 million and are related largely to installments on the newbuilds: Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Conqueror. The Deepwater Conqueror is currently mobilizing into the Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to commence its 5-year contract with Chevron later this year. 
During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $228 million of debt at a cost of $189 million.  This includes the $100 million of debt repurchases discussed during last quarter's conference call that settled after the end of the first quarter. 
Cash interest savings to maturity of the repurchased debt is approximately $55 million. Over the last 4 quarters, we opportunistically repurchased debt with a principal amount of $731 million for $657 million, saving approximately $140 million in interest expense through the maturity of this debt.
I will now provide an update on our financial expectations for 2016. Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 is unchanged from our prior guidance and is expected to be between $265 million and $275 million. This includes customer reimbursables and the early contract termination fees recognized to date in 2016.
We expect full year operating and maintenance expense to be approximately $2 billion. The 9% decrease from our previous guidance is due to reduced activity, lower stacking costs and the continued benefits of the company's actions to reduce both onshore and offshore expenses.
Third quarter O&M expense is expected to range between $425 million and $445 million. Consistent with activity, O&M costs will trend lower over the next 2 quarters as a number of active rigs decline. 
We continue to expect full-year G&A expenses to be approximately $160 million. There is no change to our full-year 2016 net interest expense, which is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $185 million and $20 million, respectively. 
The effective annual -- the annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be between 25% and 27%. This lower updated full-year range incorporates the second quarter results and considers the changes in jurisdictional mix of operating results.
Full year 2016 depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $900 million. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest for the second half of 2016, are expected to be approximately $600 million, mainly associated with the contracted newbuilds. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $50 million for the remainder of 2016.
Turning now to our financial position. In early July, we accessed debt capital markets successfully, issuing $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes with a 2023 maturity, receiving net proceeds of $1.21 billion. $886 million of these net proceeds were deployed to repurchase existing senior notes with an aggregate face value of $981 million with maturities ranging between 2020 and 2022.
All excess proceeds from this offering will be added to our liquidity positioned to meet future commitments. These new unsecured notes are senior to the company's existing debt and constitute a new currency, which, along with our substantial existing secured debt capacity, further enhances our financial flexibility and access to debt capital markets.
Regarding the aforementioned tender, and consistent with our open-market repurchase program, we targeted bond maturities that afforded us both economic and strategic benefits. We successfully repurchased debt at significant discount to face value and furthered the company's overall ability to manage objectives. As mentioned in our earnings press release, this transaction enhances our liquidity runway and increases our optionality as the industry recovers.
We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our liquidity and strategically address our debt maturities. As you are aware, we have both unsecured and debt -- and secured debt options available to us. In addition to our currently undrawn, unsecured $3 billion revolving credit facility, it does not mature until mid-2019.
Turning now to our liquidity forecast, which is now updated through 2018. We project liquidity at December 31, 2018 in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. This assumes a cash balance of approximately $500 million. This forecast factors in the recent unsecured senior notes issuance and related tender plus any open-market repurchase of debt made with the excess issuance proceeds. Additionally, the forecast assumes the merger with Transocean Partners closes in the fourth quarter of this year.
Other operating assumptions include revenue efficiency of 95% through 2018; limited new contract awards for day rates assumed to be at or near test breakeven levels through the end of 2017, with a marginal day rate improvement in 2018.
In 2017, we expect total CapEx of approximately $600 million. This includes $450 million [ph] in newbuild CapEx and $200 million for maintenance CapEx. In 2018, we expect total CapEx of $375 million. This includes $150 million in newbuild CapEx and $245 million for maintenance CapEx. This obviously translates into a very strong liquidity position, which, combined with our significant contract backlog, positions us to thrive as the market recovers.
Now I'd like to take a moment to comment on Monday's announcement regarding the acquisition of Transocean Partners. We have agreed to acquire the outstanding common units of Transocean Partners in a share per unit exchange of 1.1427 Transocean shares for each Transocean Partners' unit. The price represents a 15% premium to Partners' closing price as of July 29.
As part of this transaction, we expect to issue approximately 22.7 million new Transocean shares. This acquisition provides significant benefits to Transocean in the form of cost savings, simplified governance and enhanced liquidity.
Following the completion of this transaction, the Deepwater -- the Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III, will be 100% owned by Transocean. The merger agreement has been approved by a special committee of our Board of Directors and Transocean Partners' conference committee and their Board of Directors. The Transocean Partners' conference committee is comprised of 3 independent members whom are unaffiliated with Transocean. This transaction remains subject to approval by a majority of Transocean Partners' unitholders. We anticipate filing the S-4 in mid-August with the Transocean Partners' unitholder vote scheduled to accommodate an early fourth quarter closing.
To conclude today's call, we are very pleased with our strong operational performance, continued cost control and successful liquidity enhancement transactions. We will continue to manage Transocean prudently and toggle opportunities to improve our fleet and simplify our processes. The quality of our rig fleet and Transocean's alignment with our customers' interest better positions us to win more than our fair share of future drilling contracts. As we demonstrated throughout this downturn, we continue to add contracts and bolster our contract backlog further strengthening of our financial position.
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry."
407172,323691768,1025532,"Transocean Ltd., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good day to everyone. Transocean continues to be very busy on the marketing front despite the most recent dip in commodity pricing.

Transocean continues to be very busy on the marketing front despite the most recent dip in commodity pricing. We executed several new contracts since the last earnings call, resulting in the addition of a $117 million of contract backlog, bringing our 2016 total to $301 million. Year-to-date, we have announced 13 floater contracts thus far, representing 39% of the global fixtures contracted to date. 
As Jeremy stated, the ONGC's exploration tender was awarded to our deepwater semi, the Jack Bates. This 2-year contract will add approximately $93 million of backlog in India. The rig finished its job in Australia in May, and after a brief contract preparation period, the rig will mobilize to India and is expected to commence ONG's (sic) [ONGC's] contract in early October 2016.
Recently, we have increased our presence in India by returning 2 rigs to work for ONGC and 2 other rigs to work with the independents. We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our market presence in this country. 
In the U.K. North Sea, we secured 2 contracts for the Transocean Spitsbergen. The first is a 1-well contract with Hurricane Energy, where we and other service providers aligned with our customer to support the launch of the program in 2016 by providing a flexible commercial solution for their drilling program. 
This contract also includes additional performance incentives that reward us for achieving agreed metrics. This is consistent with our ongoing focus to align with our customers' goal of delivering wells ahead of their planned drilling curves. 
The second contract on the Spitsbergen is a 1-well contract in a Norwegian North Sea with Repsol. This contract will begin in March of next year. 
We also added a 1-well contract for the mid-water floater, Sedco 704, in the U.K. North Sea with independent oil and gas, where we again facilitated a flexible commercial solution, providing our customer the ability to execute their program successfully. 
We are also happy to announce another U.K. program with an unnamed customer that will commence early 2017 for up to 18 months utilizing the Sedco 712. The backlog is not included in the reported number above. This was a very competitive tender with 16 rigs offering, demonstrating the availability in this market and our ability to successfully execute against our competition.
Our Transocean teams are fighting for every opportunity in this challenged market as we are delivering consistent performance and creative flexible commercial solutions, resulting in a winning combination. As a result, our backlog as of July 21 is an industry-leading $13.7 billion. This continues to provide for solid future cash flow generation, with 78% of revenues contracted with the IOCs, 13% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the NOCs. And further, we do not have contracts in our current backlog that permit cancellation for convenience without some compensation. 
Although the market remains challenging, oil prices have increased to levels that have increased customer inquiries and inspired many in the industry to call the bottom, only to see oil retreat in the past few weeks. Nevertheless, we have experienced an increase in activity and more productive conversations than in the last few quarters.
We are fast approaching our customers' 2017 budget season, which should provide further clarity on next year's opportunities. Our customers remain firmly committed to their deepwater assets as they view these as a necessary source of future reserves. The pace with which operators will ultimately add rigs to replace both reserves and productions is not clear, but our customers realize that the reduction in offshore drilling is not sustainable. 
A great example of the commitment to increase exposure to deepwater is the recently announced Statoil purchase of the 66% share of Petrobras' BMS-8 in the Santos Basin in Brazil. This is a historical event and clearly demonstrates a positive shift to opening the basin to allow international oil companies' development of these important projects. 
While the increase in activity is not imminent, we know the potential of this significant play in the Golden Triangle. Longer term, continued price recovery with a stable outlook bodes very well for significant activity improvements in 2018. 
As the floater market stands today, market utilization is down to 73%, with 59 rigs idle and 56 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, 33 floater fixtures have been announced, mostly in Asia, India and the U.K., Norway, with the majority being short-term work, except for India. As the market challenges persist, we will see more stacking and retirements of the floater fleet. Under these conditions, we expect reactivations will become economically challenging and lengthy, meaning the real marketed supply, rigs ready to work could be below 200 floaters. And as we know, the demand over the past 5 years well exceeded 200 rigs. 
As in the past, access to the right hot rig may become challenging. We are encouraged by the upcoming development work requiring 1,500 meter DP rigs for almost 3 years per rig, commencing in 2017 in India. Additionally, we see other customers are taking advantage of the lower pricing environment to proceed with their projects. We are participating in multiple tenders in Nigeria, Mexico, Myanmar, Canada, Norway and are in advanced discussion on direct award opportunities, where we are very excited to be able to announce in the future.
In conclusion, we will continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we progressed to the downturn.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to you, Brad."

We've only been doing this now for just -- for about a year. So as we get better at doing this, we can shave a little more costs out of that.

As we look out to the rest of the year, we see -- obviously, as we see revenues come down, AR comes down, we'll see more working capital release. And it should continue through 2017 as well but to a much smaller amount. In 2018, once again, we start consuming our working capital. So I think if you look at it in the context of the liquidity forecast through the end of 2018, you'll see a more moderate impact on the liquidity from working capital."

Given the deeper downturn currently and what could be a more modest recovery coming out, would you still demand full payback on the reactivation from that initial contract? Or are there other factors we should be thinking about, such as pulling somebody's fifth gens-out and seeing them utilized over what should be many years of remaining useful life or seeing better fixed cost absorption in places like West Africa, securing the best crews coming out first?

Following my prepared remarks, Mark Mey will recap the quarterly financial performance and provide a perspective for the second half of the year. And then, Terry Bonno will provide an overview of the market. 
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $64 million in the second quarter or $0.17 per diluted share on $943 million in revenues. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, as they reflect the organization's unrelenting commitment to delivering incident-free operations, maximizing uptime and performance for our customers and simultaneously streamlining and optimizing every facet of our business.
For the quarter, revenue efficiency increased to 96.5% from 95% in the prior quarter. I would like to thank our crews and our shore-based support personnel for delivering another strong quarter. Due to consistent delivery of 95% or better uptime, we continue to effectively monetize our backlog while further differentiating Transocean in the eyes of our customers. 
I'm especially proud of this quarter's performance as it included strong contributions from both our latest newbuild drillship, the Deepwater Proteus, which commenced its 10-year contract with Shell in the Gulf of Mexico; and the harsh environment semisubmersible, Henry Goodrich, which commenced its 2-year contract in Canada with Husky, following a successful reactivation after being cold-stacked. As such, I would like to recognize both our newbuild team for its effort to prepare the Deepwater Proteus for its inaugural campaign; and our reactivation team, which successfully reactivated the Henry Goodrich within budget and in fewer than 90 days.
While future rig reactivations will have different requirements, I have every confidence that we will continue to learn and improve with each project, ultimately resulting in lower cost and a more compressed shipyard schedule.
Our quarterly results also included exemplary performance from our high-specification jackups in Thailand. This 3 rigs achieved average revenue efficiency of 99% while successfully drilling wells in fewer than 5 days. 
In addition to the strong uptime performance, our continued focus on organizational and operational efficiencies enabled us to maintain very strong margins in the quarter. As many of you know, Transocean has long been recognized throughout the industry for its technical leadership and its innovative approach to addressing industry challenges. Over the past 12 months, the organization has applied that same innovative approach to identify opportunities to improve efficiencies across the enterprise and drive costs out of the value chain. 
On past calls, we've talked about streamlining the organization, removing layers and closing and consolidating offices. We've also talked about optimizing our maintenance processes, more closely collaborating with suppliers of critical and costly components and reducing our daily stacking costs.
This quarter, we recognized a step change in the number of days between the moment that one of our dynamically positioned rigs rolls off of a contract and the moment that it's preserved in a cold-stacked condition. This, as you might expect, has significantly reduced the overall costs associated with stacking. 
It's important to note that this compressed time frame is primarily the result of improved planning and the application of lessons learned. Our approach to the preservation of critical components and control systems has not changed. Therefore, we remain supremely confident that these assets are being well maintained for future operations and can be quickly and cost-effectively reactivated when market conditions improve.
Because we continue to find innovative ways to drive costs out of our business and because we continue to consistently deliver high levels of operating performance, we have better positioned Transocean to work with our customers on contracting solutions that are more aligned with their interest. In the second quarter, we secured a 2-year contract for the Jack Bates with ONGC, enhancing our market position in India. The Bates will be joining the Actinia, which recently returned to work on a 3-year contract. Our longtime presence in the Indian offshore market, coupled with our history of performance, provides us with a stronger position for future opportunities in this market. And our scale, combined with our recent efforts to drive costs out of the business, provide us with a decided cost advantage in this as well as other markets.
We also recently commenced a new contract in the North Sea with an independent E&P. Within this contract, we offered a very competitive base day rate that included performance incentives that will be realized upon the success of the overall drilling program. Candidly, this project may have never been sanctioned without Transocean's willingness and the willingness of other service providers to consider such performance-driven models. But because our historical performance gives us confidence that our crews and assets can deliver, we are willing to engage in such contracts and support our customers as they strive to deliver wells safer and faster than previously envisioned. 
Speaking of our assets, during the quarter, we continued to high-grade the fleet through both the announced retirement of the deepwater floater, Sedco 702, and the addition of the Deepwater Proteus. Since the start of the downturn, we have identified 26 rigs to be retired and recycled. But on a more positive note, since 2008, we have added 16 new high-specification, ultra-deepwater floaters to our fleet. And with the Deepwater Conqueror joining the fleet later this year, the Deepwater Pontus and the Deepwater Poseidon joining the fleet over the next 2 years and our 2 new state-of-the-art rigs being constructed at the Jurong Shipyard joining the fleet in 2020, that number will grow to 21, further solidifying Transocean's position as the leading provider of high-specification, ultra-deepwater drillships. This focus on renewing the fleet through both our newbuild program and the ongoing scrapping of less capable and less marketable assets continues to enhance our overall high-specification rig composition.
Turning to the macro environment, following the precipitous decline in oil prices in January this year, oil prices rebounded strongly in the second quarter, ultimately exceeding $50 a barrel for the first time this year. While this led to more interest and inquiries from numerous independents and national oil companies, we expect most operators to remain cautious until oil prices are sustained at higher levels. Unfortunately, the recent pullback in oil prices could hinder the likelihood of any meaningful market recovery over the next year. 
Having said that, we're encouraged by the continued decline in much of the global oil supply and believe that it will ultimately lead to increased oil prices. We're also encouraged by the actions taken by the industry in recent months to drive costs out of the value chain, making deepwater projects economically viable at lower commodity prices. We, thus, remain very confident in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development and the drilling industry's inevitable recovery.
Supporting this position, our largest customers have significant deepwater reserves, and they recognize that without increased activity, they will face production declines and reserve replacement challenges that will be difficult and costly to reverse and overcome. So while we are still not expecting to experience a meaningful uptick in demand in 2016, we are becoming more hopeful that we could begin to see an increase in both interest and activity as we move through 2017 and into 2018. However, since we are unable to predict the precise timing of that eventual recovery, we continue to take the necessary steps to successfully navigate the downturn regardless of its duration and position Transocean to remain the undisputed leader in this space.
In support of that effort, in early July, we closed an important transaction, a $1.25 billion senior unsecured bond offering and launched a simultaneous tender offer to purchase up to $1 billion of our outstanding debt. And earlier this week, we announced that we have agreed to acquire Transocean Partners. The combination of these actions continues to strengthen Transocean's balance sheet and improves our liquidity position as we look into the next decade. These actions also provide greater strategic optionality when the right opportunities materialize. 
In conclusion, by continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, deliver incident-free operations, maximize uptime and performance for our customers, streamline and optimize our business, better align with our customers and high-grade our fleet, we remain confident that we are best positioned to take advantage of the inevitable upturn in offshore activity.
I will now hand the call over to Mark."

During today's call, I will recap the second quarter results and provide an update to our 2016 guidance. I will also expand on our recent senior unsecured notes offering and tender offer and Monday's announcement re",1448,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I will recap the second quarter results and provide an update to our 2016 guidance. I will also expand on our recent senior unsecured notes offering and tender offer and Monday's announcement regarding the pending acquisition of Transocean Partners. I also plan to present our end of year 2018 liquidity forecast.
For the second quarter 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $77 million or $0.21 per diluted share. These results included $13 million or $0.04 per diluted share in net favorable items that are detailed in our press release. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $64 million or $0.17 per diluted share.
Contract drilling revenue for the second quarter decreased by $193 million sequentially to $918 million due primarily to reduced activity and lower day rates. The second quarter had 214 fewer operating days sequentially, largely attributable to limited recontracting opportunities. [indiscernible] offsetting this reduced activity were the contributions from our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships, the Deepwater Proteus and Deepwater Thalassa, and the reactivation of the Henry Goodrich. 
We achieved another quarter of outstanding revenue efficiency at 96.5%, up from 95% in the first quarter. Our strong revenue efficiency performance continues to have a favorable effect on our financial performance by sustaining margins during this very challenging market conditions.
Second quarter operating and maintenance expense was at $500 million, down from $655 million in the prior quarter. In addition to reduced activity, the second quarter O&M expense was lower than our guidance due primarily to lower stacking costs, including accelerated de-manning of other rigs and the company's successful actions, sustainably reducing both operating and shore-based expenses.
Our adjusted normalized EBITDA margin was approximately 43% for the second quarter, up from 38% in the prior quarter due to the aforementioned successful cost management efforts. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the second quarter of just over $200 million. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $458 million and are related largely to installments on the newbuilds: Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Conqueror. The Deepwater Conqueror is currently mobilizing into the Gulf of Mexico and is scheduled to commence its 5-year contract with Chevron later this year. 
During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $228 million of debt at a cost of $189 million. This includes the $100 million of debt repurchases discussed during last quarter's conference call that settled after the end of the first quarter. 
Cash interest savings to maturity of the repurchased debt is approximately $55 million. Over the last 4 quarters, we opportunistically repurchased debt with a principal amount of $731 million for $657 million, saving approximately $140 million in interest expense through the maturity of this debt.
I will now provide an update on our financial expectations for 2016. Our 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for 2016 is unchanged from our prior guidance and is expected to be between $265 million and $275 million. This includes customer reimbursables and the early contract termination fees recognized to date in 2016.
We expect full year operating and maintenance expense to be approximately $2 billion. The 9% decrease from our previous guidance is due to reduced activity, lower stacking costs and the continued benefits of the company's actions to reduce both onshore and offshore expenses.
Third quarter O&M expense is expected to range between $425 million and $445 million. Consistent with activity, O&M costs will trend lower over the next 2 quarters as a number of active rigs decline. 
We continue to expect full-year G&A expenses to be approximately $160 million. There is no change to our full-year 2016 net interest expense, which is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income of $185 million and $20 million, respectively. 
The effective annual -- the annual effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be between 25% and 27%. This lower updated full-year range incorporates the second quarter results and considers the changes in jurisdictional mix of operating results.
Full year 2016 depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $900 million. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest for the second half of 2016, are expected to be approximately $600 million, mainly associated with the contracted newbuilds. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $50 million for the remainder of 2016.
Turning now to our financial position. In early July, we accessed debt capital markets successfully, issuing $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes with a 2023 maturity, receiving net proceeds of $1.21 billion. $886 million of these net proceeds were deployed to repurchase existing senior notes with an aggregate face value of $981 million with maturities ranging between 2020 and 2022.
All excess proceeds from this offering will be added to our liquidity positioned to meet future commitments. These new unsecured notes are senior to the company's existing debt and constitute a new currency, which, along with our substantial existing secured debt capacity, further enhances our financial flexibility and access to debt capital markets.
Regarding the aforementioned tender, and consistent with our open-market repurchase program, we targeted bond maturities that afforded us both economic and strategic benefits. We successfully repurchased debt at significant discount to face value and furthered the company's overall ability to manage objectives. As mentioned in our earnings press release, this transaction enhances our liquidity runway and increases our optionality as the industry recovers.
We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our liquidity and strategically address our debt maturities. As you are aware, we have both unsecured and debt -- and secured debt options available to us. In addition to our currently undrawn, unsecured $3 billion revolving credit facility, it does not mature until mid-2019.
Turning now to our liquidity forecast, which is now updated through 2018. We project liquidity at December 31, 2018 in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. This assumes a cash balance of approximately $500 million. This forecast factors in the recent unsecured senior notes issuance and related tender plus any open-market repurchase of debt made with the excess issuance proceeds. Additionally, the forecast assumes the merger with Transocean Partners closes in the fourth quarter of this year.
Other operating assumptions include revenue efficiency of 95% through 2018; limited new contract awards for day rates assumed to be at or near test breakeven levels through the end of 2017, with a marginal day rate improvement in 2018.
In 2017, we expect total CapEx of approximately $600 million. This includes $450 million [ph] in newbuild CapEx and $200 million for maintenance CapEx. In 2018, we expect total CapEx of $375 million. This includes $150 million in newbuild CapEx and $245 million for maintenance CapEx. This obviously translates into a very strong liquidity position, which, combined with our significant contract backlog, positions us to thrive as the market recovers.
Now I'd like to take a moment to comment on Monday's announcement regarding the acquisition of Transocean Partners. We have agreed to acquire the outstanding common units of Transocean Partners in a share per unit exchange of 1.1427 Transocean shares for each Transocean Partners' unit. The price represents a 15% premium to Partners' closing price as of July 29.
As part of this transaction, we expect to issue approximately 22.7 million new Transocean shares. This acquisition provides significant benefits to Transocean in the form of cost savings, simplified governance and enhanced liquidity.
Following the completion of this transaction, the Deepwater -- the Discoverer Inspiration, Discoverer Clear Leader and Development Driller III, will be 100% owned by Transocean. The merger agreement has been approved by a special committee of our Board of Directors and Transocean Partners' conference committee and their Board of Directors. The Transocean Partners' conference committee is comprised of 3 independent members whom are unaffiliated with Transocean. This transaction remains subject to approval by a majority of Transocean Partners' unitholders. We anticipate filing the S-4 in mid-August with the Transocean Partners' unitholder vote scheduled to accommodate an early fourth quarter closing.
To conclude today's call, we are very pleased with our strong operational performance, continued cost control and successful liquidity enhancement transactions. We will continue to manage Transocean prudently and toggle opportunities to improve our fleet and simplify our processes. The quality of our rig fleet and Transocean's alignment with our customers' interest better positions us to win more than our fair share of future drilling contracts. As we demonstrated throughout this downturn, we continue to add contracts and bolster our contract backlog further strengthening of our financial position.
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry."

Transocean continues to be very busy on the marketing front despite the most recent dip in commodity pricing.

Transocean continues to be very busy on the marketing front despite the most recent dip in commodity pricing. We executed several new contracts since the last earnings call, resulting in the addition of a $117 million of contract backlog, bringing our 2016 total to $301 million. Year-to-date, we have announced 13 floater contracts thus far, representing 39% of the global fixtures contracted to date. 
As Jeremy stated, the ONGC's exploration tender was awarded to our deepwater semi, the Jack Bates. This 2-year contract will add approximately $93 million of backlog in India. The rig finished its job in Australia in May, and after a brief contract preparation period, the rig will mobilize to India and is expected to commence ONG's (sic) [ ONGC's ] contract in early October 2016.
Recently, we have increased our presence in India by returning 2 rigs to work for ONGC and 2 other rigs to work with the independents. We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our market presence in this country. 
In the U.K. North Sea, we secured 2 contracts for the Transocean Spitsbergen. The first is a 1-well contract with Hurricane Energy, where we and other service providers aligned with our customer to support the launch of the program in 2016 by providing a flexible commercial solution for their drilling program. 
This contract also includes additional performance incentives that reward us for achieving agreed metrics. This is consistent with our ongoing focus to align with our customers' goal of delivering wells ahead of their planned drilling curves. 
The second contract on the Spitsbergen is a 1-well contract in a Norwegian North Sea with Repsol. This contract will begin in March of next year. 
We also added a 1-well contract for the mid-water floater, Sedco 704, in the U.K. North Sea with independent oil and gas, where we again facilitated a flexible commercial solution, providing our customer the ability to execute their program successfully. 
We are also happy to announce another U.K. program with an unnamed customer that will commence early 2017 for up to 18 months utilizing the Sedco 712. The backlog is not included in the reported number above. This was a very competitive tender with 16 rigs offering, demonstrating the availability in this market and our ability to successfully execute against our competition.
Our Transocean teams are fighting for every opportunity in this challenged market as we are delivering consistent performance and creative flexible commercial solutions, resulting in a winning combination. As a result, our backlog as of July 21 is an industry-leading $13.7 billion. This continues to provide for solid future cash flow generation, with 78% of revenues contracted with the IOCs, 13% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the NOCs. And further, we do not have contracts in our current backlog that permit cancellation for convenience without some compensation. 
Although the market remains challenging, oil prices have increased to levels that have increased customer inquiries and inspired many in the industry to call the bottom, only to see oil retreat in the past few weeks. Nevertheless, we have experienced an increase in activity and more productive conversations than in the last few quarters.
We are fast approaching our customers' 2017 budget season, which should provide further clarity on next year's opportunities. Our customers remain firmly committed to their deepwater assets as they view these as a necessary source of future reserves. The pace with which operators will ultimately add rigs to replace both reserves and productions is not clear, but our customers realize that the reduction in offshore drilling is not sustainable. 
A great example of the commitment to increase exposure to deepwater is the recently announced Statoil purchase of the 66% share of Petrobras' BMS-8 in the Santos Basin in Brazil. This is a historical event and clearly demonstrates a positive shift to opening the basin to allow international oil companies' development of these important projects. 
While the increase in activity is not imminent, we know the potential of this significant play in the Golden Triangle. Longer term, continued price recovery with a stable outlook bodes very well for significant activity improvements in 2018. 
As the floater market stands today, market utilization is down to 73%, with 59 rigs idle and 56 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, 33 floater fixtures have been announced, mostly in Asia, India and the U.K., Norway, with the majority being short-term work, except for India. As the market challenges persist, we will see more stacking and retirements of the floater fleet. Under these conditions, we expect reactivations will become economically challenging and lengthy, meaning the real marketed supply, rigs ready to work could be below 200 floaters. And as we know, the demand over the past 5 years well exceeded 200 rigs. 
As in the past, access to the right hot rig may become challenging. We are encouraged by the upcoming development work requiring 1,500 meter DP rigs for almost 3 years per rig, commencing in 2017 in India. Additionally, we see other customers are taking advantage of the lower pricing environment to proceed with their projects. We are participating in multiple tenders in Nigeria, Mexico, Myanmar, Canada, Norway and are in advanced discussion on direct award opportunities, where we are very excited to be able to announce in the future.
In conclusion, we will continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we progressed to the downturn.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to you, Brad."

With respect to our process to stack a rig, I don't want to disclose too much, because we actually think it could be a competitive advantage for us. I will say that most of it is in the upfront planning, so we're taking a more proactive approach. We're looking at when rigs are coming off campaign, when they're rolling off contract. And we've got an approach where we get all the interested parties out there and involved early, so that we know as soon as the rig rolls off contract, what we're going to do with it. And I will leave it at that in terms of the planning piece. And then the rest, unfortunately, is just in lessons learned. As we do more of these, we get more efficient.

Following my prepared remarks, Mark will recap the quarterly financial performance, comment on our recent secured debt transaction which further bolstered our strong liquidity position and provide our expectations for the fourth quarter. Then, Terry will provide an overview of the market and discuss some of the latest developments with our customers around the world.
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $93 million in the third quarter or $0.25 per diluted share on $903 million in revenue. We are again very pleased with our quarterly results as they reflect the organization's continued commitment to maximizing uptime and performance for our customers, while simultaneously streamlining and optimizing all facets of our business.
For the quarter, revenue efficiency, which was 96.5% in the prior quarter, improved to an extraordinary 100.7%. Needless to say, we are proud of this outcome as it validates the important work that our teams have been doing to redesign processes, rewrite and reformat procedures, enhance and expand our training programs and heighten our focus around procedural discipline. It is also a testament to our team's unwavering commitment to maximize uptime, which continues to differentiate Transocean in the eyes of our customers.
As such, I'd like to take this moment to recognize and personally thank our crews and our shore-based support personnel for driving this tremendous performance. I would also like to recognize and thank the team for delivering this result while simultaneously continuing to reduce our cost base. As a direct result of their efforts, our adjusted normalized EBITDA margin improved to 51%, despite a 4% sequential decline in revenue.
In addition to posting exceptionally strong operating results, we continue to take other actions necessary to further strengthen our liquidity. I'm pleased to report that in October, we raised $600 million by collateralizing one of the newest additions to our fleet, the Deepwater Thalassa, which commenced its 10-year contract with Shell earlier this year.
Speaking of new additions to the fleet, during the quarter, our newbuild team once again did a masterful job delivering another high-specification ultra-deepwater drillship, the Deepwater Conqueror. This rig is currently en route to the Gulf of Mexico, where it will commence its 5-year contract for Shell -- Chevron early next year. This will be the third world-class asset that we've added to the Transocean fleet this year, and our expectation is that the Deepwater Conqueror will perform at a similar level to the Deepwater Thalassa and the Deepwater Proteus, which both delivered impressive uptime results, averaging 98% in the third quarter, and have proven to be highly efficient drilling machines.
In addition to upgrading our ultra-deepwater drillship fleet with new assets, we are also excited about securing new work for one of our most capable harsh environment semisubmersibles. Just as the third quarter ended, we added a 15-month contract for the Transocean Barents to our backlog. The rig will be working for Suncor and is scheduled to commence operations in mid-2017. This is the second rig that we've reactivated for harsh environment work off the East Coast of Canada and serves as yet another indication that our customers place significant value on relationships, rig capability, technical support and operational performance. It also demonstrates that our customers are confident that our meticulous approach to preserving and maintaining stacked rigs will result in efficient reactivations and assets that perform as intended and when needed.
When preparing for reactivations, it's important to remember that crewing our rigs with the industry's most capable, experienced and motivated individuals is as important as preparing the rig itself. In fact, in recent discussions with our customers, they have placed greater emphasis on the reactivation of our crews than the reactivation of the rigs. Recognizing our customers' priorities, we are doing our best to retain our most seasoned talent and to maintain contact with former employees through outreach efforts with the expectation that we can keep them engaged and attract them back to Transocean as our rigs return to work.
Although we are proud of the outcomes that we produced in the quarter, many of you will know that during the month of August, we had an unfortunate incident with the Transocean Winner. While on tow from Norway, the rig encountered a strong late summer storm, which ultimately caused the grounding of the rig off the coast of Scotland. Fortunately, the incident did not result in any personal injuries and no environmental impacts were reported. And with the assistance of the local community, U.K. and Scottish government agencies and other partners, we safely refloated and moved the rig to nearby sheltered waters for evaluation and removed all debris from the grounding site.
The Winner has now arrived in Turkey, where it will be recycled. In addition to the Winner, we also made the decision to recycle 2 other mid-water floaters, the Transocean Driller and the Sedco 704. This brings our current total of floaters to be retired and recycled to 29. And as we have previously discussed, we will continue to actively assist our fleet within the context of the market and make prudent decisions to ensure Transocean continues to have the most competitive fleet in the industry.
Somewhat offsetting these rig retirements, since 2008, we have added 17 new high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters to our fleet. And with the Deepwater Pontus and the Deepwater Poseidon joining the fleet by early 2018, this number will soon increase to 19. We also have 2 more high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters that are under construction and currently scheduled for delivery in 2020.
Turning to the macro environment. In the last month, oil prices have rebounded somewhat, exceeding and holding above $50 per barrel until just recently. As was the case earlier in the year when oil touched $50 per barrel, our customers, primarily the independents and national oil companies, are once again approaching us with inquiries around rig availability and day rates. For the major integrated oil companies, we still think an oil price approaching $60 per barrel is required to compel them to commence new projects. However, as long as oil prices remain around $50 per barrel, we would expect them to engage in conversations around blend-and-extend opportunities, which would enable them to reduce their near-term obligations and secure additional term at discounted rates.
With 2016 coming to a close and most operators' budgets for next year nearing completion, our current thinking is that 2017 will represent the trough for spending in the offshore market. But looking forward, we're encouraged by the fact that global demand for oil continues to be resilient. Due a lack of investment, the global supply of oil continues to decline. And given OPEC's recent announcement, ultimately, we might see an additional 1 million barrels per day of oil production taken offline. As such, it's becoming more likely that supply and demand will soon converge, leading to continued improvement in oil prices. Additionally, the entire offshore industry has worked to eliminate cost from the value chain, making deepwater projects economically viable at lower commodity prices. The combination of these factors continues to give us confidence in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development, and ultimately, in the recovery of the deepwater drilling industry. 
In the near term, based on current commodity prices and market conditions, we expect to see an increase in both interest and contracting activity as we move through 2017 with a stronger recovery forecasted in 2018. As we prepare for that eventual recovery, we continue to take the necessary steps to successfully navigate this downturn and position Transocean to remain the undisputed leader in the space. The aforementioned $600 million secured placement, combined with our $1.25 billion senior unsecured July bond offering and simultaneous tender offer where we purchased approximately $1 billion of our outstanding debt, demonstrates our commitment and wherewithal to further strengthen our liquidity position and extend our runway.
Furthermore, following unitholder approval, we are expecting to close our acquisition of Transocean Partners this month. In addition to simplifying our administration and governance, reducing our costs and further improving our liquidity, this merger will provide Transocean Partners holders with the opportunity to rotate into Transocean's stock. 
In conclusion, I would like to once again thank all Transocean employees for delivering another great quarter. As a team, we delivered over 100% revenue efficiency. We reduced our OpEx sequentially by 19%. We reduced our SG&A by 7% and delivered adjusted normalized EBITDA margins of 51%. We also added $195 million to our cash balance, secured several new floater contracts and closed the secured financing transaction. Most importantly, we delivered these results while never losing sight of our most sacred responsibility, the safety of our operations and our people. 
I'll now hand the call over to Mark."

During today's call, I plan to briefly recap the third quarter results and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position, including the recent capital market transactions. I will also provide an update to our 201",1325,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I plan to briefly recap the third quarter results and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position, including the recent capital market transactions. I will also provide an update to our 2016 guidance and an early look at our cost expectations for 2017.
As said in our press release, for the third quarter of 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $229 million or $0.62 per diluted share. These results included $136 million or $0.37 per diluted share in net favorable items, primarily associated with gains and early retirement of debt and discrete tax benefits. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $93 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
This amount includes cost of $21 million associated with the grounding, salvage and preparation for recycling of the Transocean Winner. We anticipate an additional charge of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to this rig. We entered the third quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the third quarter of $440 million, which includes approximately $70 million of working capital release.
I will now provide an update to our financial expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our fourth quarter 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 is expected to be between $170 million and $180 million, which includes the early termination of revenue for the Discoverer India and customer reimbursables.
Fourth quarter O&M expense is expected to be between $375 million and $385 million, consistent with activity and excludes the additional cost associated with the salvage and recycling of Transocean Winner.
We expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to range between $40 million and $45 million, excluding restructuring costs. Fourth quarter net interest expense is expected to be between $100 million and $110 million, reflecting the repayment of our 5.05% [ph] senior notes due 2016 and our recent debt capital market transactions. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income. The fourth quarter 2016 annual effective tax rate is expected to be between 8% and 10%. This lower range considers changes in the jurisdictional mix of operating results.
Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $230 million. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest for the fourth quarter, are expected to be approximately $350 million, mainly associated with the contracted newbuilds. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $10 million. 
Now for an early look at 2017's primarily [ph] cost expectations. We're in the midst of covering on next year's annual budget and will provide greater detail regarding our 2017 expectations on our next earnings call. Operating and maintenance costs for 2017 are expected to be between 20% and 25% lower than full year 2016. We expect the overall reduced operating activity of our fleet to be partially offset by the full year effect of 3 ultra-deepwater newbuilds. At this time, we're committed to one reactivation in 2017, which is associated with the contract preparation and mobilization in the Transocean Barents. Our most recent fleet status report has been updated to include 2017 out-of-service time for each rig.
We expect our G&A expenses in 2017 to decline to between $145 million and $155 million, a reduction of approximately 10% year-on-year, reflecting the results of our restructuring and other cost-saving initiatives.
Capital expenditures for 2017 are anticipated to be $450 million. This includes $400 million in newbuild CapEx, largely associated with the final shipyard payments on the Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon. Maintenance CapEx is forecasted to be approximately $50 million, reflecting one planned SBS as well as the reactivation of the Barents. You will note that our other survey [indiscernible] associated with special periodic surveys have decreased substantially as compared to prior years. This is further evidence of Transocean's process reengineering initiatives, whereby we perform certain survey-required activities while rigs are operating, minimizing the potential impact of our special periodic surveys.
Turning now to our financial position. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $137 million of debt at a cost of $134 million. As a reminder, since July 2015, we have repurchased debt with a face value of $869 million or $812 million, saving approximately $180 million in interest expense through the maturity of this debt.
This excludes the debt repurchase in conjunction with the July 2016 tender offer. Following the $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July, we accessed debt capital markets again in October, successfully placing $600 million of senior secured notes with a 2024 maturity. We received their proceeds of $583 million from this offering. The proceeds will be used partially to refinance the ultra-deepwater newbuild drillship, Deepwater Thalassa, which is working on at 10-year contract with Shell on the Gulf of Mexico.
We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our liquidity and strategically address our debt maturities. As you are well aware, we have a number of options available to us, including additional unsecured and secured debt. In this regard, the second of our 4 Shell-contracted drillships, the Deepwater Proteus, which commenced operations in May 2016, is also an ideal candidate for a secured financing transaction.
And finally, as a reminder, we issued $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July. In addition with -- in addition, we have full availability on our undrawn, unsecured $3 billion revolving credit facility, further enhancing our liquidity position. 
Now let me spend a few moments on the Transocean Partners transaction.
As you know on July 31, 2016, we made an offer to purchase a publicly held common units. As is the proxy statement related to the special meeting of unitholders, this action was taken to the increase in Transocean Partners' cost of capital and inability to act as an alternative financing vehicle for Transocean. To date, all 3 major proxy advisers have published opinions supporting the transaction and we look forward to successful completion to the transaction. We expect this merger to generate important synergies and value creation, benefiting both our new and existing shareholders.
However, in the event the transaction is not consummated as expected, Transocean Partners want you to make some difficult decisions regarding its capital needs and adequacy of cash reserves. We recognize the current market conditions and reduce cash flow with fewer rigs forecasted to operate in 2017. And Transocean Partners meeting to decide whether to warm or cospec the DD3, and it's not recontracted from time the contract expires in November. Cost associated with the model stack can vary greatly as can reactivation costs. In order to appropriately plan for scenarios in which Transocean Partners revenues may come from only 2 of its 3 assets, significant portion of cash maybe -- may need for -- to be reserved for operational and planning purposes which may impact Transocean Partners' future cash distributions. Such impacts may include an elimination of the distribution to subordinated units owned by Transocean as well as a reduction in the distribution to common unitholders.
Turning now to our Projected Liquidity. We now expect liquidity at December 31, 2018, in the range of $3.6 billion to $4.1 billion, including the impact of the senior secured notes issued in October. Operating as options include revenue efficiency of 95%, A limited number of new contracts assumed to be at or near cash breakeven costs through 2017 with marginal improvement in 2018, and that cash flow reduction approximately $60 million, associated with a determination of the Discoverer India. No speculative reservations and the closure of the Transocean Partners merger after the unitholder approval. In 2018, we expect total CapEx of approximately $375 million. This includes approximately $130 million in newbuild CapEx and $245 million for maintenance CapEx.
This strong liquidity position, combined with our industry-leading contract backlog positions us very well for the future. 
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry. Terry?"

With oil prices generally holding around the $50 mark during the quarter, we have experienced an increase in customer inquiries and engaged more productive conversations as compared to the first half of the year. As a direct part of those conversations, we successfully executed several new contracts since the last earnings call, resulting in the addition of $214 million of contract backlog, bringing our 2016 total to $515 million. Year-to-date, we've announced 17 total contracts resulting -- representing more than 1/3 of the global photo fixtures contracted to date. We continue to win more work than our competitors and we fully expect to continue that trend as we hope to enhance a few my contracts before the end of 2016. As Jeremy mentioned, we're pleased to announce that Suncor's development work for Offshore Eastern Canada was awarded to our harsh environment semi, the Transocean Barents. This 15-month contract added approximately $119 million to our already industry leading backlog. 
After a brief reactivation and mobilization, the photo will commence operations in July 2017 with a Henry Goodrich is starting its contract in the second quarter of this year, the Barents will be the second harsh environment semireactivated for another independent in Canada, increasing our operating base and positioning us for longer-term work in the region.

Also in the North Sea, the mid-water floaters Sedco 712 was awarded 16 well contracts and a 1 well contract with Fairfield and Conoco Phillips, respectively, keeping her contracted until mid-2018. You may recall that the 16 well award was a very competitive tender with 16 rigs offered and as another example of our ability to successfully execute against our competition. We see multiple opportunities for harsh environment fleet in '17 and '18 as our customers are becoming more active in executing projects with creative commercial solutions and some improvement in access to capital.
Just last week, in Myanmar, the Casey II was awarded 3 appraisal wells plus 5 option wells for Woodside, commencing in early 2017. Following the completion of its current contract for Alliance in India. Should the options be exercised, the program duration is expected to be approximately one year. With this contract, we are now well positioned with an operating rate in an area to capture future work, which we see on the present with multiple customers. Unfortunately, some of this good news was offset last month when we received the early termination notice for the Discoverer India, effective December 15, 2016. Part of the terms of the women, we will be compensated for a lump sum payment of approximately $160 million. To be clear, this was a modest termination payment based on the contract executed early in 2008 which was convertible from 5 years to 10 years. This early termination payment was negotiated as part of the original contract providing only phenomenal payback after the first 5 years of operations. It is important to note that the remaining contract in our backlog are either noncancelable or provide many make-haul provisions in the event of the early termination for convenience. For the contracts, we have recently executed, we will receive at least 75% of our expected cash flow in the event of an early termination for convenience. While certainly disappointed by the cancellation, the India is a highly capable drillship which is well-suited for some near-term opportunities that we are actively pursuing. Factoring in the impact of the cancellation and the addition of the new contract our backlog as of October 24, continues to be industry-leading at $12.2 billion, which provides us far more visibility to future earnings and cash flow than any of our competitors. Of the $12.2 billion, 84% is contracted with IOC, 8% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the NOCs.
Turning now to the global market. As of today, marketed floater utilization is down to 77% with 59 rigs idle and 65 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, 45 floater fixtures have been announced mostly in Asia, India, U.K., Norway and Canada with the majority being short-term work, except for Canada and India. Although commodity prices have been positive as the capacity continues to diminish, we still need to see further improvement and stability in oil prices as we move forward. 
As a result of oil prices fluctuating in the $50 barrel range, tendering looks to be taken up with respect to the independents and NOCs. While the IOCs have greatly reduced development and production costs, we believe that $60-barrel is needed to jumpstart the sanction of their new programs. Additionally, new legislation in Brazil is expected to pave the way for international investment as some IOCs and the excitement in-country is infectious. Statoil, Chevron and Shell prime for are all looking at the portfolio drilling opportunities and we expect to see if you will to being drilled as early as late '17. Our customers continue to view their Deepwater assets vital to the future production, knowing that the lack of investment, coupled with certain deflation in offshore drilling is unsustainable. 
In conclusion, we will continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we press to the downturn looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to Brad."

And people around here starts to get really excited, unfortunately, that doesn't seem to last very long and oil prices dip down into the mid-40s again and those conversations starts of it. So I think if we can see oil prices hang around in that $50-barrel range for a period of time, you will see activity pickup. And I think first, in kind of that North Sea U.K. and Norway, we'll see more activity again in India, some in Asia Pacific. And actually I think we can start to see some toward the end of the year in Brazil. So I think those are going to be kind of the hotspots moving forward.

So if you think about the number of rigs we were running at the end of '16, but as rigs come off contract, they are going to some sort of stacking mode, the number of rigs being run at the end of '16 is substantially less. So if you look at full year '16 cost and compare to full year '17, some of that 20% to 25% reduction is just going to be a matter of reduced activity. But as we discussed at conferences and previous calls, there's also several initiatives ongoing whereby we're looking at technical sourcing and strategic sourcing to drive beyond cost. The easy part of that you [indiscernible] give me an extra 2% or 3%, well that's behind us now. Now it's doing things differently. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, particularly at SBS days for next year and compare that to what we used to have 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, and it's substantially down. So what are we doing? We engineered the process around performing the special survey work to incorporate some of that work prior to the rig going off into the shipyard and getting its survey completed. During that, about the rigs work, and you do have fewer days in the shipyard, which means fuel costs in the shipyard. And this is just a matter of folks thinking about it, looking at it differently when you're faced with oil prices that have been as low there have been in the most recent past."

We were encouraged here recently when -- with the OpEx decision and oil prices moving above $50 a barrel and staying there, we started to get far more interest from our customers at that point time. And our belief is, whether right or wrong, that we will see oil start to move above $50 and stay there as we move through the next year. And that will lead to more contracting activity. To be clear, the contracting activity is going to be very competitively priced and it's going to be a short duration. And so it's not anything that's really going to be material but it's going to be at least get things moving. And so if we can see oil move even north of $50 and get closer to $60, then we start to get more activity, we start to get a little bit better pricing at that point in time.

So obviously, the operations group, our crews and our shore-based personnel did a fantastic job of keeping our it's running and assure really high uptime. Other elements to that though, there are puts and takes. We had some contracts where we have performance bonuses. And so obviously, in this quarter and the previous quarters, we earned those performance bonuses for fantastic performance. But we also, since it's revenue efficiency, that's our ability to convert backlog into revenue. If there -- if we have provisions for doubtful accounts, so if we have revenue at risk of collecting, that impacts revenue efficiency negatively. So those are really the 3 primary component, uptime being the primary driver, performance bonuses, offset by provisions for doubtful accounts. So..."

You guys have done a good bit in terms of certainly retiring rigs and also stacking. And I know you go through a pretty detailed individual evaluation of those rigs, and you're looking for certain capabilities. And I guess on a microlevel or as you look at specifically to Transocean, those are good rigs and then that's probably true but is there a macro overlay associated with that? And you kind of, in other words, you kind of talked about the competitive situation and there's just too many rigs out there in general and it seems like you're kind of relying on the competitors to do that. So I guess from our perspective, almost no matter what the demand recovery is out there, unless there is some more aggressive attrition and kind of one of the more proactive bases, you've never need anywhere close to the number of scrap rigs that are there across the industry. So you guys have done a phenomenal job on cost and it feels like a cheap option.

So when Transocean approached cold stacking of ultra-deepwater DP rigs for the first time, we actually worked together with the [indiscernible] in particular to develop a methodology whereby we can cold-stack these rigs and stop the clock on the SPS. So we'll be able to successfully reactivate rigs without having to spend a significant amount of money on an SPS in addition to reactivation when the rig gets a contract. That being said, we recognize that whenever you come out of a downturn, your first contracts are rather short-term as we've seen and they're always rather low. So if you expect to get full playback on your reactivation is highly unlikely which means you're going to push out that into the future. So the way we look at that is, and tell you we can add to this is we look at a reactivation in the context of where and who. So if this rig has the potential to be reactivated against a 6- or 12-month contract for potential follow-on work for another 2 or 3 customers in that area, that will get us the comfort and the confidence to be able to reactivate this rig at a payback that's not full for that first contract."

Then, Terry will provide an overview of the market and discuss some of the latest developments with our customers around the world.
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $93 million in the third quarter or $0.25 per diluted share on $903 million in revenue. We are again very pleased with our quarterly results as they reflect the organization's continued commitment to maximizing uptime and performance for our customers, while simultaneously streamlining and optimizing all facets of our business.
For the quarter, revenue efficiency, which was 96.5% in the prior quarter, improved to an extraordinary 100.7%. Needless to say, we are proud of this outcome as it validates the important work that our teams have been doing to redesign processes, rewrite and reformat procedures, enhance and expand our training programs and heighten our focus around procedural discipline. It is also a testament to our team's unwavering commitment to maximize uptime, which continues to differentiate Transocean in the eyes of our customers.
As such, I'd like to take this moment to recognize and personally thank our crews and our shore-based support personnel for driving this tremendous performance. I would also like to recognize and thank the team for delivering this result while simultaneously continuing to reduce our cost base. As a direct result of their efforts, our adjusted normalized EBITDA margin improved to 51%, despite a 4% sequential decline in revenue.
In addition to posting exceptionally strong operating results, we continue to take other actions necessary to further strengthen our liquidity. I'm pleased to report that in October, we raised $600 million by collateralizing one of the newest additions to our fleet, the Deepwater Thalassa, which commenced its 10-year contract with Shell earlier this year.
Speaking of new additions to the fleet, during the quarter, our newbuild team once again did a masterful job delivering another high-specification ultra-deepwater drillship, the Deepwater Conqueror. This rig is currently en route to the Gulf of Mexico, where it will commence its 5-year contract for Shell -- Chevron early next year. This will be the third world-class asset that we've added to the Transocean fleet this year, and our expectation is that the Deepwater Conqueror will perform at a similar level to the Deepwater Thalassa and the Deepwater Proteus, which both delivered impressive uptime results, averaging 98% in the third quarter, and have proven to be highly efficient drilling machines.
In addition to upgrading our ultra-deepwater drillship fleet with new assets, we are also excited about securing new work for one of our most capable harsh environment semisubmersibles. Just as the third quarter ended, we added a 15-month contract for the Transocean Barents to our backlog. The rig will be working for Suncor and is scheduled to commence operations in mid-2017. This is the second rig that we've reactivated for harsh environment work off the East Coast of Canada and serves as yet another indication that our customers place significant value on relationships, rig capability, technical support and operational performance. It also demonstrates that our customers are confident that our meticulous approach to preserving and maintaining stacked rigs will result in efficient reactivations and assets that perform as intended and when needed.
When preparing for reactivations, it's important to remember that crewing our rigs with the industry's most capable, experienced and motivated individuals is as important as preparing the rig itself. In fact, in recent discussions with our customers, they have placed greater emphasis on the reactivation of our crews than the reactivation of the rigs. Recognizing our customers' priorities, we are doing our best to retain our most seasoned talent and to maintain contact with former employees through outreach efforts with the expectation that we can keep them engaged and attract them back to Transocean as our rigs return to work.
Although we are proud of the outcomes that we produced in the quarter, many of you will know that during the month of August, we had an unfortunate incident with the Transocean Winner. While on tow from Norway, the rig encountered a strong late summer storm, which ultimately caused the grounding of the rig off the coast of Scotland. Fortunately, the incident did not result in any personal injuries and no environmental impacts were reported. And with the assistance of the local community, U.K. and Scottish government agencies and other partners, we safely refloated and moved the rig to nearby sheltered waters for evaluation and removed all debris from the grounding site.
The Winner has now arrived in Turkey, where it will be recycled. In addition to the Winner, we also made the decision to recycle 2 other mid-water floaters, the Transocean Driller and the Sedco 704. This brings our current total of floaters to be retired and recycled to 29. And as we have previously discussed, we will continue to actively assist our fleet within the context of the market and make prudent decisions to ensure Transocean continues to have the most competitive fleet in the industry.
Somewhat offsetting these rig retirements, since 2008, we have added 17 new high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters to our fleet. And with the Deepwater Pontus and the Deepwater Poseidon joining the fleet by early 2018, this number will soon increase to 19. We also have 2 more high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters that are under construction and currently scheduled for delivery in 2020.
Turning to the macro environment. In the last month, oil prices have rebounded somewhat, exceeding and holding above $50 per barrel until just recently. As was the case earlier in the year when oil touched $50 per barrel, our customers, primarily the independents and national oil companies, are once again approaching us with inquiries around rig availability and day rates. For the major integrated oil companies, we still think an oil price approaching $60 per barrel is required to compel them to commence new projects. However, as long as oil prices remain around $50 per barrel, we would expect them to engage in conversations around blend-and-extend opportunities, which would enable them to reduce their near-term obligations and secure additional term at discounted rates.
With 2016 coming to a close and most operators' budgets for next year nearing completion, our current thinking is that 2017 will represent the trough for spending in the offshore market. But looking forward, we're encouraged by the fact that global demand for oil continues to be resilient. Due a lack of investment, the global supply of oil continues to decline. And given OPEC's recent announcement, ultimately, we might see an additional 1 million barrels per day of oil production taken offline. As such, it's becoming more likely that supply and demand will soon converge, leading to continued improvement in oil prices. Additionally, the entire offshore industry has worked to eliminate cost from the value chain, making deepwater projects economically viable at lower commodity prices. The combination of these factors continues to give us confidence in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development, and ultimately, in the recovery of the deepwater drilling industry. 
In the near term, based on current commodity prices and market conditions, we expect to see an increase in both interest and contracting activity as we move through 2017 with a stronger recovery forecasted in 2018. As we prepare for that eventual recovery, we continue to take the necessary steps to successfully navigate this downturn and position Transocean to remain the undisputed leader in the space. The aforementioned $600 million secured placement, combined with our $1.25 billion senior unsecured July bond offering and simultaneous tender offer where we purchased approximately $1 billion of our outstanding debt, demonstrates our commitment and wherewithal to further strengthen our liquidity position and extend our runway.
Furthermore, following unitholder approval, we are expecting to close our acquisition of Transocean Partners this month. In addition to simplifying our administration and governance, reducing our costs and further improving our liquidity, this merger will provide Transocean Partners holders with the opportunity to rotate into Transocean's stock. 
In conclusion, I would like to once again thank all Transocean employees for delivering another great quarter. As a team, we delivered over 100% revenue efficiency. We reduced our OpEx sequentially by 19%. We reduced our SG&A by 7% and delivered adjusted normalized EBITDA margins of 51%. We also added $195 million to our cash balance, secured several new floater contracts and closed the secured financing transaction. Most importantly, we delivered these results while never losing sight of our most sacred responsibility, the safety of our operations and our people. 
I'll now hand the call over to Mark."

During today's call, I plan to briefly recap the third quarter results and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position, including the recent capital market transactions. I will also provide an update to our 2016 guidance and an early look at our cost expectations for 2017.
As said in our press release, for the third quarter of 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $229 million or $0.62 per diluted share. These results included $136 million or $0.37 per diluted share in net favorable items, primarily associated with gains and early retirement of debt and discrete tax benefits. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $93 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
This amount includes cost of $21 million associated with the grounding, salvage and preparation for recycling of the Transocean Winner. We anticipate an additional charge of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to this rig. We entered the third quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the third quarter of $440 million, which includes approximately $70 million of working capital release.
I will now provide an update to our financial expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our fourth quarter 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 is expected to be between $170 million and $180 million, which includes the early termination of revenue for the Discoverer India and customer reimbursables.
Fourth quarter O&M expense is expected to be between $375 million and $385 million, consistent with activity and excludes the additional cost associated with the salvage and recycling of Transocean Winner.
We expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to range between $40 million and $45 million, excluding restructuring costs. Fourth quarter net interest expense is expected to be between $100 million and $110 million, reflecting the repayment of our 5.05% [ph] senior notes due 2016 and our recent debt capital market transactions. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income. The fourth quarter 2016 annual effective tax rate is expected to be between 8% and 10%. This lower range considers changes in the jurisdictional mix of operating results.
Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $230 million. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest for the fourth quarter, are expected to be approximately $350 million, mainly associated with the contracted newbuilds. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $10 million. 
Now for an early look at 2017's preliminary cost expectations. We're in the midst of covering on next year's annual budget and will provide greater detail regarding our 2017 expectations on our next earnings call. Operating and maintenance costs for 2017 are expected to be between 20% and 25% lower than full year 2016. We expect the overall reduced operating activity of our fleet to be partially offset by the full year effect of 3 ultra-deepwater newbuilds. At this time, we're committed to one reactivation in 2017, which is associated with the contract preparation and mobilization in the Transocean Barents. Our most recent fleet status report has been updated to include 2017 out-of-service time for each rig.
We expect our G&A expenses in 2017 to decline to between $145 million and $155 million, a reduction of approximately 10% year-on-year, reflecting the results of our restructuring and other cost-saving initiatives.
Capital expenditures for 2017 are anticipated to be $450 million. This includes $400 million in newbuild CapEx, largely associated with the final shipyard payments on the Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon. Maintenance CapEx is forecasted to be approximately $50 million, reflecting one planned SPS as well as the reactivation of the Barents. You will note that our other service debt associated with special periodic surveys have decreased substantially as compared to prior years. This is further evidence of Transocean's process reengineering initiatives, whereby we perform certain survey-required activities while rigs are operating, minimizing the potential impact of our special periodic surveys.
Turning now to our financial position. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $137 million of debt at a cost of $134 million. As a reminder, since July 2015, we have repurchased debt with a face value of $869 million or $812 million, saving approximately $180 million in interest expense through the maturity of this debt.
This excludes the debt repurchase in conjunction with the July 2016 tender offer. Following the $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July, we accessed debt capital markets again in October, successfully placing $600 million of senior secured notes with a 2024 maturity. We received their proceeds of $583 million from this offering. The proceeds will be used partially to refinance the ultra-deepwater newbuild drillship, Deepwater Thalassa, which is working on at 10-year contract with Shell on the Gulf of Mexico.
We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our liquidity and strategically address our debt maturities. As you are well aware, we have a number of options available to us, including additional unsecured and secured debt. In this regard, the second of our 4 Shell-contracted drillships, the Deepwater Proteus, which commenced operations in May 2016, is also an ideal candidate for a secured financing transaction.
And finally, as a reminder, we issued $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July. In addition with -- in addition, we have full availability on our undrawn, unsecured $3 billion revolving credit facility, further enhancing our liquidity position. 
Now let me spend a few moments on the Transocean Partners transaction.
As you know on, July 31, 2016, we made an offer to purchase the publicly held common units. As stated in the proxy statements related to the special meeting of unitholders, this action was taken due to the increase in Transocean Partners' cost of capital and its inability to act as an alternative financing vehicle for Transocean. To date, all 3 major proxy advisers have published opinions supporting the transaction and we look forward to successful conclusion to the transaction. We expect this merger to generate important synergies and value creation, benefiting both our new and existing shareholders.
However, in the event the transaction is not consummated as expected, Transocean Partners will need to make some difficult decisions regarding its capital needs and adequacy of cash reserves. We recognize the current challenging market conditions and reduced cash flow with fewer rigs forecasted to operate in 2017 and Transocean Partners needing to decide whether to warm or cold stack the DD3 if it's not recontracted by the time the contract expires in November. Costs associated with the mode of stacking can vary greatly as can reactivation costs. In order to appropriately plan for scenarios in which Transocean Partners' revenues may come from only 2 of its 3 assets, significant portion of cash may be -- may need for -- to be reserved for operational and planning purposes, which may impact Transocean Partners' future cash distributions. Such impacts may include an elimination of the distribution to subordinated units owned by Transocean as well as a reduction in the distribution to common unitholders.
Turning now to our projected liquidity. We now expect liquidity at December 31, 2018, in the range of $3.6 billion to $4.1 billion, including the impact of the senior secured notes issued in October. Operating assumptions include revenue efficiency of 95%, a limited number of new contracts with day rates assumed to be at or near cash breakeven costs through 2017 with marginal day rate improvement in 2018, a net cash flow reduction of approximately $60 million associated with the termination of the Discoverer India, no speculative reactivations and the closure of the Transocean Partners merger after the unitholder approval. In 2018, we expect total CapEx of approximately $375 million. This includes approximately $130 million in newbuild CapEx and $245 million for maintenance CapEx.
This strong liquidity position, combined with our industry-leading contract backlog, positions us very well for the future. 
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry. Terry?"

As",921,"Thanks, Mark, and good day to everyone. With oil prices generally holding around the $50 mark during the quarter, we have experienced an increase in customer inquiries and engaged more productive conversations as compared to the first half of the year. As a direct product of those conversations, we successfully executed several new contracts since the last earnings call, resulting in the addition of $214 million of contract backlog, bringing our 2016 total to $515 million. Year-to-date, we've announced 17 floater contracts resulting -- sorry, representing more than 1/3 of the global floater fixtures contracted to date. We continue to win more work than our competitors, and we fully expect to continue that trend as we hope to announce a few more contracts before the end of 2016. As Jeremy mentioned, we are pleased to announce that Suncor's development work for offshore Eastern Canada was awarded to our harsh-environment semi, the Transocean Barents. This 15-month contract added approximately $119 million to our already industry-leading backlog. 
After a brief reactivation and mobilization, the floater will commence operations in July 2017. With the Henry Goodrich starting its contract in the second quarter of this year, the Barents will be the second harsh-environment semi reactivated for another independent in Canada, increasing our operating base and positioning us for longer-term work in the region.
In the U.K. North Sea we are pleased that Hurricane Energy recently exercised options on the harsh-environment semisubmersible, the Transocean Spitsbergen. This contract also has the potential for 2 additional options before moving to the Norwegian North Sea to begin operating for Repsol. 
Also in the North Sea, the mid-water floater Sedco 712 was awarded 16 well contracts and a 1 well contract with Fairfield and ConocoPhillips, respectively, keeping her contracted until mid-2018. You may recall that the 16-well award was a very competitive tender with 16 rigs offered and is another example of our ability to successfully execute against our competition. We see multiple opportunities for harsh-environment fleet in '17 and '18 as our customers are becoming more active in executing projects with creative commercial solutions and some improvement in access to capital.
Just last week, in Myanmar, the KG2 was awarded 3 appraisal wells plus 5 option wells for Woodside commencing in early 2017, following the conclusion of its current contract for Reliance in India. Should the options be exercised, the program duration is expected to be approximately 1 year. With this contract, we are now well positioned with an operating rig in the area to capture future work, which we see on the horizon with multiple customers. Unfortunately, some of this good news was offset last month when we received the early termination notice for the Discoverer India effective December 15, 2016. Part of the terms of the agreement, we will be compensated through a lump sum payment of approximately $160 million. To be clear, this was a modest termination payment based on the contract executed early in 2008, which was convertible from 5 years to 10 years. This early termination payment was negotiated as part of the original contract, providing only phenomenal payback after the first 5 years of operation. It is important to note that the remaining contracts in our backlog are either noncancelable or provide many make-whole provisions in the event of the early termination for convenience. For the contracts we have recently executed, we will receive at least 75% of our expected cash flow in the event of an early termination for convenience. While certainly disappointed by the cancellation, the India is a highly capable drillship which is well suited for some near-term opportunities that we are actively pursuing. Factoring in the impact of the cancellation and the addition of the new contracts, our backlog as of October 24 continues to be industry leading at $12.2 billion, which provides us far more visibility to future earnings and cash flow than any of our competitors. Of the $12.2 billion, 84% is contracted with IOCs, 8% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the NOCs.
Turning now to the global market. As of today, marketed floater utilization is down to 77% with 59 rigs idle and 65 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, 45 floater fixtures have been announced mostly in Asia, India, U.K., Norway and Canada with the majority being short-term work, except for Canada and India. Although commodity prices have been positive as spare capacity continues to diminish, we still need to see further improvement and stability in oil prices as we move forward. 
As a result of oil prices fluctuating in the $50 barrel range, tendering looks to be picking up with respect to the independents and NOCs. While the IOCs have greatly reduced development and production costs, we believe that $60-barrel is needed to jump-start the sanction of their new programs. Additionally, new legislation in Brazil is expected to pave the way for international investment of some IOCs and the excitement in-country is infectious. Statoil, Chevron and Shell are already looking at their portfolio of drilling opportunities and we expect to see a few wells being drilled as early as late '17. Our customers continue to view their deepwater assets as vital to their future production, knowing that the lack of investment, coupled with certain deflation in offshore drilling, is unsustainable. 
In conclusion, we will continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we press through the downturn, looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to Brad."

So if you think about the number of rigs we were running at the beginning of '16 and as rigs came off contract, that they're going to some sort of a stacking mode.

So if you look at full year '16 cost and compare to full year '17, some of that 20% to 25% reduction is just going to be a matter of reduced activity. But as we discussed at conferences and previous calls, there's also several initiatives ongoing whereby we're looking at technical sourcing and strategic sourcing to drive beyond cost. The easy part of that is speaking to and calling your vendors and say give me an extra 2% or 3%. Well, that's behind us now. Now it's doing things differently. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, particularly our SPS days for next year and compare that to what we used to have 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, it's substantially down. So what are we doing? We engineered the process around performing the special periodic survey work to incorporate some of that work prior to the rig going off into the shipyard and getting its survey completed. By doing that while the rig's working, you do have fewer days in the shipyard, which means fewer costs in the shipyard. And this is just a matter of folks thinking about it, looking at it differently when you're faced with oil prices that have been as low they have been in the most recent past."

Thanks, Robin, good question. So when Transocean approached cold stacking of ultra-deepwater DP rigs for the first time, we actually worked together with the class society's DNV in particular to develop a methodology whereby we can cold-stack these rigs and stop the clock on the SPS. So we'll be able to successfully reactivate rigs without having to spend a significant amount of money on an SPS, in addition to reactivation when the rig gets a contract. That being said, we recognize that whenever you come out of a downturn, your first contracts are rather short term, as we've seen, and their risks are rather low. So do you expect to get full payback on your reactivation is highly unlikely, which means you're going to push out that into the future. So the way we look at that is, and Terry, you can add to this, is we look at a reactivation in the context of where and who. So if this rig has the potential to be reactivated against a 6- or 12-month contract for potential follow-on work for another 2 or 3 customers in that area, that will get us the comfort and the confidence to be able to reactivate this rig at a payback that's not full for that first contract."

Following my prepared remarks, Mark will recap the quarterly financial performance, comment on our recent secured debt transaction which further bolstered our strong liquidity position and provide our expectations for the fourth quarter. Then, Terry will provide an overview of the market and discuss some of the latest developments with our customers around the world.
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $93 million in the third quarter or $0.25 per diluted share on $903 million in revenue. We are again very pleased with our quarterly results as they reflect the organization's continued commitment to maximizing uptime and performance for our customers, while simultaneously streamlining and optimizing all facets of our business.
For the quarter, revenue efficiency, which was 96.5% in the prior quarter, improved to an extraordinary 100.7%. Needless to say, we are proud of this outcome as it validates the important work that our teams have been doing to redesign processes, rewrite and reformat procedures, enhance and expand our training programs and heighten our focus around procedural discipline. It is also a testament to our team's unwavering commitment to maximize uptime, which continues to differentiate Transocean in the eyes of our customers.
As such, I'd like to take this moment to recognize and personally thank our crews and our shore-based support personnel for driving this tremendous performance. I would also like to recognize and thank the team for delivering this result while simultaneously continuing to reduce our cost base. As a direct result of their efforts, our adjusted normalized EBITDA margin improved to 51%, despite a 4% sequential decline in revenue.
In addition to posting exceptionally strong operating results, we continue to take other actions necessary to further strengthen our liquidity. I'm pleased to report that in October, we raised $600 million by collateralizing one of the newest additions to our fleet, the Deepwater Thalassa, which commenced its 10-year contract with Shell earlier this year.
Speaking of new additions to the fleet, during the quarter, our newbuild team once again did a masterful job delivering another high-specification ultra-deepwater drillship, the Deepwater Conqueror. This rig is currently en route to the Gulf of Mexico, where it will commence its 5-year contract for Shell -- Chevron early next year. This will be the third world-class asset that we've added to the Transocean fleet this year, and our expectation is that the Deepwater Conqueror will perform at a similar level to the Deepwater Thalassa and the Deepwater Proteus, which both delivered impressive uptime results, averaging 98% in the third quarter, and have proven to be highly efficient drilling machines.
In addition to upgrading our ultra-deepwater drillship fleet with new assets, we are also excited about securing new work for one of our most capable harsh environment semisubmersibles. Just as the third quarter ended, we added a 15-month contract for the Transocean Barents to our backlog. The rig will be working for Suncor and is scheduled to commence operations in mid-2017. This is the second rig that we've reactivated for harsh environment work off the East Coast of Canada and serves as yet another indication that our customers place significant value on relationships, rig capability, technical support and operational performance. It also demonstrates that our customers are confident that our meticulous approach to preserving and maintaining stacked rigs will result in efficient reactivations and assets that perform as intended and when needed.
When preparing for reactivations, it's important to remember that crewing our rigs with the industry's most capable, experienced and motivated individuals is as important as preparing the rig itself. In fact, in recent discussions with our customers, they have placed greater emphasis on the reactivation of our crews than the reactivation of the rigs. Recognizing our customers' priorities, we are doing our best to retain our most seasoned talent and to maintain contact with former employees through outreach efforts with the expectation that we can keep them engaged and attract them back to Transocean as our rigs return to work.
Although we are proud of the outcomes that we produced in the quarter, many of you will know that during the month of August, we had an unfortunate incident with the Transocean Winner. While on tow from Norway, the rig encountered a strong late summer storm, which ultimately caused the grounding of the rig off the coast of Scotland. Fortunately, the incident did not result in any personal injuries and no environmental impacts were reported. And with the assistance of the local community, U.K. and Scottish government agencies and other partners, we safely refloated and moved the rig to nearby sheltered waters for evaluation and removed all debris from the grounding site.
The Winner has now arrived in Turkey, where it will be recycled. In addition to the Winner, we also made the decision to recycle 2 other mid-water floaters, the Transocean Driller and the Sedco 704. This brings our current total of floaters to be retired and recycled to 29. And as we have previously discussed, we will continue to actively assist our fleet within the context of the market and make prudent decisions to ensure Transocean continues to have the most competitive fleet in the industry.
Somewhat offsetting these rig retirements, since 2008, we have added 17 new high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters to our fleet. And with the Deepwater Pontus and the Deepwater Poseidon joining the fleet by early 2018, this number will soon increase to 19. We also have 2 more high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters that are under construction and currently scheduled for delivery in 2020.
Turning to the macro environment. In the last month, oil prices have rebounded somewhat, exceeding and holding above $50 per barrel until just recently. As was the case earlier in the year when oil touched $50 per barrel, our customers, primarily the independents and national oil companies, are once again approaching us with inquiries around rig availability and day rates. For the major integrated oil companies, we still think an oil price approaching $60 per barrel is required to compel them to commence new projects. However, as long as oil prices remain around $50 per barrel, we would expect them to engage in conversations around blend-and-extend opportunities, which would enable them to reduce their near-term obligations and secure additional term at discounted rates.
With 2016 coming to a close and most operators' budgets for next year nearing completion, our current thinking is that 2017 will represent the trough for spending in the offshore market. But looking forward, we're encouraged by the fact that global demand for oil continues to be resilient. Due a lack of investment, the global supply of oil continues to decline. And given OPEC's recent announcement, ultimately, we might see an additional 1 million barrels per day of oil production taken offline. As such, it's becoming more likely that supply and demand will soon converge, leading to continued improvement in oil prices. Additionally, the entire offshore industry has worked to eliminate cost from the value chain, making deepwater projects economically viable at lower commodity prices. The combination of these factors continues to give us confidence in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development, and ultimately, in the recovery of the deepwater drilling industry. 
In the near term, based on current commodity prices and market conditions, we expect to see an increase in both interest and contracting activity as we move through 2017 with a stronger recovery forecasted in 2018. As we prepare for that eventual recovery, we continue to take the necessary steps to successfully navigate this downturn and position Transocean to remain the undisputed leader in the space. The aforementioned $600 million secured placement, combined with our $1.25 billion senior unsecured July bond offering and simultaneous tender offer where we purchased approximately $1 billion of our outstanding debt, demonstrates our commitment and wherewithal to further strengthen our liquidity position and extend our runway.
Furthermore, following unitholder approval, we are expecting to close our acquisition of Transocean Partners this month. In addition to simplifying our administration and governance, reducing our costs and further improving our liquidity, this merger will provide Transocean Partners holders with the opportunity to rotate into Transocean's stock. 
In conclusion, I would like to once again thank all Transocean employees for delivering another great quarter. As a team, we delivered over 100% revenue efficiency. We reduced our OpEx sequentially by 19%. We reduced our SG&A by 7% and delivered adjusted normalized EBITDA margins of 51%. We also added $195 million to our cash balance, secured several new floater contracts and closed the secured financing transaction. Most importantly, we delivered these results while never losing sight of our most sacred responsibility, the safety of our operations and our people. 
I'll now hand the call over to Mark."
407172,404423721,1072146,"Transocean Ltd., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Transocean Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I plan to briefly recap the third quarter results and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position, including the recent capital market transactions. I will also provide an update to our 201",1337,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I plan to briefly recap the third quarter results and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position, including the recent capital market transactions. I will also provide an update to our 2016 guidance and an early look at our cost expectations for 2017.
As said in our press release, for the third quarter of 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $229 million or $0.62 per diluted share. These results included $136 million or $0.37 per diluted share in net favorable items, primarily associated with gains and early retirement of debt and discrete tax benefits. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $93 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
This amount includes cost of $21 million associated with the grounding, salvage and preparation for recycling of the Transocean Winner. We anticipate an additional charge of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to this rig. We entered the third quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the third quarter of $440 million, which includes approximately $70 million of working capital release.
I will now provide an update to our financial expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our fourth quarter 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 is expected to be between $170 million and $180 million, which includes the early termination of revenue for the Discoverer India and customer reimbursables.
Fourth quarter O&M expense is expected to be between $375 million and $385 million, consistent with activity and excludes the additional cost associated with the salvage and recycling of Transocean Winner.
We expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to range between $40 million and $45 million, excluding restructuring costs. Fourth quarter net interest expense is expected to be between $100 million and $110 million, reflecting the repayment of our 5.05% [ph] senior notes due 2016 and our recent debt capital market transactions. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income. The fourth quarter 2016 annual effective tax rate is expected to be between 8% and 10%. This lower range considers changes in the jurisdictional mix of operating results.
Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $230 million. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest for the fourth quarter, are expected to be approximately $350 million, mainly associated with the contracted newbuilds. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $10 million. 
Now for an early look at 2017's preliminary cost expectations. We're in the midst of covering on next year's annual budget and will provide greater detail regarding our 2017 expectations on our next earnings call. Operating and maintenance costs for 2017 are expected to be between 20% and 25% lower than full year 2016. We expect the overall reduced operating activity of our fleet to be partially offset by the full year effect of 3 ultra-deepwater newbuilds. At this time, we're committed to one reactivation in 2017, which is associated with the contract preparation and mobilization in the Transocean Barents. Our most recent fleet status report has been updated to include 2017 out-of-service time for each rig.
We expect our G&A expenses in 2017 to decline to between $145 million and $155 million, a reduction of approximately 10% year-on-year, reflecting the results of our restructuring and other cost-saving initiatives.
Capital expenditures for 2017 are anticipated to be $450 million. This includes $400 million in newbuild CapEx, largely associated with the final shipyard payments on the Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon. Maintenance CapEx is forecasted to be approximately $50 million, reflecting one planned SPS as well as the reactivation of the Barents. You will note that our other service debt associated with special periodic surveys have decreased substantially as compared to prior years. This is further evidence of Transocean's process reengineering initiatives, whereby we perform certain survey-required activities while rigs are operating, minimizing the potential impact of our special periodic surveys.
Turning now to our financial position. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $137 million of debt at a cost of $134 million. As a reminder, since July 2015, we have repurchased debt with a face value of $869 million or $812 million, saving approximately $180 million in interest expense through the maturity of this debt.
This excludes the debt repurchase in conjunction with the July 2016 tender offer. Following the $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July, we accessed debt capital markets again in October, successfully placing $600 million of senior secured notes with a 2024 maturity. We received their proceeds of $583 million from this offering. The proceeds will be used partially to refinance the ultra-deepwater newbuild drillship, Deepwater Thalassa, which is working on at 10-year contract with Shell on the Gulf of Mexico.
We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our liquidity and strategically address our debt maturities. As you are well aware, we have a number of options available to us, including additional unsecured and secured debt. In this regard, the second of our 4 Shell-contracted drillships, the Deepwater Proteus, which commenced operations in May 2016, is also an ideal candidate for a secured financing transaction.
And finally, as a reminder, we issued $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July. In addition with -- in addition, we have full availability on our undrawn, unsecured $3 billion revolving credit facility, further enhancing our liquidity position. 
Now let me spend a few moments on the Transocean Partners transaction.
As you know on, July 31, 2016, we made an offer to purchase the publicly held common units. As stated in the proxy statements related to the special meeting of unitholders, this action was taken due to the increase in Transocean Partners' cost of capital and its inability to act as an alternative financing vehicle for Transocean. To date, all 3 major proxy advisers have published opinions supporting the transaction and we look forward to successful conclusion to the transaction. We expect this merger to generate important synergies and value creation, benefiting both our new and existing shareholders.
However, in the event the transaction is not consummated as expected, Transocean Partners will need to make some difficult decisions regarding its capital needs and adequacy of cash reserves. We recognize the current challenging market conditions and reduced cash flow with fewer rigs forecasted to operate in 2017 and Transocean Partners needing to decide whether to warm or cold stack the DD3 if it's not recontracted by the time the contract expires in November. Costs associated with the mode of stacking can vary greatly as can reactivation costs. In order to appropriately plan for scenarios in which Transocean Partners' revenues may come from only 2 of its 3 assets, significant portion of cash may be -- may need for -- to be reserved for operational and planning purposes, which may impact Transocean Partners' future cash distributions. Such impacts may include an elimination of the distribution to subordinated units owned by Transocean as well as a reduction in the distribution to common unitholders.
Turning now to our projected liquidity. We now expect liquidity at December 31, 2018, in the range of $3.6 billion to $4.1 billion, including the impact of the senior secured notes issued in October. Operating assumptions include revenue efficiency of 95%, a limited number of new contracts with day rates assumed to be at or near cash breakeven costs through 2017 with marginal day rate improvement in 2018, a net cash flow reduction of approximately $60 million associated with the termination of the Discoverer India, no speculative reactivations and the closure of the Transocean Partners merger after the unitholder approval. In 2018, we expect total CapEx of approximately $375 million. This includes approximately $130 million in newbuild CapEx and $245 million for maintenance CapEx.
This strong liquidity position, combined with our industry-leading contract backlog, positions us very well for the future. 
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry. Terry?"

As",921,"Thanks, Mark, and good day to everyone. With oil prices generally holding around the $50 mark during the quarter, we have experienced an increase in customer inquiries and engaged more productive conversations as compared to the first half of the year. As a direct product of those conversations, we successfully executed several new contracts since the last earnings call, resulting in the addition of $214 million of contract backlog, bringing our 2016 total to $515 million. Year-to-date, we've announced 17 floater contracts resulting -- sorry, representing more than 1/3 of the global floater fixtures contracted to date. We continue to win more work than our competitors, and we fully expect to continue that trend as we hope to announce a few more contracts before the end of 2016. As Jeremy mentioned, we are pleased to announce that Suncor's development work for offshore Eastern Canada was awarded to our harsh-environment semi, the Transocean Barents. This 15-month contract added approximately $119 million to our already industry-leading backlog. 
After a brief reactivation and mobilization, the floater will commence operations in July 2017. With the Henry Goodrich starting its contract in the second quarter of this year, the Barents will be the second harsh-environment semi reactivated for another independent in Canada, increasing our operating base and positioning us for longer-term work in the region.
In the U.K. North Sea we are pleased that Hurricane Energy recently exercised options on the harsh-environment semisubmersible, the Transocean Spitsbergen. This contract also has the potential for 2 additional options before moving to the Norwegian North Sea to begin operating for Repsol. 
Also in the North Sea, the mid-water floater Sedco 712 was awarded 16 well contracts and a 1 well contract with Fairfield and ConocoPhillips, respectively, keeping her contracted until mid-2018. You may recall that the 16-well award was a very competitive tender with 16 rigs offered and is another example of our ability to successfully execute against our competition. We see multiple opportunities for harsh-environment fleet in '17 and '18 as our customers are becoming more active in executing projects with creative commercial solutions and some improvement in access to capital.
Just last week, in Myanmar, the KG2 was awarded 3 appraisal wells plus 5 option wells for Woodside commencing in early 2017, following the conclusion of its current contract for Reliance in India. Should the options be exercised, the program duration is expected to be approximately 1 year. With this contract, we are now well positioned with an operating rig in the area to capture future work, which we see on the horizon with multiple customers. Unfortunately, some of this good news was offset last month when we received the early termination notice for the Discoverer India effective December 15, 2016. Part of the terms of the agreement, we will be compensated through a lump sum payment of approximately $160 million. To be clear, this was a modest termination payment based on the contract executed early in 2008, which was convertible from 5 years to 10 years. This early termination payment was negotiated as part of the original contract, providing only phenomenal payback after the first 5 years of operation. It is important to note that the remaining contracts in our backlog are either noncancelable or provide many make-whole provisions in the event of the early termination for convenience. For the contracts we have recently executed, we will receive at least 75% of our expected cash flow in the event of an early termination for convenience. While certainly disappointed by the cancellation, the India is a highly capable drillship which is well suited for some near-term opportunities that we are actively pursuing. Factoring in the impact of the cancellation and the addition of the new contracts, our backlog as of October 24 continues to be industry leading at $12.2 billion, which provides us far more visibility to future earnings and cash flow than any of our competitors. Of the $12.2 billion, 84% is contracted with IOCs, 8% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the NOCs.
Turning now to the global market. As of today, marketed floater utilization is down to 77% with 59 rigs idle and 65 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, 45 floater fixtures have been announced mostly in Asia, India, U.K., Norway and Canada with the majority being short-term work, except for Canada and India. Although commodity prices have been positive as spare capacity continues to diminish, we still need to see further improvement and stability in oil prices as we move forward. 
As a result of oil prices fluctuating in the $50 barrel range, tendering looks to be picking up with respect to the independents and NOCs. While the IOCs have greatly reduced development and production costs, we believe that $60-barrel is needed to jump-start the sanction of their new programs. Additionally, new legislation in Brazil is expected to pave the way for international investment of some IOCs and the excitement in-country is infectious. Statoil, Chevron and Shell are already looking at their portfolio of drilling opportunities and we expect to see a few wells being drilled as early as late '17. Our customers continue to view their deepwater assets as vital to their future production, knowing that the lack of investment, coupled with certain deflation in offshore drilling, is unsustainable. 
In conclusion, we will continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we press through the downturn, looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to Brad."

As oil ticks up to $50 a barrel and it looks like it's going to be sustainable for a period of time, the independents and the NOCs approach us and they're asking about rig availability and they're asking about day rate, and people around here start to get really excited. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to last very long and oil prices dipped down into the mid-40s again and those conversations start to abate. So I think if we can see oil prices hang around in that $50 a barrel range for a period of time, you will see activity pick up. And I think, first, in kind of that North Sea U.K. and Norway, we'll see more activity again in India, some in Asia Pacific. And actually, I think we can start to see some toward the end of the year in Brazil. So I think those are going to be kind of the hotspots moving forward.

So if you think about the number of rigs we were running at the beginning of '16 and as rigs came off contract, that they're going to some sort of a stacking mode. The number of rigs being run at the end of '16 is substantially less. So if you look at full year '16 cost and compare to full year '17, some of that 20% to 25% reduction is just going to be a matter of reduced activity. But as we discussed at conferences and previous calls, there's also several initiatives ongoing whereby we're looking at technical sourcing and strategic sourcing to drive beyond cost. The easy part of that is speaking to and calling your vendors and say give me an extra 2% or 3%. Well, that's behind us now. Now it's doing things differently. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, particularly our SPS days for next year and compare that to what we used to have 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, it's substantially down. So what are we doing? We engineered the process around performing the special periodic survey work to incorporate some of that work prior to the rig going off into the shipyard and getting its survey completed. By doing that while the rig's working, you do have fewer days in the shipyard, which means fewer costs in the shipyard. And this is just a matter of folks thinking about it, looking at it differently when you're faced with oil prices that have been as low they have been in the most recent past."

We were encouraged here recently when -- with the OPEC decision and oil prices moving above $50 a barrel and staying there. We started to get far more interest from our customers at that point in time. And our belief is, whether right or wrong, that we will see oil start to move above $50 and stay there as we move through next year. And that will lead to more contracting activity. To be clear, that contracting activity is going to be very competitively priced and it's going to be of short duration. And so it's not anything that's really going to be material but it's going to be at least get things moving. And so if we can see oil move even north of $50 and get closer to $60, then we start to get more activity. We start to get a little bit better pricing at that point in time.

And then if we can continue to see oil prices move up as we move through 2017, that would obviously lead to more work in 2018. And so that's really where we stand today. It's going to be a challenge to move pricing. But if we can start to see activity pick up, then hopefully in 2018, we start to see pricing move up and in '19 even more.

Thanks, Robin, good question. So when Transocean approached cold stacking of ultra-deepwater DP rigs for the first time, we actually worked together with the class society's DNV in particular to develop a methodology whereby we can cold-stack these rigs and stop the clock on the SPS. So we'll be able to successfully reactivate rigs without having to spend a significant amount of money on an SPS, in addition to reactivation when the rig gets a contract. That being said, we recognize that whenever you come out of a downturn, your first contracts are rather short term, as we've seen, and their risks are rather low. So do you expect to get full payback on your reactivation is highly unlikely, which means you're going to push out that into the future. So the way we look at that is, and Terry, you can add to this, is we look at a reactivation in the context of where and who. So if this rig has the potential to be reactivated against a 6- or 12-month contract for potential follow-on work for another 2 or 3 customers in that area, that will get us the comfort and the confidence to be able to reactivate this rig at a payback that's not full for that first contract."

Following my prepared remarks, Mark will recap the quarterly financial performance, comment on our recent secured debt transaction, which further bolstered our strong liquidity position and provide our expectations for the fourth quarter. Then, Terry will provide an overview of the market and discuss some of the latest developments with our customers around the world.
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $93 million in the third quarter or $0.25 per diluted share on $903 million in revenue. We are again very pleased with our quarterly results as they reflect the organization's continued commitment to maximizing uptime and performance for our customers, while simultaneously streamlining and optimizing all facets of our business.
For the quarter, revenue efficiency, which was 96.5% in the prior quarter, improved to an extraordinary 100.7%. Needless to say, we are proud of this outcome as it validates the important work that our teams have been doing to redesign processes, rewrite and reformat procedures, enhance and expand our training programs and heighten our focus around procedural discipline. It is also a testament to our team's unwavering commitment to maximize uptime, which continues to differentiate Transocean in the eyes of our customers.
As such, I'd like to take this moment to recognize and personally thank our crews and our shore-based support personnel for driving this tremendous performance. I would also like to recognize and thank the team for delivering this result while simultaneously continuing to reduce our cost base. As a direct result of their efforts, our adjusted normalized EBITDA margin improved to 51%, despite a 4% sequential decline in revenue.
In addition to posting exceptionally strong operating results, we continue to take other actions necessary to further strengthen our liquidity. I'm pleased to report that in October, we raised $600 million by collateralizing one of the newest additions to our fleet, the Deepwater Thalassa, which commenced its 10-year contract with Shell earlier this year.
Speaking of new additions to the fleet, during the quarter, our newbuild team once again did a masterful job delivering another high-specification ultra-deepwater drillship, the Deepwater Conqueror. This rig is currently in route to the Gulf of Mexico, where it will commence its 5-year contract for Shell -- Chevron early next year. This will be the third world-class asset that we've added to the Transocean fleet this year, and our expectation is that the Deepwater Conqueror will perform at a similar level to the Deepwater Thalassa and the Deepwater Proteus, which both delivered impressive uptime results, averaging 98% in the third quarter, and have proven to be highly efficient drilling machines.
In addition to upgrading our ultra-deepwater drillship fleet with new assets, we are also excited about securing new work for one of our most capable harsh environment semisubmersibles. Just as the third quarter ended, we added a 15-month contract for the Transocean Barents to our backlog. The rig will be working for Suncor and is scheduled to commence operations in mid-2017. This is the second rig that we've reactivated for harsh environment work off the East Coast of Canada and serves as yet another indication that our customers place significant value on relationships, rig capability, technical support and operational performance. It also demonstrates that our customers are confident that our meticulous approach to preserving and maintaining stacked rigs will result in efficient reactivations and assets that perform as intended and when needed.
When preparing for reactivations, it's important to remember that crewing our rigs with the industry's most capable, experienced and motivated individuals is as important as preparing the rig itself. In fact, in recent discussions with our customers, they have placed greater emphasis on the reactivation of our crews than the reactivation of the rigs. Recognizing our customers' priorities, we are doing our best to retain our most seasoned talent and to maintain contact with former employees through outreach efforts with the expectation that we can keep them engaged and attract them back to Transocean as our rigs return to work.
Although we are proud of the outcomes that we produced in the quarter, many of you will know that during the month of August, we had an unfortunate incident with the Transocean Winner. While on tow from Norway, the rig encountered a strong late summer storm, which ultimately caused the grounding of the rig off the coast of Scotland. Fortunately, the incident did not result in any personal injuries and no environmental impacts were reported. And with the assistance of the local community, U.K. and Scottish government agencies and other partners, we safely refloated and moved the rig to nearby sheltered waters for evaluation and removed all debris from the grounding site.
The Winner has now arrived in Turkey, where it will be recycled. In addition to the Winner, we also made the decision to recycle 2 other mid-water floaters, the Transocean Driller and the Sedco 704. This brings our current total of floaters to be retired and recycled to 29. And as we have previously discussed, we will continue to actively assist our fleet within the context of the market and make prudent decisions to ensure Transocean continues to have the most competitive fleet in the industry.
Somewhat offsetting these rig retirements, since 2008, we have added 17 new high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters to our fleet. And with the Deepwater Pontus and the Deepwater Poseidon joining the fleet by early 2018, this number will soon increase to 19. We also have 2 more high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters that are under construction and currently scheduled for delivery in 2020.
Turning to the macro environment. In the last month, oil prices have rebounded somewhat, exceeding and holding above $50 per barrel until just recently. As was the case earlier in the year when oil touched $50 per barrel, our customers, primarily the independents and national oil companies, are once again approaching us with inquiries around rig availability and day rates. For the major integrated oil companies, we still think an oil price approaching $60 per barrel is required to compel them to commence new projects. However, as long as oil prices remain around $50 per barrel, we would expect them to engage in conversations around blend-and-extend opportunities, which would enable them to reduce their near-term obligations and secure additional term at discounted rates.
With 2016 coming to a close and most operators' budgets for next year nearing completion, our current thinking is that 2017 will represent the trough for spending in the offshore market. But looking forward, we're encouraged by the fact that global demand for oil continues to be resilient. Due to a lack of investment, the global supply of oil continues to decline. And given OPEC's recent announcement, ultimately, we might see an additional 1 million barrels per day of oil production taken offline. As such, it's becoming more likely that supply and demand will soon converge, leading to continued improvement in oil prices. Additionally, the entire offshore industry has worked to eliminate costs from the value chain, making deepwater projects economically viable at lower commodity prices. The combination of these factors continues to give us confidence in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development, and ultimately, in the recovery of the deepwater drilling industry. 
In the near term, based on current commodity prices and market conditions, we expect to see an increase in both interest and contracting activity as we move through 2017, with a stronger recovery forecasted in 2018. As we prepare for that eventual recovery, we continue to take the necessary steps to successfully navigate this downturn and position Transocean to remain the undisputed leader in the space. The aforementioned $600 million secured placement, combined with our $1.25 billion senior unsecured July bond offering and simultaneous tender offer, where we purchased approximately $1 billion of our outstanding debt, demonstrates our commitment and wherewithal to further strengthen our liquidity position and extend our runway.
Furthermore, following unitholder approval, we are expecting to close our acquisition of Transocean Partners this month. In addition to simplifying our administration and governance, reducing our costs and further improving our liquidity, this merger will provide Transocean Partners holders with the opportunity to rotate into Transocean's stock. 
In conclusion, I would like to once again thank all Transocean employees for delivering another great quarter. As a team, we delivered over 100% revenue efficiency. We reduced our OpEx sequentially by 19%. We reduced our SG&A by 7% and delivered adjusted normalized EBITDA margins of 51%. We also added $195 million to our cash balance, secured several new floater contracts and closed the secured financing transaction. Most importantly, we delivered these results while never losing sight of our most sacred responsibility, the safety of our operations and our people. 
I'll now hand the call over to Mark."

During today's call, I plan to briefly recap the third quarter results and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position, including the recent capital market transactions. I will also provide an update to our 2016 guidance and an early look at our cost expectations for 2017.
As said in our press release, for the third quarter of 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $229 million or $0.62 per diluted share. These results include $136 million or $0.37 per diluted share in net favorable items, primarily associated with gains and the early retirement of debt and discrete tax benefits. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $93 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
This amount includes costs of $21 million associated with the grounding, salvage and preparation for recycling of the Transocean Winner. We anticipate an additional charge of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to this rig. We ended the third quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the third quarter of $440 million, which includes approximately $70 million of working capital release.
I will now provide an update to our financial expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our fourth quarter 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 is expected to be between $170 million and $180 million, which includes the early termination of revenue for the Discoverer India and customer reimbursables.
Fourth quarter O&M expense is expected to be between $375 million and $385 million, consistent with activity and excludes the additional costs associated with the salvage and recycling of the Transocean Winner.
We expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to range between $40 million and $45 million, excluding restructuring costs. Fourth quarter net interest expense is expected to be between $100 million and $110 million, reflecting the repayment of our 5.05% senior notes due 2016 and our recent debt capital market transactions. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income. The fourth quarter 2016 annual effective tax rate is expected to be between 8% and 10%. This lower range considers changes in the jurisdictional mix of operating results.
Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $230 million. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest for the fourth quarter, are expected to be approximately $350 million, mainly associated with the contracted newbuilds. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $10 million. 
Now for an early look at 2017's preliminary cost expectations. We're in the midst of preparing our next year's annual budget and we'll provide greater detail regarding our 2017 expectations on our next earnings call. Operating and maintenance costs for 2017 are expected to be between 20% and 25% lower than full year 2016. We expect our overall reduced operating activity of our fleet to be partially offset by the full year effect of 3 ultra-deepwater newbuilds. At this time, we're committed to one reactivation in 2017, which is associated with the contract preparation and mobilization on the Transocean Barents. Our most recent fleet status report has been updated to include 2017 out-of-service time for each rig.
We expect our G&A expenses in 2017 to decline to between $145 million and $155 million, a reduction of approximately 10% year-on-year, reflecting the results of our restructuring and other cost-saving initiatives.
Capital expenditures for 2017 are anticipated to be approximately $450 million. This includes $400 million in newbuild CapEx, largely associated with the final shipyard payments on the Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon. Maintenance CapEx is forecasted to be approximately $50 million, reflecting one planned SPS as well as the reactivation of the Barents. You will note that our other service debt associated with special periodic surveys have decreased substantially as compared to prior years. This is further evidence of Transocean's process reengineering initiatives, whereby we perform certain survey-required activities while rigs are operating, minimizing the potential impact of our special periodic surveys.
Turning now to our financial position. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $137 million of debt at a cost of $134 million. As a reminder, since July 2015, we have repurchased debt with a face value of $869 million for $812 million, saving approximately $180 million in interest expense through the maturity of this debt.
This excludes the debt repurchase in conjunction with the July 2016 tender offer. Following the $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July, we accessed debt capital markets again in October, successfully placing $600 million of senior secured notes with a 2024 maturity. We received net proceeds of $583 million from this offering. The proceeds will be used partially to refinance the ultra-deepwater newbuild drillship, Deepwater Thalassa, which is working on a 10-year contract with Shell in the Gulf of Mexico.
We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our liquidity and strategically address our debt maturities. As you are well aware, we have a number of options available to us, including additional unsecured and secured debt. In this regard, the second of our 4 Shell-contracted drillships, the Deepwater Proteus, which commenced operations in May 2016, is also an ideal candidate for a secured financing transaction.
And finally, as a reminder, we issued $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July. In addition with -- in addition, we have full availability on our undrawn, unsecured $3 billion revolving credit facility, further enhancing our liquidity position. 
Now let me spend a few moments on the Transocean Partners transaction.
As you know, on July 31, 2016, we made an offer to purchase their publicly held common units. As stated in the proxy statements related to the special meeting of unitholders, this action was taken due to the increase in Transocean Partners' cost of capital and its inability to act as an alternative financing vehicle for Transocean. To date, all 3 major proxy advisers have published opinions supporting the transaction, and we look forward to a successful conclusion to the transaction. We expect this merger to generate important synergies and value creation, benefiting both our new and existing shareholders.
However, in the event the transaction is not consummated as expected, Transocean Partners will need to make some difficult decisions regarding its capital needs and adequacy of cash reserves. We recognize the current challenging market conditions and reduced cash flow, with fewer rigs forecasted to operate in 2017, and Transocean Partners needing to decide whether to warm or cold stack the DD3 if it's not recontracted by the time the contract expires in November. Costs associated with the mode of stacking can vary greatly as can reactivation costs. In order to appropriately plan for scenarios in which Transocean Partners' revenues may come from only 2 of its 3 assets, a significant portion of cash may be -- may need for -- to be reserved for operational and planning purposes, which may impact Transocean Partners' future cash distributions. Such impacts may include the elimination of the distribution to subordinated units owned by Transocean as well as a reduction in the distribution to common unitholders.
Turning now to our projected liquidity. We now expect liquidity at December 31, 2018, in the range of $3.6 billion to $4.1 billion, including the impact of the senior secured notes issued in October. Operating assumptions include revenue efficiency of 95%, a limited number of new contracts with day rates assumed to be at or near cash breakeven costs through 2017 with marginal day rate improvement in 2018, a net cash flow reduction of approximately $60 million associated with the termination of the Discoverer India, no speculative reactivations and the closure of the Transocean Partners merger after the unitholder approval. In 2018, we expect total CapEx of approximately $375 million. This includes approximately $130 million in newbuild CapEx and $245 million for maintenance CapEx.
This strong liquidity position, combined with our industry-leading contract backlog, positions us very well for the future. 
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry. Terry?"

With oil prices generally holding around the $50 mark during the quarter, we have experienced an increase in customer inquiries and engaged in more productive conversations as compared to the first half of the year.",925,"Thanks, Mark, and good day to everyone. With oil prices generally holding around the $50 mark during the quarter, we have experienced an increase in customer inquiries and engaged in more productive conversations as compared to the first half of the year. As a direct product of those conversations, we successfully executed several new contracts since the last earnings call, resulting in the addition of $214 million of contract backlog, bringing our 2016 total to $515 million. Year-to-date, we've announced 17 floater contracts resulting -- sorry, representing more than 1/3 of the global floater fixtures contracted to date. We continue to win more work than our competitors, and we fully expect to continue that trend as we hope to announce a few more contracts before the end of 2016. As Jeremy mentioned, we were pleased to announce that Suncor's development work for offshore Eastern Canada was awarded to our harsh-environment semi, the Transocean Barents. This 15-month contract added approximately $119 million to our already industry-leading backlog. 
After a brief reactivation and mobilization, the floater will commence operations in July 2017. With the Henry Goodrich starting its contract in the second quarter of this year, the Barents will be the second harsh-environment semi reactivated for another independent in Canada, increasing our operating base and positioning us for longer-term work in the region.
In the U.K. North Sea we are pleased that Hurricane Energy recently exercised options on the harsh-environment semisubmersible the Transocean Spitsbergen. This contract also has the potential for 2 additional options before moving to the Norwegian North Sea to begin operating for Repsol. 
Also in the North Sea, the mid-water floater Sedco 712 was awarded a 16-well contracts and a 1-well contract with Fairfield and ConocoPhillips, respectively, keeping her contracted until mid-2018. You may recall that the 16-well award was a very competitive tender, with 16 rigs offered and is another example of our ability to successfully execute against our competition. We see multiple opportunities for harsh-environment fleet in '17 and '18 as our customers are becoming more active in executing projects with creative commercial solutions and some improvement in access to capital.
Just last week, in Myanmar, the KG2 was awarded 3 appraisal wells plus 5 option wells for Woodside commencing in early 2017, following the conclusion of its current contract for Reliance in India. Should the options be exercised, the program duration is expected to be approximately 1 year. With this contract, we are now well positioned with an operating rig in the area to capture future work, which we see on the horizon with multiple customers. Unfortunately, some of this good news was offset last month when we received the early termination notice for the Discoverer India effective December 15, 2016. Per the terms of the agreement, we will be compensated through a lump sum payment of approximately $160 million. To be clear, this was a modest termination payment based on a contract executed early in 2008, which was convertible from 5 years to 10 years. This early termination payment was negotiated as part of the original contract, providing only for nominal payback after the first 5 years of operation. It is important to note that the remaining contracts in our backlog are either noncancelable or provide many make-whole provisions in the event of the early termination for convenience. For the contracts we have recently executed, we will receive at least 75% of our expected cash flow in the event of an early termination for convenience. While certainly disappointed by the cancellation, the India is a highly capable drillship which is well suited for some near-term opportunities that we are actively pursuing. Factoring in the impact of the cancellation and the addition of the new contracts, our backlog as of October 24 continues to be industry leading at $12.2 billion, which provides us far more visibility to future earnings and cash flow than any of our competitors. Of the $12.2 billion, 84% is contracted with IOCs, 8% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the NOCs.
Turning now to the global market. As of today, marketed floater utilization is down to 77%, with 59 rigs idle and 65 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, 45 floater fixtures have been announced, mostly in Asia, India, U.K., Norway and Canada with the majority being short-term work, except for Canada and India. Although commodity prices have been positive as spare capacity continues to diminish, we still need to see further improvement and stability in oil prices as we move forward. 
As a result of oil prices fluctuating in the $50 a barrel range, tendering looks to be picking up with respect to the independents and the NOCs. While the IOCs have greatly reduced development and production costs, we believe that $60 a barrel is needed to jump-start the sanction of their new programs. Additionally, new legislation in Brazil is expected to pave the way for international investment of some IOCs and the excitement in-country is infectious. Statoil, Chevron and Shell are already looking at their portfolio of drilling opportunities, and we expect to see a few wells being drilled as early as late '17. Our customers continue to view their deepwater assets as vital to their future production, knowing that the lack of investment, coupled with certain depletion in offshore drilling, is unsustainable. 
In conclusion, we will continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we press through the downturn, looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to Brad."

So if you think about the number of rigs we were running at the beginning of '16, then as rigs came off contract, they would go into some sort of a stacking mode.

So if you look at full year '16 costs and compare to full year '17, some of that 20% to 25% reduction is just going to be a matter of reduced activity. But as we discussed at conferences and previous calls, there's also several initiatives ongoing whereby we're looking at technical sourcing and strategic sourcing to drive down costs. The easy part of that is picking up the phone and calling your vendors and saying give me an extra 2% or 3%. Well, that's behind us now. Now it's doing things differently. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, particularly our SPS days for next year, and compare that to what we used to have 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, and it's substantially down. So what are we doing? We re-engineered the process around performing the special periodic survey work to incorporate some of that work prior to the rig going off into the shipyard and getting its survey completed. By doing that while the rig's working, you have fewer days in the shipyard, which means fewer costs in the shipyard. And this is just a matter of folks thinking about it, looking at it differently when you're faced with oil prices that have been as low they have been in the most recent past."

So when Transocean approached cold stacking of ultra-deepwater and deepwater DP rigs for the first time, we actually worked together with the class society's DNV in particular to develop a methodology whereby we can cold-stack these rigs and stop the clock on the SPS. So we'll be able to successfully reactivate rigs without having to spend a significant amount of money on an SPS in addition to reactivation when the rig gets a contract. That being said, we recognize that whenever you come out of a downturn, your first contracts are rather short term, as we've seen, and day rates are rather low. So to you expect to get full payback on your reactivation is highly unlikely, which means you're going to push out that into the future. So the way we look at that is, and Terry, you can add to this, is we look at a reactivation in the context of where and who. So if this rig has the potential to be reactivated against a 6- or 12-month contract with potential follow-on work for another 2 or 3 customers in that area, that will get us the comfort and the confidence to be able to reactivate this rig at a payback that's not full for that first contract."

Following my prepared remarks, Mark will recap the quarterly financial performance, comment on our recent secured debt transaction, which further bolstered our strong liquidity position and provide our expectations for the fourth quarter. Then, Terry will provide an overview of the market and discuss some of the latest developments with our customers around the world.
As reported in yesterday's earnings release, the company generated adjusted net income of $93 million in the third quarter or $0.25 per diluted share on $903 million in revenue. We are again very pleased with our quarterly results as they reflect the organization's continued commitment to maximizing uptime and performance for our customers, while simultaneously streamlining and optimizing all facets of our business.
For the quarter, revenue efficiency, which was 96.5% in the prior quarter, improved to an extraordinary 100.7%. Needless to say, we are proud of this outcome as it validates the important work that our teams have been doing to redesign processes, rewrite and reformat procedures, enhance and expand our training programs and heighten our focus around procedural discipline. It is also a testament to our team's unwavering commitment to maximize uptime, which continues to differentiate Transocean in the eyes of our customers.
As such, I'd like to take this moment to recognize and personally thank our crews and our shore-based support personnel for driving this tremendous performance. I would also like to recognize and thank the team for delivering this result while simultaneously continuing to reduce our cost base. As a direct result of their efforts, our adjusted normalized EBITDA margin improved to 51%, despite a 4% sequential decline in revenue.
In addition to posting exceptionally strong operating results, we continue to take other actions necessary to further strengthen our liquidity. I'm pleased to report that in October, we raised $600 million by collateralizing one of the newest additions to our fleet, the Deepwater Thalassa, which commenced its 10-year contract with Shell earlier this year.
Speaking of new additions to the fleet, during the quarter, our newbuild team once again did a masterful job delivering another high-specification ultra-deepwater drillship, the Deepwater Conqueror. This rig is currently in route to the Gulf of Mexico, where it will commence its 5-year contract for Shell -- Chevron early next year. This will be the third world-class asset that we've added to the Transocean fleet this year, and our expectation is that the Deepwater Conqueror will perform at a similar level to the Deepwater Thalassa and the Deepwater Proteus, which both delivered impressive uptime results, averaging 98% in the third quarter, and have proven to be highly efficient drilling machines.
In addition to upgrading our ultra-deepwater drillship fleet with new assets, we are also excited about securing new work for one of our most capable harsh environment semisubmersibles. Just as the third quarter ended, we added a 15-month contract for the Transocean Barents to our backlog. The rig will be working for Suncor and is scheduled to commence operations in mid-2017. This is the second rig that we've reactivated for harsh environment work off the East Coast of Canada and serves as yet another indication that our customers place significant value on relationships, rig capability, technical support and operational performance. It also demonstrates that our customers are confident that our meticulous approach to preserving and maintaining stacked rigs will result in efficient reactivations and assets that perform as intended and when needed.
When preparing for reactivations, it's important to remember that crewing our rigs with the industry's most capable, experienced and motivated individuals is as important as preparing the rig itself. In fact, in recent discussions with our customers, they have placed greater emphasis on the reactivation of our crews than the reactivation of the rigs. Recognizing our customers' priorities, we are doing our best to retain our most seasoned talent and to maintain contact with former employees through outreach efforts with the expectation that we can keep them engaged and attract them back to Transocean as our rigs return to work.
Although we are proud of the outcomes that we produced in the quarter, many of you will know that during the month of August, we had an unfortunate incident with the Transocean Winner. While on tow from Norway, the rig encountered a strong late summer storm, which ultimately caused the grounding of the rig off the coast of Scotland. Fortunately, the incident did not result in any personal injuries and no environmental impacts were reported. And with the assistance of the local community, U.K. and Scottish government agencies and other partners, we safely refloated and moved the rig to nearby sheltered waters for evaluation and removed all debris from the grounding site.
The Winner has now arrived in Turkey, where it will be recycled. In addition to the Winner, we also made the decision to recycle 2 other mid-water floaters, the Transocean Driller and the Sedco 704. This brings our current total of floaters to be retired and recycled to 29. And as we have previously discussed, we will continue to actively assist our fleet within the context of the market and make prudent decisions to ensure Transocean continues to have the most competitive fleet in the industry.
Somewhat offsetting these rig retirements, since 2008, we have added 17 new high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters to our fleet. And with the Deepwater Pontus and the Deepwater Poseidon joining the fleet by early 2018, this number will soon increase to 19. We also have 2 more high-specification ultra-deepwater floaters that are under construction and currently scheduled for delivery in 2020.
Turning to the macro environment. In the last month, oil prices have rebounded somewhat, exceeding and holding above $50 per barrel until just recently. As was the case earlier in the year when oil touched $50 per barrel, our customers, primarily the independents and national oil companies, are once again approaching us with inquiries around rig availability and day rates. For the major integrated oil companies, we still think an oil price approaching $60 per barrel is required to compel them to commence new projects. However, as long as oil prices remain around $50 per barrel, we would expect them to engage in conversations around blend-and-extend opportunities, which would enable them to reduce their near-term obligations and secure additional term at discounted rates.
With 2016 coming to a close and most operators' budgets for next year nearing completion, our current thinking is that 2017 will represent the trough for spending in the offshore market. But looking forward, we're encouraged by the fact that global demand for oil continues to be resilient. Due to a lack of investment, the global supply of oil continues to decline. And given OPEC's recent announcement, ultimately, we might see an additional 1 million barrels per day of oil production taken offline. As such, it's becoming more likely that supply and demand will soon converge, leading to continued improvement in oil prices. Additionally, the entire offshore industry has worked to eliminate costs from the value chain, making deepwater projects economically viable at lower commodity prices. The combination of these factors continues to give us confidence in the long-term fundamentals of offshore exploration and development, and ultimately, in the recovery of the deepwater drilling industry. 
In the near term, based on current commodity prices and market conditions, we expect to see an increase in both interest and contracting activity as we move through 2017, with a stronger recovery forecasted in 2018. As we prepare for that eventual recovery, we continue to take the necessary steps to successfully navigate this downturn and position Transocean to remain the undisputed leader in the space. The aforementioned $600 million secured placement, combined with our $1.25 billion senior unsecured July bond offering and simultaneous tender offer, where we purchased approximately $1 billion of our outstanding debt, demonstrates our commitment and wherewithal to further strengthen our liquidity position and extend our runway.
Furthermore, following unitholder approval, we are expecting to close our acquisition of Transocean Partners this month. In addition to simplifying our administration and governance, reducing our costs and further improving our liquidity, this merger will provide Transocean Partners holders with the opportunity to rotate into Transocean's stock. 
In conclusion, I would like to once again thank all Transocean employees for delivering another great quarter. As a team, we delivered over 100% revenue efficiency. We reduced our OpEx sequentially by 19%. We reduced our SG&A by 7% and delivered adjusted normalized EBITDA margins of 51%. We also added $195 million to our cash balance, secured several new floater contracts and closed the secured financing transaction. Most importantly, we delivered these results while never losing sight of our most sacred responsibility, the safety of our operations and our people. 
I'll now hand the call over to Mark."

During today's call, I plan to briefly recap the third quarter results and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position, including the recent capital market transactions. I will also provide an update to our 201",1341,"Thank you, Jeremy, and good day to all. During today's call, I plan to briefly recap the third quarter results and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position, including the recent capital market transactions. I will also provide an update to our 2016 guidance and an early look at our cost expectations for 2017.
As said in our press release, for the third quarter of 2016, we reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $229 million or $0.62 per diluted share. These results include $136 million or $0.37 per diluted share in net favorable items, primarily associated with gains and the early retirement of debt and discrete tax benefits. Excluding these items, adjusted net income was $93 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
This amount includes costs of $21 million associated with the grounding, salvage and preparation for recycling of the Transocean Winner. We anticipate an additional charge of approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter related to this rig. We ended the third quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting cash flow from operations for the third quarter of $440 million, which includes approximately $70 million of working capital release.
I will now provide an update to our financial expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our fourth quarter 2016 revenue efficiency guidance remains at 95%. Other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 is expected to be between $170 million and $180 million, which includes the early termination of revenue for the Discoverer India and customer reimbursables.
Fourth quarter O&M expense is expected to be between $375 million and $385 million, consistent with activity and excludes the additional costs associated with the salvage and recycling of the Transocean Winner.
We expect fourth quarter G&A expenses to range between $40 million and $45 million, excluding restructuring costs. Fourth quarter net interest expense is expected to be between $100 million and $110 million, reflecting the repayment of our 5.05% senior notes due 2016 and our recent debt capital market transactions. Net interest expense includes capitalized interest and interest income. The fourth quarter 2016 annual effective tax rate is expected to be between 8% and 10%. This lower range considers changes in the jurisdictional mix of operating results.
Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $230 million. Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest for the fourth quarter, are expected to be approximately $350 million, mainly associated with the contracted newbuilds. We expect maintenance CapEx to be approximately $10 million. 
Now for an early look at 2017's preliminary cost expectations. We're in the midst of preparing our next year's annual budget and we'll provide greater detail regarding our 2017 expectations on our next earnings call. Operating and maintenance costs for 2017 are expected to be between 20% and 25% lower than full year 2016. We expect our overall reduced operating activity of our fleet to be partially offset by the full year effect of 3 ultra-deepwater newbuilds. At this time, we're committed to one reactivation in 2017, which is associated with the contract preparation and mobilization on the Transocean Barents. Our most recent fleet status report has been updated to include 2017 out-of-service time for each rig.
We expect our G&A expenses in 2017 to decline to between $145 million and $155 million, a reduction of approximately 10% year-on-year, reflecting the results of our restructuring and other cost-saving initiatives.
Capital expenditures for 2017 are anticipated to be approximately $450 million. This includes $400 million in newbuild CapEx, largely associated with the final shipyard payments on the Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon. Maintenance CapEx is forecasted to be approximately $50 million, reflecting one planned SPS as well as the reactivation of the Barents. You will note that our other service debt associated with special periodic surveys have decreased substantially as compared to prior years. This is further evidence of Transocean's process reengineering initiatives, whereby we perform certain survey-required activities while rigs are operating, minimizing the potential impact of our special periodic surveys.
Turning now to our financial position. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $137 million of debt at a cost of $134 million. As a reminder, since July 2015, we have repurchased debt with a face value of $869 million for $812 million, saving approximately $180 million in interest expense through the maturity of this debt.
This excludes the debt repurchase in conjunction with the July 2016 tender offer. Following the $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July, we accessed debt capital markets again in October, successfully placing $600 million of senior secured notes with a 2024 maturity. We received net proceeds of $583 million from this offering. The proceeds will be used partially to refinance the ultra-deepwater newbuild drillship, Deepwater Thalassa, which is working on a 10-year contract with Shell in the Gulf of Mexico.
We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our liquidity and strategically address our debt maturities. As you are well aware, we have a number of options available to us, including additional unsecured and secured debt. In this regard, the second of our 4 Shell-contracted drillships, the Deepwater Proteus, which commenced operations in May 2016, is also an ideal candidate for a secured financing transaction.
And finally, as a reminder, we issued $1.25 billion of priority guaranteed senior unsecured debt in July. In addition with -- in addition, we have full availability on our undrawn, unsecured $3 billion revolving credit facility, further enhancing our liquidity position. 
Now let me spend a few moments on the Transocean Partners transaction.
As you know, on July 31, 2016, we made an offer to purchase their publicly held common units. As stated in the proxy statements related to the special meeting of unitholders, this action was taken due to the increase in Transocean Partners' cost of capital and its inability to act as an alternative financing vehicle for Transocean. To date, all 3 major proxy advisers have published opinions supporting the transaction, and we look forward to a successful conclusion to the transaction. We expect this merger to generate important synergies and value creation, benefiting both our new and existing shareholders.
However, in the event the transaction is not consummated as expected, Transocean Partners will need to make some difficult decisions regarding its capital needs and adequacy of cash reserves. We recognize the current challenging market conditions and reduced cash flow, with fewer rigs forecasted to operate in 2017, and Transocean Partners needing to decide whether to warm or cold stack the DD3 if it's not recontracted by the time the contract expires in November. Costs associated with the mode of stacking can vary greatly as can reactivation costs. In order to appropriately plan for scenarios in which Transocean Partners' revenues may come from only 2 of its 3 assets, a significant portion of cash may be -- may need for -- to be reserved for operational and planning purposes, which may impact Transocean Partners' future cash distributions. Such impacts may include the elimination of the distribution to subordinated units owned by Transocean as well as a reduction in the distribution to common unitholders.
Turning now to our projected liquidity. We now expect liquidity at December 31, 2018, in the range of $3.6 billion to $4.1 billion, including the impact of the senior secured notes issued in October. Operating assumptions include revenue efficiency of 95%, a limited number of new contracts with day rates assumed to be at or near cash breakeven costs through 2017 with marginal day rate improvement in 2018, a net cash flow reduction of approximately $60 million associated with the termination of the Discoverer India, no speculative reactivations and the closure of the Transocean Partners merger after the unitholder approval. In 2018, we expect total CapEx of approximately $375 million. This includes approximately $130 million in newbuild CapEx and $245 million for maintenance CapEx.
This strong liquidity position, combined with our industry-leading contract backlog, positions us very well for the future. 
This concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Terry. Terry?"

With oil prices generally holding around the $50 mark during the quarter, we have experienced an increase in customer inquiries and engaged in more productive conversations as compared to the first half of the year.",925,"Thanks, Mark, and good day to everyone. With oil prices generally holding around the $50 mark during the quarter, we have experienced an increase in customer inquiries and engaged in more productive conversations as compared to the first half of the year. As a direct product of those conversations, we successfully executed several new contracts since the last earnings call, resulting in the addition of $214 million of contract backlog, bringing our 2016 total to $515 million. Year-to-date, we've announced 17 floater contracts resulting -- sorry, representing more than 1/3 of the global floater fixtures contracted to date. We continue to win more work than our competitors, and we fully expect to continue that trend as we hope to announce a few more contracts before the end of 2016. As Jeremy mentioned, we were pleased to announce that Suncor's development work for offshore Eastern Canada was awarded to our harsh-environment semi, the Transocean Barents. This 15-month contract added approximately $119 million to our already industry-leading backlog. 
After a brief reactivation and mobilization, the floater will commence operations in July 2017. With the Henry Goodrich starting its contract in the second quarter of this year, the Barents will be the second harsh-environment semi reactivated for another independent in Canada, increasing our operating base and positioning us for longer-term work in the region.
In the U.K. North Sea we are pleased that Hurricane Energy recently exercised options on the harsh-environment semisubmersible the Transocean Spitsbergen. This contract also has the potential for 2 additional options before moving to the Norwegian North Sea to begin operating for Repsol. 
Also in the North Sea, the mid-water floater Sedco 712 was awarded a 16-well contracts and a 1-well contract with Fairfield and ConocoPhillips, respectively, keeping her contracted until mid-2018. You may recall that the 16-well award was a very competitive tender, with 16 rigs offered and is another example of our ability to successfully execute against our competition. We see multiple opportunities for harsh-environment fleet in '17 and '18 as our customers are becoming more active in executing projects with creative commercial solutions and some improvement in access to capital.
Just last week, in Myanmar, the KG2 was awarded 3 appraisal wells plus 5 option wells for Woodside commencing in early 2017, following the conclusion of its current contract for Reliance in India. Should the options be exercised, the program duration is expected to be approximately 1 year. With this contract, we are now well positioned with an operating rig in the area to capture future work, which we see on the horizon with multiple customers. Unfortunately, some of this good news was offset last month when we received the early termination notice for the Discoverer India effective December 15, 2016. Per the terms of the agreement, we will be compensated through a lump sum payment of approximately $160 million. To be clear, this was a modest termination payment based on a contract executed early in 2008, which was convertible from 5 years to 10 years. This early termination payment was negotiated as part of the original contract, providing only for nominal payback after the first 5 years of operation. It is important to note that the remaining contracts in our backlog are either noncancelable or provide many make-whole provisions in the event of the early termination for convenience. For the contracts we have recently executed, we will receive at least 75% of our expected cash flow in the event of an early termination for convenience. While certainly disappointed by the cancellation, the India is a highly capable drillship which is well suited for some near-term opportunities that we are actively pursuing. Factoring in the impact of the cancellation and the addition of the new contracts, our backlog as of October 24 continues to be industry leading at $12.2 billion, which provides us far more visibility to future earnings and cash flow than any of our competitors. Of the $12.2 billion, 84% is contracted with IOCs, 8% contracted with the independents and 8% contracted with the NOCs.
Turning now to the global market. As of today, marketed floater utilization is down to 77%, with 59 rigs idle and 65 cold-stacked. Year-to-date, 45 floater fixtures have been announced, mostly in Asia, India, U.K., Norway and Canada with the majority being short-term work, except for Canada and India. Although commodity prices have been positive as spare capacity continues to diminish, we still need to see further improvement and stability in oil prices as we move forward. 
As a result of oil prices fluctuating in the $50 a barrel range, tendering looks to be picking up with respect to the independents and the NOCs. While the IOCs have greatly reduced development and production costs, we believe that $60 a barrel is needed to jump-start the sanction of their new programs. Additionally, new legislation in Brazil is expected to pave the way for international investment of some IOCs and the excitement in-country is infectious. Statoil, Chevron and Shell are already looking at their portfolio of drilling opportunities, and we expect to see a few wells being drilled as early as late '17. Our customers continue to view their deepwater assets as vital to their future production, knowing that the lack of investment, coupled with certain depletion in offshore drilling, is unsustainable. 
In conclusion, we will continue to position Transocean to increase our market-leading position as we press through the downturn, looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.
This concludes my overview of the market, so I will turn it over to Brad."

Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to last very long, and oil prices dip down into the mid-$40s again and those conversations start to abate. So I think if we can see oil prices hang around in that $50 a barrel range for a period of time, you will see activity pick up. And I think, first, in kind of that North Sea U.K. and Norway, we'll see more activity again in India, some in Asia Pacific. And actually, I think we can start to see some toward the end of the year in Brazil. So I think those are going to be kind of the hotspots moving forward. And I don't know if, Terry, if you want to add anything to that or..."

So if you think about the number of rigs we were running at the beginning of '16, then as rigs came off contract, they would go into some sort of a stacking mode. The number of rigs being run at the end of '16 is substantially less. So if you look at full year '16 costs and compare to full year '17, some of that 20% to 25% reduction is just going to be a matter of reduced activity. But as we discussed at conferences and previous calls, there's also several initiatives ongoing whereby we're looking at technical sourcing and strategic sourcing to drive down costs. The easy part of that is picking up the phone and calling your vendors and saying give me an extra 2% or 3%. Well, that's behind us now. Now it's doing things differently. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, particularly our SPS days for next year, and compare that to what we used to have 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, and it's substantially down. So what are we doing? We re-engineered the process around performing the special periodic survey work to incorporate some of that work prior to the rig going off into the shipyard and getting its survey completed. By doing that while the rig's working, you have fewer days in the shipyard, which means fewer costs in the shipyard. And this is just a matter of folks thinking about it, looking at it differently when you're faced with oil prices that have been as low they have been in the most recent past."

We were encouraged here recently when -- with the OPEC decision and the oil prices moving above $50 a barrel and staying there. We started to get far more interest from our customers at that point in time. And our belief is, whether right or wrong, that we will see oil start to move above $50 and stay there as we move through next year. And that will lead to more contracting activity. To be clear, that contracting activity is going to be very competitively priced, and it's going to be of short duration. And so it's not anything that's really going to be material but it's going to be at least get things moving. And so if we can see oil move even north of $50 and get closer to $60, then we start to get more activity. We start to get a little bit better pricing at that point in time.

To be clear, I said a -- start to see signs of more contracting activity in 2017 with a stronger recovery in 2018, not a strong recovery in 2018. So we expect this to be gradual. We expect to see, again, assuming oil prices tick above $50 a barrel and stay there next year, we certainly expect to see more contracting activity, again driven by independents and NOCs to start. And then if we can continue to see oil prices move up as we move through 2017, that would obviously lead to more work in 2018. And so that's really where we stand today. It's going to be a challenge to move pricing. But if we can start to see activity pick up, then hopefully in 2018, we start to see pricing move up and in '19 even more. But again, we need oil prices to help us to drive demand from our customers."

Thanks, Robin, good question. So when Transocean approached cold stacking of ultra-deepwater and deepwater DP rigs for the first time, we actually worked together with the class society's DNV in particular to develop a methodology whereby we can cold-stack these rigs and stop the clock on the SPS. So we'll be able to successfully reactivate rigs without having to spend a significant amount of money on an SPS in addition to reactivation when the rig gets a contract. That being said, we recognize that whenever you come out of a downturn, your first contracts are rather short term, as we've seen, and day rates are rather low. So to you expect to get full payback on your reactivation is highly unlikely, which means you're going to push out that into the future. So the way we look at that is, and Terry, you can add to this, is we look at a reactivation in the context of where and who. So if this rig has the potential to be reactivated against a 6- or 12-month contract with potential follow-on work for another 2 or 3 customers in that area, that will get us the comfort and the confidence to be able to reactivate this rig at a payback that's not full for that first contract."

And we're already in-country so I think that we'd be a natural competitor to be able to capture some of that work, so we like that. I think that the reality is that it's a plug-and-play environment with the jack-ups. And as you get movement in the commodity price, then these tenders start to come out.
