For both periods, we set new company records for revenue and adjusted earnings, and drove double-digit growth. We're the first firm in our sector to exceed $10 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in normalized EBITDA, and we obtained these milestones while making strategic gains across CBRE. 
Notably, our occupier outsourcing business is materially stronger with the acquisition of the Global Workplace Solutions business. We have an unrivaled ability to self performed facilities management services around the world. And capital markets, we made market share gains around the globe. We acquired 9 leading companies in 2015, enhancing our capabilities in energy management, retail data analytics, capital markets and consulting. 
We had our third straight year of outsized recruiting gains as hundreds of new senior brokerage and capital markets professionals, net of departures, elected to join our team. The average production of people joining our team is 3x higher than those who leave. We opened our 30th new state-of-the-art, alternative workplace office, providing our people with a collaborative and innovative work environment. 
Finally, we ended the year with a balance sheet that is stronger than at any time in recent history, highlighted by investment-grade credit ratings. We thank our more than 70,000 employees for an excellent year in 2015 and for their commitment to our clients. Now Jim will take you through our results in greater detail."

As you've seen in our press release, CBRE's growth in 2015 was outstanding. Revenue rose 20% to $10.9 billion, fee revenue increased 14% to $7.7 billion, normalized EBITDA rose 21% to $1.4 billion and adjusted EPS was up 22% to $2.05 this year. Profitability was strong with an 18.3% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue in 2015, up approximately 110 basis points from 2014. This performance was achieved in spite a significant headwinds from currency movements. 
Our 3 regional service segments achieved a 27% increase in normalized EBITDA with a margin on fee revenue of 16.5%, up 100 basis points for the year. Bob mentioned the strength of our balance sheet. Despite investing approximately $1.6 billion in 9 acquisition during the year, we ended 2015 with no outstanding borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, $470 million of available cash and short-term investments and net debt of just under 1.6x normalized EBITDA. 
Please turn to Slide 6 for a look at full year revenue growth by line of business. Our businesses continue to exhibit excellent broad-based momentum in 2015. Revenue from contractual sources totaled $6 billion. Contractual fee revenue was $2.9 billion, up 29% in local currency or 14% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasings surpassed $2.5 billion of global revenue, up 11% in local currency. 
Capital markets business, property sales and mortgage services exceeded $2.1 billion in revenue and achieved 20% growth in local currency. The multiyear shift towards a more stable recurring business mix continued in 2015. Contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 70%. 
Please turn to Slide 7 where we will shift our attention from the full-year to a view of our financial performance in Q4. Revenue and adjusted earnings growth for the quarter was very strong. Fee revenue improved 23% in local currency and 10% without the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This growth was achieved on top of an exceptionally strong Q4 2014 when revenue increased 28% versus Q4 2013. 
Normalized EBITDA for the quarter totaled $518 million, a 26% increase from last year's Q4 with 31% increase in local currency. Our profit margin also improved significantly. At 20.3%, our normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 130 basis points over prior year Q4. Adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.81 for the quarter. 
Q4 2015 normalized EBITDA reflects the following adjustments: $26 million of carried interest expense, which we will recognize in future periods when we record associated revenue. This allowing of timing of expense and revenue recognition. $24 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions; and $40 million incurred to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 8 where we will review Q4 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 17% in the Americas as every business line exhibited growth. In EMEA, fee revenue improved 36% as we saw healthy gains across the region, particularly in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, fee revenue rose 27% with Australia, Greater China and India setting the pace growth. 
Absent the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, fee revenue rose 9 [ph], 12% in EMEA and 11% in Asia Pacific. Normalized EBITDA increased 9% for the Americas, 45% for EMEA and 24% for Asia-Pacific. Q4 normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue for the 3 regions combined was 16.3%. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q4. All percentage increases are in local currency. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 73% of fee revenue for the quarter. Occupier outsourcing fee revenue more than doubled with the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. 
Excluding contributions from this acquisition, occupier outsourcing continued to exhibit strong double-digit growth with a 19% increase in fee revenue. Asset Services had a strong quarter. Fee revenues increased 12% with notable growth in EMEA and the Americas. Investment Management also has a strong quarter. Revenue rose 22%, driven by carried interest on property dispositions, reflecting strong returns generated for fund investors. 
Our evaluations business grew revenue 9%. Leasing revenue rose 8% growth in the United States, which reflects a solid performance on top of an exceptionally strong 28% year-to-year increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Global growth and leasing was paced by a 22% increase in Europe, notably France and the United Kingdom, as well as strong contributions from Canada and Mexico. 
Our capital markets business remained highly active globally, although growth rate slowed from earlier in the year. Global property sales rose 7% after accounting for a decline in market volumes from the United Kingdom. The global growth rate in Q4 excluding the United Kingdom was 13%. Investor interest in the United Kingdom remained strong with cap rates stable and rental rates increasing in Q4. But we are seeing capital migrate to Continental as local economies there strengthen and property yields are higher. 
In the United States, our sales revenues grew 10% as we once again gained significant market share according to RCA. Commercial mortgage services revenue increased 6%. As expected, gains from mortgage servicing rights with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises were flat as the agencies reached the regulatory caps on their lending. 
However, loan originations were higher with banks, conduits and other debt capital sources. Our global loan servicing portfolio totaled $135 billion at year end. 
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. Even without the benefit of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, 2015 was a record year in terms of occupier outsourcing contracts. We brought on board more new clients and importantly expanded our service scope for more existing clients than ever before. In addition, we continue to make meaningful inroads in Europe and Asia, as well as in key verticals like health care, data centers and life sciences. 
Feedback from our clients has exceeded our expectations and we are on course to materially complete client facing integration activities over the next 60 days. 
Please turn to Slide 11, regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue rose 22% in local currency and normalized EBITDA nearly doubled, fueled by $30 million of carried interest tied to significant returns for our clients on property dispositions. The strong performance of our investment programs relative to industry benchmarks continues to help us attract capital, new equity commitments totaled $7 billion in 2015. 
In Q4, Assets Under Management grew by $3 billion to $89 billion after $1.1 billion drag from currency movement. For the year, AUM was up $1.9 billion in local currency, but down $1.6 billion when converted into U.S. dollars. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. As anticipated, development services had a very strong quarter. Several large asset sales resulted in EBITDA of nearly $75 million for Q4. Development projects in process totaled $6.7 billion at year-end 2015, up $1.3 billion from 2014. The pipeline inventory totaled $3.6 billion, down $0.4 [ph] billion as projects converted to in process. 
Please turn to Slide 13. I will conclude my remarks by reiterating 3 points that highlight the financial strength of the business. Normalized EBITDA was up 21% for the year and 26% for the quarter. We achieved a margin on fee revenue of 18.3% for the year and our available liquidity exceeds $3 billion. 
Now please turn to Slide 14 as I turn the call back to Bob for closing remarks."

From all you've heard today, it should be clear that CBRE has a sustainable competitive advantage. Our leading global brand and strong culture help us to attract and keep tremendous talent in highly desirable clients. Investments in our platform, especially in technology and data analytics, are helping our people to create more value for these clients. Our revenue base is more stable and stickier than ever before. 
For 2016, we expect occupier outsourcing to continue its track record of strong performance. We anticipate low double-digit revenue growth this year before the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing revenue should increase at a high single-digit rate as we continue to gain market share. Our capital markets businesses, which consist of property sales and mortgage services, are most influenced by the financial markets and volumes can be hard to predict quarter-to-quarter. 
However, we believe that the strong fundamentals and the value that real estate offers relative to other asset classes will continue to draw global capital to real estate in 2016. We estimate our capital markets revenue will grow to rate in the mid to high single digits. Normalized EBITDA from our combined principal businesses, Global Investment Management and development services is anticipated to be flat to slightly down in 2016, reflecting a very strong 2015. 
The shift to a more stable recurring business mix will continue as our financial results include a full-year contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Even with this shift in business mix, in 2016, we expect our industry-leading margin on fee revenue to approximate 17%. While we are mindful of concerns about China's slowing growth and the effect of lower oil prices, fundamentals in our sector on solid footing. We're positioned for another strong year in 2016 but are maintaining flexibility in case the economy weakens. 
Our Outlook is based on economists consensus view that the global economy will maintain its modest rate of growth in 2016. We anticipate double-digit growth again this year, supported by continued gains in market share and expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.27 to $2.37 for 2016. This equates to a growth rate of 13% at the midpoint of our guidance. 
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

So I think that the businesses is just a different business than existed at that time. The other comment I would make is our balance sheet is a dramatically different balance sheet than existed at that time because we have enormous liquidity. We have very, very few -- very, very small amounts of maturities coming out for the next several years. So we are, I think nicely poised to take advantage of opportunities.

For both periods, we set new company records for revenue and adjusted earnings and drove double-digit growth. We're the first firm in our sector to exceed $10 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in normalized EBITDA, and we obtained these milestones while making strategic gains across CBRE.
Notably, our occupier outsourcing business is materially stronger with the acquisition of the Global Workplace Solutions business. We have an unrivaled ability to self-performed facilities management services around the world. In capital markets, we made market share gains around the globe. We acquired 9 leading companies in 2015, enhancing our capabilities in energy management, retail data analytics, capital markets and consulting.
We had our third straight year of outsized recruiting gains as hundreds of new senior brokerage and capital markets professionals, net of departures, elected to join our team. The average production of people joining our team is 3x higher than those who leave. We opened our 30th new state-of-the-art, alternative workplace office, providing our people with a collaborative and innovative work environment.
Finally, we ended the year with a balance sheet that is stronger than at any time in recent history, highlighted by investment grade credit ratings. We thank our more than 70,000 employees for an excellent year in 2015 and for their commitment to our clients. 
Now Jim will take you through our results in greater detail."

As you've seen in our press release, CBRE's growth in 2015 was outstanding: revenue rose 20% to $10.9 billion; fee revenue increased 14% to $7.7 billion; normalized EBITDA rose 21% to $1.4 billion; and adjusted EPS",1278,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As you've seen in our press release, CBRE's growth in 2015 was outstanding: revenue rose 20% to $10.9 billion; fee revenue increased 14% to $7.7 billion; normalized EBITDA rose 21% to $1.4 billion; and adjusted EPS was up 22% to $2.05 this year. Profitability was strong with an 18.3% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue in 2015, up approximately 110 basis points from 2014. This performance was achieved in spite of significant headwinds from currency movements. 
Our 3 regional service segments achieved a 27% increase in normalized EBITDA with a margin on fee revenue of 16.5%, up 100 basis points for the year. 
Bob mentioned the strength of our balance sheet. Despite investing approximately $1.6 billion in 9 acquisitions during the year, we ended 2015 with no outstanding borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, $470 million of available cash in short-term investments and net debt of just under 1.6x normalized EBITDA.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a look at full year revenue growth by line of business. Our businesses continue to exhibit excellent broad-based momentum in 2015. Revenue from contractual sources totaled $6 billion. Contractual fee revenue was $2.9 billion, up 29% in local currency or 14% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing surpassed $2.5 billion of global revenue, up 11% in local currency.
Capital markets business, property sales and mortgage services exceeded $2.1 billion in revenue and achieved 20% growth in local currency. The multiyear shift towards a more stable recurring business mix continued in 2015. Contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 70%.
Please turn to Slide 7, where we will shift our attention from the full year to a view of our financial performance in Q4. 
Revenue and adjusted earnings growth for the quarter was very strong. Fee revenue improved 23% in local currency and 10% without the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This growth was achieved on top of an exceptionally strong Q4 2014 when revenue increased 28% versus Q4 2013.
Normalized EBITDA for the quarter totaled $518 million, a 26% increase from last year's Q4, with 31% increase in local currency. Our profit margin also improved significantly. At 20.3%, our normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 130 basis points over prior year Q4. Adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.81 for the quarter.  
Q4 2015 normalized EBITDA reflects the following adjustments: $26 million of carried interest expense, which we will recognize in future periods when we record associated revenue. This aligns the timing of expense and revenue recognition; $24 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions; and $40 million incurred to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where we will review Q4 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 17% in the Americas as every business line exhibited growth. In EMEA, fee revenue improved 36% as we saw healthy gains across the region, particularly in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, fee revenue rose 27%, with Australia, Greater China and India setting the pace for growth.
Absent the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, fee revenue rose 12% in EMEA and 11% in Asia Pacific. Normalized EBITDA increased 9% for the Americas, 45% for EMEA and 24% for Asia Pacific. Q4 normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue for the 3 regions combined was 16.3%.
Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q4. All percentage increases are in local currency. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 73% of fee revenue for the quarter. Occupier outsourcing fee revenue more than doubled with the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions.
Excluding contributions from this acquisition, occupier outsourcing continued to exhibit strong double-digit growth with a 19% increase in fee revenue. Asset Services had a strong quarter. Fee revenues increased 12% with notable growth in EMEA and the Americas. Investment Management also had a strong quarter. Revenue rose 22%, driven by carried interest on property dispositions, reflecting strong returns generated for fund investors.
Our Evaluations business grew revenue 9%. Leasing revenue rose 8% growth in the United States, which reflects a solid performance on top of an exceptionally strong 28% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Global growth and leasing was paced by a 22% increase in Europe, notably France and the United Kingdom, as well as strong contributions from Canada and Mexico.
Our capital markets business remained highly active globally, although growth rate slowed from earlier in the year. Global property sales rose 7% after accounting for a decline in market volumes from the United Kingdom. The global growth rate in Q4, excluding the United Kingdom was 13%. Investor interest in the United Kingdom remained strong, with cap rates stable and rental rates increasing in Q4, but we are seeing capital migrate to Continental Europe as local economies there strengthen and property yields are higher.
In the United States, our sales revenues grew 10% as we once again gained significant market share according to RCA. Commercial mortgage services revenue increased 6%. As expected, gains from mortgage servicing rights with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises were flat as the agencies reached the regulatory caps on their lending.
However, loan originations were higher with banks, conduits and other debt capital sources. Our global loan servicing portfolio totaled $135 billion at year-end.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. Even without the benefit of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, 2015 was a record year in terms of occupier outsourcing contracts. We brought on board more new clients and importantly expanded our service scope for more existing clients than ever before. In addition, we continue to make meaningful inroads in Europe and Asia as well as in key verticals like healthcare, data centers and life sciences.
Feedback from our clients has exceeded our expectations, and we are on course to materially complete client facing integration activities over the next 60 days.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue rose 22% in local currency and normalized EBITDA nearly doubled, fueled by $30 million of carried interest tied to significant returns for our clients on property dispositions. The strong performance of our investment programs relative to industry benchmarks continues to help us attract capital. New equity commitments totaled $7 billion in 2015. 
In Q4, Assets Under Management grew by $3 billion to $89 billion after $1.1 billion drag from currency movement. For the year, AUM was up $1.9 billion in local currency, but down $1.6 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. As anticipated, Development Services had a very strong quarter. Several large asset sales resulted in EBITDA of nearly $75 million for Q4. Development projects in-process totaled $6.7 billion at year-end 2015, up $1.3 billion from 2014. The pipeline inventory totaled $3.6 billion, down $0.4 billion as projects converted to in-process. 
Please turn to Slide 13. I will conclude my remarks by reiterating 3 points that highlight the financial strength of the business. Normalized EBITDA was up 21% for the year and 26% for the quarter. We achieved a margin on fee revenue of 18.3% for the year, and our available liquidity exceeds $3 billion. 
Now please turn to Slide 14 as I turn the call back to Bob for closing remarks."

From all you've heard today, it should be clear that CBRE has a sustainable competitive advantage. Our leading global brand and strong culture help us to attract and keep tremendous talent in highly desirable clients. Investments in our platform, especially in technology and data analytics, are helping our people to create more value for these clients. Our revenue base is more stable and stickier than ever before.
For 2016, we expect occupier outsourcing to continue its track record of strong performance. We anticipate low double-digit revenue growth this year before the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing revenue should increase at a high single-digit rate as we continue to gain market share. Our capital markets businesses, which consist of property sales and mortgage services, are most influenced by the financial markets, and volumes can be hard to predict quarter-to-quarter. 
However, we believe that the strong fundamentals and the value that real estate offers relative to other asset classes will continue to draw global capital to real estate in 2016. We estimate our capital markets revenue will grow to rate in the mid- to high single digits. Normalized EBITDA from our combined principal businesses, Global Investment Management and Development Services is anticipated to be flat to slightly down in 2016, reflecting a very strong 2015.
The shift to a more stable recurring business mix will continue as our financial results include a full year contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Even with this shift in business mix, in 2016, we expect our industry-leading margin on fee revenue to approximate 17%. While we are mindful of concerns about China's slowing growth and the effect of lower oil prices, fundamentals in our sector remain on solid footing. We're positioned for another strong year in 2016, but are maintaining flexibility in case the economy weakens.
Our outlook is based on economists consensus view that the global economy will maintain its modest rate of growth in 2016. We anticipate double-digit growth again this year supported by continued gains in market share and expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.27 to $2.37 for 2016. This equates to a growth rate of 13% at the midpoint of our guidance.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

Capital markets, which is the piece with more variability, is more economically sensitive, is a much smaller part of the overall business; the contractual revenues, in particular, asset management and facility management, generally are either stable; or in the case of Asset Services, countercyclical, make up a much, much larger percentage of the business. And that's growing and will continue to grow as the results -- as the acquisition shows up in our full year numbers. So I think the business is just a different business than existed at that time. The other comment I would make is our balance sheet is a dramatically different balance sheet than existed at that time because we have enormous liquidity. We have very, very few -- very, very small amounts of maturities coming out for the next several years. So we are, I think, nicely poised to take advantage of opportunities. There are parts of our business that will be impacted if we have -- if we go into a recession, but overall, I think, we'll see tremendous opportunities to take advantage of as well."

For both periods, we set new company records for revenue and adjusted earnings and drove double-digit growth. We're the first firm in our sector to exceed $10 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in normalized EBITDA, and we attained these milestones while making strategic gains across CBRE.
Notably, our occupier outsourcing business is materially stronger with the acquisition of the Global Workplace Solutions business. We have an unrivaled ability to self-performed facilities management services around the world. In capital markets, we made market share gains around the globe. We acquired 9 leading companies in 2015, enhancing our capabilities in energy management, retail data analytics, capital markets and consulting.
We had our third straight year of outsized recruiting gains as hundreds of new senior brokerage and capital markets professionals, net of departures, elected to join our team. The average production of people joining our team is 3x higher than those who leave. We opened our 30th new state-of-the-art, alternative workplace office, providing our people with a collaborative and innovative work environment.
Finally, we ended the year with a balance sheet that is stronger than at any time in recent history, highlighted by investment grade credit ratings. We thank our more than 70,000 employees for an excellent year in 2015 and for their commitment to our clients. 
Now Jim will take you through our results in greater detail."

As you've seen in our press release, CBRE's growth in 2015 was outstanding: revenue rose 20% to $10.9 billion; fee revenue increased 14% to $7.7 billion; normalized EBITDA rose 21% to $1.4 billion; and adjusted EPS",1284,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As you've seen in our press release, CBRE's growth in 2015 was outstanding: revenue rose 20% to $10.9 billion; fee revenue increased 14% to $7.7 billion; normalized EBITDA rose 21% to $1.4 billion; and adjusted EPS was up 22% to $2.05 this year. Profitability was strong with an 18.3% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue in 2015, up approximately 110 basis points from 2014. This performance was achieved in spite of significant headwinds from currency movements. 
Our 3 regional service segments achieved a 27% increase in normalized EBITDA with a margin on fee revenue of 16.5%, up 100 basis points for the year. 
Bob mentioned the strength of our balance sheet. Despite investing approximately $1.6 billion in 9 acquisitions during the year, we ended 2015 with no outstanding borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, $470 million of available cash in short-term investments and net debt of just under 1.6x normalized EBITDA.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a look at full year revenue growth by line of business. Our businesses continued to exhibit excellent broad-based momentum in 2015. Revenue from contractual sources totaled $6 billion. Contractual fee revenue was $2.9 billion, up 29% in local currency or 14% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing surpassed $2.5 billion of global revenue, up 11% in local currency.
The Capital markets business, property sales and mortgage services exceeded $2.1 billion in revenue and achieved 20% growth in local currency. The multiyear shift towards a more stable recurring business mix continued in 2015. Contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 70%.
Please turn to Slide 7, where we will shift our attention from the full year to a review of our financial performance in Q4. 
Revenue and adjusted earnings growth for the quarter was very strong. Fee revenue improved 23% in local currency and 10% without the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This growth was achieved on top of an exceptionally strong Q4 2014 when revenue increased 28% versus Q4 2013.
Normalized EBITDA for the quarter totaled $518 million, a 26% increase from last year's Q4, with 31% increase in local currency. Our profit margin also improved significantly. At 20.3%, our normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 130 basis points over prior year Q4. Adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.81 for the quarter.  
Q4 2015 normalized EBITDA reflects the following adjustments: $26 million of carried interest expense, which we will recognize in future periods when we record associated revenue. This aligns with timing of expense and revenue recognition; $24 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions; and $40 million incurred to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where we will review Q4 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 17% in the Americas as every business line exhibited growth. In EMEA, fee revenue improved 36% as we saw healthy gains across the region, particularly in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, fee revenue rose 27%, with Australia, Greater China and India setting the pace for growth.
Absent the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, fee revenue rose 9% in the Americas, 12% in EMEA and 11% in Asia Pacific. Normalized EBITDA increased 9% for the Americas, 45% for EMEA and 24% for Asia Pacific. Q4 normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue for the 3 regions combined was 16.3%.
Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q4. All percentage increases are in local currency. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 73% of fee revenue for the quarter. Occupier outsourcing fee revenue more than doubled with the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions.
Excluding contributions from this acquisition, occupier outsourcing continued to exhibit strong double-digit growth with a 19% increase in fee revenue. Asset Services had a strong quarter. Fee revenues increased 12% with notable growth in EMEA and the Americas. Investment Management also had a strong quarter. Revenue rose 22%, driven by carried interest on property dispositions, reflecting strong returns generated for fund investors.
Our Evaluations business grew revenue 9%. Leasing revenue rose 8% growth in the United States, which reflects a solid performance on top of an exceptionally strong 28% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Global growth and leasing was paced by a 22% increase in Europe, notably France and the United Kingdom, as well as strong contributions from Canada and Mexico.
Our capital markets business remained highly active globally, although growth rates slowed from earlier in the year. Global property sales rose 7% after accounting for a decline in market volumes from the United Kingdom. The global growth rate in Q4, excluding the United Kingdom was 13%. Investor interest in the United Kingdom remained strong, with cap rates stable and rental rates increasing in Q4, but we are seeing capital migrate to Continental Europe as local economies there strengthen and property yields are higher.
In the United States, our sales revenues grew 10% as we once again gained significant market share according to RCA. Commercial mortgage services revenue increased 6%. As expected, gains from mortgage servicing rights with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises were flat as the agencies reached the regulatory caps on their lending.
However, loan originations were higher with banks, conduits and other debt capital sources. Our global loan servicing portfolio totaled $135 billion at year-end.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. Even without the benefit of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, 2015 was a record year in terms of occupier outsourcing contracts. We brought on board more new clients and importantly expanded our service scope for more existing clients than ever before. In addition, we continue to make meaningful inroads in Europe and Asia as well as in key verticals like healthcare, data centers and life sciences.
Feedback from our clients has exceeded our expectations, and we are on course to materially complete client facing integration activities over the next 60 days.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue rose 22% in local currency and normalized EBITDA nearly doubled, fueled by $30 million of carried interest tied to significant returns for our clients on property dispositions. The strong performance of our investment programs relative to industry benchmarks continues to help us attract capital. New equity commitments totaled $7 billion in 2015. 
In Q4, Assets Under Management grew by $3 billion to $89 billion after a $1.1 billion drag from currency movement. For the year, AUM was up $1.9 billion in local currency, but down $1.6 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. As anticipated, Development Services had a very strong quarter. Several large asset sales resulted in EBITDA of nearly $75 million for Q4. Development projects in-process totaled $6.7 billion at year-end 2015, up $1.3 billion from 2014. The pipeline inventory totaled $3.6 billion, down $0.4 billion as projects converted to in-process. 
Please turn to Slide 13. I will conclude my remarks by reiterating 3 points that highlight the financial strength of the business. Normalized EBITDA was up 21% for the year and 26% for the quarter. We achieved a margin on fee revenue of 18.3% for the year, and our available liquidity exceeds $3 billion. 
Now please turn to Slide 14 as I turn the call back to Bob for closing remarks."

From all you've heard today, it should be clear that CBRE has a sustainable competitive advantage. Our leading global brand and strong culture help us to attract and keep tremendous talent in highly desirable clients. Investments in our platform, especially in technology and data analytics, are helping our people to create more value for these clients. Our revenue base is more stable and stickier than ever before.
For 2016, we expect occupier outsourcing to continue its track record of strong performance. We anticipate low double-digit revenue growth this year before the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing revenue should increase at a high single-digit rate as we continue to gain market share. Our capital markets businesses, which consist of property sales and mortgage services, are most influenced by the financial markets, and volumes can be hard to predict quarter-to-quarter. 
However, we believe that the strong fundamentals and the value that real estate offers relative to other asset classes will continue to draw global capital to real estate in 2016. We estimate our capital markets revenue will grow to rate in the mid- to high single digits. Normalized EBITDA from our combined principal businesses, Global Investment Management and Development Services is anticipated to be flat to slightly down in 2016, reflecting a very strong 2015.
The shift to a more stable recurring business mix will continue as our financial results include a full year contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Even with this shift in business mix, in 2016, we expect our industry-leading margin on fee revenue to approximate 17%. While we are mindful of concerns about China's slowing growth and the effect of lower oil prices, fundamentals in our sector remain on solid footing. We're positioned for another strong year in 2016, but are maintaining flexibility in case the economy weakens.
Our outlook is based on economists consensus view that the global economy will maintain its modest rate of growth in 2016. We anticipate double-digit growth again this year supported by continued gains in market share and expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.27 to $2.37 for 2016. This equates to a growth rate of 13% at the midpoint of our guidance.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

And that's growing and will continue to grow as the results -- as the acquisition shows up in our full year numbers. So I think the business is just a different business than existed at that time. The other comment I would make is our balance sheet is a dramatically different balance sheet than existed at that time because we have enormous liquidity. We have very, very few -- very, very small amounts of maturities coming out for the next several years. So we are, I think, nicely poised to take advantage of opportunities.

For both periods, we set new company records for revenue and adjusted earnings and drove double-digit growth. We're the first firm in our sector to exceed $10 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in normalized EBITDA, and we attained these milestones while making strategic gains across CBRE.
Notably, our occupier outsourcing business is materially stronger with the acquisition of the Global Workplace Solutions business. We have an unrivaled ability to self-performed facilities management services around the world. In capital markets, we made market share gains around the globe. We acquired 9 leading companies in 2015, enhancing our capabilities in energy management, retail data analytics, capital markets and consulting.
We had our third straight year of outsized recruiting gains as hundreds of new senior brokerage and capital markets professionals, net of departures, elected to join our team. The average production of people joining our team is 3x higher than those who leave. We opened our 30th new state-of-the-art, alternative workplace office, providing our people with a collaborative and innovative work environment.
Finally, we ended the year with a balance sheet that is stronger than at any time in recent history, highlighted by investment grade credit ratings. We thank our more than 70,000 employees for an excellent year in 2015 and for their commitment to our clients. 
Now Jim will take you through our results in greater detail."

As you've seen in our press release, CBRE's growth in 2015 was outstanding: revenue rose 20% to $10.9 billion; fee revenue increased 14% to $7.7 billion; normalized EBITDA rose 21% to $1.4 billion; and adjusted EPS",1284,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As you've seen in our press release, CBRE's growth in 2015 was outstanding: revenue rose 20% to $10.9 billion; fee revenue increased 14% to $7.7 billion; normalized EBITDA rose 21% to $1.4 billion; and adjusted EPS was up 22% to $2.05 this year. Profitability was strong with an 18.3% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue in 2015, up approximately 110 basis points from 2014. This performance was achieved in spite of significant headwinds from currency movements. 
Our 3 regional service segments achieved a 27% increase in normalized EBITDA with a margin on fee revenue of 16.5%, up 100 basis points for the year. 
Bob mentioned the strength of our balance sheet. Despite investing approximately $1.6 billion in 9 acquisitions during the year, we ended 2015 with no outstanding borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, $470 million of available cash in short-term investments and net debt of just under 1.6x normalized EBITDA.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a look at full year revenue growth by line of business. Our businesses continued to exhibit excellent broad-based momentum in 2015. Revenue from contractual sources totaled $6 billion. Contractual fee revenue was $2.9 billion, up 29% in local currency or 14% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing surpassed $2.5 billion of global revenue, up 11% in local currency.
The Capital markets business, property sales and mortgage services exceeded $2.1 billion in revenue and achieved 20% growth in local currency. The multiyear shift towards a more stable recurring business mix continued in 2015. Contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 70%.
Please turn to Slide 7, where we will shift our attention from the full year to a review of our financial performance in Q4. 
Revenue and adjusted earnings growth for the quarter was very strong. Fee revenue improved 23% in local currency and 10% without the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This growth was achieved on top of an exceptionally strong Q4 2014 when revenue increased 28% versus Q4 2013.
Normalized EBITDA for the quarter totaled $518 million, a 26% increase from last year's Q4, with 31% increase in local currency. Our profit margin also improved significantly. At 20.3%, our normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 130 basis points over prior year Q4. Adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.81 for the quarter. 
Q4 2015 normalized EBITDA reflects the following adjustments: $26 million of carried interest expense, which we will recognize in future periods when we record associated revenue. This aligns with timing of expense and revenue recognition; $24 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions; and $40 million incurred to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where we will review Q4 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 17% in the Americas as every business line exhibited growth. In EMEA, fee revenue improved 36% as we saw healthy gains across the region, particularly in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, fee revenue rose 27%, with Australia, Greater China and India setting the pace for growth.
Absent the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, fee revenue rose 9% in the Americas, 12% in EMEA and 11% in Asia Pacific. Normalized EBITDA increased 9% for the Americas, 45% for EMEA and 24% for Asia Pacific. Q4 normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue for the 3 regions combined was 16.3%.
Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q4. All percentage increases are in local currency. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 73% of fee revenue for the quarter. Occupier outsourcing fee revenue more than doubled with the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions.
Excluding contributions from this acquisition, occupier outsourcing continued to exhibit strong double-digit growth with a 19% increase in fee revenue. Asset Services had a strong quarter. Fee revenues increased 12% with notable growth in EMEA and the Americas. Investment Management also had a strong quarter. Revenue rose 22%, driven by carried interest on property dispositions, reflecting strong returns generated for fund investors.
Our Evaluations business grew revenue 9%. Leasing revenue rose 8% growth in the United States, which reflects a solid performance on top of an exceptionally strong 28% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Global growth and leasing was paced by a 22% increase in Europe, notably France and the United Kingdom as well as strong contributions from Canada and Mexico.
Our capital markets business remained highly active globally, although growth rates slowed from earlier in the year. Global property sales rose 7% after accounting for a decline in market volumes from the United Kingdom. The global growth rate in Q4, excluding the United Kingdom was 13%. Investor interest in the United Kingdom remained strong, with cap rates stable and rental rates increasing in Q4, but we are seeing capital migrate to Continental Europe as local economies there strengthen and property yields are higher.
In the United States, our sales revenues grew 10% as we once again gained significant market share according to RCA. Commercial mortgage services revenue increased 6%. As expected, gains from mortgage servicing rights with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises were flat as the agencies reached the regulatory caps on their lending.
However, loan originations were higher with banks, conduits and other debt capital sources. Our global loan servicing portfolio totaled $135 billion at year-end.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. Even without the benefit of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, 2015 was a record year in terms of occupier outsourcing contracts. We brought on board more new clients and importantly expanded our service scope for more existing clients than ever before. In addition, we continue to make meaningful inroads in Europe and Asia as well as in key verticals like healthcare, data centers and life sciences.
Feedback from our clients has exceeded our expectations, and we are on course to materially complete client facing integration activities over the next 60 days.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue rose 22% in local currency and normalized EBITDA nearly doubled, fueled by $30 million of carried interest tied to significant returns for our clients on property dispositions. The strong performance of our investment programs relative to industry benchmarks continues to help us attract capital. New equity commitments totaled $7 billion in 2015. 
In Q4, Assets Under Management grew by $3 billion to $89 billion after a $1.1 billion drag from currency movement. For the year, AUM was up $1.9 billion in local currency, but down $1.6 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. As anticipated, Development Services had a very strong quarter. Several large asset sales resulted in EBITDA of nearly $75 million for Q4. Development projects in-process totaled $6.7 billion at year-end 2015, up $1.3 billion from 2014. The pipeline inventory totaled $3.6 billion, down $0.4 billion as projects converted to in-process. 
Please turn to Slide 13. I will conclude my remarks by reiterating 3 points that highlight the financial strength of the business. Normalized EBITDA was up 21% for the year and 26% for the quarter. We achieved a margin on fee revenue of 18.3% for the year, and our available liquidity exceeds $3 billion. 
Now please turn to Slide 14 as I turn the call back to Bob for closing remarks."

Our revenue base is more stable and stickier than ever before.
For 2016, we expect occupier outsourcing to continue its track record of strong performance. We anticipate low double-digit revenue growth this year before the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing revenue should increase at a high single-digit rate as we continue to gain market share. Our capital markets businesses, which consist of property sales and mortgage services, are most influenced by the financial markets, and volumes can be hard to predict quarter-to-quarter. 
However, we believe that the strong fundamentals and the value that real estate offers relative to other asset classes will continue to draw global capital to real estate in 2016. We estimate our capital markets revenue will grow to rate in the mid- to high single digits. Normalized EBITDA from our combined principal businesses, Global Investment Management and Development Services is anticipated to be flat to slightly down in 2016, reflecting a very strong 2015.
The shift to a more stable recurring business mix will continue as our financial results include a full year contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Even with this shift in business mix, in 2016, we expect our industry-leading margin on fee revenue to approximate 17%. While we are mindful of concerns about China's slowing growth and the effect of lower oil prices, fundamentals in our sector remain on solid footing. We're positioned for another strong year in 2016, but are maintaining flexibility in case the economy weakens.
Our outlook is based on economists consensus view that the global economy will maintain its modest rate of growth in 2016. We anticipate double-digit growth again this year supported by continued gains in market share and expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.27 to $2.37 for 2016. This equates to a growth rate of 13% at the midpoint of our guidance.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

And that's growing and will continue to grow as the results -- as the acquisition shows up in our full year numbers. So I think the business is just a different business than existed at that time. The other comment I would make is our balance sheet is a dramatically different balance sheet than existed at that time because we have enormous liquidity. We have very, very few -- very, very small amounts of maturities coming out for the next several years. So we are, I think, nicely poised to take advantage of opportunities.

For both periods, we set new company records for revenue and adjusted earnings and drove double-digit growth. We're the first firm in our sector to exceed $10 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in normalized EBITDA, and we attained these milestones while making strategic gains across CBRE. Notably, our occupier outsourcing business is materially stronger with the acquisition of the Global Workplace Solutions business. We have an unrivaled ability to self-perform facilities management services around the world. 
In capital markets, we made market share gains around the globe. We acquired 9 leading companies in 2015, enhancing our capabilities in energy management, retail data analytics, capital markets and consulting. We had our third straight year of outsized recruiting gains as hundreds of new senior brokerage and capital markets professionals, net of departures, elected to join our team. The average production of people joining our team is 3x higher than those who leave. We opened our 30th new state-of-the-art alternative workplace office, providing our people with a collaborative and innovative work environment.
Finally, we ended the year with a balance sheet that is stronger than at any time in recent history, highlighted by investment grade credit ratings. We thank our more than 70,000 employees for an excellent year in 2015 and for their commitment to our clients. 
Now Jim will take you through our results in greater detail."

Please turn to Slide 5.

Profitability was strong with an 18.3% normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue in 2015, up approximately 110 basis points from 2014. This performance was achieved in spite of significant headwinds from currency movements. Our 3 regional service segments achieved a 27% increase in normalized EBITDA with a margin on fee revenue of 16.5%, up 100 basis points for the year. Bob mentioned the strength of our balance sheet. Despite investing approximately $1.6 billion in 9 acquisitions during the year, we ended 2015 with no outstanding borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, $470 million of available cash and short-term investments and net debt of just under 1.6x normalized EBITDA.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a look at full year revenue growth by line of business. Our businesses continued to exhibit excellent broad-based momentum in 2015. Revenue from contractual sources totaled $6 billion. Contractual fee revenue was $2.9 billion, up 29% in local currency or 14% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing surpassed $2.5 billion of global revenue, up 11% in local currency. The capital markets business, property sales and mortgage services exceeded $2.1 billion in revenue and achieved 20% growth in local currency. The multiyear shift towards a more stable recurring business mix continued in 2015. Contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 70%.
Please turn to Slide 7, where we will shift our attention from the full year to a review of our financial performance in Q4. Revenue and adjusted earnings growth for the quarter was very strong. Fee revenue improved 23% in local currency and 10% without the contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This growth was achieved on top of an exceptionally strong Q4 2014 when revenue increased 28% versus Q4 2013. Normalized EBITDA for the quarter totaled $518 million, a 26% increase from last year's Q4 or a 31% increase in local currency. Our profit margin also improved significantly. At 20.3%, our normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 130 basis points over prior year Q4. Adjusted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.81 for the quarter. Q4 2015 normalized EBITDA reflects the following adjustments. $26 million of carried interest expense, which we will recognize in future periods when we record associated revenue. This aligns the timing of expense and revenue recognition. $24 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions and $40 million incurred to eliminate costs to enhance margins going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 8, where we will review Q4 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 17% in the Americas as every business line exhibited growth. In EMEA, fee revenue improved 36% as we saw healthy gains across the region, particularly in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, fee revenue rose 27%, with Australia, Greater China and India setting the pace for growth. Absent the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, fee revenue rose 9% in the Americas, 12% in EMEA and 11% in Asia Pacific. Normalized EBITDA increased 9% for the Americas, 45% for EMEA and 24% for Asia Pacific. Q4 normalized EBITDA margin on fee revenue for the 3 regions combined was 16.3%.
Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q4. All percentage increases are in local currency. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 73% of fee revenue for the quarter. Occupier outsourcing fee revenue more than doubled with the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. Excluding contributions from this acquisition, occupier outsourcing continue to exhibit strong double-digit growth with a 19% increase in fee revenue. Asset Services had a strong quarter. Fee revenues increased 12% with notable growth in EMEA and the Americas. Investment Management also had a strong quarter. Revenue rose 22%, driven by carried interest on property dispositions, reflecting strong returns generated for fund investors.
Our valuations business grew revenue 9%. Leasing revenue rose 8% globally. This was muted by 4% growth in the United States, which reflects a solid performance on top of an exceptionally strong 28% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of 2014. Global growth in leasing was paced by 22% increase in Europe, notably France and the United Kingdom as well as strong contributions from Canada and Mexico.
Our capital markets business remained highly active globally, although growth rates slowed from earlier in the year. Global property sales rose 7% after accounting for a decline in market volumes from the United Kingdom. The global growth rate in Q4, excluding the United Kingdom, was 13%. Investor interest in the United Kingdom remained strong, with cap rates stable and rental rates increasing in Q4, but we are seeing capital migrate to Continental Europe as local economies there strengthen and property yields are higher. In the United States, our sales revenues grew 10% as we once again gained significant market share according to RCA. 
Commercial mortgage services revenue increased 6%. As expected, gains from mortgage servicing rights with the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises were flat as the agencies reached the regulatory caps on their lending. However, loan originations were higher with banks, conduits and other debt capital sources. Our global loan servicing portfolio totaled $135 billion at year-end.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. Even without the benefit of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business, 2015 was a record year in terms of occupier outsourcing contracts. We brought on board more new clients, and importantly, expanded our service scope for more existing clients than ever before. In addition, we continue to make meaningful inroads in Europe and Asia as well as in key verticals like healthcare, data centers and life sciences. Feedback from our clients has exceeded our expectations, and we are on course to materially complete client-facing integration activities over the next 60 days.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Revenue rose 22% in local currency and normalized EBITDA nearly doubled, fueled by $30 million of carried interest tied to significant returns for our clients on property dispositions. The strong performance of our investment programs relative to industry benchmarks continues to help us attract capital. New equity commitments totaled $7 billion in 2015. In Q4, assets under management grew by $3 billion to $89 billion after a $1.1 billion drag from currency movement. For the year, AUM was up $1.9 billion in local currency, but down $1.6 billion when converted into U.S. dollars.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Development Services segment. As anticipated, Development Services had a very strong quarter. Several large asset sales resulted in EBITDA of nearly $75 million for Q4. Development projects in process totaled $6.7 billion at year-end 2015, up $1.3 billion from 2014. The pipeline inventory totaled $3.6 billion, down $0.4 billion as projects converted to in process. 
Please turn to Slide 13. I will conclude my remarks by reiterating 3 points that highlight the financial strength of the business. Normalized EBITDA was up 21% for the year and 26% for the quarter. We achieved a margin on fee revenue of 18.3% for the year, and our available liquidity exceeds $3 billion. 
Now please turn to Slide 14 as I turn the call back to Bob for closing remarks."

From all you've heard today, it should be clear that CBRE has a sustainable competitive advantage. Our leading global brand and strong culture help us to attract and keep tremendous talent and highly desirable clients. Investments in our platform, especially in technology and data analytics, are helping our people to create more value for these clients. Our revenue base is more stable and stickier than ever before.
For 2016, we expect occupier outsourcing to continue its track record of strong performance. We anticipate low double-digit revenue growth this year before the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing revenue should increase at a high single-digit rate as we continue to gain market share. Our capital markets businesses, which consists of property sales and mortgage services, are most influenced by the financial markets, and volumes can be hard to predict quarter-to-quarter. However, we believe that the strong fundamentals and the value that real estate offers relative to other asset classes will continue to draw global capital to real estate in 2016. We estimate our capital markets revenue will grow at a rate in the mid- to high single digits. 
Normalized EBITDA from our combined principal businesses, Global Investment Management and Development Services, is anticipated to be flat to slightly down in 2016, reflecting a very strong 2015. The shift to a more stable recurring business mix will continue as our financial results include a full year contribution from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Even with this shift in business mix, in 2016, we expect our industry-leading margin on fee revenue to approximate 17%. While we are mindful of concerns about China's slowing growth and the effect of lower oil prices, fundamentals in our sector remain on solid footing. We're positioned for another strong year in 2016, but are maintaining flexibility in case the economy weakens.
Our outlook is based on economists' consensus view that the global economy will maintain its modest rate of growth in 2016. We anticipate double-digit growth again this year supported by continued gains in market share and expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.27 to $2.37 for 2016. This equates to a growth rate of 13% at the midpoint of our guidance.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

So I think the businesses is just a different business than existed at that time. The other comment I would make is that our balance sheet is a dramatically different balance sheet than existed at that time because we have enormous liquidity. We have very, very few -- very, very small amounts of maturities coming out for the next several years. So we are, I think, nicely poised to take advantage of opportunities.

CBRE started 2016 with very strong performance. We again logged healthy double-digit increases in revenue and adjusted earnings per share despite significant and negative effects from currency hedges in the quarter. Our 3 largest global business lines leasing, occupier outsourcing and sales each generated notable growth. In addition, all 3 regional services businesses generated double-digit organic fee revenue growth in local currency. This level of growth, which excludes all M&A contributions is especially notable following a year in which there was considerable acquisition activity by all the major players.  
Leasing had an exceptional quarter. With markets around the world still improving modestly, our high-teens growth rate reflects the market share gains we're making through strategic recruiting and increased productivity of our professionals.  Occupier outsourcing had robust revenue growth even without contributions from the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition. Similarly, our property sales business had strong performance with high single-digit growth in revenue globally.
We continue to make materially strategic gains across our business. Clients increasingly want integrated solutions. They value highly strategic advice supported by insight, a powerful platform and superior execution delivered by the most knowledgeable specialists in every business line in every local markets around the world. CBRE is uniquely able to meet these requirements and create significant value for our clients. 
I'll turn the call over to Jim now who will take you through the quarter in detail."

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. Growth for the quarter was strong. Fee revenue grew 28% in local currency, or 10% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Normalized EBITDA for the quarter totaled $283 million, a 15% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q1. Adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $0.36 for the quarter. 
We believe more insight is derived by looking at the performance of the business in Q1 without the significant impact of currency hedges. On this basis, which achieved robust normalized EBITDA growth of 23% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. The negative noncash impact of marking currency hedges to market more than offset a slight gain from other currency movements during the quarter. The net impact of these and noncash charges was to reduce EPS and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04 and to reduce EBITDA and normalized EBITDA by $21 million and $22 million, respectively. Throughout this call, I will refer to this as the impact of currency hedges.
Q1 2016 normalized EBITDA includes adjustments for $17 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions and $12 million incurred in connection with the cost elimination program that we discussed last quarter.
Please turn to Slide 6 regarding Q1 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency and before the effects of currency hedges. Excluding the benefits of all 2015 acquisitions, all 3 regions still produced double-digit organic fee revenue growth in local currency. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, fee revenue increased 12% in the Americas, 13% in EMEA and 11% in Asia-Pacific. Including the acquisition, fee revenue in the Americas rose by 26%, triggered by strong growth in leasing and occupier outsourcing; fee revenue in EMEA increased to 45% with strength across the region, highlighted by The Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom; fee revenue in Asia-Pacific increased 34%. India and Japan were catalyst behind growth in this region. 
This quarter, we began to allocate the impact of currency hedging to the segments and have reflected the impact in both Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 to maintain a like-for-like comparison. Without the impact of currency hedges, normalized EBITDA for the 3 regional businesses improved 19% in aggregate, including 11% in the Americas, 82% in EMEA and 37% in Asia-Pacific. The increase in the Americas would have been 15% without lower gains from servicing rights on loan origination with government-sponsored enterprises. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q1. All percentage increases are in local currency. Our business mix continues to shift towards greater contractual revenues. And the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue was 46% of total fee revenue, up from 39% in Q1 2015. 
For context as to how much the business mix has changed over time, in 2016, contractual fee revenue was 21% of total fee revenue. This compares to 46% in Q1. Contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 74% of fee revenue for the quarter, this was up from 70% in Q1 of the prior year.
Global leasing was exceptionally strong during the quarter as revenue surged 18%. United States set the pace with revenue up 20%. A number of large leases in the quarter contributed to this growth. A broad range of countries also contributed with double-digit year-over-year growth in Canada, France, India, Italy and Japan. In the United Kingdom, we achieved 16% growth.
Occupier outsourcing continues to benefit from strong underlying growth drivers augmented by the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Excluding contributions from this acquisition, fee revenue improved 17% with all 3 regions recording double-digit growth. 
Global property sales revenue grew 9% with notable growth outside the U.S. where Asia Pac led the way with an 18% increase, paced by Japan; EMEA saw revenue rise 11% driven by strong gains in France, The Netherlands and Spain as well as 3% growth in the United Kingdom; the Americas posted a solid increase of 7%. In the U.S., CBRE improved market share by 50 basis points in Q1 according to Real Capital Analytics. We completed more than 1,800 sales transactions in the U.S. during Q1, ranging from a few million dollars to more than $500 million in value.
Commercial mortgage services revenue increased 3% driven by higher loan origination volumes with banks. Activity with a government-sponsored enterprises did not match Q1's exceptionally robust pace as the agencies plan to more evenly paced their loan originations throughout the year. Debt financing remains plentiful and other capital sources have largely replaced the pullback of CMBS originations.
Property management services for institutional property owners, which we call Asset Services, increased fee revenue globally by 4%. Revenue in our global valuation business grew by 7%. 
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. We now include renewals and expansions of clients of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business in our reporting of such contracts on this slide. Note that revenues from transaction management contracts are reflected in our leasing and sales revenue categories. 
We reported strong revenue growth and record number of executed contracts in Q1, even while integrating the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business and continuing to wind down some accounts that Johnson's Controls was in the process of exiting as we acquired the business.
We are pleased to report that client-facing integration activities were materially completed on schedule at the end of Q1 and today, we go-to-market with great enthusiasm and a premier integrated full-service global offering. Nearly half of the new long-term contracts signed in Q1 were with clients in EMEA and Asia-Pacific where rising demand for outsourcing services is being met by our significantly enhanced capabilities. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this business.
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Assets under management during the quarter grew to $89.7 billion, reflecting a $300 million increase in local currency. Revenue and EBITDA decline for the quarter with minimal carried interest and lower relative fees on investment programs that are showing the strongest growth. Drag from the impact of currency hedges had a negative $4.7 million impact on normalized EBITDA. 
New equity capital raised continues at a strong pace, totaling $1.8 billion for Q1 2016 and $7.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. Investor interest remains strong.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Development Services segment. This business line is very strong performance in 2015 continued in the first quarter, driven by the timing of large asset sales pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests increased to $69 million and normalized EBITDA totaled $32 million for the quarter. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $1.6 billion from Q1 2015. The pipeline of $3.1 billion was down $500 million from a year-ago as projects converted from pipeline to in-process.
Please turn to Slide 11. Before I turn the call back over to bob, I will summarize our Q1 financial performance without the noncash impact of currency hedges. Fee revenue increased 28%, or 10% excluding our major acquisition in 2015. Normalized EBITDA increased 23%. Adjusted EPS increased 25%. 
Now please turn to Slide 12 for Bob's closing remarks."

We're very encouraged by our strong start to 2016. Our people, collaborative culture and integrated suite of global services, coupled with continued enhancements to our operating platform have created formidable advantages for our company and real differentiation in the marketplace. This was driven home earlier this month when Forbes named CBRE the 15th Best Employer in America and spotlighted the tremendous benefits we're realizing with our alternative workplace strategy called Workplace 360. For a firm that specializes in advising clients on how best to utilize real estate to attract talent, there's no better endorsement. 
As we look ahead, it is important to remember that first quarter is typically our seasonally lightest quarter for revenue and earnings. As always, we caution against using the first quarter as a barometer of full year performance. However, our business has positive momentum and the macro environment, while more cautious than a year ago, remains generally supportive with consensus forecasts calling for continued modest economic growth in the U.S. and globally. Against this backdrop, we continue to expect double-digit growth again in 2016 with full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.27 to $2.37. This is 13% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the range. 
With that, operator, open the lines for questions."

I think what you saw was a few things. Number one, we took market share, we believe. It's hard, as you know, to get perfect numbers on that, but we believe we took market share. It's also important in looking at our business to understand that there's some things in the public data that don't come through in reporting on our business. For instance, we do significant buyer representation, we do significant land sales, and we do significant sales of user buildings that don't show up in the numbers.

We've tightened down our underwriting standards because of where we're at, 7 years of growth. We've also seen some what we consider to be uneconomic and unsustainable deals made in the market and we just want to play in that game. We're staying very clear of that. And we really think it's important for investors to understand how companies treat these incentives and signing bonuses that are brokers. In our case, as a public company, we include all these costs in our cost of services and we fully amortized them over the life of the contract, so those are real costs that are incurred and we're very, very careful about how we do that."

CBRE started 2016 with very strong performance. We again logged healthy double-digit increases in revenue and adjusted earnings per share despite significant negative effects from currency hedges in the quarter. Our 3 largest global business lines, leasing, occupier outsourcing and sales, each generated notable growth. In addition, all 3 regional services businesses generated double-digit organic fee revenue growth in local currency. This level of growth, which excludes all M&A contributions, is especially notable following a year in which there was considerable acquisition activity by all the major players.  
Leasing had an exceptional quarter. With markets around the world still improving modestly, our high-teens growth rate reflects the market share gains we're making through strategic recruiting and increased productivity of our professionals.  
Occupier outsourcing had robust revenue growth even without contributions from the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition. 
Similarly, our property sales business had strong performance with high single-digit growth in revenue globally.
We continue to make material strategic gains across our business. Clients increasingly want integrated solutions. They value highly strategic advice supported by insight, a powerful platform and superior execution delivered by the most knowledgeable specialists in every business line, in every local markets around the world. CBRE is uniquely able to meet these requirements and create significant value for our clients.

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. Growth for the quarter was strong.

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. Growth for the quarter was strong. Fee revenue grew 28% in local currency, or 10% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Normalized EBITDA for the quarter totaled $283 million, a 15% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q1. Adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $0.36 for the quarter. 
We believe more insight is derived by looking at the performance of the business in Q1 without the significant impact of currency hedges. On this basis, which achieved robust normalized EBITDA growth of 23% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. The negative noncash impact of marking currency hedges to market more than offset a slight gain from other currency movements during the quarter. The net impact of these noncash charges was to reduce EPS and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04, and to reduce EBITDA and normalized EBITDA by $21 million and $22 million, respectively. Throughout this call, I will refer to this as the impact of currency hedges.
Q1 2016 normalized EBITDA includes adjustments for $17 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions and $12 million incurred in connection with the cost elimination program that we discussed last quarter.
Please turn to Slide 6 regarding Q1 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency and before the effects of currency hedges. Excluding the benefits of all 2015 acquisitions, all 3 regions still produced double-digit organic fee revenue growth in local currency. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, fee revenue increased 12% in the Americas, 13% in EMEA and 11% in Asia Pacific. Including the acquisition, fee revenue in the Americas rose by 26%, triggered by strong growth in leasing and occupier outsourcing. Fee revenue in EMEA increased to 45% with strength across the region, highlighted by The Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Fee revenue in Asia Pacific increased 34%. India and Japan were the catalyst behind growth in this region. 
This quarter, we began to allocate the impact of currency hedging to these segments and have reflected the impact in both Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 to maintain a like-for-like comparison. Without the impact of currency hedges, normalized EBITDA for the 3 regional businesses improved 19% in aggregate, including 11% in the Americas, 82% in EMEA and 37% in Asia Pacific. The increase in the Americas would have been 15% without lower gains from servicing rights on loan origination with government-sponsored enterprises. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q1. All percentage increases are in local currency. Our business mix continues to shift towards greater contractual revenues. With the company, as a whole, contractual fee revenue was 46% of total fee revenue, up from 39% in Q1 2015. 
For context as to how much the business mix has changed over time, in 2006, contractual fee revenue was 21% of total fee revenue. This compares to 46% in Q1. Contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 74% of fee revenue for the quarter. This was up from 70% in Q1 of the prior year.
Global leasing was exceptionally strong during the quarter as revenue surged 18%. United States set the pace with revenue up 20%. A number of large leases in the quarter contributed to this growth. A broad range of countries also contributed with double-digit year-over-year growth in Canada, France, India, Italy and Japan. In the United Kingdom, we achieved 16% growth.
Occupier outsourcing continues to benefit from strong underlying growth drivers augmented by the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Excluding contributions from this acquisition, fee revenue improved 17% with all 3 regions recording double-digit growth. 
Global property sales revenue grew 9% with notable growth outside the U.S. where Asia Pac led the way with an 18% increase, paced by Japan. EMEA saw a revenue rise 11% driven by strong gains in France, The Netherlands and Spain as well as 3% growth in the United Kingdom. The Americas posted a solid increase of 7%. 
In the U.S., CBRE improved market share by 50 basis points in Q1 according to Real Capital Analytics. We completed more than 1,800 sales transactions in the U.S. during Q1 ranging from a few million dollars to more than $500 million in value.
Commercial mortgage services revenue increased 3% driven by higher loan origination volumes with banks. Activity with the government-sponsored enterprises did not match Q1's exceptionally robust pace as the agencies plan to more evenly pace their loan originations throughout the year. Debt financing remains plentiful and other capital sources have largely replaced the pullback of CMBS originations.
Property management services for institutional property owners, which we call Asset Services, increased fee revenue globally by 4%. Revenue in our global valuation business grew by 7%. 
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. We now include renewals and expansions of clients of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business in our reporting of such contracts on this slide. Note that revenues from transaction management contracts are reflected in our leasing and sales revenue categories. 
We recorded strong revenue growth and a record number of executed contracts in Q1, even while integrating the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business and continuing to wind down some accounts that Johnson Controls was in the process of exiting as we acquired the business.
We are pleased to report that client-facing integration activities were materially completed on schedule at the end of Q1 and today, we go to market with great enthusiasm and a premier integrated full-service global offering. Nearly half of the new long-term contracts signed in Q1 were with clients in EMEA and Asia Pacific where rising demand for outsourcing services is being met by our significantly enhanced capabilities. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this business.
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Assets under management during the quarter grew to $89.7 billion, reflecting a $300 million increase in local currency. Revenue in EBITDA decline for the quarter with minimal carried interest and lower relative fees on investment programs that are showing the strongest growth. Drag from the impact of currency hedges at a negative $4.7 million impact on normalized EBITDA. New equity capital raised continues at a strong pace, totaling $1.8 billion for Q1 2016 and $7.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. Investor interest remains strong.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Development Services segment. This business line's very strong performance in 2015 continued in the first quarter driven by the timing of large asset sales. Pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests increased to $69 million and normalized EBITDA totaled $32 million for the quarter. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $1.6 billion from Q1 2015. The pipeline of $3.1 billion was down $500 million from a year ago, as projects converted from pipeline to in-process.
Please turn to Slide 11. Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I will summarize our Q1 financial performance without the noncash impact of currency hedges. Fee revenue increased 28%, or 10% excluding our major acquisition in 2015. Normalized EBITDA increased 23%. Adjusted EPS increased 25%. 
Now please turn to Slide 12 for Bob's closing remarks."

We're very encouraged by our strong start to 2016. Our people, collaborative culture and integrated suite of global services, coupled with continued enhancements to our operating platform, have created formidable advantages for our company and real differentiation in the marketplace. This was driven home earlier this month when Forbes named CBRE the 15th Best Employer in America and spotlighted the tremendous benefits we're realizing with our alternative workplace strategy called Workplace 360. For a firm that specializes in advising clients on how best to utilize real estate to attract talent, there's no better endorsement. 
As we look ahead, it is important to remember that first quarter is typically our seasonally lightest quarter for revenue and earnings. As always, we caution against using the first quarter as a barometer of full year performance. However, our business has positive momentum in the macro environment, while more cautious than a year ago, remains generally supportive with consensus forecast calling for continued modest economic growth in the U.S. and globally. Against this backdrop, we continue to expect double-digit growth again in 2016 with full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.27 to $2.37. This is 13% year-on-year growth at the midpoint of the range. 
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

It's also important in looking at our business to understand that there's some things in the public data that don't come through in reporting on our business.

But after years of very, very substantial growth, we just felt it was time to kind of put aside some dedicated energy into looking for areas we could cut some costs. It is in the scale of our company, still quite a small program. And we will reinvest some of the savings in things that we think can help drive the organic revenue growth of the business, so it will not all drop to the bottom line."

But we're -- particularly with regard to trophy office, we're not seeing as many bidders in some cases. Again, I'm going to go back to something both Jim and I commented on earlier and that is that the -- a little bit of nervousness and choppiness that we saw the first couple months of the year, we saw start to abate a bit at the end of the quarter. And in general, we think the news in the capital -- things in the capital markets have slowed down and the prospects are looking more now for the rest of the year like they did at the end of last year rather than as we got into first -- or the beginning of the first quarter. But we're not seeing much impact on pricing. If we were going to circle some assets and say these are the ones that might be vulnerable, clearly, would be the trophy, the trophy office assets. But again, I think it's important to remember, David, and this is what I think gets missed a little bit when people look at our company, we certainly have a big practice in that area. We have a very big and very active practice in the industrial area, but we also have a big far-reaching practice in areas that don't necessarily get a lot of the bright lights. Again, we represent a lot of buyers. We represent a lot of land sellers. We do a lot of the work with users, buying and selling properties.

CBRE started 2016 with very strong performance. We again logged healthy double-digit increases in revenue and adjusted earnings per share despite significant negative effects from currency hedges in the quarter. Our 3 largest global business lines, leasing, occupier outsourcing and sales, each generated notable growth. In addition, all 3 regional services businesses generated double-digit organic fee revenue growth in local currency. This level of growth, which excludes all M&A contributions, is especially notable following a year in which there was considerable acquisition activity by all the major players.  
Leasing had an exceptional quarter. With markets around the world still improving modestly, our high-teens growth rate reflects the market share gains we're making through strategic recruiting and increased productivity of our professionals.  
Occupier outsourcing had robust revenue growth even without contributions from the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition. 
Similarly, our property sales business had strong performance with high single-digit growth in revenue globally.
We continue to make material strategic gains across our business. Clients increasingly want integrated solutions. They value highly strategic advice supported by insight, a powerful platform and superior execution delivered by the most knowledgeable specialists in every business line, in every local market around the world. CBRE is uniquely able to meet these requirements and create significant value for our clients.

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. Growth for the quarter was strong.

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. Growth for the quarter was strong. Fee revenue grew 28% in local currency, or 10% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Normalized EBITDA for the quarter totaled $283 million, a 15% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q1. Adjusted earnings per share increased 13% to $0.36 for the quarter. 
We believe more insight is derived by looking at the performance of the business in Q1 without the significant impact of currency hedges. On this basis, we achieved robust normalized EBITDA growth of 23% and adjusted EPS growth of 25%. The negative noncash impact of marking currency hedges to market more than offset a slight gain from other currency movements during the quarter. The net impact of these noncash charges was to reduce EPS and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04, and to reduce EBITDA and normalized EBITDA by $21 million and $22 million, respectively. Throughout this call, I will refer to this as the impact of currency hedges.
Q1 2016 normalized EBITDA includes adjustments for $17 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions and $12 million incurred in connection with the cost elimination program that we discussed last quarter.
Please turn to Slide 6 regarding Q1 results for our 3 regional services segments, all in local currency and before the effects of currency hedges. Excluding the benefits of all 2015 acquisitions, all 3 regions still produced double-digit organic fee revenue growth in local currency. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, fee revenue increased 12% in the Americas, 13% in EMEA and 11% in Asia Pacific. Including the acquisition, fee revenue in the Americas rose by 26%, triggered by strong growth in leasing and occupier outsourcing. Fee revenue in EMEA increased to 45% with strength across the region, highlighted by The Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Fee revenue in Asia Pacific increased 34%. India and Japan were the catalyst behind growth in this region. 
This quarter, we began to allocate the impact of currency hedging to these segments and have reflected the impact in both Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 to maintain a like-for-like comparison. Without the impact of currency hedges, normalized EBITDA for the 3 regional businesses improved 19% in aggregate, including 11% in the Americas, 82% in EMEA and 37% in Asia Pacific. The increase in the Americas would have been 15% without lower gains from servicing rights on loan origination with government-sponsored enterprises. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of the performance of our major global lines of business in Q1. All percentage increases are in local currency. Our business mix continues to shift towards greater contractual revenues. With the company, as a whole, contractual fee revenue was 46% of total fee revenue, up from 39% in Q1 2015. 
For context as to how much the business mix has changed over time, in 2006, contractual fee revenue was 21% of total fee revenue. This compares to 46% in Q1. Contractual fee revenue plus leasing, which is largely recurring, totaled 74% of fee revenue for the quarter. This was up from 70% in Q1 of the prior year.
Global leasing was exceptionally strong during the quarter as revenue surged 18%. United States set the pace with revenue up 20%. A number of large leases in the quarter contributed to this growth. A broad range of countries also contributed with double-digit year-over-year growth in Canada, France, India, Italy and Japan. In the United Kingdom, we achieved 16% growth.
Occupier outsourcing continues to benefit from strong underlying growth drivers augmented by the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Excluding contributions from this acquisition, fee revenue improved 17% with all 3 regions recording double-digit growth. 
Global property sales revenue grew 9% with notable growth outside the U.S. where Asia Pac led the way with an 18% increase, paced by Japan. EMEA saw a revenue rise 11% driven by strong gains in France, The Netherlands and Spain as well as 3% growth in the United Kingdom. The Americas posted a solid increase of 7%. 
In the U.S., CBRE improved market share by 50 basis points in Q1 according to Real Capital Analytics. We completed more than 1,800 sales transactions in the U.S. during Q1 ranging from a few million dollars to more than $500 million in value.
Commercial mortgage services revenue increased 3% driven by higher loan origination volumes with banks. Activity with the government-sponsored enterprises did not match Q1's exceptionally robust pace as the agencies plan to more evenly pace their loan originations throughout the year. Debt financing remains plentiful and other capital sources have largely replaced the pullback of CMBS originations.
Property management services for institutional property owners, which we call Asset Services, increased fee revenue globally by 4%. Revenue in our global valuation business grew by 7%. 
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. We now include renewals and expansions of clients of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business in our reporting of such contracts on this slide. Note that revenues from transaction management contracts are reflected in our leasing and sales revenue categories. 
We recorded strong revenue growth and a record number of executed contracts in Q1, even while integrating the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business and continuing to wind down some accounts that Johnson Controls was in the process of exiting as we acquired the business.
We are pleased to report that client-facing integration activities were materially completed on schedule at the end of Q1 and today, we go to market with great enthusiasm and a premier integrated full-service global offering. Nearly half of the new long-term contracts signed in Q1 were with clients in EMEA and Asia Pacific where rising demand for outsourcing services is being met by our significantly enhanced capabilities. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this business.
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Assets under management during the quarter grew to $89.7 billion, reflecting a $300 million increase in local currency. Revenue in EBITDA declined for the quarter with minimal carried interest and lower relative fees on investment programs that are showing the strongest growth. Drag from the impact of currency hedges had a negative $4.7 million impact on normalized EBITDA. New equity capital raised continues at a strong pace, totaling $1.8 billion for Q1 2016 and $7.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. Investor interest remains strong.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Development Services segment. This business line's very strong performance in 2015 continued in the first quarter driven by the timing of large asset sales. Pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests increased to $69 million and normalized EBITDA totaled $32 million for the quarter. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $1.6 billion from Q1 2015. The pipeline of $3.1 billion was down $500 million from a year ago, as projects converted from pipeline to in-process.
Please turn to Slide 11. Before I turn the call back over to Bob, I will summarize our Q1 financial performance without the noncash impact of currency hedges. Fee revenue increased 28%, or 10% excluding our major acquisition in 2015. Normalized EBITDA increased 23%. Adjusted EPS increased 25%. 
Now please turn to Slide 12 for Bob's closing remarks."

We're very encouraged by our strong start to 2016. Our people, collaborative culture and integrated suite of global services, coupled with continued enhancements to our operating platform, have created formidable advantages for our company and real differentiation in the marketplace. This was driven home earlier this month when Forbes named CBRE the 15th Best Employer in America and spotlighted the tremendous benefits we're realizing with our alternative workplace strategy called Workplace 360. For a firm that specializes in advising clients on how best to utilize real estate to attract talent, there's no better endorsement. 
As we look ahead, it is important to remember that first quarter is typically our seasonally lightest quarter for revenue and earnings. As always, we caution against using the first quarter as a barometer of full year performance. However, our business has positive momentum in the macro environment, while more cautious than a year ago, remains generally supportive with consensus forecast calling for continued modest economic growth in the U.S. and globally. Against this backdrop, we continue to expect double-digit growth again in 2016 with full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.27 to $2.37.

We have had, as we've noted, several years running of really strong hiring. More of that hiring, by the way, has been in our leasing business than in our sales business, but we have hired professionals around the world. I think what you saw was a few things. Number one, we took market share, we believe. It's hard, as you know, to get perfect numbers on that, but we believe we took market share. It's also important in looking at our business to understand that there's some things in the public data that don't come through in reporting on our business. For instance, we do significant buyer representation, we do significant land sales and we do significant sales of user buildings that don't show up in the numbers.

4204816,372842948,1014996,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. CBRE posted another quarter of strong growth on the top and bottom lines with a 24% increase in adjusted EPS.

CBRE posted another quarter of strong growth on the top and bottom lines with a 24% increase in adjusted EPS. This growth came amid an uncertain macro environment and, notably, a time when global property sales volumes, marketwide, have pulled back from a robust 2015. The diversity of CBRE's service offering is especially important in the current market environment. Our performance for the quarter was supported by strong growth in mortgage services reflecting continued debt capital flows into commercial real estate and in occupier outsourcing, which, once again, grew revenue strongly even before contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business. 
Leasing was also up nicely in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, and our Investment Management and Development Services businesses produced solid EBITDA gains for the quarter. 
Jim will take you through all of this in detail shortly. Before he does, I want to address the UK's growth to leave the European Union. 
Please turn to Slide 5. CBRE, like the rest of the commercial real estate services industry, was affected by the high degree of uncertainty in the U.K. market leading up to the referendum on June 23. This can be seen in the nearly 40% drop in U.K. marketwide property sales volumes in Q2, according to CBRE research. However, the effect on CBRE's U.K. revenue was materially less pronounced. In local currency, CBRE's total U.K. fee revenue increased 12%. Without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business, U.K. fee revenue in local currency was just 5% below Q2 2015, which had been up 32% over Q2 of the prior year. This performance highlights how significantly our U.K. business has evolved in recent years. During the first half of 2016, occupier outsourcing and property management, which is sticky recurring revenue, accounted for 69% of U.K. fee revenue versus just 19% in the first half of 2013. This shift in our U.K. revenue mix has been driven by our acquisitions of Norland in late 2013 and Global WorkPlace Solutions in September 2015, and positions us well as the U.K. goes about resetting its relationship with the European Union. 
Please turn to Slide 6. CBRE expects continued near term hesitancy among occupiers about space decisions in the U.K., particularly in London. We expect a modest increase in property yields reflecting the higher perceived risk of holding U.K. property. However, this increase may be temporary especially for top-tier assets due to the inherent attractiveness of the U.K. market. In addition, the decline in the value of sterling against the U.S. dollar should provide some incremental support for foreign investment into the U.K. over time. We also anticipate a delay in some office development activity, which should provide longer-term support for property prices as well as rents, particularly in central London, where availability stands at just 3%. 
We are monitoring Brexit-related developments closely. There's a long road ahead, but the swift resolution of the political leadership in Britain is an encouraging sign. Given our clear leadership position, CBRE is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the U.K. and across Europe. We are firmly focused on continuing to support our European business and clients. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim who will discuss our second quarter results in detail."

Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our financial results. Fee revenue rose 20% in local currency to $2.1 billion, or 3% organic growth in fee revenue without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business and o",933,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our financial results. Fee revenue rose 20% in local currency to $2.1 billion, or 3% organic growth in fee revenue without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business and other M&A. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $360 million, a 19% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q2. Margin on fee revenue was 17%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 24% to $0.52 for the quarter. Q2's results include $4 million of net benefit to adjusted EBITDA from currency movement, including gains on hedges. This compares to a net unfavorable impact of $40 million in the second quarter of 2015. Q2 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $360 million includes adjustments for $28 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions and $27 million incurred in connection with cost elimination program that we discussed in the prior 2 quarters. 
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding Q2 results for our 3 regional service segments, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 18% in the Americas, 31% in EMEA and 18% in Asia Pacific. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions, fee revenue increased 6% in the Americas, it was essentially flat in both EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our business mix. Our business mix continues to evolve towards greater contractual revenue. The company, as a whole, contractual fee revenue was 44% of total fee revenue, up from 34% in Q2 2015 and 19% in Q2 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ].
Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q2. All percentages, increases are in local currencies. Occupier outsourcing continue to exhibit strong growth. Global fee revenue was up 118%, aided by the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions. Without contributions from this acquisition, fee revenue rose 10%. Commercial mortgage services had a very good quarter with revenue up 14%, led by private lenders, particularly banks and continued growth with government-sponsored enterprises. Leasing had [indiscernible] the good growth in the Americas, which is up 8%, and Asia-Pacific, which rose 7%. We continue to benefit from the influx of producers, choosing to join CBRE. In the Americas, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. all turned in healthy performances, while Asia Pac was led by Greater China, India and New Zealand. Leasing was down 11% in EMEA as growth in Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands [indiscernible], partially offset a decline in the U.K. Property sales revenue rose 2% in the Americas, while EMEA and Asia-Pacific both declined 16% [ph]. This compares with an exceptionally strong Q2 2015 when year-on-year growth rates were 25% in the Americas, 62% in EMEA and 24% in Asia-Pacific. 
Q2 2016 property sales revenue in the U.K. declined by approximately 1/3. CBRE continue to make gains in property sales, as evidenced by our 150 basis point market share increase in the U.S. during Q2 according to RCA. 
Fee revenue from profit management services, which we call Asset Services, increased by 7%. Valuation revenue was essentially unchanged. 
Please turn to Slide 11, regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which we reported within the 3 regional services segments. Finance interest in our outsourcing offering remains high. This can be seen in the 96 total contracts we signed during Q2, including 37 with new clients. Notably, more than 1/3 of these new clients were in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Evidence to outsourcing is gaining more traction in overseas markets. 
Our engagements often span multiple geographies and services. CBRE is well positioned to serve complex, multi-market requirements with our clients with the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions expertise firmly embedded in our outsourcing business. 
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business line increased to $26 million. The business continues to attract significant capital commitments. We raised $1.8 billion of new -- in new equity in Q2 and $7.1 billion in the trailing 12 months. Assets under management totaled $88.6 billion, up $3.9 billion from a year ago in local currency. However, all but $200 million of this increase was offset by foreign currency movement over the past year. 
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Development Services segment. Strong performance in this business continued in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $19 million for the quarter while pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, increased to $46 million. These strong results in the quarter were helped by the timing of asset sales. We note that these development asset sales accounted for the vast majority of our equity earnings for the quarter. Due to the timing of projects sales, we expect results for the remainder of the year to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter with a significantly lighter third quarter. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $1.1 billion from Q2 2015. The pipeline of $3 billion was down $700 million from a year ago as projects converted from pipeline to in-process. 
Please turn to Slide 14. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to briefly highlight our results for the first half of 2016. These results are strong, including growth rates of 24% in fee revenue in local currency, 17% in adjusted EBITDA and 21% in adjusted earnings per share. This growth is particularly notable coming at a time when average earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to decline in Q2 2016 for the fifth consecutive quarter. Please turn to Slide 15 for Bob's closing remarks."

As you've seen, our business has performed very well in the first half of 2016, even with a decline in marketwide property sales volumes compared to a year ago. It is important to note that market fundamentals in commercial real estate remain in good shape, with the impact of Brexit largely limited to property transactions activity in the U.K  and we anticipate solid earnings growth for the year. Looking ahead, we are adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. This is due principally to the impact of Brexit on U.K. property transaction volumes and less visibility around the timing of the realization of certain tenants in our Global Investment Management business and Development Services business. These factors have caused us to reduce our earnings guidance by 3% at the top end of our range and by 5% at the bottom end. These results in expected adjusted EPS for the calendar year of $2.15 to $2.30, which represents solid growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range. We see adjusted EPS in the second half of 2016 more weighted to Q4 rather than Q3 compared with our customary progression of earnings throughout the year. 
As the clear market leader, CBRE is well positioned to further extend our competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our ongoing talent and technology initiatives, collaborative culture, market-leading service offering and financial strength uniquely position us to satisfy clients' growing demand for our services.

And notably, we've grown our small asset class business materially on the sales side. And on the advisory and transaction services side of our occupier client offering, we've integrated our outsourcing business with our local brokerage business and added a bunch of advisory capabilities that have really allowed us to take on a lot of account business beyond what we were ever able to do before and offer things to our clients that go beyond what we're able to offer before. And that's coming through on our numbers, and it's coming through our numbers for outsourcing business and our local brokerage business or local leasing business, and we're taking market share as a result."

And we're talking to most companies in the world, most of the time about doing leasing work for them, nothing about that has changed. But with regard to the relationship people on those accounts, they've almost exclusively focused on transitioning the accounts and doing great work form and measuring that work. That's going well. We have a lot of work to do in that area. We've gotten most of that integration work done. I will tell you that if you talked to Bill Concannon and his team, they'll tell you now that if things are starting to feel very different with those clients, those clients were becoming much more comfortable with them. We've had some very recent significant wins. The confidence that we can marry up all the pieces of that business and go to market as an integrated offering is growing pretty rapidly. So we think those opportunities are very, very good, but through the first 3 quarters of that acquisition transition, the focus has been on transitioning those accounts and really questioning the work that we've already been given from those clients."

4204816,372842948,1015140,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. CBRE posted another quarter of strong growth on the top and bottom lines with a 24% increase in adjusted EPS.

CBRE posted another quarter of strong growth on the top and bottom lines with a 24% increase in adjusted EPS. This growth came amid an uncertain macro environment and, notably, a time when global property sales volumes market-wide have pulled back from a robust 2015. The diversity of CBRE's service offering is especially important in the current market environment. Our performance for the quarter was supported by strong growth in mortgage services, reflecting continued debt capital flows into commercial real estate and in occupier outsourcing, which, once again, grew revenue strongly even before contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business.
Leasing was also up nicely in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and our Investment Management and Development Services businesses produced solid EBITDA gains for the quarter.
Jim will take you through all of this in detail shortly. Before he does, I want to address the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
Please turn to Slide 5. CBRE, like the rest of the commercial real estate services industry, was affected by the high degree of uncertainty in the U.K. market leading up to the referendum on June 23. This can be seen in the nearly 40% drop in U.K. market-wide property sales volumes in Q2, according to CBRE research. However, the effect on CBRE's U.K. revenue was materially less pronounced. In local currency, CBRE's total U.K. fee revenue increased 12%. Without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business, U.K. fee revenue in local currency was just 5% below Q2 2015, which had been up 32% over Q2 of the prior year. This performance highlights how significantly our U.K. business has evolved in recent years. During the first half of 2016, occupier outsourcing and property management, which is sticky recurring revenue, accounted for 69% of U.K. fee revenue versus just 19% in the first half of 2013. This shift in our U.K. revenue mix has been driven by our acquisitions of Norland in late 2013 and Global WorkPlace Solutions in September 2015 and positions us well as the U.K. goes about resetting its relationship with the European Union.
Please turn to Slide 6. CBRE expects continued near-term hesitancy among occupiers about space decisions in the U.K., particularly in London. We expect a modest increase in property yields, reflecting the higher perceived risk of holding U.K. property. However, this increase may be temporary, especially for top-tier assets, due to the inherent attractiveness of the U.K. market. In addition, the decline in the value of sterling against the U.S. dollar should provide some incremental support for foreign investments into the U.K. over time. We also anticipate a delay in some office development activity, which should provide longer-term support for property prices as well as rents, particularly in Central London, where availability stands at just 3%.
We are monitoring Brexit-related developments closely. There's a long road ahead, but the swift resolution of the political leadership in Britain is an encouraging sign. Given our clear leadership position, CBRE is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the U.K. and across Europe. We are firmly focused on continuing to support our European business and clients.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will discuss our second quarter results in detail."

Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our financial results. Fee revenue rose 20% in local currency to $2.1 billion or 3% organic growth in fee revenue without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business and ot",935,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our financial results. Fee revenue rose 20% in local currency to $2.1 billion or 3% organic growth in fee revenue without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business and other M&A. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $360 million, a 19% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q2. Margin on fee revenue was 17%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 24% to $0.52 for the quarter. Q2's results include $4 million of net benefit to adjusted EBITDA from currency movement, including gains on hedges. This compares to a net unfavorable impact of $40 million in the second quarter of 2015. Q2 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $360 million includes adjustments for $28 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions and $27 million incurred in connection with cost elimination program that we discussed in the prior 2 quarters.
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding Q2 results for our 3 regional service segments, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 18% in the Americas, 31% in EMEA and 18% in Asia Pacific. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions, fee revenue increased 6% in the Americas and was essentially flat in both EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our business mix. Our business mix continues to evolve towards greater contractual revenue. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue was 44% of total fee revenue, up from 34% in Q2 2015 and 19% in Q2 2006.
Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q2. All percentages increases are in local currency. Occupier outsourcing continued to exhibit strong growth. Global fee revenue was up 118%, aided by the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions. Without contributions from this acquisition, fee revenue rose 10%. Commercial mortgage services had a very good quarter with revenue up 14%, led by private lenders, particularly banks, and continued growth with government-sponsored enterprises. Leasing achieved good growth in the Americas, which is up 8%, and Asia Pacific, which rose 7%. We continue to benefit from the influx of producers choosing to join CBRE.
In the Americas, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. all turned in healthy performances, while Asia Pac was led by Greater China, India and New Zealand. Leasing was down 11% in EMEA as growth in Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands and Spain partially offset a decline in the U.K. Property sales revenue rose 2% in the Americas, while EMEA and Asia Pacific both declined 16%. This compares with an exceptionally strong Q2 2015 when year-on-year growth rates were 25% in the Americas, 62% in EMEA and 24% in Asia Pacific.
Q2 2016 property sales revenue in the U.K. declined by approximately 1/3. CBRE continued to make gains in property sales as evidenced by our 150 basis point market share increase in the U.S. during Q2, according to RCA.
Fee revenue from property management services, which we call asset services, increased by 7%. Valuation revenue was essentially unchanged.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which we reported within the 3 regional service segments. Finance interest in our outsourcing offering remains high. This can be seen in the 96 total contracts we signed during Q2, including 37 with new clients. Notably, more than 1/3 of these new clients were in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Evidence to the outsourcing is gaining more traction in overseas markets.
Our engagements often span multiple geographies and services. CBRE is well positioned to serve complex, multi-market requirements with our clients with the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions expertise firmly embedded in our outsourcing business.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business line increased to $26 million. The business continues to attract significant capital commitments. We raised $1.8 billion of new -- in new equity in Q2 and $7.1 billion in the trailing 12 months. Assets under management totaled $88.6 billion, up $3.9 billion from a year ago in local currency. However, all but $200 million of this increase was offset by foreign currency movement over the past year.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Development Services segment. Strong performance in this business continued in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $19 million for the quarter, while pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, increased to $46 million. These strong results in the quarter were helped by the timing of asset sales. We note that these development asset sales accounting for -- accounted for the vast majority of our equity earnings for the quarter. Due to the timing of project sales, we expect results for the remainder of the year to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, with a significantly lighter third quarter. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $1.1 billion from Q2 2015. The pipeline of $3 billion was down $700 million from a year ago as projects converted from pipeline to in-process.
Please turn to Slide 14. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to briefly highlight our results for the first half of 2016. These results are strong, including growth rates of 24% in fee revenue in local currency, 17% in adjusted EBITDA and 21% in adjusted earnings per share. This growth is particularly notable coming at a time when average earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to decline in Q2 2016 for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Please turn to Slide 15 for Bob's closing remarks."

As you've seen, our business has performed very well in the first half of 2016, even with a decline in market-wide property sales volumes compared to a year ago. It is important to note that market fundamentals in commercial real estate remain in good shape, with the impact of Brexit largely limited to property transactions activity in the U.K., and we anticipate solid earnings growth for the year. Looking ahead, we are adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. This is due principally to the impact of Brexit on U.K. property transaction volumes and less visibility around the timing of the realization of certain tenants in our Global Investment Management business and Development Services business. These factors have caused us to reduce our earnings guidance by 3% at the top end of our range and by 5% at the bottom end. This results in expected adjusted EPS for the calendar year of $2.15 to $2.30, which represents solid growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range. We see adjusted EPS in the second half of 2016 more weighted to Q4 rather than Q3 compared with our customary progression of earnings throughout the year.
As the clear market leader, CBRE is well positioned to further extend our competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our ongoing talent and technology initiatives, collaborative culture, market-leading service offering and financial strength uniquely position us to satisfy clients' growing demand for our services.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

And it's also very typical that we will take on new geography, sometimes just within the United States or sometimes in other parts of the world. But those are the 2 things. And that's one of the beautiful things about this business. If you do good work for these clients, and we track the work we do for them very closely, there is almost always an opportunity to take on new services or new geography.

That's very typical of those accounts. So it's a mixed bag. The way we generally view these big outsourcing accounts when we take them on, they tend -- they're getting larger and larger, so it's not uncommon anymore for us to take on a client and grow it to be a multi-hundred-million dollar revenue source for the company.

4204816,372842948,1015327,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone.

CBRE posted another quarter of strong growth on the top and bottom lines with a 24% increase in adjusted EPS. This growth came amid an uncertain macro environment and, notably, a time when global property sales volumes market-wide have pulled back from a robust 2015. The diversity of CBRE's service offering is especially important in the current market environment. Our performance for the quarter was supported by strong growth in mortgage services, reflecting continued debt capital flows into commercial real estate and in occupier outsourcing, which, once again, grew revenue strongly even before contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business.
Leasing was also up nicely in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and our Investment Management and Development Services businesses produced solid EBITDA gains for the quarter.
Jim will take you through all of this in detail shortly. Before he does, I want to address the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
Please turn to Slide 5. CBRE, like the rest of the commercial real estate services industry, was affected by the high degree of uncertainty in the U.K. market leading up to the referendum on June 23. This can be seen in the nearly 40% drop in U.K. market-wide property sales volumes in Q2, according to CBRE research. However, the effect on CBRE's U.K. revenue was materially less pronounced. In local currency, CBRE's total U.K. fee revenue increased 12%. Without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business, U.K. fee revenue in local currency was just 5% below Q2 2015, which had been up 32% over Q2 of the prior year. This performance highlights how significantly our U.K. business has evolved in recent years. During the first half of 2016, occupier outsourcing and property management, which is sticky recurring revenue, accounted for 69% of U.K. fee revenue versus just 19% in the first half of 2013. This shift in our U.K. revenue mix has been driven by our acquisitions of Norland in late 2013 and Global WorkPlace Solutions in September 2015 and positions us well as the U.K. goes about resetting its relationship with the European Union.
Please turn to Slide 6. CBRE expects continued near-term hesitancy among occupiers about space decisions in the U.K., particularly in London. We expect a modest increase in property yields, reflecting the higher perceived risk of holding U.K. property. However, this increase may be temporary, especially for top-tier assets, due to the inherent attractiveness of the U.K. market. In addition, the decline in the value of sterling against the U.S. dollar should provide some incremental support for foreign investments into the U.K. over time. We also anticipate a delay in some office development activity, which should provide longer-term support for property prices as well as rent, particularly in Central London, where availability stands at just 3%.
We are monitoring Brexit-related developments closely. There's a long road ahead, but the swift resolution of the political leadership in Britain is an encouraging sign. Given our clear leadership position, CBRE is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the U.K. and across Europe. We are firmly focused on continuing to support our European business and clients.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will discuss our second quarter results in detail."

Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our financial results. Fee revenue rose 20% in local currency to $2.1 billion or 3% organic growth in fee revenue without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business and ot",935,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our financial results. Fee revenue rose 20% in local currency to $2.1 billion or 3% organic growth in fee revenue without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business and other M&A. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $360 million, a 19% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q2. Margin on fee revenue was 17%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 24% to $0.52 for the quarter. Q2's results include $4 million of net benefit to adjusted EBITDA from currency movement, including gains on hedges. This compares to a net unfavorable impact of $14 million in the second quarter of 2015. Q2 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $360 million includes adjustments for $28 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions and $27 million incurred in connection with cost elimination program that we discussed in the prior 2 quarters.
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding Q2 results for our 3 regional service segments, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 18% in the Americas, 31% in EMEA and 18% in Asia Pacific. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions, fee revenue increased 6% in the Americas and was essentially flat in both EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our business mix. Our business mix continues to evolve towards greater contractual revenue. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue was 44% of total fee revenue, up from 34% in Q2 2015 and 19% in Q2 2006.
Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q2. All percentages increases are in local currency. Occupier outsourcing continued to exhibit strong growth. Global fee revenue was up 118%, aided by the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions. Without contributions from this acquisition, fee revenue rose 10%. Commercial mortgage services had a very good quarter with revenue up 14%, led by private lenders, particularly banks, and continued growth with government-sponsored enterprises. Leasing achieved good growth in the Americas, which was up 8%, and Asia Pacific, which rose 7%. We continue to benefit from the influx of producers choosing to join CBRE.
In the Americas, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. all turned in healthy performances, while Asia Pac was led by Greater China, India and New Zealand. Leasing was down 11% in EMEA as growth in Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands and Spain partially offset a decline in the U.K. Property sales revenue rose 2% in the Americas, while EMEA and Asia Pacific both declined 16%. This compares with an exceptionally strong Q2 2015 when year-on-year growth rates were 25% in the Americas, 62% in EMEA and 24% in Asia Pacific.
Q2 2016 property sales revenue in the U.K. declined by approximately 1/3. CBRE continued to make gains in property sales as evidenced by our 150 basis point market share increase in the U.S. during Q2, according to RCA.
Fee revenue from property management services, which we call asset services, increased by 7%. Valuation revenue was essentially unchanged.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which we reported within the 3 regional service segments. Finance interest in our outsourcing offering remains high. This can be seen in the 96 total contracts we signed during Q2, including 37 with new clients. Notably, more than 1/3 of these new clients were in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Evidence to the outsourcing is gaining more traction in overseas markets.
Our engagements often span multiple geographies and services. CBRE is well positioned to serve complex, multi-market requirements with our clients with the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions expertise firmly embedded in our outsourcing business.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business line increased to $26 million. The business continues to attract significant capital commitments. We raised $1.8 billion of new -- in new equity in Q2 and $7.1 billion in the trailing 12 months. Assets under management totaled $88.6 billion, up $3.9 billion from a year ago in local currency. However, all but $200 million of this increase was offset by foreign currency movement over the past year.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Development Services segment. Strong performance in this business continued in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $19 million for the quarter, while pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, increased to $46 million. These strong results in the quarter were helped by the timing of asset sales. We note that these development asset sales accounting for -- accounted for the vast majority of our equity earnings for the quarter. Due to the timing of project sales, we expect results for the remainder of the year to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, with a significantly lighter third quarter. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $1.1 billion from Q2 2015. The pipeline of $3 billion was down $700 million from a year ago as projects converted from pipeline to in-process.
Please turn to Slide 14. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to briefly highlight our results for the first half of 2016. These results are strong, including growth rates of 24% in fee revenue in local currency, 17% in adjusted EBITDA and 21% in adjusted earnings per share. This growth is particularly notable coming at a time when average earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to decline in Q2 2016 for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Please turn to Slide 15 for Bob's closing remarks."

As you've seen, our business has performed very well in the first half of 2016, even with a decline in market-wide property sales volumes compared to a year ago. It is important to note that market fundamentals in commercial real estate remain in good shape, with the impact of Brexit largely limited to property transactions activity in the U.K., and we anticipate solid earnings growth for the year. Looking ahead, we are adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. This is due principally to the impact of Brexit on U.K. property transaction volumes and less visibility around the timing of the realization of certain tenants in our Global Investment Management business and Development Services business. These factors have caused us to reduce our earnings guidance by 3% at the top end of our range and by 5% at the bottom end. This results in expected adjusted EPS for the calendar year of $2.15 to $2.30, which represents solid growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range. We see adjusted EPS in the second half of 2016 more weighted to Q4 rather than Q3 compared with our customary progression of earnings throughout the year.
As the clear market leader, CBRE is well positioned to further extend our competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our ongoing talent and technology initiatives, collaborative culture, market-leading service offering and financial strength uniquely position us to satisfy clients' growing demand for our services.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

If you look at the update on our guidance at the midpoint, it's -- the range is a little wider, and at the midpoint, we're down 4%. And I think as we kind of referenced, a little more than half of that is really tied to Brexit impact on U.K. transactions. And then some of the widening and a bit that's left is in there around just some timing risk around the realization of incentives in our Global Investment Management and Development Services and then just some very minor tweaks to our forecast internally."

And notably, we've grown our small asset class business materially on the sales side. And on the advisory and transaction services side of our occupier client offering, we've integrated our outsourcing business with our local brokerage business and added a bunch of advisory capabilities that have really allowed us to take on a lot of account business beyond what we were ever able to do before and offer things to our clients that go beyond what we were able to offer before.

So they're -- you will hear us refer to leasing as being largely recurring over time. And -- but we don’t include any of those revenues in the contractual section of what we refer to as contractual. As far as the percentage of deals we get renewals, I can't give you a figure -- an exact figure, but it's extremely high. And if we didn't get a renewal -- on the margin, if we or others aren't getting the renewals on their assignments, then we're picking up the other competitors' piece and vice versa, but that tends to be quite rare."

So we often will have incentives in these contracts that will allow us to earn incremental dollars if we meet certain performance thresholds. And we also will have some variable amount of work. So for instance, we may take on a contractual relationship with a big corporate client to do project management work of a certain type for them. And the more projects they do, the more work we do. That's very typical of those accounts. So it's a mixed bag. The way we generally view these big outsourcing accounts when we take them on, they tend -- they're getting larger and larger, so it's not uncommon anymore for us to take on a client and grow it to be a multi-hundred-million dollar revenue source for the company. We almost view these incremental accounts as starting new little businesses within our company. So you start them -- when you start them, there's something there, and then you do a good job and you grow them. And with 90-plus percent renewal rates and increasing customer satisfaction rates, we tend to keep them and grow them. So you end up with something at the core that's largely guaranteed, and you have the opportunity to grow it from there."

CBRE posted another quarter of strong growth on the top and bottom lines with a 24% increase in adjusted EPS. This growth came amid an uncertain macro environment and, notably, a time when global property sales volumes market-wide have pulled back from a robust 2015. The diversity of CBRE's service offering is especially important in the current market environment. Our performance for the quarter was supported by strong growth in mortgage services, reflecting continued debt capital flows into commercial real estate and in occupier outsourcing, which, once again, grew revenue strongly even before contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business.
Leasing was also up nicely in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and our Investment Management and Development Services businesses produced solid EBITDA gains for the quarter.
Jim will take you through all of this in detail shortly. Before he does, I want to address the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
Please turn to Slide 5. CBRE, like the rest of the commercial real estate services industry, was affected by the high degree of uncertainty in the U.K. market leading up to the referendum on June 23. This can be seen in the nearly 40% drop in U.K. market-wide property sales volumes in Q2, according to CBRE research. However, the effect on CBRE's U.K. revenue was materially less pronounced. In local currency, CBRE's total U.K. fee revenue increased 12%. Without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business, U.K. fee revenue in local currency was just 5% below Q2 2015, which had been up 32% over Q2 of the prior year. This performance highlights how significantly our U.K. business has evolved in recent years. During the first half of 2016, occupier outsourcing and property management, which is sticky recurring revenue, accounted for 69% of U.K. fee revenue versus just 19% in the first half of 2013. This shift in our U.K. revenue mix has been driven by our acquisitions of Norland in late 2013 and Global WorkPlace Solutions in September 2015 and positions us well as the U.K. goes about resetting its relationship with the European Union.
Please turn to Slide 6. CBRE expects continued near-term hesitancy among occupiers about space decisions in the U.K., particularly in London. We expect a modest increase in property yields, reflecting the higher perceived risk of holding U.K. property. However, this increase may be temporary, especially for top-tier assets, due to the inherent attractiveness of the U.K. market. In addition, the decline in the value of sterling against the U.S. dollar should provide some incremental support for foreign investments into the U.K. over time. We also anticipate a delay in some office development activity, which should provide longer-term support for property prices as well as rent, particularly in Central London, where availability stands at just 3%.
We are monitoring Brexit-related developments closely. There's a long road ahead, but the swift resolution of the political leadership in Britain is an encouraging sign. Given our clear leadership position, CBRE is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the U.K. and across Europe. We are firmly focused on continuing to support our European business and clients.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will discuss our second quarter results in detail."

Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our financial results. Fee revenue rose 20% in local currency to $2.1 billion or 3% organic growth in fee revenue without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business and ot",935,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our financial results. Fee revenue rose 20% in local currency to $2.1 billion or 3% organic growth in fee revenue without the contributions from the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions business and other M&A. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $360 million, a 19% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q2. Margin on fee revenue was 17%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 24% to $0.52 for the quarter. Q2's results include $4 million of net benefit to adjusted EBITDA from currency movement, including gains on hedges. This compares to a net unfavorable impact of $14 million in the second quarter of 2015. Q2 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $360 million includes adjustments for $28 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions and $27 million incurred in connection with cost elimination program that we discussed in the prior 2 quarters.
Please turn to Slide 8 regarding Q2 results for our 3 regional service segments, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 18% in the Americas, 31% in EMEA and 18% in Asia Pacific. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions, fee revenue increased 6% in the Americas and was essentially flat in both EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our business mix. Our business mix continues to evolve towards greater contractual revenue. For the company as a whole, contractual fee revenue was 44% of total fee revenue, up from 34% in Q2 2015 and 19% in Q2 2006.
Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q2. All percentages increases are in local currency. Occupier outsourcing continued to exhibit strong growth. Global fee revenue was up 118%, aided by the acquisition of Global WorkPlace Solutions. Without contributions from this acquisition, fee revenue rose 10%. Commercial mortgage services had a very good quarter with revenue up 14%, led by private lenders, particularly banks, and continued growth with government-sponsored enterprises. Leasing achieved good growth in the Americas, which was up 8%, and Asia Pacific, which rose 7%. We continue to benefit from the influx of producers choosing to join CBRE.
In the Americas, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. all turned in healthy performances, while Asia Pac was led by Greater China, India and New Zealand. Leasing was down 11% in EMEA as growth in Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands and Spain partially offset a decline in the U.K. Property sales revenue rose 2% in the Americas, while EMEA and Asia Pacific both declined 16%. This compares with an exceptionally strong Q2 2015 when year-on-year growth rates were 25% in the Americas, 62% in EMEA and 24% in Asia Pacific.
Q2 2016 property sales revenue in the U.K. declined by approximately 1/3. CBRE continued to make gains in property sales as evidenced by our 150 basis point market share increase in the U.S. during Q2, according to RCA.
Fee revenue from property management services, which we call asset services, increased by 7%. Valuation revenue was essentially unchanged.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which we reported within the 3 regional service segments. Finance interest in our outsourcing offering remains high. This can be seen in the 96 total contracts we signed during Q2, including 37 with new clients. Notably, more than 1/3 of these new clients were in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Evidence to the outsourcing is gaining more traction in overseas markets.
Our engagements often span multiple geographies and services. CBRE is well positioned to serve complex, multi-market requirements with our clients with the acquired Global WorkPlace Solutions expertise firmly embedded in our outsourcing business.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business line increased to $26 million. The business continues to attract significant capital commitments. We raised $1.8 billion of new -- in new equity in Q2 and $7.1 billion in the trailing 12 months. Assets under management totaled $88.6 billion, up $3.9 billion from a year ago in local currency. However, all but $200 million of this increase was offset by foreign currency movement over the past year.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Development Services segment. Strong performance in this business continued in Q2. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $19 million for the quarter, while pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, increased to $46 million. These strong results in the quarter were helped by the timing of asset sales. We note that these development asset sales accounting for -- accounted for the vast majority of our equity earnings for the quarter. Due to the timing of project sales, we expect results for the remainder of the year to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, with a significantly lighter third quarter. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $1.1 billion from Q2 2015. The pipeline of $3 billion was down $700 million from a year ago as projects converted from pipeline to in-process.
Please turn to Slide 14. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to briefly highlight our results for the first half of 2016. These results are strong, including growth rates of 24% in fee revenue in local currency, 17% in adjusted EBITDA and 21% in adjusted earnings per share. This growth is particularly notable coming at a time when average earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to decline in Q2 2016 for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Please turn to Slide 15 for Bob's closing remarks."

As you've seen, our business has performed very well in the first half of 2016, even with a decline in market-wide property sales volumes compared to a year ago. It is important to note that market fundamentals in commercial real estate remain in good shape, with the impact of Brexit largely limited to property transactions activity in the U.K., and we anticipate solid earnings growth for the year. Looking ahead, we are adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. This is due principally to the impact of Brexit on U.K. property transaction volumes and less visibility around the timing of the realization of certain tenants in our Global Investment Management business and Development Services business. These factors have caused us to reduce our earnings guidance by 3% at the top end of our range and by 5% at the bottom end. This results in expected adjusted EPS for the calendar year of $2.15 to $2.30, which represents solid growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range. We see adjusted EPS in the second half of 2016 more weighted to Q4 rather than Q3 compared with our customary progression of earnings throughout the year.
As the clear market leader, CBRE is well positioned to further extend our competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our ongoing talent and technology initiatives, collaborative culture, market-leading service offering and financial strength uniquely position us to satisfy clients' growing demand for our services.

That's very typical of those accounts. So it's a mixed bag. The way we generally view these big outsourcing accounts when we take them on, they tend -- they're getting larger and larger, so it's not uncommon anymore for us to take on a client and grow it to be a multi-hundred-million dollar revenue source for the company. We almost view these incremental accounts as starting new little businesses within our company. So you start them -- when you start them, there's something there, and then you do a good job and you grow them.

Our results are solid and largely in line with our, and the markets', expectations. Our performance is notable when viewed against the exceptionally strong growth we posted in last year's Q3 and a backdrop of lower property sales volumes in most markets. In this environment, CBRE's premier position in commercial real estate with a deep, diverse market-leading service offering continues to serve us and our clients well. 
Occupier outsourcing, our largest business line, saw fee revenue growth of 16% or better in local currency in each of our 3 regions before contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This acquisition, which we completed 13 months ago, has fortified our capabilities and given us an advantage position serving occupier clients. The diversity and depth of our service offering helps set CBRE apart from others in our sector. 
Another way we're distinguishing ourselves is through the strategic gains we're making across the company. Our investments in people, digital initiatives, specialized consulting services and other capabilities are driving growth and enhancing CBRE's ability to deliver highly differentiated client outcomes.

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. As Bob noted, Q3 was a solid quarter against an exceptionally strong Q3 of 2015. To put this into perspective, we achieved growth rates in Q3 2015 of 21% in fee revenue and 24%",1565,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. As Bob noted, Q3 was a solid quarter against an exceptionally strong Q3 of 2015. To put this into perspective, we achieved growth rates in Q3 2015 of 21% in fee revenue and 24% in adjusted EBITDA, both in local currency, and 28% in adjusted EPS. 
In Q3 of 2016, fee revenue of $2.1 billion was up 11% in local currency from Q3 2015. Organic growth without the contributions from acquisitions, including the Global Workplace Solutions business, increased 1%. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $349 million, a 1% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q3 or 5% increase without the impact of currency movements, including hedging. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue for the quarter was solid at 16.5% despite headwinds versus prior year Q3 from reduced carried interest, decreased property sales and increased cost to retain and attract talent. 
Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.50 for the quarter. 
Comparing Q3 2016 results for the year earlier quarter, currency movement, including hedges, had a negative impact of $12.9 million to adjusted EBITDA and $0.03 to adjusted EPS. Without this impact, adjusted EPS was up 4%. 
Q3 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $349 million includes $38.9 million incurred in connection with the cost elimination program that we discussed in the prior 3 quarters. This program is now complete. It also includes $28.6 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. 
In Q3, we continue to maintain our investment discipline around M&A as we have seen pricing increase on less stable income streams during 2016. We remain actively engaged in the market but are willing to step aside when price or terms are out of step with our underwriting criteria. 
In a similar vein, recruiting in the sales and leasing businesses continued at a measured pace. As noted on prior calls, we have tightened underwriting and reduced our net recruiting significantly versus the pace of the last few years. Nonetheless, we expect to add hundreds of producers, net of departures this year, while maintaining by far the highest EBITDA margins among the diversified services providers. 
Please turn to Slide 6, regarding Q3 results for our 3 regional services segments, all on local currency. Fee revenue increased 25% in EMEA and 9% in both the Americas and Asia Pacific. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, fee revenue increased 8% in EMEA and 3% in the Americas, but declined 2% in Asia Pacific. After removing the effect of foreign currency, including hedging in both Q3 '16 and 2015, adjusted EBITDA increased 19% in EMEA and 6% in the Americas, while decreasing 8% in Asia Pacific. 
Our strong performance in EMEA this quarter highlights the steps we have taken in recent years to strengthen our position. A material slowdown in transaction activity in the U.K., our largest market in the region, was more than offset by the results from 3 areas of focus: Number one, significant growth in our outsourcing business; two, the strength of our business in Continental Europe, which is benefiting from an enhanced leadership team; and three, run rate operating savings from our proactive cost elimination program, which began a year ago and is now complete. 
In the U.K., overall gross revenue and fee revenue grew 20% and 12%, respectively, or 8% and 2%, excluding the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This growth occurred despite the slowdown in the U.K. transaction market in the wake of Brexit. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of our business mix. The company's business mix has evolved significantly in recent years. Contractual fee revenue comprised 42% of total fee revenue for the company as a whole. This compares with 37% in Q3 2015 and 20% in Q3 2006. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a review of our major global lines of business. In Q3, all percentage increases are in local currency. As Bob mentioned, occupier outsourcing indeed a very strong growth. Organic fee revenue rose 19% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions accounts. Strength was exhibited around the world with fee revenue growth rates, ex the Global Workforce Global Workplace Solutions acquisition of 16% in the Americas, 21% in EMEA and 25% in Asia Pacific. 
Property sales activity was healthy by historical standards, but global sales revenue declined 7% compared with a very strong Q3 2015 when our global sales revenue rose 19%. 
In Q3 2016, EMEA saw strong growth in France, The Netherlands and Switzerland, which offset continued weakness in property sales in the U.K. in the wake of Brexit. 
Commercial mortgage services rose 24% driven by gains from mortgage servicing rights and increased loan originations for the government-sponsored enterprises to provide financing to multifamily assets. 
Year-to-date, capital markets revenues were up 2%. In light of lower sales revenue in Q3 and the impact of Brexit discussed last quarter, we now expect our capital markets revenues to be flat to slightly up for the year. 
Leasing revenue grew 2% in Q3 compared with largely flat global market volumes and a very strong Q3 for CBRE in 2015, which saw leasing up 12% globally. Year-to-date, our leasing revenues are up 7% globally. 
In the Americas, robust growth in Brazil, Canada and Mexico offset flat performance in the U.S. in Q3. Year-to-date leasing revenue in the Americas has increased 9%. In Asia Pacific, leasing revenue increased 4% in Q3, led by Greater China, Japan and Singapore. Leasing in EMEA rose 3%, a turnaround from a decline in Q2. A number of countries showed strength notably France, Ireland, Poland and Switzerland. 
Fee revenue from property management services increased by 2%. Valuation revenue was essentially unchanged for the quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional service segments. This business' ongoing appeal to large space users can be seen in the 113 total outsourcing contracts, including facility management, project management and transaction management signed during Q3, including 52 expansions of client -- existing client relationships, a company record. 
In our outsourcing business, gross revenue, as determined under GAAP, depends on the contracts structure while there's typically no impact on the calculation of fee revenue. As we harmonize contract structures and renewals of legacy JCI Global Workplace Solutions clients, we will likely continue to experience different growth rates over time for gross and fee revenue. We believe fee revenue generally provide a more consistent view of revenue growth. 
We continue to make great inroads in the health care sector, an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. We signed 16 total contracts in this sector in Q3 adding new clients like [indiscernible] hospital and Mount Sinai Health System, while expanding our work for existing clients such as Johns Hopkins. 
We're also well positioned to capture integrated multiservice, multi-geography mandates. One recent example was ExxonMobile [ph] which selected CBRE to provide integrated facilities, project and transaction management services throughout Asia Pacific and the Americas. 
CBRE's capabilities enable us to create competitive advantage for our global clients and in turn, drive growth opportunities in our outsourcing and the transaction businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business totaled $19 million, down from a particularly strong Q3 of 2015. This decrease was driven by the timing of carried interest. Just $2 million of carried interest revenue was realized in the current quarter compared with $19 million in the prior year period. 
Attesting to the strong returns this business line generates for its clients, total equity commitments in Q3 rose to $2.1 billion, the highest level in 9 quarters. Total equity raised over the past 12 months increased to $7.4 billion. 
Assets under management totaled $87.9 billion, up $5 billion from a year ago in local currency. Foreign currency movement over the past year limited the increase to $1.9 billion in U.S. dollars. This reflects the fact that approximately 60% of our AUM, excluding securities, is in Europe and is generally denominated in euros and pounds sterling. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. This business continue to perform well. Adjusted EBITDA totaled nearly $16 million for Q3, while pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests increased to $43 million. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $400 million from Q3 2015. 
The new projects pipeline totaled $3.7 billion, down $300 million from a year ago as projects have converted from pipeline to in-process. 
Now looking at our Development Services and investment segments together. As noted in the last quarter, we continue to see some uncertainty as to the timing of the realization of incentives. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to briefly highlight our results for the first 9 months of 2016. Fee revenue increased 19% and adjusted EBITDA rose 12%, both in local currency. Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% or 13% without the effects of currency changes, including hedging. This strong performance was on top of an exceptional growth for the first 9 months of 2015 when we achieved growth rates of 24% for adjusted EBITDA and 30% per adjusted EPS, both without the effects of currency, including hedging. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE has continued to produce strong results for our shareholders as we invest in our people and platform, including digital initiatives to drive long-term growth and create superior outcomes for our clients. Commercial real estate fundamentals remain healthy in most parts of the world and the global economy continues to grow at a modest pace. CBRE as the clear market leader is well positioned to achieve strong long-term financial performance and widen our competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
We continue to expect adjusted EPS for the full year of $2.15 to $2.30, which represents solid growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range on top of an exceptional performance in 2015. 
Before we close, you'll note that this morning, we announced an authorization to repurchase up to $250 million of our shares over the next 3 years. The strength of our balance sheet, considerable cash flow and resiliency of our business gives us the flexibility to return capital to our shareholders, while continuing to meet long-term growth-oriented investments. 
With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions."

We grew very dramatically on the continent as a result of some of the things that Jim talked about in his prepared remarks.

But against the backdrop from last year, where we and the market grew dramatically, it seems fairly muted. We expect there to continue to be solid activity.

By now you've read our press release detailing CBRE's financial results for the third quarter of 2016, which Jim will discuss shortly. 
Our results are solid and largely in line with our and the markets' expectations. Our performance is notable when viewed against the exceptionally strong growth we posted in last year's Q3 and a backdrop of lower property sales volumes in most markets. In this environment, CBRE's premier position in commercial real estate with a deep, diverse market-leading service offering continues to serve us and our clients well. Occupier outsourcing, our largest business line, saw a fee revenue growth of 16% or better in local currency in each of our 3 regions before contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This acquisition, which we competed -- completed 13 months ago, has fortified our capabilities and given us an advantaged position serving occupier clients. The diversity and depth of our service offering helps set CBRE apart from others in our sector. 
Another way we're distinguishing ourselves is through the strategic gains we're making across the company. Our investments in people, digital initiatives, specialized consulting services and other capabilities are driving growth and enhancing CBRE's ability to deliver highly differentiated client outcomes. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a detailed review of our third quarter results."

In Q3 of 2016, fee revenue of $2.1 billion was up 11% in local currency from Q3 2015. Organic growth without the contributions from acquisitions, including the Global Workplace Solutions business, increased 1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $349 million, a 1% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q3 or 5% increase without the impact of currency movements, including hedging. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue for the quarter was solid at 16.5% despite headwinds versus prior year Q3 from reduced carried interest, decreased property sales and increased cost to retain and attract talent. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.50 for the quarter. 
Comparing Q3 2016 results for the year-earlier quarter, currency movement, including hedges, had a negative impact of $12.9 million to adjusted EBITDA and $0.03 to adjusted EPS. Without this impact, adjusted EPS was up 4%. 
Q3 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $349 million includes $38.9 million incurred in connection with the cost elimination program that we discussed in the prior 3 quarters. This program is now complete. It also includes $28.6 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. 
In Q3, we continue to maintain our investment discipline around M&A as we have seen pricing increase on less stable income streams during 2016. We remain actively engaged in the market but are willing to step aside when price or terms are out of step with our underwriting criteria. 
In a similar vein, recruiting in the sales and leasing business continued at a measured pace. As noted on prior calls, we have tightened underwriting and reduced our net recruiting significantly versus the pace of the last few years. Nonetheless, we expect to add hundreds of producers, net of departures, this year while maintaining by far the highest EBITDA margins among the diversified services providers. 
Please turn to Slide 6 regarding Q3 results for our 3 regional services segment, all on local currency. Fee revenue increased 25% in EMEA and 9% in both the Americas and Asia Pacific. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, fee revenue increased 8% in EMEA and 3% in the Americas but declined 2% in Asia Pacific. After removing the effect of foreign currency, including hedging, in both Q3 '16 and 2015, adjusted EBITDA increased 19% in EMEA and 6% in the Americas while decreasing 8% in Asia Pacific. 
Our strong performance in EMEA this quarter highlights the steps we have taken in recent years to strengthen our position. A material slowdown in transaction activity in the U.K., our largest market in the region, was more than offset by the results from 3 areas of focus: number one, significant growth in our outsourcing business; two, the strength of our business in Continental Europe, which is benefiting from an enhanced leadership team; and three, run rate operating savings from our proactive cost elimination program, which began a year ago and is now complete. 
In the U.K., overall gross revenue and fee revenue grew 20% and 12%, respectively; or 8% and 2%, excluding the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This growth occurred despite the slowdown in the U.K. transaction market in the wake of Brexit. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of our business mix. The company's business mix has evolved significantly in recent years. Contractual fee revenue comprised 42% of total fee revenue for the company as a whole. This compares with 37% in Q3 2015 and 20% in Q3 2006. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a review of our major global lines of business. In Q3, all percentage increases are in local currency. As Bob mentioned, occupier outsourcing exhibited a very strong growth. Organic fee revenue rose 19% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions accounts. Strength was exhibited around the world, with fee revenue growth rates, ex the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, of 16% in the Americas, 21% in EMEA and 25% in Asia Pacific. 
Property sales activity was healthy by historical standards, but global sales revenue declined 7% compared with a very strong Q3 2015 when our global sales revenue rose 19%. 
In Q3 2016, EMEA saw strong growth in France, The Netherlands and Switzerland, which offset continued weakness in property sales in the U.K. in the wake of Brexit. 
Commercial mortgage services rose 24%, driven by gains from mortgage servicing rights and increased loan originations for the government-sponsored enterprises to provide financing to multifamily assets. 
Year-to-date, capital markets revenues were up 2%. In light of lower sales revenue in Q3 and the impact of Brexit discussed last quarter, we now expect our capital markets revenues to be flat to slightly up for the year. 
Leasing revenue grew 2% in Q3 compared with largely flat global market volumes and a very strong Q3 for CBRE in 2015, which saw leasing up 12% globally. Year-to-date, our leasing revenues are up 7% globally. In the Americas, robust growth in Brazil, Canada and Mexico offset flat performance in the U.S. in Q3. Year-to-date leasing revenue in the Americas has increased 9%. In Asia Pacific, leasing revenue increased 4% in Q3, led by Greater China, Japan and Singapore. Leasing in EMEA rose 3%, a turnaround from a decline in Q2. A number of countries showed strength, notably France, Ireland, Poland and Switzerland. 
Fee revenue from property management services increased by 2%. Valuation revenue was essentially unchanged for the quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional service segments. This business' ongoing appeal to large space users can be seen in the 113 total outsourcing contracts, including facility management, project management and transaction management signed during Q3, including 52 expansions of client -- existing client relationships, a company record. 
In our outsourcing business, gross revenue, as determined under GAAP, depends on the contract structure while there's typically no impact on the calculation of fee revenue. As we harmonized contract structures and renewals of legacy JCI Global Workplace Solution clients, we will likely continue to experience different growth rates over time for gross and fee revenue. We believe fee revenue generally provides a more consistent view of revenue growth. 
We continue to make great inroads in the health care sector, an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. We signed 16 total contracts in this sector in Q3, adding new clients like Brigham and Women's Hospital and Mount Sinai Health System while expanding our work for existing clients such as Johns Hopkins. 
We're also well positioned to capture integrated multiservice, multi-geography mandates. One recent example was ExxonMobil, which selected CBRE to provide integrated facilities, project and transaction management services throughout Asia Pacific and the Americas. 
CBRE's capabilities enable us to create competitive advantage for our global clients and, in turn, drive growth opportunities in our outsourcing and transaction businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business totaled $19 million, down from a particularly strong Q3 of 2015. This decrease was driven by the timing of carried interest. Just $2 million of carried interest revenue was realized in the current quarter compared with $19 million in the prior year period. Attesting to the strong returns this business line generates for its clients, total equity commitments in Q3 rose to $2.1 billion, the highest level in 9 quarters. Total equity raised over the past 12 months increased to $7.4 billion. 
Assets under management totaled $87.9 billion, up $5 billion from a year ago in local currency. Foreign currency movement over the past year limited the increase to $1.9 billion in U.S. dollars. This reflects the fact that approximately 60% of our AUM, excluding securities, is in Europe and is generally denominated in euros and pound sterling. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. This business continue to perform well. Adjusted EBITDA totaled nearly $16 million for Q3 while pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, increased to $43 million. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $400 million from Q3 2015. The new projects pipeline totaled $3.7 billion, down $300 million from a year ago as projects have converted from pipeline to in-process. When looking at our Development Services and investment segments together, as noted in the last quarter, we continue to see some uncertainty as to the timing of the realization of incentives. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to briefly highlight our results for the first 9 months of 2016. Fee revenue increased 19%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 12%, both in local currency. Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% or 13% without the effects of currency changes, including hedging. This strong performance was on top of an exceptional growth for the first 9 months of 2015 when we achieved growth rates of 24% for adjusted EBITDA and 30% for adjusted EPS, both without the effects of currency, including hedging. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE has continued to produce strong results for our shareholders as we invest in our people and platform, including digital initiatives, to drive long-term growth and create superior outcomes for our clients. Commercial real estate fundamentals remain healthy in most parts of the world, and the global economy continues to grow at a modest pace. CBRE, as the clear market leader, is well positioned to achieve strong long-term financial performance and widen our competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
We continue to expect adjusted EPS for the full year of $2.15 to $2.30, which represents solid growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range on top of an exceptional performance in 2015. 
Before we close, you'll note that this morning, we announced an authorization to repurchase up to $250 million of our shares over the next 3 years. The strength of our balance sheet, considerable cash flow and resiliency of our business gives us the flexibility to return capital to our shareholders while continuing to make long-term growth-oriented investments. 
With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions."

Opportunities are out there. But we have felt that pricing was getting heady and that the income streams that were being priced were less certain. And as a result, we've pulled back on deal volume that we've been closing, we've stepped away from deals where we had the last shot to make the deal, we just didn't think the economic returns, that risk/reward ratio was right.

By now you've read our press release detailing CBRE's financial results for the third quarter of 2016, which Jim will discuss shortly. 
Our results are solid and largely in line with our and the markets' expectations. Our performance is notable when viewed against the exceptionally strong growth we posted in last year's Q3 and a backdrop of lower property sales volumes in most markets. In this environment, CBRE's premier position in commercial real estate, with a deep, diverse market-leading service offering continues to serve us and our clients well. Occupier outsourcing, our largest business line, saw fee revenue growth of 16% or better in local currency in each of our 3 regions before contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This acquisition, which we competed -- completed 13 months ago, has fortified our capabilities and given us an advantaged position serving occupier clients. The diversity and depth of our service offering helps to set CBRE apart from others in our sector. 
Another way we're distinguishing ourselves is through the strategic gains we're making across the company. Our investments in people, digital initiatives, specialized consulting services and other capabilities are driving growth and enhancing CBRE's ability to deliver highly differentiated client outcomes. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a detailed review of our third quarter results."

Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. As Bob noted, Q3 was a solid quarter against an exceptionally strong Q3 of 2015. To put this into perspective, we achieved growth rates in Q3 2015 of 21% in fee revenue and 24%",1563,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. As Bob noted, Q3 was a solid quarter against an exceptionally strong Q3 of 2015. To put this into perspective, we achieved growth rates in Q3 2015 of 21% in fee revenue and 24% in adjusted EBITDA, both in local currency, and 28% in adjusted EPS. 
In Q3 of 2016, fee revenue of $2.1 billion was up 11% in local currency from Q3 2015. Organic growth without the contributions from acquisitions, including the Global Workplace Solutions business, increased 1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $349 million, a 1% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q3 or a 5% increase without the impact of currency movements, including hedging. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue for the quarter was solid at 16.5% despite headwinds versus prior year Q3 from reduced carried interest, decreased property sales and increased costs to retain and attract talent. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.50 for the quarter. 
Comparing Q3 2016 results for the year-earlier quarter, currency movement, including hedges, had a negative impact of $12.9 million to adjusted EBITDA and $0.03 to adjusted EPS. Without this impact, adjusted EPS was up 4%. 
Q3 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $349 million includes $38.9 million incurred in connection with the cost elimination program that we discussed in the prior 3 quarters. This program is now complete. It also includes $28.6 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. 
In Q3, we continued to maintain our investment discipline around M&A as we have seen pricing increase on less stable income streams during 2016. We remain actively engaged in the market but are willing to step aside when price or terms are out of step with our underwriting criteria. 
In a similar vein, recruiting in the sales and leasing business continued at a measured pace. As noted on prior calls, we have tightened underwriting and reduced our net recruiting significantly versus the pace of the last few years. Nonetheless, we expect to add hundreds of producers, net of departures, this year while maintaining by far the highest EBITDA margins among the diversified services providers. 
Please turn to Slide 6 regarding Q3 results for our 3 regional services segment, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 25% in EMEA and 9% in both the Americas and Asia Pacific. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, fee revenue increased 8% in EMEA and 3% in the Americas but declined 2% in Asia Pacific. After removing the effect of foreign currency, including hedging, in both Q3 '16 and 2015, adjusted EBITDA increased 19% in EMEA and 6% in the Americas while decreasing 8% in Asia Pacific. 
Our strong performance in EMEA this quarter highlights the steps we have taken in recent years to strengthen our position. A material slowdown in transaction activity in the U.K., our largest market in the region, was more than offset by the results from 3 areas of focus: number one, significant growth in our outsourcing business; two, the strength of our business in Continental Europe, which is benefiting from an enhanced leadership team; and three, run rate operating savings from our proactive cost elimination program, which began a year ago and is now complete. 
In the U.K., overall gross revenue and fee revenue grew 20% and 12%, respectively; or 8% and 2%, excluding the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This growth occurred despite the slowdown in the U.K. transaction market in the wake of Brexit. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of our business mix. The company's business mix has evolved significantly in recent years. Contractual fee revenue comprised 42% of total fee revenue for the company as a whole. This compares with 37% in Q3 2015 and 20% in Q3 2006. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q3. All percentage increases are in local currency. As Bob mentioned, occupier outsourcing exhibited very strong growth. Organic fee revenue rose 19% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions accounts. Strength was exhibited around the world, with fee revenue growth rates, ex the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, of 16% in the Americas, 21% in EMEA and 25% in Asia Pacific. 
Property sales activity was healthy by historical standards, but global sales revenue declined 7% compared with a very strong Q3 2015, when our global sales revenue rose 19%. 
In Q3 2016, EMEA saw strong growth in France, The Netherlands and Switzerland, which offset continued weakness in property sales in the U.K. in the wake of Brexit. 
Commercial mortgage services rose 24%, driven by gains from mortgage servicing rights and increased loan originations for the government-sponsored enterprises to provide financing to multifamily assets. 
Year-to-date, capital markets revenues were up 2%. In light of lower sales revenue in Q3 and the impact of Brexit discussed last quarter, we now expect our capital markets revenues to be flat to slightly up for the year. 
Leasing revenue grew 2% in Q3 compared with largely flat global market volumes and a very strong Q3 for CBRE in 2015, which saw leasing up 12% globally. Year-to-date, our leasing revenues are up 7% globally. In the Americas, robust growth in Brazil, Canada and Mexico offset flat performance in the U.S. in Q3. Year-to-date, leasing revenue in the Americas has increased 9%. In Asia Pacific, leasing revenue increased 4% in Q3, led by Greater China, Japan and Singapore. Leasing in EMEA rose 3%, a turnaround from a decline in Q2. A number of countries showed strength, notably France, Ireland, Poland and Switzerland. 
Fee revenue from property management services increased by 2%. Valuation revenue was essentially unchanged for the quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional service segments. This business' ongoing appeal to large space users can be seen in the 113 total outsourcing contracts, including facility management, project management and transaction management, signed during Q3, including 52 expansions of client -- existing client relationships, a company record. 
In our outsourcing business, gross revenue, as determined under GAAP, depends on the contract structure while there's typically no impact on the calculation of fee revenue. As we harmonize contract structures and renewals of legacy JCI Global Workplace Solution clients, we will likely continue to experience different growth rates over time for gross and fee revenue. We believe fee revenue generally provides a more consistent view of revenue growth. 
We continue to make great inroads in the health care sector, an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. We signed 16 total contracts in this sector in Q3, adding new clients like Brigham and Women's Hospital and Mount Sinai Health System while expanding our work for existing clients such as Johns Hopkins. 
We are also well positioned to capture integrated multiservice, multi-geography mandates. One recent example was ExxonMobil, which selected CBRE to provide integrated facilities, project and transaction management services throughout Asia Pacific and the Americas. 
CBRE's capabilities enable us to create competitive advantage for our global clients and, in turn, drive growth opportunities in our outsourcing and transaction businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business totaled $19 million, down from a particularly strong Q3 of 2015. This decrease was driven by the timing of carried interest. Just $2 million of carried interest revenue was realized in the current quarter compared with $19 million in the prior year period. Attesting to the strong returns this business line generates for its clients, total equity commitments in Q3 rose to $2.1 billion, the highest level in 9 quarters. Total equity raised over the past 12 months increased to $7.4 billion. 
Assets under management totaled $87.9 billion, up $5 billion from a year ago in local currency. Foreign currency movement over the past year limited the increase to $1.9 billion in U.S. dollars. This reflects the fact that approximately 60% of our AUM, excluding securities, is in Europe and is generally denominated in euros and pounds sterling. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. This business continued to perform well. Adjusted EBITDA totaled nearly $16 million for Q3, while pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, increased to $43 million. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $400 million from Q3 2015. The new projects pipeline totaled $3.7 billion, down $300 million from a year ago as projects have converted from pipeline to in-process. When looking at our Development Services and investment segments together, as noted in the last quarter, we continue to see some uncertainty as to the timing of the realization of incentives. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to briefly highlight our results for the first 9 months of 2016. Fee revenue increased 19%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 12%, both in local currency. Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% or 13% without the effects of currency changes, including hedging. This strong performance was on top of an exceptional growth for the first 9 months of 2015, when we achieved growth rates of 24% for adjusted EBITDA and 30% for adjusted EPS, both without the effects of currency, including hedging. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE has continued to produce strong results for our shareholders as we invest in our people and platform, including digital initiatives, to drive long-term growth and create superior outcomes for our clients.

CBRE, as the clear market leader, is well positioned to achieve strong long-term financial performance and widen our competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
We continue to expect adjusted EPS for the full year of $2.15 to $2.30, which represents solid growth of approximately 9% at the midpoint of the range on top of an exceptional performance in 2015. 
Before we close, you'll note that this morning, we announced an authorization to repurchase up to $250 million of our shares over the next 3 years. The strength of our balance sheet, considerable cash flow and resiliency of our business gives us the flexibility to return capital to our shareholders while continuing to make long-term growth-oriented investments.

By now you've read our press release detailing CBRE's financial results for the third quarter of 2016, which Jim will discuss shortly. 
Our results are solid and largely in line with our and the markets' expectations. Our performance is notable when viewed against the exceptionally strong growth we posted in last year's Q3 and a backdrop of lower property sales volumes in most markets. In this environment, CBRE's premier position in commercial real estate, with a deep, diverse market-leading service offering continues to serve us and our clients well. Occupier outsourcing, our largest business line, saw fee revenue growth of 16% or better in local currency in each of our 3 regions before contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This acquisition, which we competed -- completed 13 months ago, has fortified our capabilities and given us an advantaged position serving occupier clients. The diversity and depth of our service offering helps to set CBRE apart from others in our sector. 
Another way we're distinguishing ourselves is through the strategic gains we're making across the company. Our investments in people, digital initiatives, specialized consulting services and other capabilities are driving growth and enhancing CBRE's ability to deliver highly differentiated client outcomes. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a detailed review of our third quarter results."
4204816,404118539,1064474,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. As Bob noted, Q3 was a solid quarter against an exceptionally strong Q3 of 2015. To put this into perspective, we achieved growth rates in Q3 2015 of 21% in fee revenue and 24%",1563,"Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our financial results. As Bob noted, Q3 was a solid quarter against an exceptionally strong Q3 of 2015. To put this into perspective, we achieved growth rates in Q3 2015 of 21% in fee revenue and 24% in adjusted EBITDA, both in local currency, and 28% in adjusted EPS. 
In Q3 of 2016, fee revenue of $2.1 billion was up 11% in local currency from Q3 2015. Organic growth without the contributions from acquisitions, including the Global Workplace Solutions business, increased 1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $349 million, a 1% increase in U.S. dollars from last year's Q3 or a 5% increase without the impact of currency movements, including hedging. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue for the quarter was solid at 16.5% despite headwinds versus prior year Q3 from reduced carried interest, decreased property sales and increased costs to retain and attract talent. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.50 for the quarter. 
Comparing Q3 2016 results for the year-earlier quarter, currency movement, including hedges, had a negative impact of $12.9 million to adjusted EBITDA and $0.03 to adjusted EPS. Without this impact, adjusted EPS was up 4%. 
Q3 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $349 million includes $38.9 million incurred in connection with the cost elimination program that we discussed in the prior 3 quarters. This program is now complete. It also includes $28.6 million of integration costs relating to the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. 
In Q3, we continued to maintain our investment discipline around M&A as we have seen pricing increase on less stable income streams during 2016. We remain actively engaged in the market but are willing to step aside when price or terms are out of step with our underwriting criteria. 
In a similar vein, recruiting in the sales and leasing business continued at a measured pace. As noted on prior calls, we have tightened underwriting and reduced our net recruiting significantly versus the pace of the last few years. Nonetheless, we expect to add hundreds of producers, net of departures, this year while maintaining by far the highest EBITDA margins among the diversified services providers. 
Please turn to Slide 6 regarding Q3 results for our 3 regional services segment, all in local currency. Fee revenue increased 25% in EMEA and 9% in both the Americas and Asia Pacific. Without contributions from the acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, fee revenue increased 8% in EMEA and 3% in the Americas but declined 2% in Asia Pacific. After removing the effect of foreign currency, including hedging, in both Q3 '16 and 2015, adjusted EBITDA increased 19% in EMEA and 6% in the Americas while decreasing 8% in Asia Pacific. 
Our strong performance in EMEA this quarter highlights the steps we have taken in recent years to strengthen our position. A material slowdown in transaction activity in the U.K., our largest market in the region, was more than offset by the results from 3 areas of focus: number one, significant growth in our outsourcing business; two, the strength of our business in Continental Europe, which is benefiting from an enhanced leadership team; and three, run rate operating savings from our proactive cost elimination program, which began a year ago and is now complete. 
In the U.K., overall gross revenue and fee revenue grew 20% and 12%, respectively; or 8% and 2%, excluding the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. This growth occurred despite the slowdown in the U.K. transaction market in the wake of Brexit. 
Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of our business mix. The company's business mix has evolved significantly in recent years. Contractual fee revenue comprised 42% of total fee revenue for the company as a whole. This compares with 37% in Q3 2015 and 20% in Q3 2006. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q3. All percentage increases are in local currency. As Bob mentioned, occupier outsourcing exhibited very strong growth. Organic fee revenue rose 19% without the contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions accounts. Strength was exhibited around the world, with fee revenue growth rates, ex the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, of 16% in the Americas, 21% in EMEA and 25% in Asia Pacific. 
Property sales activity was healthy by historical standards, but global sales revenue declined 7% compared with a very strong Q3 2015, when our global sales revenue rose 19%. 
In Q3 2016, EMEA saw strong growth in France, The Netherlands and Switzerland, which offset continued weakness in property sales in the U.K. in the wake of Brexit. 
Commercial mortgage services rose 24%, driven by gains from mortgage servicing rights and increased loan originations for the government-sponsored enterprises to provide financing to multifamily assets. 
Year-to-date, capital markets revenues were up 2%. In light of lower sales revenue in Q3 and the impact of Brexit discussed last quarter, we now expect our capital markets revenues to be flat to slightly up for the year. 
Leasing revenue grew 2% in Q3 compared with largely flat global market volumes and a very strong Q3 for CBRE in 2015, which saw leasing up 12% globally. Year-to-date, our leasing revenues are up 7% globally. In the Americas, robust growth in Brazil, Canada and Mexico offset flat performance in the U.S. in Q3. Year-to-date, leasing revenue in the Americas has increased 9%. In Asia Pacific, leasing revenue increased 4% in Q3, led by Greater China, Japan and Singapore. Leasing in EMEA rose 3%, a turnaround from a decline in Q2. A number of countries showed strength, notably France, Ireland, Poland and Switzerland. 
Fee revenue from property management services increased by 2%. Valuation revenue was essentially unchanged for the quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional service segments. This business' ongoing appeal to large space users can be seen in the 113 total outsourcing contracts, including facility management, project management and transaction management, signed during Q3, including 52 expansions of client -- existing client relationships, a company record. 
In our outsourcing business, gross revenue, as determined under GAAP, depends on the contract structure while there's typically no impact on the calculation of fee revenue. As we harmonize contract structures and renewals of legacy JCI Global Workplace Solution clients, we will likely continue to experience different growth rates over time for gross and fee revenue. We believe fee revenue generally provides a more consistent view of revenue growth. 
We continue to make great inroads in the health care sector, an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. We signed 16 total contracts in this sector in Q3, adding new clients like Brigham and Women's Hospital and Mount Sinai Health System while expanding our work for existing clients such as Johns Hopkins. 
We are also well positioned to capture integrated multiservice, multi-geography mandates. One recent example was ExxonMobil, which selected CBRE to provide integrated facilities, project and transaction management services throughout Asia Pacific and the Americas. 
CBRE's capabilities enable us to create competitive advantage for our global clients and, in turn, drive growth opportunities in our outsourcing and transaction businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business totaled $19 million, down from a particularly strong Q3 of 2015. This decrease was driven by the timing of carried interest. Just $2 million of carried interest revenue was realized in the current quarter compared with $19 million in the prior year period. Attesting to the strong returns this business line generates for its clients, total equity commitments in Q3 rose to $2.1 billion, the highest level in 9 quarters. Total equity raised over the past 12 months increased to $7.4 billion. 
Assets under management totaled $87.9 billion, up $5 billion from a year ago in local currency. Foreign currency movement over the past year limited the increase to $1.9 billion in U.S. dollars. This reflects the fact that approximately 60% of our AUM, excluding securities, is in Europe and is generally denominated in euros and pounds sterling. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. This business continued to perform well. Adjusted EBITDA totaled nearly $16 million for Q3, while pro forma revenue, which includes gains on real estate sales, equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, increased to $43 million. Development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $400 million from Q3 2015. The new projects pipeline totaled $3.7 billion, down $300 million from a year ago as projects have converted from pipeline to in-process. When looking at our Development Services and investment segments together, as noted in the last quarter, we continue to see some uncertainty as to the timing of the realization of incentives. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to briefly highlight our results for the first 9 months of 2016. Fee revenue increased 19%, and adjusted EBITDA rose 12%, both in local currency. Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% or 13% without the effects of currency changes, including hedging. This strong performance was on top of an exceptional growth for the first 9 months of 2015, when we achieved growth rates of 24% for adjusted EBITDA and 30% for adjusted EPS, both without the effects of currency, including hedging. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

If we think about the Investment Management business, the type of capital you're raising from the various sources, maybe some color around what the fee structures look like, how sticky the capital may be in terms of what those deals look like versus last year or a couple years ago. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for whether you're seeing things in the capital raised within CBREI that gives you a little either pause, some cause for concern or just gives you a different feel for where your customers may think we are in the cycle versus where a broker's transaction customer might."

I would say with regard to fees in the business, we had fees in Europe, particularly continental -- fee pressure in Europe, particularly Continental Europe, for part of the last few years. We're really not seeing too much of that anymore. I think that's stabilized. We are a core based -- our platform is primarily targeting investment of core properties. We do have value-add funds that are very high performers, but the majority of our AUM is core, core plus. The product tends to be pretty stable and stable fee structures. Sometimes, we'll have an impact on mix. We did have mix change a bit, particularly in Europe, where folks were coming out of the higher fee funds and moving more into separate accounts, where they wanted more control or a core, core plus, that had a little lower fee structure. But generally, I think we're seeing that to be reasonably stable today."

We try not to comment generally on our share price. I would say, the fact that we've had a slower pace over the last 18 months was helpful, in as we think about our capital allocation opportunities, it gave us more comfort that we could do both in building up a little bit of liquidity. But the other factor I would comment on is just the growth in the company over the last few years. Our profitability is up considerably, and the flexibility we have on our balance sheet really gave us comfort that we could do both now. The other thing I'd just reiterate, the opportunities are still out there. It's just the pricing is off. And that doesn't usually last forever, so I expect we'll see more in the future."

We think it's -- it's a strategic initiative for us because we have very much committed to continuing to invest in our strategy through cycle. It was tough to do that in past cycles. That's something that we've addressed very specifically. And so we're focused on cost. We decided a year or so ago that after, at the time, 6-plus years of strong growth, when we were adding all kinds of people and capability, that it was time to kind of scrutinize what we had done and formally address some cost inefficiencies. That was what drove that initiative. It wasn't looking at the market or predicting where the market cycle was going. We completed that program. But we will remain very, very focused on cost management. And if we think we're at a point in time anywhere where we -- we're just carrying too much cost or cost of at the wrong type or we've made investments that we need to pull back on, then we'll get more aggressive.
