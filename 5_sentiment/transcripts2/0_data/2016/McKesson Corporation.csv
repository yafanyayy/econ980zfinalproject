As we've had an opportunity to speak with many of our and investors since we last provided an update just a few weeks ago on January 11, I'll keep my remarks fairly brief this afternoon. In a moment, I'm turn the call over to James, and he will walk you through our results for the third quarter. But before I do, I have 3 key messages I want to leave you with today. 
First, there had been no changes to the fiscal 2016 outlook and preliminary fiscal 2017 outlook, which we've provided on January 11. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90 for fiscal 2016. 
Second, our third quarter results were right in line with our revised expectations. I'm proud of the excellent progress we have made in expanding our global pharmaceutical sourcing scale, delivering operating margin improvements in our Technology Solutions segment and successfully executing on the Celesio acquisition synergies. 
And third, I have great confidence in our future. As we enter the final months of fiscal 2016 and look to the future, I'm as confident as ever in our industry and unique role we play in making the business at healthcare more efficient. I'm confident McKesson, our focus on our innovation and our customer-first mindset has propelled us to be leaders in the markets we serve. And most important, I'm confident in the extraordinary team we have at McKesson were truly the best in the business.
Our businesses are very well positioned, both domestically and internationally. And we have a tremendously strong balance sheet, which we will continue to deploy effectively and strategically to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Year-to-date, we repurchased approximately $850 million of our common stock, we paid nearly $1 billion in long-term debt and made internal capital investments of $417 million and paid $179 million in dividends. We ended the third quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash, and our expectations to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review our third quarter results, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

As John discussed earlier, we've provided our updated view on fiscal 2016 earnings on January 11, and the continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90.
Our results this quarter are consistent with our revised expectations. I will now review our third quarter consolidated financial results. As a reminder, schedule 3 of the accompanying table through our press release includes supplemental constant currency information the outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results. 
During the third quarter and the first 9 months of our fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.11, respectively. Therefore, during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures.
Now let's move to our results for the third quarter. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.18, which excludes 3 items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.
Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on schedules 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues increased 3% for the quarter to $47.9 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were $49 billion, an increase of 5%, led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment.
Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 3% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was flat to the prior year, driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions, primarily reflecting the impact of a weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends, offset by growth across our other domestic and international businesses and continued progress on procurement synergies related to our acquisition of Celesio.
Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by diligent cost management in both segments and the sale of our nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses earlier in the fiscal year.
Adjusted other income was $14 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $87 million decreased 6% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. 
Now moving to taxes. This quarter's adjusted tax rate of 25.5% was driven by both a favorable mix of income and certain favorable discrete tax items, which totaled approximately $0.07, primarily reflecting recent Celesio changes in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29.5%. 
Adjusted income for the quarter was $739 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.18, up 9% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency.
Wrapping up our consolidated results for the third quarter. Diluted weighted average shares decreased 2% year-over-year to 232 million. During the third quarter, we completed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $350 million. And fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock.
Overall, we expect to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment, which reflects a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be 233 million for the full fiscal year.
Now let's turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $47.2 billion were up 3% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $48.3 billion for the third quarter, reflecting growth of 6%. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $39.6 million in the third quarter, up 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues primarily reflect market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical specialty and Canadian businesses, offset primarily by the expiration of a customer contract at the start of the third quarter.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6 billion for the third quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $700 million in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year.
Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.7 billion in the third quarter, down 1% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015, partially offset by continued growth in our U.K. business.
Medical-Surgical revenues were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth in our primary care business, offset by the sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter.
Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit of $2.5 billion decreased 3% on a reported basis and increased 1% on a constant currency basis to $2.6 billion. Overall, the third quarter adjusted gross profit reflected our mix of business, including a growing portion of specialty pharmaceuticals, a weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends when compared to the prior year and continued progress on driving Celesio-related procurement synergies.
Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 5% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, segment operating expense was flat year-over-year, primarily driven by expense management and the sale of the ZEE Medical business during the second quarter.
Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion was flat on a reported basis and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 224 basis points, a decline of 8 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 9 basis points, primarily driven by the adjusted gross profit result.
Generic pricing trends are anticipated to be weaker during the second half of our fiscal year as we outlined on January 11. Therefore, we now expect the Distribution Solutions' segment adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat to the prior year.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $694 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter and the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinics software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts and the sale of the nurse triage business. Third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 7% to $133 million, and the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 19%, representing an increase of 274 basis points versus the prior year.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 2%, representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our payer solutions, relay connectivity and Medical Imaging businesses.
For the full year, we now expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be in the low-20% range.
Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of the given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventories increased by 2 days to 33 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 54 days.
We generated $566 million in cash flow from operations during the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.4 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore. For the 9 months ending December 31, we had $417 million of internal capital spending, repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock, repaid approximately $1 billion in long-term debt and paid $179 million in dividends.
Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. Our outlook assumes a full year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.27 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.31 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.72 and $0.82 per share in LIFO-related adjustments.
In summary, McKesson delivered results consistent with our revised expectations for the quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect to leverage the core operational strength and scale of our leading global businesses and our long-standing portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders, customers and business partners.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Melissa?"

We had a very large customer in the mail business that add some significant year-over-year progress in terms of customer win you saw us benefit from, from a revenue perspective that helped push it into the double digits, in addition to the launches of some of these specialty drugs. So the combination of those 2 events will probably the things that propelled us from a revenue perspective. The 7% from my perspective at least now is where we think the market underlying growth rates are probably running at today. Obviously, there are some minor changes in what we might see from a mixed perspective. And I think to James' point, it's probably a little premature for us to talk about FY '17 revenue forecast, but I think that we're probably going to grow like we are today in line with the market. It's just a question of customer changes that might happen during the year either customers of ours that are winning or losing business or went on cases. Sometimes, we lose a piece of business of the suspect weighted like a large mail-order customer just recently."

So the question here, clearly we try not to feel pressured on any dimension because it may caused you to do something that doesn't make sense. Having said that, as our balance sheet has become healthier, we paid out some of the depth and made the commitments that we said we would make relative to deleveraging. After Celesio, we're very aware of the fact that we now have expanded opportunity to deploy our balance sheet in a portfolio way, and we plan to continue to do so. I would say that the fluctuation, the valuations thus make some opportunities more attractive than others and clearly some of the private companies have might've dreamed of IPOs, et cetera, maybe more available to a conversation to us than they might have been otherwise. And as it relates to putting leverage back on the company, I think the fact that we were able to lever up and then delever again gives us credibility with making our commitments a reality. And I think that the issue of another leg in the stool or transformational deal, including -- we look at any deal that makes sense to us financially and strategically, I don't think we pushed that away from the table. But having said that, synergies are usually more possible on deals that -- and more line of sight deals that are you and one of the segments that we're currently participating in. What I would tell you that our bias is to going to business and we don't currently understand and operate as opposed to something that's far afield than the synergies are based on some expectation that the markets are going to be more attractive, that they're going to go faster.

So is it fair to say that, that's not reflective of long-term industry growth? Or how do you think about long-term industry growth today?"

And the volatility certainly is partially driven by supply and disruption. And so I wish to say that if you could forecast what supply disruptions might occur in the future, maybe you might have the ability to at least have some inclinations to what happens with the branded price or generic price inflation. But I'm really reluctant to speculate on how things may play out. We clearly have given you guidance for the rest of this fiscal year and not mention inflation for both branded and generic. And we've given your thoughts related to fiscal '17 guidance on those 2 dimensions. And I think that we stand by our current speculation on that. But it's just that -- those views are amongst other views we have to take every year on what might happen throughout the year. And we just want to be transparent with you about what we're thinking. So I think that, that's probably most I can say about it.
I understand that we don't have any additional questions in the queue. I know we hit a lot of the subjects in early January, and I appreciate all of the attention that you've paid to these matters and others and for your time on the call today.
As we enter the final few months of our fiscal year and I look to the future, I'm excited about the opportunities I see for us to continue our lead from an innovation perspective and how we can help our customers meet the many challenges that they face. The fundamental strength of McKesson has long been our ability to constantly adapt and grow during times of change and must staying focused on our customers and to your core values. I'll now hand the call to Erin for a further review for upcoming events for the financial for the year."

As we've had an opportunity to speak with many of our and investors since we last provided an update just a few weeks ago on January 11, I'll keep my remarks fairly brief this afternoon. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to James, and he will walk you through our results for the third quarter. But before I do, I have 3 key messages I want to leave you with today. 
First, there have been no changes to the fiscal 2016 outlook and preliminary fiscal 2017 outlook, which we've provided on January 11. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90 for fiscal 2016. 
Second, our third quarter results were right in line with our revised expectations. I'm proud of the excellent progress we have made in expanding our global pharmaceutical sourcing scale, delivering operating margin improvements in our Technology Solutions segment and successfully executing on the Celesio acquisition synergies. 
And third, I have great confidence in our future. As we enter the final months of fiscal 2016 and look to the future, I'm as confident as ever in our industry and the unique role we play in making the business at healthcare more efficient. I'm confident McKesson, our focus on innovation and our customer-first mindset has propelled us to be leaders in the markets we serve. And most important, I'm confident in the extraordinary team we have at McKesson were truly the best in the business.
Our businesses are very well positioned, both domestically and internationally. And we have a tremendously strong balance sheet, which we will continue to deploy effectively and strategically to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Year-to-date, we repurchased approximately $850 million of our common stock, we paid nearly $1 billion in long-term debt and made internal capital investments of $417 million and paid $179 million in dividends. We ended the third quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash, and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review our third quarter results, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

As John discussed earlier, we've provided our updated view on fiscal 2016 earnings on January 11, and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90.
Our results this quarter are consistent with our revised expectations. I will now review our third quarter consolidated financial results. As a reminder, schedule 3 of the accompanying table through our press release includes supplemental constant currency information to outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results. 
During the third quarter and the first 9 months of our fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.11, respectively. Therefore, during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures.
Now let's move to our results for the third quarter. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.18, which excludes 3 items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments.
Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on schedules 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues increased 3% for the quarter to $47.9 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were $49 billion, an increase of 5%, led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment.
Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 3% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was flat to the prior year, driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions, primarily reflecting the impact of a weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends, offset by growth across our other domestic and international businesses and continued progress on procurement synergies related to our acquisition of Celesio.
Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by diligent cost management in both segments and the sale of our nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses earlier in the fiscal year.
Adjusted other income was $14 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $87 million decreased 6% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. 
Now moving to taxes. This quarter's adjusted tax rate of 25.5% was driven by both a favorable mix of income and certain favorable discrete tax items, which totaled approximately $0.07, primarily reflecting recent legislative changes in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29.5%. 
Adjusted income for the quarter was $739 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.18, up 9% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency.
Wrapping up our consolidated results for the third quarter, diluted weighted average shares decreased 2% year-over-year to 232 million. During the third quarter, we completed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $350 million. And fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock.
Overall, we expect to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment, which reflects a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be 233 million for the full fiscal year.
Now let's turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $47.2 billion were up 3% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $48.3 billion for the third quarter, reflecting growth of 6%. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $39.6  billion in the third quarter, up 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues primarily reflect market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, specialty and Canadian businesses, offset primarily by the expiration of a customer contract at the start of the third quarter.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6 billion for the third quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $700 million in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year.
Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.7 billion in the third quarter, down 1% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015, partially offset by continued growth in our U.K. business.
Medical-Surgical revenues were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth in our primary care business, offset by the sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter.
Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit of $2.5 billion decreased 3% on a reported basis and increased 1% on a constant currency basis to $2.6 billion. Overall, the third quarter adjusted gross profit reflected our mix of business, including a growing proportion of specialty pharmaceuticals, a weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends when compared to the prior year and continued progress on driving Celesio-related procurement synergies.
Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 5% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis segment operating expense was flat year-over-year, primarily driven by expense management and the sale of the ZEE Medical business during the second quarter.
Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion was flat on a reported basis and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 224 basis points, a decline of 8 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 9 basis points, primarily driven by the adjusted gross profit result.
Generic pricing trends are anticipated to be weaker during the second half of our fiscal year as we outlined on January 11. Therefore, we now expect the Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat to the prior year.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $694 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter and the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts and the sale of the nurse triage business. Third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 7% to $133 million, and the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 19%, representing an increase of 274 basis points versus the prior year.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 2%, representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our payer solutions, relay connectivity and Medical Imaging businesses.
For the full year we now expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be in the low-20% range.
Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of the given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventories increased by 2 days to 33 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 54 days.
We generated $566 million in cash flow from operations during the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.4 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore. For the 9 months ending December 31, we had $417 million of internal capital spending, repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock, repaid approximately $1 billion in long-term debt and paid $179 million in dividends.
Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. Our outlook assumes a full year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.27 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.31 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.72 and $0.82 per share in LIFO-related adjustments.
In summary, McKesson delivered results consistent with our revised expectations for the quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect to leverage the core operational strength and scale of our leading global businesses and our long-standing portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders, customers and business partners.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.

We had a very large -- we have a very large customer that's in the mail business that had some significant year-over-year progress in terms of customer wins that you saw us benefit from, from a revenue perspective that helped push us into the double digits in addition to the launches of some of these specialty drugs. And so the combination of those 2 events were probably the things that propelled us from a revenue perspective. The 7% from my perspective at least now is more consistent with what we think the market underlying growth rates are probably running at today. Obviously, there are some minor changes in what we might see from a mixed perspective. And I think to James' point, it's probably a little premature for us to talk about FY '17 revenue forecast, but I think that we're probably going to grow like we are today in line with the market. It's just a question of any customer changes that might happen during the year, either customers of ours that are winning or losing business or went on cases. Sometimes, we lose a piece of business like we did with a large mail-order customer just recently."

Clearly we try not to feel pressured on any dimension because it may cause you to do something that doesn't make sense. Having said that, as our balance sheet has become healthier, and we paid out some of the debt and made the commitments that we said we would make relative to delevering after Celesio, we're very aware of the fact that we now have expanded opportunity to deploy our balance sheet in a portfolio way, and we plan to continue to do so. I would say that the fluctuation, the valuations does make some opportunities more attractive than others and clearly even some of the private companies might have dreamed of IPOs, et cetera, maybe more available to a conversation with us and they might have been otherwise. And as it relates to putting leverage back on the company, I think the fact that we were able to lever up and then delever again gives us credibility with making our commitments a reality. And I think that the issue of another leg in the stool or a transformational deal, clearly we look at any deal that makes sense to us financially and strategically. I don't think we push it in a way from the table.

Now obviously, we could be off plus or minus depending on what your view is of the process by which Walgreens will complete the transaction and how that may actually take shape. I would say that we're reluctant to ever comment on what a customer might do when the decision is in their hands. I would say however, that you've seen certain customers of ours, they value the incumbent relationship and continue to enjoy a relationship with McKesson going forward like you do at Target and Omnicare, where the relationship change from a mixed perspective, but we were able to retain at least a portion of the business. I would not take that speculation and apply it necessarily to Walgreens. But I just point that out as certainly an alternative that has some possibility. But other than that not much else I can say on it, Ross."

And that has flowed through in combination with good cost control to -- allows to record much stronger margins with the comment that we think for the full year will be in the low 20s. About 1 point of that margin benefit, of course, remember comes from the sale of our care management business a couple of quarters or so ago. So that's really the story on the technology margins.

And so I wish to say that if you could forecast what supply disruptions might occur in the future, then you might have the ability to at least have some inclinations to what happens with the branded price or generic price inflation. But I'm really reluctant to speculate on how things may play out. We clearly have given you guidance for the rest of this fiscal year on that dimension of inflation, both branded and generic. And we've given you our thoughts relative to fiscal '17 guidance on those 2 dimensions. And I think that we stand by our current speculation on that.

As we enter the final few months of our fiscal year and I look to the future, I'm excited about the opportunities I see for us to continue our lead from an innovation perspective and how we can help our customers meet the many challenges that they face. The fundamental strength of McKesson has long been our ability to constantly adapt and grow during times of change and by staying focused on our customers and true to our core values.

As we've had an opportunity to speak with many of our and investors since we last provided an update just a few weeks ago on January 11, I'll keep my remarks fairly brief this afternoon. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to James, and he will walk you through our results for the third quarter. But before I do, I have 3 key messages I want to leave you with today. 
First, there have been no changes to the fiscal 2016 outlook and preliminary fiscal 2017 outlook, which we've provided on January 11. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90 for fiscal 2016. 
Second, our third quarter results were right in line with our revised expectations. I'm proud of the excellent progress we have made in expanding our global pharmaceutical sourcing scale, delivering operating margin improvements in our Technology Solutions segment and successfully executing on the Celesio acquisition synergies. 
And third, I have great confidence in our future. As we enter the final months of fiscal 2016 and look to the future, I'm as confident as ever in our industry and the unique role we play in making the business at healthcare more efficient. I'm confident McKesson, our focus on innovation and our customer-first mindset has propelled us to be leaders in the markets we serve. And most important, I'm confident in the extraordinary team we have at McKesson were truly the best in the business.
Our businesses are very well positioned, both domestically and internationally. And we have a tremendously strong balance sheet, which we will continue to deploy effectively and strategically to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Year-to-date, we repurchased approximately $850 million of our common stock, we paid nearly $1 billion in long-term debt and made internal capital investments of $417 million and paid $179 million in dividends. We ended the third quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash, and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review our third quarter results, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

As John discussed earlier, we've provided our updated view on fiscal 2016 earnings on January 11, and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90.
Our results this quarter are consistent with our revised expectations. I will now review our third quarter consolidated financial results. As a reminder, schedule 3 of the accompanying table to our press release includes supplemental constant currency information to outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results. 
During the third quarter and the first 9 months of our fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.11, respectively. Therefore, during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures.
Now let's move to our results for the third quarter. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.18, which excludes 3 items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments.
Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on schedules 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues increased 3% for the quarter to $47.9 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were $49 billion, an increase of 5%, led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment.
Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 3% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was flat to the prior year, driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions, primarily reflecting the impact of a weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends, offset by growth across our other domestic and international businesses and continued progress on procurement synergies related to our acquisition of Celesio.
Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by diligent cost management in both segments and the sale of our nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses earlier in the fiscal year.
Adjusted other income was $14 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $87 million decreased 6% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. 
Now moving to taxes. This quarter's adjusted tax rate of 25.5% was driven by both a favorable mix of income and certain favorable discrete tax items, which totaled approximately $0.07, primarily reflecting recent legislative changes in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29.5%. 
Adjusted income for the quarter was $739 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.18, up 9% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency.
Wrapping up our consolidated results for the third quarter, diluted weighted average shares decreased 2% year-over-year to 232 million. During the third quarter, we completed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $350 million. And fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock.
Overall, we expect to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment, which reflects a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be 233 million for the full fiscal year.
Now let's turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $47.2 billion were up 3% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $48.3 billion for the third quarter, reflecting growth of 6%. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $39.6  billion in the third quarter, up 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues primarily reflect market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, specialty and Canadian businesses, offset primarily by the expiration of a customer contract at the start of the third quarter.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6 billion for the third quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $700 million in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year.
Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.7 billion in the third quarter, down 1% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015, partially offset by continued growth in our U.K. business.
Medical-Surgical revenues were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth in our primary care business, offset by the sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter.
Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit of $2.5 billion decreased 3% on a reported basis and increased 1% on a constant currency basis to $2.6 billion. Overall, the third quarter adjusted gross profit reflected our mix of business, including a growing proportion of specialty pharmaceuticals, a weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends when compared to the prior year and continued progress on driving Celesio-related procurement synergies.
Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 5% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis segment operating expense was flat year-over-year, primarily driven by expense management and the sale of the ZEE Medical business during the second quarter.
Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion was flat on a reported basis and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 224 basis points, a decline of 8 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 9 basis points, primarily driven by the adjusted gross profit result.
Generic pricing trends are anticipated to be weaker during the second half of our fiscal year as we outlined on January 11. Therefore, we now expect the Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat to the prior year.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $694 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter and the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts and the sale of the nurse triage business. Third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 7% to $133 million, and the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 19%, representing an increase of 274 basis points versus the prior year.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 2%, representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our payer solutions, relay connectivity and Medical Imaging businesses.
For the full year we now expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be in the low-20% range.
Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of the given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventories increased by 2 days to 33 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 54 days.
We generated $566 million in cash flow from operations during the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.4 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore. For the 9 months ending December 31, we had $417 million of internal capital spending, repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock, repaid approximately $1 billion in long-term debt and paid $179 million in dividends.
Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. Our outlook assumes a full year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.27 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.31 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.72 and $0.82 per share in LIFO-related adjustments.
In summary, McKesson delivered results consistent with our revised expectations for the quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect to leverage the core operational strength and scale of our leading global businesses and our long-standing portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders, customers and business partners.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.

And an answer to your earlier question also, Lisa, relative to procurement, I might also point out that the opportunities for us extend beyond just the U.S. And many times, customers look -- or if you look at customers that you know of in the U.S. that are buying on their own, but there are also customers buying on their own in other important markets for us where we and they have the ability to dispense some generic that we've sourced together.

I don't see a lot of customer changes that would drive one to believe that there's something going on materially different from a pricing perspective out in the marketplace. I can speak for McKesson's strategy, and that is that we continue to focus heavily on our selling efforts within our existing customer base trying to find ways to add more value to those relationships. And through that value-added and create a relationship that has more stability, but it also provides better profit for our customers and better profit for McKesson as we evolve these partnerships.

As we've had an opportunity to speak with many of our and investors since we last provided an update just a few weeks ago on January 11, I'll keep my remarks fairly brief this afternoon. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to James, and he will walk you through our results for the third quarter. But before I do, I have 3 key messages I want to leave you with today. 
First, there have been no changes to the fiscal 2016 outlook and preliminary fiscal 2017 outlook, which we've provided on January 11. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90 for fiscal 2016. 
Second, our third quarter results were right in line with our revised expectations. I'm proud of the excellent progress we have made in expanding our global pharmaceutical sourcing scale, delivering operating margin improvements in our Technology Solutions segment and successfully executing on the Celesio acquisition synergies. 
And third, I have great confidence in our future. As we enter the final months of fiscal 2016 and look to the future, I'm as confident as ever in our industry and the unique role we play in making the business at healthcare more efficient. I'm confident McKesson, our focus on innovation and our customer-first mindset has propelled us to be leaders in the markets we serve. And most important, I'm confident in the extraordinary team we have at McKesson were truly the best in the business.
Our businesses are very well positioned, both domestically and internationally. And we have a tremendously strong balance sheet, which we will continue to deploy effectively and strategically to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Year-to-date, we repurchased approximately $850 million of our common stock, we paid nearly $1 billion in long-term debt and made internal capital investments of $417 million and paid $179 million in dividends. We ended the third quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash, and our expectation to deliver cash flow from operations of approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2016 remains unchanged from our original guidance.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James to review our third quarter results, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

As John discussed earlier, we've provided our updated view on fiscal 2016 earnings on January 11, and we continue to expect adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90.
Our results this quarter are consistent with our revised expectations. I will now review our third quarter consolidated financial results. As a reminder, schedule 3 of the accompanying table to our press release includes supplemental constant currency information to outline both the dollar and percentage impact of currency movements on our reported results. 
During the third quarter and the first 9 months of our fiscal 2016, our reported adjusted earnings per diluted share included currency headwinds of approximately $0.03 and $0.11, respectively. Therefore, during my prepared remarks, I will reference both the reported and constant currency figures.
Now let's move to our results for the third quarter. My remarks today will focus on our third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $3.18, which excludes 3 items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; acquisition expenses and related adjustments; and LIFO-related adjustments.
Turning now to our consolidated results, which can be found on schedules 2 and 3. Consolidated revenues increased 3% for the quarter to $47.9 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. On a constant currency basis, revenues were $49 billion, an increase of 5%, led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment.
Adjusted gross profit for the quarter decreased by 3% to $2.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was flat to the prior year, driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions, primarily reflecting the impact of a weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends, offset by growth across our other domestic and international businesses and continued progress on procurement synergies related to our acquisition of Celesio.
Total adjusted operating expenses of $1.8 billion were down 5% for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by diligent cost management in both segments and the sale of our nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses earlier in the fiscal year.
Adjusted other income was $14 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $87 million decreased 6% on a reported basis and 5% in constant currency. 
Now moving to taxes. This quarter's adjusted tax rate of 25.5% was driven by both a favorable mix of income and certain favorable discrete tax items, which totaled approximately $0.07, primarily reflecting recent legislative changes in both the U.S. and Europe during the third quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29.5%. 
Adjusted income for the quarter was $739 million, with our adjusted earnings per diluted share at $3.18, up 9% on a reported basis and up 10% in constant currency.
Wrapping up our consolidated results for the third quarter, diluted weighted average shares decreased 2% year-over-year to 232 million. During the third quarter, we completed a share repurchase of common stock totaling $350 million. And fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock.
Overall, we expect to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment, which reflects a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be 233 million for the full fiscal year.
Now let's turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b. Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $47.2 billion were up 3% on a reported basis. Revenues were negatively impacted by $1.1 billion as a result of foreign currency rate movements. Constant currency revenues were $48.3 billion for the third quarter, reflecting growth of 6%. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $39.6  billion in the third quarter, up 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues primarily reflect market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, specialty and Canadian businesses, offset primarily by the expiration of a customer contract at the start of the third quarter.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6 billion for the third quarter. International revenues were impacted by approximately $700 million in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year.
Adjusting for this currency impact, revenues were approximately $6.7 billion in the third quarter, down 1% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015, partially offset by continued growth in our U.K. business.
Medical-Surgical revenues were flat year-over-year, primarily driven by market growth in our primary care business, offset by the sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter.
Distribution Solutions' adjusted gross profit of $2.5 billion decreased 3% on a reported basis and increased 1% on a constant currency basis to $2.6 billion. Overall, the third quarter adjusted gross profit reflected our mix of business, including a growing proportion of specialty pharmaceuticals, a weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends when compared to the prior year and continued progress on driving Celesio-related procurement synergies.
Adjusted operating expense for the segment decreased 5% for the quarter on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis segment operating expense was flat year-over-year, primarily driven by expense management and the sale of the ZEE Medical business during the second quarter.
Segment adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion was flat on a reported basis and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 224 basis points, a decline of 8 basis points year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the segment margin declined 9 basis points, primarily driven by the adjusted gross profit result.
Generic pricing trends are anticipated to be weaker during the second half of our fiscal year as we outlined on January 11. Therefore, we now expect the Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat to the prior year.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 8% for the quarter to $694 million. This decline was primarily driven by the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter and the anticipated revenue softness of the Horizon Clinical software platform, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses in the segment decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our ongoing expense management efforts and the sale of the nurse triage business. Third quarter adjusted operating profit for the segment increased 7% to $133 million, and the adjusted operating margin rate was approximately 19%, representing an increase of 274 basis points versus the prior year.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 2%, representing an adjusted operating margin increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. This increase was driven by strong performance in our payer solutions, relay connectivity and Medical Imaging businesses.
For the full year we now expect the adjusted operating margin for the segment to be in the low-20% range.
Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of the given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding were relatively flat at 26 days. Our days sales in inventories increased by 2 days to 33 days. Our days sales in payables increased by 3 days to 54 days.
We generated $566 million in cash flow from operations during the first 9 months of fiscal 2016. And for the full year, we continue to expect our cash flow from operations to be approximately $3 billion.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.4 billion, with $2.4 billion held offshore. For the 9 months ending December 31, we had $417 million of internal capital spending, repurchased approximately $850 million in common stock, repaid approximately $1 billion in long-term debt and paid $179 million in dividends.
Now I'll turn to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $12.60 to $12.90. Our outlook assumes a full year average exchange rate of $1.10 per euro, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. In addition, we now expect $1.27 per share in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.31 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments. We also expect between $0.72 and $0.82 per share in LIFO-related adjustments.
In summary, McKesson delivered results consistent with our revised expectations for the quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect to leverage the core operational strength and scale of our leading global businesses and our long-standing portfolio approach to capital deployment to create value for our shareholders, customers and business partners.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.

We had a very large -- we have a very large customer that's in the mail business that had some significant year-over-year progress in terms of customer wins that you saw us benefit from, from a revenue perspective that helped push us into the double digits in addition to the launches of some of these specialty drugs. And so the combination of those 2 events were probably the things that propelled us from a revenue perspective. The 7% from my perspective at least now is more consistent with what we think the market underlying growth rates are probably running at today. Obviously, there are some minor changes in what we might see from a mix perspective. And I think to James' point, it's probably a little premature for us to talk about FY '17 revenue forecast, but I think that we're probably going to grow like we are today in line with the market. It's just a question of any customer changes that might happen during the year, either customers of ours that are winning or losing business or when on occasions sometimes, we lose a piece of business like we did with a large mail-order customer just recently."

Clearly we try not to feel pressured on any dimension because it may cause you to do something that doesn't make sense. Having said that, as our balance sheet has become healthier, and we paid off some of the debt and made the commitments that we said we would make relative to delevering after Celesio, we're very aware of the fact that we now have expanded opportunity to deploy our balance sheet in a portfolio way, and we plan to continue to do so. I would say that the fluctuation in valuations does make some opportunities more attractive than others and clearly even some of the private companies might have dreamed of IPOs, et cetera, maybe more available to a conversation with us than they might have been otherwise. And as it relates to putting leverage back on the company, I think the fact that we were able to lever up and then delever again gives us credibility with making our commitments a reality. And I think that the issue of another leg in the stool or a transformational deal, clearly we look at any deal that makes sense to us financially and strategically. I don't think we push anything away from the table. But having said that, synergies are usually more possible on deals that -- and more line of sight on deals that are in one of the segments that we're currently participating in. And so I would tell you that our bias is to go into businesses that we currently understand and operate as opposed to something that's far afield where the synergies are based on some expectation that the markets are going to be more attractive or they're going to grow faster. And usually, we can't add a lot to those values if we don't have synergies to bring it into the -- to bring into the transaction."

We think that it's -- we're in a period now where we're going to have modest inflation. That's what we have been experiencing. That's what we talked about in July -- excuse me, January 11. And that's what we anticipate for the rest of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year as modest generic inflation."

Many of our independent customers have continued to join us in the generic procurement side, and they've become more and more reliant on McKesson's ability to help them reduce their cost and improve their performance. Our Health Mart stores are now above 4,500 stores, and that program has been extremely successful in driving generics. And our proprietary genetics programs are still growing in healthy double-digit kind of ranges. So overall, I think we continue to make progress. Some of our largest customers still procure some or all of their generics on their own, through their own distribution network and do their own sourcing activities, and we continue to have conversations with those customers about the value of using McKesson's combined power with theirs to do an even better job. And those conversations, obviously, are important to us as we think about the relationship with these customers.

We're not the ones making the decision on the generic or the branded side relative to inflation. I would say that the political discourse that's taking place and the Congressional inquiries relative to pricing practices, I think, are obviously going to have people at least pausing perhaps to consider whether now is the right time to take a price increase. There obviously are other circumstances related to pricing associated with supply disruption, availability, new product launches. I mean there's all kinds of things that probably play into the calculus there. And I would say that -- I think the political discussions really clearly and the media discussion probably has some impact, but to speculate on how much it would be difficult."

And that volatility certainly is partially driven by supply and disruption. And so I wish to say that if you could forecast what supply disruptions might occur in the future, then you might have the ability to at least have some inclinations to what happens with the branded price or generic price inflation. But I'm really reluctant to speculate on how things may play out. We clearly have given you guidance for the rest of this fiscal year on that dimension of inflation, both branded and generic. And we've given you our thoughts relative to fiscal '17 guidance on those 2 dimensions. And I think that we stand by our current speculation on that. But it's just that -- those views are amongst other views we have to take every year on what might happen throughout the year. And we just want to be transparent with you about what we're thinking. So I think that, that's probably the most I can say about it.
I understand that we don't have any additional questions in the queue. I know we hit a lot of these subjects in early January, and I appreciate all of the attention that you've paid to these matters and others and for your time on the call today.
As we enter the final few months of our fiscal year and I look to the future, I'm excited about the opportunities I see for us to continue our lead from an innovation perspective and how we can help our customers meet the many challenges that they face. The fundamental strength of McKesson has long been our ability to constantly adapt and grow during times of change and by staying focused on our customers and true to our core values. I'll now hand the call over to Erin, further review upcoming events for the financial community."

I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both our Distribution Solutions and our Technology Solutions segments. Fiscal 2016 was a year of grow",2167,"Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both our Distribution Solutions and our Technology Solutions segments. Fiscal 2016 was a year of growth and expansion across McKesson, despite the headwinds resulting from generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and industry consolidation. I want to highlight a few important accomplishments across our company over the last year. 
In our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, we continue to expand our relationships with customers and drive strong growth across all channels, including national retailers, independent pharmacies and health systems. Our global sourcing and procurement office based in London delivered tremendous results in fiscal 2016, and I'm proud of our teams' performance and the value they are delivering on a global basis for our company and for our manufacturing partners.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to achieve the full run rate of procurement-related synergies as articulated in the original Celesio acquisition, more than 1 year ahead of the original business case.
Our Specialty Health business delivered strong mid-teens revenue growth for the fiscal year while announcing 2 strategic acquisitions to further complement our core business.
We saw solid expansion of our leading independent pharmacy banner programs across the United States, Canada and Europe. We also saw strong growth across the Lloyd's brand pharmacies in Europe. And we're also very pleased to announce our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health in Canada.
The operating margin rate in our Technology Solutions segment expanded nicely as a result of our efforts over the last several years at reshaping our portfolio and focusing our investments.
And as we discussed in January, the company undertook a review of its cost structure across the enterprise and implemented a set of actions designed to ensure McKesson remains at the forefront of operational excellence, efficiency, value and innovation.
I also want to highlight McKesson's strong operating cash flow results for fiscal 2016, which exceeded our expectations. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.7 billion in operating cash flow, up 18% year-over-year.
There's one more item I'd like to call to your attention. Many of you joined us in January when we made an unscheduled announcement to highlight some industry trends and company-specific events that impacted our fiscal 2016 results and our preliminary outlook for fiscal 2017. One of the topics we discussed in January, and it continues to receive attention, is the subject of generic pharmaceutical pricing. We believe some of you maybe seeking clarification as to how it affects various industry constituents. So let me take a moment and talk about how it works here at McKesson.
Over a very long period, our generic pharmaceutical portfolio has experienced a deflation and continues to do so today. I also will remind you that our agreements with our manufacturing partners contemplate and protect us from a decrease in the value of our inventory. However, on a small group of generic drugs, as we have in the past, we expect we will continue to experience price increases. When we talk about generic inflation at McKesson, we are specifically referring only to the small subset of generics that experienced a price increase. As we think about fiscal 2017, we expect the nominal contribution from those generic pharmaceuticals that will increase in price.
We saw this trend early in our guidance today is consistent with the information we shared with you in January. And further, the fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 that we provided you today is in line with what we communicated with you back in January.
I'm proud of this management team and their constant focus on growth and innovation to create value for the long term. I'm pleased with our accomplishments in fiscal 2016, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their leadership, consistent focus on putting our customers' success at the forefront of everything that we do.
Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment. Across all of the markets we serve, the themes of cost, quality and access remain central to the opportunities and challenges facing out there. And as I've seen with relative consistently over my own career, these same themes continued to take a prominent plays in the national platform of the current presidential election process in the United States. I think it is important to remember that the issues of costs, quality and access are not new. And demographics will continue to drive strong demand for pharmaceuticals, and the use of pharmaceuticals will continue to play an important role in the health care systems across the world and remain the most effective and cost-efficient way to treat patients across a variety of disease states and chronic conditions.
And the pace of innovation continues to advance our industry in exciting ways from the discovery of new pharmaceutical therapies to fight and cure disease to new technology-enabled ways in which conflict consumers are engaging and managing their own health to real progress we see in the pay-for-value care delivery models that are emerging. Against this backdrop of change, I see great opportunity for McKesson.
Change inevitably opens the door to new conversations with customers about how we can bring the strength of McKesson to help address the opportunities they see and the challenges that they face. Our customer first culture demonstrates a commitment and an awareness that McKesson's long-term success is linked to our customers' success. And while change can bring its own set of challenges, I'm very excited about with the future holds for our company.
Now moving onto our business results. Distribution Solutions concluded another solid year with good performance across the segment. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services delivered 11% revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The U.S. Pharmaceutical business delivered solid results for the year, despite pricing trends on generic pharmaceuticals that were below our original plan and a few notable customer transitions related to consolidation within our healthcare supply chain.
Despite the impact of these 2 events, the business saw growth and expansion across a number of important areas. In fiscal 2016, we continued to see excellent growth with existing customers who expanded their business with McKesson as well as new customers using McKesson as their pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution partner.
At the beginning of April, we begin to service the pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution for Albertsons Safeway, and I'm very pleased with the way our team has prepared to hit the ground running on day 1. Our OneStop proprietary genetics program continued its strong performance and grew 21% year-over-year. And Health Mart extended its tremendous track record of growth during fiscal 2016, ending the year with more than 4,600 stores or approximately 19% growth over the prior year.
I know that customer consolidation, which impacted us in fiscal 2016, has caused some of the questions the skill and competitiveness of McKesson's generic pharmaceutical sourcing. To me, there's no better proof point that some of the examples I just walked you through while we continue to expand our customer relationships, win new customers, deliver strong growth in our OneStop proprietary genetics program and rapidly expand the number of independent pharmacies we see real value to the bottom line by joining Health Mart. 
I'm incredibly confident in the strength of our relationships with our manufacturing partners and in McKesson's ability to be a great partner to them through our global procurement scale and operational footprint.
In summary, I believe in the core strength and competitive position of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. And while we recently faced challenges related to a shift in generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and customer consolidation, I'm confident this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success.
Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid results in fiscal 2016. In addition to the strong performance of our leading pharmaceutical distributions and services business, we also had strong performance across our extensive retail banner business. 
Several weeks ago, we announced our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health, which we expect to close later this calendar year. This acquisition supports McKesson's commitment to drive value in the industry by improving healthcare solutions delivered in the retail pharmacy setting, and it enhances our ability to provide best-in-class pharmacy care for patients through an expanded retail footprint across Canada.
Our team at Canada has an outstanding track record of delivering great value to our customers and to patients, and I'm very excited about the opportunities we see for this business in fiscal 2017 and beyond.
Turning now to our Specialty Health business. Fiscal 2016 was another year of exceptional growth in our oncology and multispecialty businesses. We recently brought together several assets under a new manufacturer services organization within McKesson Specialty Health. By integrating these capabilities, we'll offer improved core the nature of our best-in-class solutions to manufacturers and ultimately improve patient access and adherence to essential life-saving therapies.
Additionally, we closed in our Biologics and Vantage oncology acquisitions on April 1. Biologics is the largest independent oncology-focused specialty pharmacy in the United States. And Vantage oncology is a leading national provider of radiation oncology, medical oncology and integrated cancer care. And in combination with our US Oncology Network, this now includes over 120 integrated cancer centers across 29 states.
These 2 important acquisitions will increase McKesson's specialty pharmaceutical distribution scale, expand our pharmacy focus pharmacy offerings, enhance our solutions for manufacturers and payers and broaden the scope of practice management services available to providers and patients.
These investments demonstrate McKesson's commitment to the success of our community oncology partners and our customers, and we believe the acquisitions of Biologics and Vantage oncology complement our holistic approach to exceptional care for cancer patients.
Our teams are hard at work with our new colleagues from both Biologics and Vantage oncology, as they put in place detailed integration plans. And we are incredibly excited about welcoming the talent and expertise that exist across these 2 terrific organizations to the McKesson team. 
Turning now to international pharmaceutical distribution and services. I am pleased with the results for fiscal 2016. We are making strong progress on some important investments to strengthen the information technology environment across Celesio while we continue to invest in the European retail pharmacy business.
Additionally, in fiscal 2016, we announced a number of acquisitions across several of our markets where we see strong opportunities to enhance our services and capabilities. Looking ahead, Celesio is well positioned to execute on its operating plan, which includes a focus on the integration of acquisitions during fiscal 2017.
In our Medical-Surgical business, we saw strong growth in our physician office business, including outstanding growth to large accounts and customer wins with integrated delivery networks. Our surgery center and laboratory focused businesses also delivered strong growth in fiscal 2016, and I'm pleased to report that we have successfully concluded our integration plan of PSS World Medical, which delivered synergies as expected.
Overall, I'm proud of our full year operating performance in Distribution Solutions. We have an exciting year ahead of us in fiscal 2017 that will require us to do what we do best: Focus on our customer success; leverage our culture of operational excellence and innovation to deliver the best value in the industry; and execute, integrate and deliver value through the acquisitions we have announced.
As we look ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect the Distribution Solutions revenues will increase by high single digits compared to the prior year, driven by market growth and acquisitions.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm pleased by the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016. We experienced outstanding growth in our payer solutions, medical imaging and relay connectivity businesses. And while revenue growth and Technology Solutions has been impacted over the last several years, primarily by important actions we've taken to focus our investments and shape our portfolio, our enhanced focus has resulted in meaningful improvements in our adjusted operating margin rate for the segment, which we expect will lead to further margin expansion in fiscal 2017.
To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a solid plan for fiscal 2017. Growth across our businesses and growth from capital deployment is balanced against the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical pricing trends in the United States and customer consolidation. We're in a business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. And while the business of healthcare continues to transform across the markets we serve around the world, we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities for our company.
At McKesson, we have the best management team in the business, and I'm confident in this team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. I'm proud of our performance in fiscal 2016 and look forward to the many exciting opportunities ahead of us in fiscal 2017.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James?"

As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2016 results reflect solid execution and core operational growth from both segments. In addition, we delivered operating cash flow, which exceeded our expectations while applying our portfolio approach to capital deployment to create shareholder value. 
Today, I will cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. I will also present annual guidance for fiscal 2017. 
Now before I review our fiscal 2016 results, I would like to take -- address the Cost Alignment Plan, which John mentioned in his remarks. This plan primarily includes workforce reductions and business process initiatives. As outlined in January, our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings guidance did not include restructuring charges related to this Cost Alignment Plan, given that this plan was initiated late in the fourth quarter. Our earnings press release outlines the pretax charges related to the Cost Alignment Plan totaling $229 million were recorded during the quarter, representing an adjusted earnings impact of $0.73 for fiscal 2016.
Overall, cost alignment charges reduced adjusted gross profit by $26 million and increased adjusted operating expenses by $203 million for the fourth quarter and full year. The tables accompanying our press release outline our reported results inclusive of these cost alignment charges. However, in order to review our core operating performance for the quarter and the fiscal year, my remarks will provide our constant currency results, excluding the impact of both the cost alignment charges and the gains realized earlier in FY '16 on the sale of the nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses. These gains totaled $0.29 per diluted share. Therefore, in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation includes additional information about our Cost Alignment Plan, including actual fiscal 2016 charges and the charges anticipated during fiscal 2017. This presentation also provides more of a core operational or baseline view of our fiscal 2016 earnings in constant currency, excluding the cost alignment charges and business sale gains that I just mentioned.
During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2016 baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal '17 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the fiscal '16 baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation.
For the balance of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results, including consolidated revenues, I will review the customary tables, which accompany our earnings press release.
Now let's move to our consolidated results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release.
Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter increased 5% in constant currency. For the full year, revenues were $195.3 billion in constant currency, an increase of 9% over the prior year, led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment.
I'll now refer you to Slides 3 and 4 of the supplemental presentation. Fourth quarter baseline gross profit was relatively flat, and full year baseline gross profit increased 3% in constant currency year-over-year. Fiscal '16 baseline gross profit was driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions, primarily reflecting market growth, our mix of business and our global procurement benefits, offset by the weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year, which were in line with our previous expectations.
Fourth quarter baseline operating expenses declined 4%, and full year baseline operating expenses were flat in constant currency.
For the full year, total baseline operating expenses benefited from lower expenses recorded related to the nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses sold earlier in the fiscal year.
Now turning back to schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release. Adjusted other income was $17 million for the quarter and $68 million for the full year. In fiscal 2017, other income is expected to increase by approximately 40% from the fiscal 2016 level, primarily related to the anticipated profit contribution from Celesio's equity investment in [indiscernible], which previously announced its acquisition of the Netherland's subsidiary of Nadiq [ph]. 
Interest expense of $86 million decreased 4% in constant currency for the quarter. Full year interest expense of $359 million decreased 4% in constant currency, primarily driven by the retirement of debt obligations during the fiscal year.
For fiscal 2017, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be relatively flat to fiscal 2016, driven primarily by scheduled debt maturities and the incremental financing related to acquisitions we expect to close in fiscal 2017.
Now moving to taxes. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.9%, excluding cost alignment charges reflecting our mix of income and a number of favorable discrete tax items.
For fiscal 2017, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31%, which is primarily based on our expected mix of U.S. versus international income. However, this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
For fiscal '16, McKesson's constant currency net income from continuing operations totaled $3 billion, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $169 million and after-tax gains on the sale of the 2 businesses that I mentioned earlier totaling $67 million.
I'll now refer you to Slide 5 of the supplemental presentation. Our full year baseline fiscal 2016 earnings per share of $12.52 increased 14% in constant currency versus the prior year. Overall, this year's baseline earnings per share reflects market growth across the Distribution Solutions segment, margin expansion in the Technology Solutions segment, global procurement synergies, the cumulative benefit of share repurchases in the fiscal year and a lower adjusted tax rate versus the prior year.
Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 1% year-over-year to 233 million. During the fourth quarter, we completed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase program, bringing the value of total shares repurchased during fiscal '16 to $1.5 billion.
At the end of fiscal '16, approximately $1 billion remained on the current share repurchase authorization granted by the board. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2017 is $228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter to $46.4 billion. For the full year, Distribution Solutions' constant currency segment revenues were $192.4 billion, up 9%, primarily driven by market growth in our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business.
In fiscal 2017, Distribution Solutions' revenue growth is expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to fiscal '16. As previously outlined, we continue to assume we retain the existing sourcing and distribution relationship with Rite Aid, which would contribute approximately $13 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017.
For the quarter, North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 6% in constant currency. For the full year, North American distribution revenues increased 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, specialty and Canadian businesses, offset primarily by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of our third quarter.
For fiscal 2017, we expect our North American distribution business to deliver high single-digit percentage revenue growth compared to fiscal '16.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were nearly $6 billion for the quarter, up 2% in constant currency. For the full year, international revenues of $23.5 billion were impacted by approximately $3 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar when compared to the prior year.
For the full year, revenues were $26.5 billion in constant currency, up 1%, driven by growth in our U.K. business, partially offset by the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015.
In fiscal 2017
[Audio Gap]
Drug pricing trends to be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016, and we anticipate a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increased in price during fiscal '17. We also expect the contribution from the launch of new oral generic drugs in the U.S. market to decline from the prior year. And finally, we expect a higher mix of more complex and expensive therapies, which will impact our margin rate.
Now turning back to schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions' revenues were down 5% for the quarter and down 6% for the full year to $2.9 billion. This full year decline was driven by the anticipated revenue softness in our hospital software business, the sale of the nurse triage business and the wind down and transition of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
Looking ahead to fiscal '17, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline slightly year-over-year, as growth in our connectivity, care solutions, medical imaging and provider revenue cycle businesses will be more than offset by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business.
Now I'll refer you to Slides 9 and 10 of the supplemental presentation.
Full year baseline segment gross profit was flat year-over-year in constant currency. Full year baseline operating expenses in the segment declined 5% in constant currency from the prior year. Full year baseline operating expenses benefited from various ongoing cost management initiatives, including the fiscal 2015 workforce reductions and lower expenses following the sale of the nurse triage business in the first quarter.
Let's now move to Slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 12% in constant currency, driving a full year baseline operating margin of 18.72%, up 288 basis points over the prior year.
During fiscal 2017, we expect the baseline operating margin for the segment to be in the low 20% range.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days from the prior year to 28 days. Our days sales in inventories increased 1 day from the prior year to 32 days, and our days sales in payables increased 5 days from the prior year to 59 days.
As a result of our profit growth and disciplined approach to working capital management, we reported $3.7 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2016, and we ended the year with a cash balance of $4 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore.
In fiscal '17, we expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $270 million in expected cash payments related to the combination of the Cost Alignment Plan and a settlement agreement with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice, as previously disclosed in April of 2015.
Internal capital spending totaled $677 million for fiscal 2016. For fiscal '17, internal capital spending is projected to be between $700 million and $800 million.
Our dividend obligation to Celesio's noncontrolling shareholders is included within a line titled Net Income Attributable To Noncontrolling Interests on schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. We expect this obligation to drive a fiscal 2017 expense of $46 million or approximately $12 million per quarter assuming a 76% ownership stake.
During fiscal 2017, we also expect to record income for noncontrolling interests related to our joint venture physician partners operating within Vantage Oncology, the previously announced and now completed acquisition within our U.S. Specialty business.
As a result, in fiscal '17, we expect income attributable to noncontrolling interests to increase by approximately 50% from fiscal 2016.
And finally, we also anticipate a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.03 during fiscal 2017.
In today's earnings press release, we detailed many key assumptions underpinning our fiscal '17 outlook of $13.30 to $13.80 per diluted share, which excludes anticipated FY '17 Cost Alignment Plan charges of $40 million to $50 million, equating to approximately $0.12 to $0.15 per diluted share.
I'll now refer you to Slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year-over-year baseline earnings growth.
Our fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 provides baseline earnings growth of 6% to 10% year-over-year, which is in line with the fiscal 2017 preliminary outlook we've provided back in January.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Vicky?"

I think the best way to for us to think about this is really related to post the challenges we faced this year from the lapping of the generic price phenomenons we experienced last year as well as the customer consolidations and the negative mix change associated with those customers. We think once we lap those changes and we get through this fiscal year, you should begin to see us perform at a level that's very similar to the level we performed at in the past. So we don't really see any structure in our business or in our business model that would cause us to be concerned about our ability to grow organically in a way that's very similar to the way we've grown in the past. Now clearly, in FY '18, we also have the transition with Rite Aid, and obviously, you see us making lots of moves now to prepare to go through those challenges, but we'll talk about that more as the time approaches. But other than that additional headwind that we'll face in that fiscal year, I think the business continues to perform as it has in the past."

And so clearly, we've made some nice progress on that recently. Yes, in terms of overall leverage, we've made significant progress in the last 12 months, with debt maturities bringing down the gross debt level that we entered into to finance the Celesio acquisition a couple of years ago. So we've brought ourselves an additional level of financial flexibility as a result of doing that. That's been very important. But I also indicated in my script that as we think about closing on some of the acquisitions in the coming several months or so, they will expect us to be raising some additional debt in order to be able to accomplish those closings as well.

And the second part of the question is really related to the demonstration project that had some people concerned. As to the demonstration project, it really has no material effect on our business as a demonstration. And frankly, even if it's ruled out in its current form, which we don't think necessarily is in the best interest of patients or oncologists in this country, it can still be relatively immaterial to our corporation. Clearly, we are very focused on helping our oncology practice partners, whether they're in our network or they are customers of ours become more efficient and improve the profitability of their practices. But the fundamental strategy for us is to be well positioned to the corporation for what we believe is a continued significant launch cycle for new oncology treatments, including drugs and other protocols. The increase in the rate of cancer patients in this country and to be positioned to help our community oncology practices thrive in an environment where they carry the return already lower costs, equal or better outcomes and clearly better flexibility for the patients that they serve. And so when you see us combine our efforts in not only with our existing businesses but with these new acquisitions, we're really focused on making sure that we have a wide variety of offerings for the clinician to use when they're making decisions about the appropriate patient care. And I might also mention that CMS has other programs underway, and McKesson participates very heavily in those pilot programs to make sure that we're helping to demonstrate new ways to treat patients,  a new ways to develop value-based costs and quality-oriented outcomes, and we're excited to be working with all the players in those areas because we think we can do a great job in the community.

And so we're excited about Lloyd's being positioned as a destination for healthcare services. We are trying to carve a position with our pharmacy strategy and frankly, around the world that is more focused on being in the care process as opposed to some of the other avenues that some of these retail stores can take.

I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both our Distribution Solutions and our Technology Solutions segments. Fiscal 2016 was a year of grow",2161,"Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both our Distribution Solutions and our Technology Solutions segments. Fiscal 2016 was a year of growth and expansion across McKesson, despite the headwinds resulting from generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and industry consolidation. I want to highlight a few important accomplishments across our company over the last year. 
In our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, we continue to expand our relationships with our customers and drive strong growth across all channels, including national retailers, independent pharmacies and health systems. Our global sourcing and procurement office based in London delivered tremendous results in fiscal 2016, and I'm proud of our teams' performance and the value they are delivering on a global basis for our company and for our manufacturing partners.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to achieve the full run rate of procurement-related synergies as articulated in the original Celesio acquisition, more than 1 year ahead of the original business case.
Our Specialty Health business delivered strong mid-teens revenue growth for the fiscal year, while announcing 2 strategic acquisitions to further complement our core business.
We saw a solid expansion of our leading independent pharmacy banner programs across the United States, Canada and Europe. We also saw strong growth across the Lloyds brand pharmacies in Europe. And we're also very pleased to announce our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health in Canada.
The operating margin rate in our Technology Solutions segment expanded nicely as a result of our efforts over the last several years at reshaping our portfolio and focusing our investments.
And as we discussed in January, the company undertook a review of its cost structure across the enterprise and implemented a set of actions designed to ensure McKesson remains at the forefront of operational excellence, efficiency, value and innovation.
I also want to highlight McKesson's strong operating cash flow results for fiscal 2016, which exceeded our expectations. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.7 billion in operating cash flow, up 18% year-over-year.
There's one more item I'd like to call to your attention. Many of you joined us in January, when we made an unscheduled announcement to highlight some industry trends and company-specific events that impacted our fiscal 2016 results and our preliminary outlook for fiscal 2017. One of the topics we discussed in January, and it continues to receive attention, is the subject of generic pharmaceutical pricing. We believe some of you maybe seeking clarification as to how it affects various industry constituents. So let me take a moment and talk about how it works here at McKesson.
Over a very long period, our generic pharmaceutical portfolio has experienced a deflation and continues to do so today. I also will remind you that our agreements with our manufacturing partners contemplate and protect us from a decrease in the value of our inventory. However, on a small group of generic drugs, as we have in the past, we expect we will continue to experience price increases. When we talk about generic inflation at McKesson, we are specifically referring only to the small subset of generics that experienced a price increase. As we think about fiscal 2017, we expect a nominal contribution from those generic pharmaceuticals that will increase in price.
We saw this trend early in our guidance today, is consistent with the information we shared with you in January. And further, the fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 that we provided you today, is in line with what we communicated with you back in January.
I'm proud of this management team and their constant focus on growth and innovation to create value for the long term. I'm pleased with our accomplishments in fiscal 2016, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their leadership, consistent focus on putting our customers' success at the forefront of everything that we do.
Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment. Across all of the markets we serve, the themes of cost, quality and access remain central to the opportunities and challenges faced in healthcare. And as I've seen with relative consistency over my own career, the same themes continue to take a prominent place in the national platform of the current presidential election process in the United States. I think it is important to remember that the issues of costs, quality and access are not new. And demographics will continue to drive strong demand for pharmaceuticals, and the use of pharmaceuticals will continue to play an important role in the healthcare systems across the world and remain the most effective and cost-efficient way to treat patients across a variety of disease states and chronic conditions.
And the pace of innovation continues to advance our industry in exciting ways: from the discovery of new pharmaceutical therapies to fight and cure disease; to new technology-enabled ways in which consumers are engaging and managing their own health; to real progress we see in the pay-for-value care delivery models that are emerging. Against this backdrop of change, I see great opportunity for McKesson.
Change inevitably opens the door to new conversations with customers about how we can bring the strength of McKesson to help address the opportunities they see and the challenges that they face. Our customer-first culture demonstrates a commitment and an awareness that McKesson's long-term success is linked to our customers' success. And while change can bring its own set of challenges, I'm very excited about what the future holds for our company.
Now moving onto our business results. Distribution Solutions concluded another solid year, with good performance across the segment. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services delivered 11% revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The U.S. Pharmaceutical business delivered solid results for the year, despite pricing trends on generic pharmaceuticals that were below our original plan and a few notable customer transitions related to consolidation within our healthcare supply chain.
Despite the impact of these 2 events, the business saw growth and expansion across a number of important areas. In fiscal 2016, we continued to see excellent growth with existing customers, who expanded their business with McKesson as well as new customers choosing McKesson as their pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution partner.
At the beginning of April, we began to service the pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution for Albertsons, Safeway, and I'm very pleased with the way our team has prepared to hit the ground running on day 1. Our OneStop proprietary generics program continued its strong performance and grew 21% year-over-year. And Health Mart extended its tremendous track record of growth during fiscal 2016, ending the year with more than 4,600 stores or approximately 19% growth over the prior year.
I know that customer consolidation, which impacted us in fiscal 2016 has caused some to question the skill and competitiveness of McKesson's generic pharmaceutical sourcing. To me, there's no better proof point that some of the examples I just walked you through, while we continue to expand our customer relationships, win new customers, deliver strong growth in our OneStop proprietary genetics program and rapidly expand the number of independent pharmacies, we see real value to their bottom line by joining Health Mart. 
I'm incredibly confident in the strength of our relationships with our manufacturing partners and in McKesson's ability to be a great partner to them through our global procurement scale and operational footprint.
In summary, I believe in the core strength and competitive position of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. And while we recently faced challenges related to a shift in generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and customer consolidation, I'm confident this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success.
Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid results in fiscal 2016. In addition to the strong performance of our leading pharmaceutical distribution and services business, we also had strong performance across our extensive retail banner business. 
Several weeks ago, we announced our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health, which we expect to close later this calendar year. This acquisition supports McKesson's commitment to drive value in the industry by improving healthcare solutions delivered in the retail pharmacy setting, and it enhances our ability to provide best-in-class pharmacy care for patients through an expanded retail footprint across Canada.
Our team at Canada has an outstanding track record of delivering great value to our customers and to patients, and I'm very excited about the opportunities we see for this business in fiscal 2017 and beyond.
Turning now to our Specialty Health business. Fiscal 2016 was another year of exceptional growth in our oncology and multispecialty businesses. We recently brought together several assets, under a new manufacturer services organization within McKesson Specialty Health. By integrating these capabilities, we'll offer improved coordination of our best-in-class solutions to manufacturers and ultimately improve patient access and adherence to essential life-saving therapies.
Additionally, we closed in our Biologics and Vantage Oncology acquisitions on April 1. Biologics is the largest independent oncology-focused specialty pharmacy in the United States. And Vantage Oncology is a leading national provider of radiation oncology, medical oncology and integrated cancer care. And in combination with our US Oncology Network, this now includes over 120 integrated cancer centers across 29 states.
These 2 important acquisitions will increase McKesson's specialty pharmaceutical distribution scale, expand our oncology-focused pharmacy offerings, enhance our solutions for manufacturers and payers and broaden the scope of practice management services available to providers and patients.
These investments demonstrate McKesson's commitment to the success of our community oncology partners and our customers, and we believe the acquisitions of Biologics and Vantage Oncology complement our holistic approach to exceptional care for cancer patients.
Our teams are hard at work, with our new colleagues from both Biologics and Vantage Oncology, as they put in place detailed integration plans. And we are incredibly excited about welcoming the talent and expertise that exists across these 2 terrific organizations to the McKesson team. 
Turning now to international pharmaceutical distribution and services. I am pleased with the results for fiscal 2016. We are making strong progress on some important investments to strengthen the information technology environment across Celesio, while we continue to invest in the European retail pharmacy business.
Additionally, in fiscal 2016, we announced a number of acquisitions across several of our markets, where we see strong opportunities to enhance our services and capabilities. Looking ahead, Celesio is well positioned to execute on its operating plan, which includes a focus on the integration of acquisitions during fiscal 2017.
In our Medical-Surgical business, we saw strong results in our physician office business, including outstanding growth with large accounts and customer wins with integrated delivery networks. Our surgery center and laboratory-focused businesses also delivered strong growth in fiscal 2016, and I'm pleased to report that we have successfully concluded our integration plan of PSS World Medical, which delivered synergies as expected.
Overall, I'm proud of our full year operating performance in Distribution Solutions. We have an exciting year ahead of us in fiscal 2017 that will require us to do what we do best: focus on our customer success; leverage our culture of operational excellence and innovation to deliver the best value in the industry; and execute, integrate and deliver value through the acquisitions we have announced.
As we look ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect the Distribution Solutions revenues will increase by high single digits compared to the prior year, driven by market growth and acquisitions.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm pleased by the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016. We experienced outstanding growth in our payer solutions, medical imaging and relay connectivity businesses. And while revenue growth in Technology Solutions has been impacted over the last several years, primarily by important actions we've taken to focus our investments and shape our portfolio, our enhanced focus has resulted in meaningful improvements in our adjusted operating margin rate for the segment, which we expect will lead to further margin expansion in fiscal 2017.
To wrap up my comments, I believe, we have a solid plan for fiscal 2017. Growth across our businesses and growth from capital deployment is balanced against the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical pricing trends in the United States and customer consolidation. We're in a business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. And while the business of healthcare continues to transform across the markets, we serve around the world, we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities for our company.
At McKesson, we have the best management team in the business, and I'm confident in this team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. I'm proud of our performance in fiscal 2016 and look forward to the many exciting opportunities ahead of us in fiscal 2017.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James?"

As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2016 results reflect solid execution and core operational growth from both segments. In addition, we delivered operating cash flow, which exceeded our expectations, while applying our portfolio approach to capital deployment to create shareholder value. 
Today, I will cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. I will also present annual guidance for fiscal 2017. 
Now before I review our fiscal 2016 results, I would like to take -- address the Cost Alignment Plan, which John mentioned in his remarks. This plan primarily includes workforce reductions and business process initiatives. As outlined in January, our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings guidance did not include restructuring charges related to this Cost Alignment Plan, given that this plan was initiated late in the fourth quarter. Our earnings press release outlines the pretax charges related to the Cost Alignment Plan totaling $229 million were recorded during the quarter, representing an adjusted earnings impact of $0.73 for fiscal 2016.
Overall, cost alignment charges reduced adjusted gross profit by $26 million and increased adjusted operating expenses by $203 million for the fourth quarter and full year. The tables accompanying our press release outline our reported results, inclusive of these cost alignment charges. However, in order to review our core operating performance for the quarter and the fiscal year, my remarks will provide our constant currency results, excluding the impact of both the cost alignment charges and the gains realized earlier in FY '16 on the sale of the nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses. These gains totaled $0.29 per diluted share. Therefore, in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation includes additional information about our Cost Alignment Plan, including actual fiscal 2016 charges and the charges anticipated during fiscal 2017. This presentation also provides more of a core operational or baseline view of our fiscal 2016 earnings in constant currency, excluding the cost alignment charges and business sale gains that I just mentioned.
During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2016 baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal '17 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the fiscal '16 baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation.
For the balance of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results, including consolidated revenues, I will review the customary tables, which accompany our earnings press release.
Now let's move to our consolidated results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release.
Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter increased 5% in constant currency. For the full year, revenues were $195.3 billion in constant currency, an increase of 9% over the prior year, led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment.
I'll now refer you to Slides 3 and 4 of the supplemental presentation. Fourth quarter baseline gross profit was relatively flat, and full year baseline gross profit increased 3% in constant currency year-over-year. Fiscal '16 baseline gross profit was driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions, primarily reflecting market growth, our mix of business and our global procurement benefits, offset by the weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year, which were in line with our previous expectations.
Fourth quarter baseline operating expenses declined 4%, and full year baseline operating expenses were flat in constant currency.
For the full year, total baseline operating expenses benefited from lower expenses recorded related to the nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses sold earlier in the fiscal year.
Now turning back to schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release. Adjusted other income was $17 million for the quarter and $68 million for the full year. In fiscal 2017, other income is expected to increase by approximately 40% from the fiscal 2016 level, primarily related to the anticipated profit contribution from Celesio's equity investment in Brocacef, which previously announced its acquisition of the Netherland's subsidiary of Mediq. 
Interest expense of $86 million decreased 4% in constant currency for the quarter. Full year interest expense of $359 million decreased 4% in constant currency, primarily driven by the retirement of debt obligations during the fiscal year.
For fiscal 2017, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be relatively flat to fiscal 2016, driven primarily by scheduled debt maturities and the incremental financing related to acquisitions we expect to close in fiscal 2017.
Now moving to taxes. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.9%, excluding cost alignment charges, reflecting our mix of income and a number of favorable discrete tax items.
For fiscal 2017, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31%, which is primarily based on our expected mix of U.S. versus international income. However, this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
For fiscal '16, McKesson's constant currency net income from continuing operations totaled $3 billion, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $169 million and after-tax gains on the sale of the 2 businesses that I mentioned earlier totaling $67 million.
I'll now refer you to Slide 5 of the supplemental presentation. Our full year baseline fiscal 2016 earnings per share of $12.52 increased 14% in constant currency versus the prior year. Overall, this year's baseline earnings per share reflects market growth across the Distribution Solutions segment, margin expansion in the Technology Solutions segment, global procurement synergies, the cumulative benefit of share repurchases in the fiscal year and a lower adjusted tax rate versus the prior year.
Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 1% year-over-year to 233 million. During the fourth quarter, we completed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase program, bringing the value of total shares repurchased during fiscal '16 to $1.5 billion.
At the end of fiscal '16, approximately $1 billion remained on the current share repurchase authorization granted by the board. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2017 is $228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter to $46.4 billion. For the full year, Distribution Solutions' constant currency segment revenues were $192.4 billion, up 9%, primarily driven by market growth in our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business.
In fiscal 2017, Distribution Solutions' revenue growth is expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to fiscal '16. As previously outlined, we continue to assume we retain the existing sourcing and distribution relationship with Rite Aid, which would contribute approximately $13 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017.
For the quarter, North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 6% in constant currency. For the full year, North American distribution revenues increased 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, specialty and Canadian businesses, offset primarily by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of our third quarter.
For fiscal 2017, we expect our North American distribution business to deliver high single-digit percentage revenue growth compared to fiscal '16.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were nearly $6 billion for the quarter, up 2% in constant currency. For the full year, international revenues of $23.5 billion were impacted by approximately $3 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro, relative to the U.S. dollar, when compared to the prior year.
For the full year, revenues were $26.5 billion in constant currency, up 1%, driven by growth in our U.K. business, partially offset by the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015.
In fiscal 2017 we

drug pricing trends to be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016, and we anticipate a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price during fiscal '17. We also expect the contribution from the launch of new oral generic drugs in the U.S. market to decline from the prior year. And finally, we expect a higher mix of more complex and expensive therapies, which will impact our margin rate.
Now turning back to schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions' revenues were down 5% for the quarter and down 6% for the full year to $2.9 billion. This full year decline was driven by the anticipated revenue softness in our hospital software business, the sale of the nurse triage business and the wind down and transition of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
Looking ahead to fiscal '17, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline slightly year-over-year, as growth in our connectivity payer solutions, medical imaging and provider revenue cycle businesses will be more than offset by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business.
Now I'll refer you to Slides 9 and 10 of the supplemental presentation.
Full year baseline segment gross profit was flat year-over-year in constant currency. Full year baseline operating expenses in the segment declined 5% in constant currency from the prior year. Full year baseline operating expenses benefited from various ongoing cost management initiatives, including the fiscal 2015 workforce reductions and lower expenses, following the sale of the nurse triage business in the first quarter.
Let's now move to Slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 12% in constant currency, driving a full year baseline operating margin of 18.72%, up 288 basis points over the prior year.
During fiscal 2017, we expect the baseline operating margin for the segment to be in the low 20% range.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days from the prior year to 28 days. Our days sales in inventories increased 1 day from the prior year to 32 days, and our days sales in payables increased 5 days from the prior year to 59 days.
As a result of our profit growth and disciplined approach to working capital management, we reported $3.7 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2016, and we ended the year with a cash balance of $4 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore.
In fiscal '17, we expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $270 million in expected cash payments related to the combination of the Cost Alignment Plan and a settlement agreement with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice, as previously disclosed in April of 2015.
Internal capital spending totaled $677 million for fiscal 2016. For fiscal '17, internal capital spending is projected to be between $700 million and $800 million.
Our dividend obligation to Celesio's noncontrolling shareholders is included within a line titled Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests on schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. We expect this obligation to drive a fiscal 2017 expense of $46 million, or approximately $12 million per quarter assuming a 76% ownership stake.
During fiscal 2017, we also expect to record income for noncontrolling interests related to our joint venture physician partners operating within Vantage Oncology, the previously announced and now completed acquisition within our U.S. Specialty business.
As a result, in fiscal '17, we expect income attributable to noncontrolling interests to increase by approximately 50% from fiscal 2016.
And finally, we also anticipate a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.03 during fiscal 2017.
In today's earnings press release, we detailed many key assumptions underpinning our fiscal '17 outlook of $13.30 to $13.80 per diluted share, which excludes anticipated FY '17 Cost Alignment Plan charges of $40 million to $50 million, equating to approximately $0.12 to $0.15 per diluted share.
I'll now refer you to Slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year-over-year baseline earnings growth.
Our fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 provides baseline earnings growth of 6% to 10% year-over-year, which is in line with the fiscal 2017 preliminary outlook, we provided back in January.

I think the best way to for us to think about this is really related to post the challenges we faced this year from the lapping of the generic price phenomenon we experienced last year as well as the customer consolidations and the negative mix change associated with those customers. We think once we lap those changes and we get through this fiscal year, you should begin to see us perform at a level that's very similar to the level we performed at in the past. So we don't really see any structure in our business or in our business model that would cause us to be concerned about our ability to grow organically in a way that's very similar to the way we've grown in the past. Now clearly, in FY '18, we also have the transition with Rite Aid and obviously, you see us making lots of moves now to prepare to grow through those challenges, but we'll talk about that more as the time approaches. But other than that additional headwind that we'll face in that fiscal year, I think the business continues to perform as it has in the past."

And so clearly, we've made some nice progress on that recently. Yes, in terms of overall leverage, we've made significant progress in the last 12 months, with debt maturities bringing down the gross debt level that we entered into to finance the Celesio acquisition a couple of years ago. So we've brought ourselves an additional level of financial flexibility as a result of doing that, and I think that's been very important. But I also indicated in my script that as we think about closing on some of the acquisitions in the coming several months or so, that I would expect us to be raising some additional debt in order to be able to accomplish those closings as well.

And so I am very pleased with the progress the team has made and as you might imagine, in all of our McKesson businesses, last year's result is not good enough for next year. So we are certainly pushing our organizations to continue to make progress on all of the dimensions within our businesses to improve. But clearly, the magnitude of improvement left available to us in global procurement has largely been realized and now, it will be more incremental improvement on that baseline."

And the second part of the question is really related to the demonstration project that had some people concerned. As to the demonstration project, it really has no material effect on our business as a demonstration. And frankly, even if it's rolled out in its current form which we don't think necessarily is in the best interest of patients or oncologists in this country, it can still be relatively immaterial to our corporation. Clearly, we are very focused on helping our oncology practice partners, whether they're in our network or they are customers of ours, become more efficient and improve the profitability of their practices. But the fundamental strategy for us is to be well positioned to the corporation for what we believe is a continued significant launch cycle for new oncology treatments, including drugs and other protocols. The increase in the rate of cancer patients in this country and to be positioned to help our community oncology practices thrive in an environment where they can demonstrate already lower costs, equal or better outcomes and clearly better flexibility for the patients that they serve. And so when you see us combine our efforts in not only our existing businesses but with these new acquisitions, we're really focused on making sure that we have a wide variety of offerings for the clinician to use when they're making decisions about the appropriate patient care. And I might also mention that CMS has other programs underway, and as McKesson participates very heavily in those pilot programs to make sure that we're helping to demonstrate new ways to treat patients, new ways to develop value-based costs and quality-oriented outcomes, and we're excited to be working with all the payers in those areas because we think we can do a great job in the community and that frankly, we're in a better position to deliver better costs and better value and better outcomes than many other constituents."

And certainly, ways to reduce the queuing that goes on in the larger health systems by using pharmacists as another expert as a provider in the health care system.

I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both our Distribution Solutions and our Technology Solutions segments. Fiscal 2016 was a year of grow",2160,"Thanks, Erin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. I am pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by solid execution across both our Distribution Solutions and our Technology Solutions segments. Fiscal 2016 was a year of growth and expansion across McKesson, despite the headwinds resulting from generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and industry consolidation. I want to highlight a few important accomplishments across our company over the last year. 
In our U.S. Pharmaceutical business, we continue to expand our relationships with our customers and drive strong growth across all channels, including national retailers, independent pharmacies and health systems. Our global sourcing and procurement office based in London delivered tremendous results in fiscal 2016, and I'm proud of our teams' performance and the value they are delivering on a global basis for our company and for our manufacturing partners.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to achieve the full run rate of procurement-related synergies as articulated in the original Celesio acquisition, more than 1 year ahead of the original business case.
Our Specialty Health business delivered strong mid-teens revenue growth for the fiscal year, while announcing 2 strategic acquisitions to further complement our core business.
We saw a solid expansion of our leading independent pharmacy banner programs across the United States, Canada and Europe. We also saw strong growth across the Lloyds brand pharmacies in Europe. And we're also very pleased to announce our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health in Canada.
The operating margin rate in our Technology Solutions segment expanded nicely as a result of our efforts over the last several years at reshaping our portfolio and focusing our investments.
And as we discussed in January, the company undertook a review of its cost structure across the enterprise and implemented a set of actions designed to ensure McKesson remains at the forefront of operational excellence, efficiency, value and innovation.
I also want to highlight McKesson's strong operating cash flow results for fiscal 2016, which exceeded our expectations. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.7 billion in operating cash flow, up 18% year-over-year.
There's one more item I'd like to call to your attention. Many of you joined us in January, when we made an unscheduled announcement to highlight some industry trends and company-specific events that impacted our fiscal 2016 results and our preliminary outlook for fiscal 2017. One of the topics we discussed in January, and it continues to receive attention, is the subject of generic pharmaceutical pricing. We believe some of you may be seeking clarification as to how it affects various industry constituents. So let me take a moment and talk about how it works here at McKesson.
Over a very long period, our generic pharmaceutical portfolio has experienced deflation and continues to do so today. I also will remind you that our agreements with our manufacturing partners contemplate and protect us from a decrease in the value of our inventory. However, on a small group of generic drugs, as we have in the past, we expect we will continue to experience price increases. When we talk about generic inflation at McKesson, we are specifically referring only to the small subset of generics that experience a price increase. As we think about fiscal 2017, we expect a nominal contribution from those generic pharmaceuticals that will increase in price.
We saw this trend early, and our guidance today is consistent with the information we shared with you in January. And further, the fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 that we provided you today, is in line with what we communicated with you back in January.
I'm proud of this management team and their constant focus on growth and innovation to create value for the long term. I'm pleased with our accomplishments in fiscal 2016, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their leadership, consistent focus on putting our customers' success at the forefront of everything that we do.
Turning for a moment to the broader industry environment. Across all of the markets we serve, the themes of cost, quality and access remain central to the opportunities and challenges faced in healthcare. And as I've seen with relative consistency over my own career, the same themes continue to take a prominent place in the national platform of the current presidential election process in the United States. I think it is important to remember that the issues of costs, quality and access are not new. And demographics will continue to drive strong demand for pharmaceuticals, and the use of pharmaceuticals will continue to play an important role in the healthcare systems across the world and remain the most effective and cost-efficient way to treat patients across a variety of disease states and chronic conditions.
And the pace of innovation continues to advance our industry in exciting ways: from the discovery of new pharmaceutical therapies to fight and cure disease; to new technology-enabled ways in which consumers are engaging and managing their own health; to real progress we see in the pay-for-value care delivery models that are emerging. Against this backdrop of change, I see great opportunity for McKesson.
Change inevitably opens the door to new conversations with customers about how we can bring the strength of McKesson to help address the opportunities they see and the challenges that they face. Our customer-first culture demonstrates a commitment and an awareness that McKesson's long-term success is linked to our customers' success. And while change can bring its own set of challenges, I'm very excited about what the future holds for our company.
Now moving onto our business results. Distribution Solutions concluded another solid year, with good performance across the segment. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services delivered 11% revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. The U.S. Pharmaceutical business delivered solid results for the year, despite pricing trends on generic pharmaceuticals that were below our original plan and a few notable customer transitions related to consolidation within our healthcare supply chain.
Despite the impact of these 2 events, the business saw growth and expansion across a number of important areas. In fiscal 2016, we continued to see excellent growth with existing customers, who expanded their business with McKesson as well as new customers choosing McKesson as their pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution partner.
At the beginning of April, we began to service the pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution for Albertsons-Safeway, and I'm very pleased with the way our team has prepared to hit the ground running on day 1. Our OneStop proprietary generics program continued its strong performance and grew 21% year-over-year. And Health Mart extended its tremendous track record of growth during fiscal 2016, ending the year with more than 4,600 stores for approximately 19% growth over the prior year.
I know that customer consolidation, which impacted us in fiscal 2016, has caused some to question the scale and competitiveness of McKesson's generic pharmaceutical sourcing. To me, there's no better proof point that some of the examples I just walked you through, where we continue to expand our customer relationships, win new customers, deliver strong growth in our OneStop proprietary genetics program and rapidly expand the number of independent pharmacies who see real value to their bottom line by joining Health Mart. 
I'm incredibly confident in the strength of our relationships with our manufacturing partners and in McKesson's ability to be a great partner to them through our global procurement scale and operational footprint.
In summary, I believe in the core strength and competitive position of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. And while we recently faced challenges related to a shift in generic pharmaceutical pricing trends and customer consolidation, I'm confident this business remains extremely well positioned for continued success.
Our Canadian distribution business delivered solid results in fiscal 2016. In addition to the strong performance of our leading pharmaceutical distribution and services business, we also had strong performance across our extensive retail banner business. 
Several weeks ago, we announced our proposed acquisition of Rexall Health, which we expect to close later this calendar year. This acquisition supports McKesson's commitment to drive value in the industry by improving healthcare solutions delivered in the retail pharmacy setting, and it enhances our ability to provide best-in-class pharmacy care for patients through an expanded retail footprint across Canada.
Our team at Canada has an outstanding track record of delivering great value to our customers and to patients, and I'm very excited about the opportunities we see for this business in fiscal 2017 and beyond.
Turning now to our Specialty Health business. Fiscal 2016 was another year of exceptional growth in our oncology and multispecialty businesses. We recently brought together several assets, under a new manufacturer services organization within McKesson Specialty Health. By integrating these capabilities, we'll offer improved coordination of our best-in-class solutions to manufacturers and ultimately improve patient access and adherence to essential life-saving therapies.
Additionally, we closed on our Biologics and Vantage Oncology acquisitions on April 1. Biologics is the largest independent oncology-focused specialty pharmacy in the United States. And Vantage Oncology is a leading national provider of radiation oncology, medical oncology and integrated cancer care. And in combination with our US Oncology Network, this now includes over 120 integrated cancer centers across 29 states.
These 2 important acquisitions will increase McKesson's specialty pharmaceutical distribution scale, expand our oncology-focused pharmacy offerings, enhance our solutions for manufacturers and payers and broaden the scope of practice management services available to providers and patients.
These investments demonstrate McKesson's commitment to the success of our community oncology partners and our customers, and we believe the acquisitions of Biologics and Vantage Oncology complement our holistic approach to exceptional care for cancer patients.
Our teams are hard at work, with our new colleagues from both Biologics and Vantage Oncology, as they put in place detailed integration plans. And we are incredibly excited about welcoming the talent and expertise that exists across these 2 terrific organizations to the McKesson team. 
Turning now to international pharmaceutical distribution and services. I am pleased with the results for fiscal 2016. We are making strong progress on some important investments to strengthen the information technology environment across Celesio, while we continue to invest in the European retail pharmacy business.
Additionally, in fiscal 2016, we announced a number of acquisitions across several of our markets, where we see strong opportunities to enhance our services and capabilities. Looking ahead, Celesio is well positioned to execute on its operating plan, which includes a focus on the integration of acquisitions during fiscal 2017.
In our Medical-Surgical business, we saw strong results in our physician office business, including outstanding growth with large accounts and customer wins with integrated delivery networks. Our surgery center and laboratory-focused businesses also delivered strong growth in fiscal 2016, and I'm pleased to report that we have successfully concluded our integration plan of PSS World Medical, which delivered synergies as expected.
Overall, I'm proud of our full year operating performance in Distribution Solutions. We have an exciting year ahead of us in fiscal 2017 that will require us to do what we do best: focus on our customers' success; leverage our culture of operational excellence and innovation to deliver the best value in the industry; and execute, integrate and deliver value through the acquisitions we have announced.
As we look ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect that Distribution Solutions revenues will increase by high single digits compared to the prior year, driven by market growth and acquisitions.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm pleased by the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016. We experienced outstanding growth in our payer solutions, medical imaging and relay connectivity businesses. And while revenue growth in Technology Solutions has been impacted over the last several years, primarily by important actions we've taken to focus our investments and shape our portfolio, our enhanced focus has resulted in meaningful improvements in our adjusted operating margin rate for the segment, which we expect will lead to further margin expansion in fiscal 2017.
To wrap up my comments, I believe we have a solid plan for fiscal 2017. Growth across our businesses and growth from capital deployment is balanced against the negative impact of generic pharmaceutical pricing trends in the United States and customer consolidation. We're in a business that continues to generate strong cash flow from operations. And while the business of healthcare continues to transform across the markets, we serve around the world, we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities for our company.
At McKesson, we have the best management team in the business, and I'm confident in this team's ability to continue to deliver value to our customers and strong financial returns to our shareholders. I'm proud of our performance in fiscal 2016 and look forward to the many exciting opportunities ahead of us in fiscal 2017.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James for a detailed review of our financial results. James?"

As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2016 results reflect solid execution and core operational growth from both segments.

As John discussed earlier, our fiscal 2016 results reflect solid execution and core operational growth from both segments. In addition, we delivered operating cash flow which exceeded our expectations, while applying our portfolio approach to capital deployment to create shareholder value. 
Today, I will cover both the fourth quarter and full year results. I will also present annual guidance for fiscal 2017. 
Now before I review our fiscal 2016 results, I would like to take -- address the Cost Alignment Plan, which John mentioned in his remarks. This plan primarily includes workforce reductions and business process initiatives. As outlined in January, our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings guidance did not include restructuring charges related to this Cost Alignment Plan, given that this plan was initiated late in the fourth quarter. Our earnings press release outlines the pretax charges related to the Cost Alignment Plan totaling $229 million were recorded during the quarter, representing an adjusted earnings impact of $0.73 for fiscal 2016.
Overall, cost alignment charges reduced adjusted gross profit by $26 million and increased adjusted operating expenses by $203 million for the fourth quarter and full year. The tables accompanying our press release outline our reported results, inclusive of these cost alignment charges. However, in order to review our core operating performance for the quarter and the fiscal year, my remarks will provide our constant currency results, excluding the impact of both the cost alignment charges and the gains realized earlier in FY '16 on the sale of the nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses. These gains totaled $0.29 per diluted share. Therefore, in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation includes additional information about our Cost Alignment Plan, including actual fiscal 2016 charges and the charges anticipated during fiscal 2017. This presentation also provides more of a core operational or baseline view of our fiscal 2016 earnings in constant currency, excluding the cost alignment charges and business sale gains that I just mentioned.
During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2016 baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal '17 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the fiscal '16 baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation.
For the balance of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results, including consolidated revenues, I will review the customary tables which accompany our earnings press release.
Now let's move to our consolidated results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release.
Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter increased 5% in constant currency. For the full year, revenues were $195.3 billion in constant currency, an increase of 9% over the prior year, led by growth in our Distribution Solutions segment.
I'll now refer you to Slides 3 and 4 of the supplemental presentation. Fourth quarter baseline gross profit was relatively flat, and full year baseline gross profit increased 3% in constant currency year-over-year. Fiscal '16 baseline gross profit was driven by the performance of Distribution Solutions, primarily reflecting market growth, our mix of business and our global procurement benefits, offset by the weaker year-over-year profit contribution from generic pricing trends, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year, which were in line with our previous expectations.
Fourth quarter baseline operating expenses declined 4%, and full year baseline operating expenses were flat in constant currency.
For the full year, total baseline operating expenses benefited from lower expenses recorded related to the nurse triage and ZEE Medical businesses sold earlier in the fiscal year.
Now turning back to schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release. Adjusted other income was $17 million for the quarter and $68 million for the full year. In fiscal 2017, other income is expected to increase by approximately 40% from the fiscal 2016 level, primarily related to the anticipated profit contribution from Celesio's equity investment in Brocacef, which previously announced its acquisition of the Netherlands subsidiary of Mediq. 
Interest expense of $86 million decreased 4% in constant currency for the quarter. Full year interest expense of $359 million decreased 4% in constant currency, primarily driven by the retirement of debt obligations during the fiscal year.
For fiscal 2017, we expect our year-over-year interest expense to be relatively flat to fiscal 2016, driven primarily by scheduled debt maturities and the incremental financing related to acquisitions we expect to close in fiscal 2017.
Now moving to taxes. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.9%, excluding cost alignment charges, reflecting our mix of income and a number of favorable discrete tax items.
For fiscal 2017, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31%, which is primarily based on our expected mix of U.S. versus international income. However, this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
For fiscal '16, McKesson's constant currency net income from continuing operations totaled $3 billion, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $169 million and after-tax gains on the sale of the 2 businesses that I mentioned earlier totaling $67 million.
I'll now refer you to Slide 5 of the supplemental presentation. Our full year baseline fiscal 2016 earnings per share of $12.52 increased 14% in constant currency versus the prior year. Overall, this year's baseline earnings per share reflects market growth across the Distribution Solutions segment, margin expansion in the Technology Solutions segment, global procurement synergies, the cumulative benefit of share repurchases in the fiscal year and a lower adjusted tax rate versus the prior year.
Wrapping up our consolidated results, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 1% year-over-year to 233 million. During the fourth quarter, we completed a $650 million accelerated share repurchase program, bringing the value of total shares repurchased during fiscal '16 to $1.5 billion.
At the end of fiscal '16, approximately $1 billion remained on the current share repurchase authorization granted by the board. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding assumption for fiscal 2017 is 228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release. Distribution Solutions segment revenues were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter to $46.4 billion. For the full year, Distribution Solutions' constant currency segment revenues were $192.4 billion, up 9%, primarily driven by market growth in our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business.
In fiscal 2017, Distribution Solutions' revenue growth is expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to fiscal '16. As previously outlined, we continue to assume we retain the existing sourcing and distribution relationship with Rite Aid, which would contribute approximately $13 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017.
For the quarter, North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 6% in constant currency. For the full year, North American distribution revenues increased 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical, specialty and Canadian businesses, offset primarily by the expiration of our contract with Optum at the start of our third quarter.
For fiscal 2017, we expect our North American distribution business to deliver high single-digit percentage revenue growth compared to fiscal '16.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were nearly $6 billion for the quarter, up 2% in constant currency. For the full year, international revenues of $23.5 billion were impacted by approximately $3 billion in unfavorable currency rate movements, primarily attributable to a weaker euro, relative to the U.S. dollar, when compared to the prior year.
For the full year, revenues were $26.5 billion in constant currency, up 1%, driven by growth in our U.K. business, partially offset by the loss of a hospital contract in Norway during fiscal 2015.
In fiscal 2017 we

drug pricing trends to be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016, and we anticipate a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price during fiscal '17. We also expect the contribution from the launch of new oral generic drugs in the U.S. market to decline from the prior year. And finally, we expect a higher mix of more complex and expensive therapies, which will impact our margin rate.
Now turning back to schedules 3a and 3b of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions' revenues were down 5% for the quarter and down 6% for the full year to $2.9 billion. This full year decline was driven by the anticipated revenue softness in our hospital software business, the sale of the nurse triage business and the wind down and transition of our U.K. workforce business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
Looking ahead to fiscal '17, we expect Technology Solutions revenues to decline slightly year-over-year, as growth in our connectivity payer solutions, medical imaging and provider revenue cycle businesses will be more than offset by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business.
Now I'll refer you to Slides 9 and 10 of the supplemental presentation.
Full year baseline segment gross profit was flat year-over-year in constant currency. Full year baseline operating expenses in the segment declined 5% in constant currency from the prior year. Full year baseline operating expenses benefited from various ongoing cost management initiatives, including the fiscal 2015 workforce reductions and lower expenses, following the sale of the nurse triage business in the first quarter.
Let's now move to Slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 12% in constant currency, driving a full year baseline operating margin of 18.72%, up 288 basis points over the prior year.
During fiscal 2017, we expect the baseline operating margin for the segment to be in the low 20% range.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 2 days from the prior year to 28 days. Our days sales in inventories increased 1 day from the prior year to 32 days, and our days sales in payables increased 5 days from the prior year to 59 days.
As a result of our profit growth and disciplined approach to working capital management, we reported $3.7 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2016, and we ended the year with a cash balance of $4 billion, with $2.2 billion held offshore.
In fiscal '17, we expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $270 million in expected cash payments related to the combination of the Cost Alignment Plan and a settlement agreement with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice, as previously disclosed in April of 2015.
Internal capital spending totaled $677 million for fiscal 2016. For fiscal '17, internal capital spending is projected to be between $700 million and $800 million.
Our dividend obligation to Celesio's noncontrolling shareholders is included within a line titled Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests on schedule 1 of the tables accompanying our press release. We expect this obligation to drive a fiscal 2017 expense of $46 million, or approximately $12 million per quarter assuming a 76% ownership stake.
During fiscal 2017, we also expect to record income for noncontrolling interests related to our joint venture physician partners operating within Vantage Oncology, the previously announced and now completed acquisition within our U.S. Specialty business.
As a result, in fiscal '17, we expect income attributable to noncontrolling interests to increase by approximately 50% from fiscal 2016.
And finally, we also anticipate a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.03 during fiscal 2017.
In today's earnings press release, we detailed many key assumptions underpinning our fiscal '17 outlook of $13.30 to $13.80 per diluted share, which excludes anticipated FY '17 Cost Alignment Plan charges of $40 million to $50 million, equating to approximately $0.12 to $0.15 per diluted share.
I'll now refer you to Slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year-over-year baseline earnings growth.
Our fiscal 2017 guidance of $13.30 to $13.80 provides baseline earnings growth of 6% to 10% year-over-year, which is in line with the fiscal 2017 preliminary outlook we provided back in January.

I think the best way to for us to think about this is really related to post the challenges we faced this year from the lapping of the generic price phenomenons we experienced last year as well as the customer consolidations and the negative mix change associated with those customers. We think once we lap those changes and we get through this fiscal year, you should begin to see us perform at a level that's very similar to the level we performed at in the past. So we don't really see any structure in our business or in our business model that would cause us to be concerned about our ability to grow organically in a way that's very similar to the way we've grown in the past. Now clearly, in FY '18, we also have the transition with Rite Aid and obviously, you see us making lots of moves now to prepare to grow through those challenges, but we'll talk about that more as the time approaches.

We have a long-standing tradition of building value with our manufacturing partners, both on the generic as well as on the branded and specialty sides of our business.

Most of our profits are covered under a more fixed arrangement that is pretty reliable, sort of regardless of what happens with price inflation.

Now that said, we've also indicated in the past and maintain a preference for value-creating M&A if we can find good alternatives versus share buybacks. And so clearly, we've made some nice progress on that recently. Yes, in terms of overall leverage, we've made significant progress in the last 12 months, with debt maturities bringing down the gross debt level that we entered into to finance the Celesio acquisition a couple of years ago. So we've brought ourselves an additional level of financial flexibility as a result of doing that, and I think that's been very important. But I also indicated in my script that as we think about closing on some of the acquisitions in the coming several months or so, that I would expect us to be raising some additional debt in order to be able to accomplish those closings as well.

And the second part of the question is really related to the demonstration project that had some people concerned. As to the demonstration project, it really has no material effect on our business as a demonstration. And frankly, even if it's rolled out in its current form which we don't think necessarily is in the best interest of patients or oncologists in this country, it can still be relatively immaterial to our corporation. Clearly, we are very focused on helping our oncology practice partners, whether they're in our network or they are customers of ours, become more efficient and improve the profitability of their practices. But the fundamental strategy for us is to be well positioned as a corporation for what we believe is a continued significant launch cycle for new oncology treatments, including drugs and other protocols. The increase in the rate of cancer patients in this country and to be positioned to help our community oncology practices thrive in an environment where they can demonstrate already lower costs, equal or better outcomes and clearly better flexibility for the patients that they serve. And so when you see us combine our efforts in not only our existing businesses but with these new acquisitions, we're really focused on making sure that we have a wide variety of offerings for the clinician to use when they're making decisions about the appropriate patient care. And I might also mention that CMS has other programs underway, and McKesson participates very heavily in those pilot programs to make sure that we're helping to demonstrate new ways to treat patients, new ways to develop value-based costs and quality-oriented outcomes, and we're excited to be working with all the payers in those areas because we think we can do a great job in the community and that frankly, we're in a better position to deliver better costs and better value and better outcomes than many other constituents."

And certainly, ways to reduce the queuing that goes on in the larger health systems by using pharmacists as another expert as a provider in the health care system. And so we're excited about Lloyds being positioned as a destination for healthcare services.

Today, we reported a solid start to fiscal 2017. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $49.9 billion, up 5%; and earnings per diluted share of $3.53, up 18%, both on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. We are maintaining a full year guidance range of $13.43 to $13.93 for fiscal 2017.
Before I dive into the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some recent events that continue to demonstrate our commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of businesses. In the past quarter alone, we closed 7 acquisitions, including Biologics, US Oncology and UDG Healthcare. We serve the important work to expeditiously integrate and achieve each acquisition's underlying business guys, and we divested our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business.
Second, we jointly announced with changed health care the creation of a new company to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower healthcare costs; improve patient access and outcomes; and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care. This new healthcare information technology company will offer complementary capabilities and will help enhance opportunities to benefit customers, employees and shareholders. This is a significant undertaking for both McKesson and Change Healthcare during the past few quarters, and I am pleased with our progress in driving this transaction forward.
Last, in May, we announced our strategic sourcing partnership with Walmart. Walmart is a very sophisticated company, not just on the logistic side but around their sourcing and procurement operations. The selection of McKesson is a clear endorsement of not only our long-term partnership, but also McKesson's world-class pharmaceutical sourcing and procurement capabilities. Building a long-term relationship made sense for Walmart, and we were the right partner. 
Our advantage relative to others in the industry is our ability to combine our exceptional operational excellence with our global scale and sourcing expertise. For us, it takes quality people that are trained and experienced to make this happen; second, it takes great partners on the manufacturers side to make the supply chain work effectively; and last, it takes a continued source of knowledge and analytics around what's possible to make great procurement decisions. All of these things position McKesson as the best partner in the industry.
We've had a very busy first quarter, and I'm encouraged by the work of our employees to successfully execute against our many important initiatives.
Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.2 billion, up 5% on a constant currency basis. And Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis and in line with our original expectation.
Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which includes U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, drove revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis, despite the lapping effect of our customer consolidation that occurred late in fiscal 2016.
Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business met our expectation in the first quarter, driven by strong growth in customers across the retail, institutional and independent channels. Note that effective April 1, we started servicing the combined Albertsons Safeway network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the U.S. under our new 5-year distribution agreement, and I'm pleased with our team's execution to onboard this important customer, which includes the sourcing and distribution of both branded and generic pharmaceuticals.
I'd like to take a moment to highlight our strong and growing community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month, we hosted our annual idea share conference for our independent retail pharmacy customers, including significant participation from our Health Mart partners. With approximately 4,700 stores nationwide, Health Mart is growing by 50% over the past 3 years. This growth is attributed largely to, first, our focus on helping our independent pharmacy customers deliver and be recognized for top clinical performance; and second, our delivery of innovative solutions and implementation support that helps [indiscernible] compete and grow their business.
Some important tools available to our independent pharmacy customers include Health Mart's pathway to better pharmacy performance and profit, a step-by-step approach to help members navigate the changes and stage retail pharmacy market and stay ahead of the curve; and My Health Mart, a proprietary online portal that enables tables pharmacies to proactively manage their business.
Additionally, as a market leader in managed care solutions, McKesson's access health provides the education, expertise and tools pharmacies need to gain access to, and compete in preferred networks.
In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver to our independent pharmacy customers and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart from the competition.
Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We again delivered impressive growth in our specialty business driven by the performance in our oncology and other multispecialty categories. I'd like to spend a minute to highlight an example of our progress and commitment towards the transition to value-based care.
The Center for Medical and Medicaid Innovation is developing new payment and delivery models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of specialty care. Among those specialty models is the Oncology Care Model, or OCM, which aims to provide higher-quality for highly coordinated oncology care at the same or lower costs to Medicare.
Under the OCM, physician practices answer to a payment arrangement that include financial and performance accountability for care related to chemotherapy. The practice is participating in OCM have committed to provide enhanced services to Medicare beneficiaries such as care coordination, navigation and national treatment guidelines for care.
Earlier this month, we announced the 12 practices affiliated with the US Oncology Network, representing approximately 800 physicians who will participate in the OCM. In total, approximately 3,200 physicians were chosen to participate in the OCM, which means our network-affiliated physicians represented 1/4 of all participating physicians. And if we consider customer support through our on mark GPO and Vantage oncology affiliated practices, McKesson Specialty Health supports nearly 50 practices that had been selected an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology.
The OCM marks a major milestone of shift to value-based cancer care, and we congratulate all of our affiliated practices selected to participate in this innovative program. We remain committed to new care delivery models that will better position our affiliated practices to more effectively operate from a clinical and financial perspective and build further upon our strength in this transformation to value-based care.
Moving to our Canadian business. We have managed growth in the quarter with the results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse selection of businesses similar to those in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on specialty and retail. We expect to close the previously announced Rexall transaction later this calendar year, which will further enhance McKesson's retail pharmacy capabilities, procurement scale and best-in-class pharmacy care for patients across Canada.
Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating performance [indiscernible] was slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to recent retail pharmacy reimbursement changes in the UK. While scheduled reimbursement cuts were expected, there were further unanticipated cuts made by the U.K. government effective in April and June this year, which impacted the first quarter and will impact the remainder of the year.
Despite the unanticipated events surrounding recent reimbursement changes as well as the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU, we continue to lead [ph] the [indiscernible] represents a strong long-term earnings growth opportunity across retail, wholesale and specialty.
And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior year, driven by market growth, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the prior year second quarter sale of ZEE Medical, growth in this segment was 4%.
In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter. We continue to expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high single digits compared to the prior year and that full year adjusted operating margin will remain flat, relative to the prior year.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 1% for the first quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by an unanticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of our nurse triage business, largely offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Technology Solutions' operating margin was up significantly relative to the prior year. Our first quarter results benefited from growth in our payer solutions and connectivity businesses, including favorable timing and lower operating expenses. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions. Our continued efforts to deliver customer success and improve profitability position our technology businesses well for the future of Change Healthcare. I remain confident in our Technology Solutions outlook for the full year, which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the low 20% range for the segment.
Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are maintaining our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 at a range of $13.43 to $13.93. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"
288195,372571215,1014314,"McKesson Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As John mentioned, today, we reported results which reflected solid start for fiscal 2017. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we h",1716,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As John mentioned, today, we reported results which reflected solid start for fiscal 2017. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational or baseline view of our fiscal 2017 earnings in constant currency. This baseline view excludes the impacts of cost alignment charges from our adjusted earnings as well as a gain on the sale of a business in the first quarter of the prior year.
During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2017 first quarter baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the first quarter baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation.
Now let's move to our results for the first quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.50 per diluted share, which excludes 4 items: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.
Baseline EPS was $3.53 per diluted share on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.14 per diluted share included a gain on the sale of the nurse triage business, totaling $0.16 per diluted share. Our consolidated results can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the tables accompanying our press release. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 5% in constant currency.
I'll now refer you to Slides 3 and 4 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline gross profit was up 1% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by global procurement benefits, recent business acquisitions and an incremental pretax gain related to antitrust settlement proceeds, largely offset by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity.
First quarter baseline operating expenses decreased 2% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, related to our Cost Alignment Plan. Adjusted other income was $23 million for the quarter, an increase of 53% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $79 million decreased 11% in constant currency fourth quarter.
Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate was 27.1%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $37 million more $0.16 per diluted share, driven by an amended accounting standard related to share-based compensation that I mentioned at our Investor Day in late June. I would note that while the impact of this standard may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, in general, the largest effect will likely continue to occur in our first quarter due to the timing of the exploration investing of our share-based compensation awards.
For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect a total impact of approximately $0.20 due to this amended accounting standard. As a result of this accounting change, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 30% in fiscal 2017. However, as a reminder, this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
McKesson's baseline net income from continuing operations totaled $805 million in constant currency, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $5 million.
I'll now refer you to Slide 5 of the supplemental presentation. Our first quarter baseline earnings per share of $3.53 increased 18% in constant currency versus the prior year. The year-over-year currency headwind equated to $0.01 per diluted share.
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million. We continue to expect a full year share count of 228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3 of the tables accompanying our press release.
Distribution Solutions' segment revenues of $49.2 billion were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency in the quarter, primarily reflecting growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical specialty and Canadian businesses as well as the contribution from our recent acquisitions.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions. Revenues were modestly impacted by approximately $35 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.
Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business.
I'll now refer you to Slide 6 of the supplemental presentation.
Distribution Solutions' baseline gross profit was flat on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Baseline gross profit reflected the anticipated weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends, customer consolidation headwinds and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer when compared to the prior year.
As we've discussed previously, the year-over-year impact from weaker generic pricing trends will more heavily impact the first half of our fiscal '17. For the full year, we continue to expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increased in price.
Benefiting our first quarter baseline gross profit was the incremental impact of a pretax gain related to an antitrust settlement recorded in the quarter, which was contemplated in our original fiscal '17 guidance. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '16, we recorded a pretax gain of $59 million related to antitrust settlement proceeds, so the year-over-year we impact in the most recent quarter from these settlements totaled $83 million. We continue to expect the branded pharmaceutical pricing trends will be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
Let's now move to Slide 7 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter Distribution Solutions segment baseline operating expenses were flat on a constant currency basis. The segment operating expenses benefited from the Cost Alignment Plan actions taken in late fiscal 2016 and lower operating expenses due to the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter of fiscal '16.
I'll now refer you to Slide 8 in the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions' first quarter segment baseline operating profit was flat in constant currency of [ph] $1.1 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 231 basis points, a decrease of 11 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by the expected weaker generic pricing trends, recent customer consolidation and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, offset by the anticipated antitrust settlement recorded in the quarter, global procurement benefits and lower operating expenses. We continue to expect the segment baseline operating margin to approximate the fiscal 2016 baseline operating margin.
Now turning back to Schedule 3 of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions' revenues were down 1% for the quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of the nurse triage business, largely offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
I'll now refer you to Slides 9 and 10 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline segment gross profit was up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the timing of a few items that were originally expected later in fiscal '17. First quarter baseline operating expenses in the segment decreased 10% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by actions related to the Cost Alignment Plan.
Let's now move to Slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 53% in constant currency, resulting in an operating margin of 24.55%, up 879 basis points over the prior year. This improvement was driven by our continued focus on higher-margin businesses, lower operating expenses and certain timing benefits. We continue to expect the full year segment baseline operating margin to be in the low-20% range.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week, month to close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory were flat from the prior year at 30 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days.
We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. We continue to expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $217 [ph] million in expected cash payments related to the combination of the Cost Alignment Plan and a settlement with the U.S. government, which we've previously disclosed in April of 2015. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.7 billion, with $2.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $114 million for the first quarter.
We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In particular, we have been active on the M&A front, announcing the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare as well as closing 7 acquisitions during the quarter. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share.
I'll now turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook and refer you to Slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year-over-year baseline earnings growth. As John discussed earlier, we are reiterating our fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.43 to $13.93, which excludes approximately $0.12 to $0.15 in expected charges related to the Cost Alignment Plan announced in March of 2016. This range provides baseline earnings growth of 7% to 11% year-over-year.
Our outlook anticipates a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.10 during fiscal 2017, consistent with our recently updated guidance announcement on June 29. And as a reminder, on May 4, we guided that our fiscal '17 results would be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect to generate approximately 48% of our earnings in the first half of the year.
And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our FY '17 adjusted earnings per diluted share.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Justin?"

Today, we reported a solid start to fiscal 2017. For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $49.9 billion, up 5%; and earnings per diluted share of $3.53, up 18%, both on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. We are maintaining our full year guidance range of $13.43 to $13.93 for fiscal 2017.
Before I dive into the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some recent events that continue to demonstrate our commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of businesses. In the past quarter alone, we closed 7 acquisitions, including Biologics, Vantage Oncology and UDG Healthcare. We started the important work to expeditiously integrate and achieve each acquisition's underlying business case, and we divested our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business.
Second, we jointly announced with Change Healthcare the creation of a new company to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower healthcare costs; improve patient access and outcomes; and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care. This new healthcare information technology company will offer complementary capabilities and will help enhance opportunities to benefit customers, employees and shareholders. This is a significant undertaking for both McKesson and Change Healthcare during the past few quarters, and I am pleased with our progress in driving this transaction forward.
Last, in May, we announced our strategic sourcing partnership with Walmart. Walmart is a very sophisticated company not just on the logistic side but around their sourcing and procurement operations. The selection of McKesson is a clear endorsement of not only our long-term partnership but also McKesson's world-class pharmaceutical sourcing and procurement capabilities. Building a long-term relationship made sense for Walmart, and we were the right partner.
Our advantage relative to others in the industry is our ability to combine our exceptional operational excellence with our global scale and sourcing expertise. For us, it takes quality people that are trained and experienced to make this happen. Second, it takes great partners on the manufacturer side to make the supply chain work effectively. And last, it takes a continued source of knowledge and analytics around what's possible to make great procurement decisions. All of these things position McKesson as the best partner in the industry.
We've had a very busy first quarter, and I'm encouraged by the work of our employees to successfully execute against so many important initiatives.
Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.2 billion, up 5% on a constant currency basis. And Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis and in line with our original expectations.
Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which includes U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, drove revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis despite the lapping effect of our customer consolidation that occurred late in fiscal 2016.
Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business met our expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong growth in customers across the retail, institutional and independent channels. Note that effective April 1, we started servicing the combined Albertsons/Safeway network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the U.S. under our new 5-year distribution agreement. And I'm pleased with our team's execution to onboard this important customer, which includes the sourcing and distribution of both branded and generic pharmaceuticals.
I'd like to take a moment to highlight our strong and growing community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month, we hosted our annual ideaShare conference for our independent retail pharmacy customers, including significant participation from our Health Mart partners. With approximately 4,700 stores nationwide, Health Mart is growing by 50% over the past 3 years. This growth is attributed largely to, first, our focus on helping our independent retail pharmacy customers deliver and be recognized for top clinical performance; and second, our delivery of innovative solutions and implementation support that helps members compete and grow their business.
Some important tools available to our independent retail pharmacy customers include Health Mart's Pathway to Better Pharmacy Performance and Profit, a step-by-step approach to help members navigate the changes in today's retail pharmacy market and stay ahead of the curve; and myHealthMart, a proprietary online portal that enables pharmacies to proactively manage their business.
Additionally, as a market leader in managed care solutions, McKesson's access health provides the education, expertise and tools pharmacies need to gain access to and compete in preferred networks.
In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver to our independent pharmacy customers and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart from the competition.
Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We again delivered impressive growth in our specialty business driven by the performance in our oncology and other multispecialty categories. I'd like to spend a minute to highlight an example of our progress and commitment towards the transition to value-based care.
The Center for Medical and Medicaid Innovation is developing new payment and delivery models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of specialty care. Among those specialty models is the Oncology Care Model, or OCM, which aims to provide higher quality for highly coordinated oncology care at the same or lower cost to Medicare.
Under the OCM, physician practices enter into a payment arrangement that include financial and performance accountability for care related to chemotherapy. The practices participating in OCM have committed to provide enhanced services to Medicare beneficiaries such as care coordination, navigation and national treatment guidelines for care.
Earlier this month, we announced the 12 practices affiliated with The U.S. Oncology Network, representing approximately 800 physicians, will participate in the OCM. In total, approximately 3,200 physicians were chosen to participate in the OCM, which means our network-affiliated physicians represented 1/4 of all participating physicians. And if we consider customers supported through our Onmark GPO and Vantage Oncology-affiliated practices, McKesson Specialty Health supports nearly 50 practices that have been selected, an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology.
The OCM marks a major milestone of a shift to value-based cancer care, and we congratulate all of our affiliated practices selected to participate in this innovative program. We remain committed to new care delivery models that will better position our affiliated practices to more effectively operate from a clinical and financial perspective and build further upon our strength in this transformation to value-based care.
Moving to our Canadian business. We had nice growth in the quarter with the results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse selection of businesses similar to those in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on specialty and retail. We expect to close the previously announced Rexall transaction later this calendar year, which will further enhance McKesson's retail pharmacy capabilities, procurement scale and best-in-class pharmacy care for patients across Canada.
Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating performance for Celesio was slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to the recent retail pharmacy reimbursement changes in the U.K. While scheduled reimbursement cuts were expected, there were further unanticipated cuts made by the U.K. government effective in April and June this year, which impacted the first quarter and will impact the remainder of the year.
Despite the unanticipated events surrounding recent reimbursement changes as well as the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU, we continue to believe that Celesio represents a strong long-term earnings growth opportunity across retail, wholesale and specialty.
And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior year, driven by market growth, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the prior year second quarter sale of ZEE Medical, growth in this segment was 4%.
In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter. We continue to expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high single digits compared to the prior year and that full year adjusted operating margin will remain flat relative to the prior year.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 1% for the first quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by an unanticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of our nurse triage business, largely offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Technology Solutions operating margin was up significantly relative to the prior year. Our first quarter results benefited from growth in our payer solutions and connectivity businesses, including favorable timing and lower operating expenses.
We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions. Our continued efforts to deliver customer success and improve profitability position our technology businesses well for the future with Change Healthcare. I remain confident in our Technology Solutions outlook for the full year, which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the low 20% range for the segment.
Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are maintaining our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 at a range of $13.43 to $13.93. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

As John mentioned, today, we reported results which reflect a solid start to fiscal 2017. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational or baseline view of our fiscal 2017 earnings in constant currency. This baseline view excludes the impacts of cost alignment charges from our adjusted earnings as well as a gain on the sale of a business in the first quarter of the prior year.
During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2017 first quarter baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the first quarter baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation.
Now let's move to our results for the first quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.50 per diluted share, which excludes 4 items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.
Baseline EPS was $3.53 per diluted share on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.14 per diluted share included a gain on the sale of the nurse triage business totaling $0.16 per diluted share. Our consolidated results can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the tables accompanying our press release. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 5% in constant currency.
I'll now refer you to Slides 3 and 4 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline gross profit was up 1% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by global procurement benefits, recent business acquisitions and an incremental pretax gain related to antitrust settlement proceeds, largely offset by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity.
First quarter baseline operating expenses decreased 2% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our Cost Alignment Plan. Adjusted other income was $23 million for the quarter, an increase of 53% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $79 million decreased 11% in constant currency fourth quarter.
Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate was 27.1%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $37 million or $0.16 per diluted share, driven by an amended accounting standard related to share-based compensation that I mentioned at our Investor Day in late June. I would note that while the impact of this standard may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, in general, the largest effect will likely continue to occur in our first quarter due to the timing of the expiration and vesting of our share-based compensation awards.
For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect a total impact of approximately $0.20 due to this amended accounting standard. As a result of this accounting change, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 30% in fiscal 2017. However, as a reminder, this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
McKesson's baseline net income from continuing operations totaled $805 million in constant currency, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $5 million.
I'll now refer you to Slide 5 of the supplemental presentation. Our first quarter baseline earnings per share of $3.53 increased 18% in constant currency versus the prior year. The year-over-year currency headwind equated to $0.01 per diluted share.
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million. We continue to expect a full year share count of 228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3 of the tables accompanying our press release.
Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $49.2 billion were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency in the quarter, primarily reflecting growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical specialty and Canadian businesses as well as contribution from our recent acquisitions.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions. Revenues were modestly impacted by approximately $35 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.
Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business.
I'll now refer you to Slide 6 of the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit was flat on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Baseline gross profit reflected the anticipated weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends, customer consolidation headwinds and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer when compared to the prior year.
As we've discussed previously, the year-over-year impact from weaker generic pricing trends will more heavily impact the first half of our fiscal '17. For the full year, we continue to expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increased in price.
Benefiting our first quarter baseline gross profit was the incremental impact of a pretax gain related to an antitrust settlement recorded in the quarter, which was contemplated in our original fiscal '17 guidance. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '16, we recorded a pretax gain of $59 million related to antitrust settlement proceeds. So the year-over-year we impact in the most recent quarter from these settlements totaled $83 million. We continue to expect the branded pharmaceutical pricing trends will be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
Let's now move to Slide 7 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter Distribution Solutions segment baseline operating expenses were flat on a constant currency basis. The segment operating expenses benefited from the Cost Alignment Plan actions taken in late fiscal 2016 and lower operating expenses due to the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter of fiscal '16.
I'll now refer you to Slide 8 in the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions first quarter segment baseline operating profit was flat in constant currency at $1.1 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 231 basis points, a decrease of 11 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by the expected weaker generic pricing trends, recent customer consolidation and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, offset by the anticipated antitrust settlement recorded in the quarter, global procurement benefits and lower operating expenses. We continue to expect the segment baseline operating margin to approximate the fiscal 2016 baseline operating margin.
Now turning back to Schedule 3 of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions revenues were down 1% for the quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of the nurse triage business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
I'll now refer you to Slides 9 and 10 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline segment gross profit was up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the timing of a few items that were originally expected later in fiscal '17. First quarter baseline operating expenses in the segment decreased 10% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by actions related to the Cost Alignment Plan.
Let's now move to Slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 53% in constant currency, resulting in an operating margin of 24.55%, up 879 basis points over the prior year. This improvement was driven by our continued focus on higher-margin businesses, lower operating expenses and certain timing benefits. We continue to expect the full year segment baseline operating margin to be in the low 20% range.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory were flat from the prior year at 30 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days.
We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. We continue to expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $217 million in expected cash payments related to the combination of the Cost Alignment Plan and a settlement with the U.S. government, which we've previously disclosed in April of 2015. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.7 billion, with $2.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $114 million for the first quarter.
We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In particular, we have been active on the M&A front, announcing the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare as well as closing 7 acquisitions during the quarter. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share.
I'll now turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook and refer you to Slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year-over-year baseline earnings growth. As John discussed earlier, we are reiterating our fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.43 to $13.93, which excludes approximately $0.12 to $0.15 in expected charges related to the Cost Alignment Plan announced in March of 2016. This range provides baseline earnings growth of 7% to 11% year-over-year.
Our outlook anticipates a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.10 during fiscal 2017, consistent with our recently updated guidance announcement on June 29. And as a reminder, on May 4, we guided that our fiscal '17 results would be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect to generate approximately 48% of our earnings in the first half of the year.
And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our FY '17 adjusted earnings per diluted share.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Justin?"

In terms of Q1 versus Q2 items, I just mentioned to Lisa the point that I would expect there will be some timing items around the Technology Solutions business, and then obviously Q1 benefited substantially from the antitrust settlement that's roughly $0.38 in the quarter or equivalent to a year-over-year impact of $83 million. And then in terms of the change in accounting, our own share-based compensation, as we discussed at Analyst Day, that is going to be $0.16 benefit for Q1 and then only another incremental $0.04 over the balance of the year. So just directionally, about $0.01 or so benefit in Q2. So I think those are the important drivers, if you will, of the Q1, Q2 split."

And people are increasingly going to be paid in a way that reflects the value they deliver on those 2 dimensions. So I think regardless of the candidate that wins or the party platform that gets adopted, we're trying to help our customers prepare for that environment of more cost pressure and more inspection of their ability to deliver value. And part of that is also going to require them to collaborate and connect across the boundaries of their individual businesses. So I would say that, that theme is the thing that stuck out the most.

And the places where we can influence the selection of the biosimilar, we believe we will benefit and our customers will benefit. Clearly, part of the challenge biosimilars face in the market is their ability to prove the equivalence of their product compared to the originator. And we think, in particular, our U.S. Oncology Network is prepared to work with manufacturers to do the type of work that will be necessary not only to prove to us that their product produces a similar result at a lower cost but also provide a beachhead or a benchmark from which other customers can be convinced given the rigor and discipline that our network uses to evaluate these types of opportunities. So I think in some categories, we may not have much influence. But clearly, in products that are used in clinics or in oncology practices in particular, we are very well positioned to create value for the manufacturers and as a result, deliver value to our customers through that relationship to manufacturers."

We are maintaining our full year guidance range of $13.43 to $13.93 for fiscal 2017.
Before I dive into the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some recent events that continue to demonstrate our commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of businesses. In the past quarter alone, we closed 7 acquisitions, including Biologics, Vantage Oncology and UDG Healthcare. We started the important work to expeditiously integrate and achieve each acquisition's underlying business case, and we divested our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business.
Second, we jointly announced with Change Healthcare the creation of a new company to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower healthcare costs; improve patient access and outcomes; and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care. This new healthcare information technology company will offer complementary capabilities and will help enhance opportunities to benefit customers, employees and shareholders. This is a significant undertaking for both McKesson and Change Healthcare during the past few quarters, and I am pleased with our progress in driving this transaction forward.
Last, in May, we announced a strategic sourcing partnership with Walmart. Walmart is a very sophisticated company not just on the logistics side but around their sourcing and procurement operations. The selection of McKesson is a clear endorsement of not only our long-term partnership but also McKesson's world-class pharmaceutical sourcing and procurement capabilities. Building a long-term relationship made sense for Walmart, and we were the right partner.
Our advantage relative to others in the industry is our ability to combine our exceptional operational excellence with our global scale and sourcing expertise. First, it takes quality people that are trained and experienced to make this happen. Second, it takes great partners on the manufacturer side to make the supply chain work effectively. And last, it takes a continued source of knowledge and analytics around what's possible to make great procurement decisions. All of these things position McKesson as the best partner in the industry.
We've had a very busy first quarter, and I'm encouraged by the work of our employees to successfully execute against so many important initiatives.
Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.2 billion, up 5% on a constant currency basis. And Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis and in line with our original expectations.
Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which includes U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, drove revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis despite the lapping effect of our customer consolidation that occurred late in fiscal 2016.
Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business met our expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong growth from customers across the retail, institutional and independent channels. Note that effective April 1, we started servicing the combined Albertsons/Safeway network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the U.S. under our new 5-year distribution agreement. And I'm pleased with our team's execution to onboard this important customer, which includes the sourcing and distribution of both branded and generic pharmaceuticals.
I'd like to take a moment to highlight our strong and growing community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month, we hosted our annual ideaShare conference for our independent retail pharmacy customers, including significant participation from our Health Mart partners. With approximately 4,700 stores nationwide, Health Mart has grown by 50% over the past 3 years. This growth is attributed largely to, first, our focus on helping our independent retail pharmacy customers deliver and be recognized for top clinical performance; and second, our delivery of innovative solutions and implementation support that helps members compete and grow their business.
Some important tools available to our independent retail pharmacy customers include Health Mart's Pathway to Better Pharmacy Performance and Profit, a step-by-step approach to help members navigate the changes in today's retail pharmacy market and stay ahead of the curve; and myHealthMart, a proprietary online portal that enables pharmacies to proactively manage their business.
Additionally, as a market leader in managed care solutions, McKesson's access health provides the education, expertise and tools pharmacies need to gain access to and compete in preferred networks.
In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver to our independent pharmacy customers and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart from the competition.
Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We again delivered impressive growth in our specialty business driven by the performance in our oncology and other multispecialty categories. I'd like to spend a minute to highlight an example of our progress and commitment towards the transition to value-based care.
The Center for Medical and Medicaid Innovation is developing new payment and delivery models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of specialty care. Among those specialty models is the Oncology Care Model, or OCM, which aims to provide higher quality. more highly coordinated oncology care at the same or lower cost to Medicare.
Under the OCM, physician practices enter into a payment arrangement that includes financial and performance accountability for care related to chemotherapy. The practices participating in OCM have committed to providing enhanced services to Medicare beneficiaries such as care coordination, navigation and national treatment guidelines for care.
Earlier this month, we announced the 12 practices affiliated with The U.S. Oncology Network, representing approximately 800 physicians, will participate in the OCM. In total, approximately 3,200 physicians were chosen to participate in the OCM, which means our network-affiliated physicians represented 1/4 of all participating physicians. And if we consider customers supported through our Onmark GPO and Vantage Oncology-affiliated practices, McKesson Specialty Health supports nearly 50 practices that have been selected, an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology.
The OCM marks a major milestone in the shift to value-based cancer care, and we congratulate all of our affiliated practices selected to participate in this innovative program. We remain committed to new care delivery models that will better position our affiliated practices to more effectively operate from a clinical and financial perspective and build further upon our strength in this transformation to value-based care.
Moving to our Canadian business. We had nice growth in the quarter with the results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse collection of businesses similar to those in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on specialty and retail. We expect to close the previously announced Rexall transaction later this calendar year, which will further enhance McKesson's retail pharmacy capabilities, procurement scale and best-in-class pharmacy care for patients across Canada.
Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating performance from Celesio was slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to recent retail pharmacy reimbursement changes in the U.K. While scheduled reimbursement cuts were expected, there were further unanticipated cuts made by the U.K. government effective in April and June this year, which impacted the first quarter and will impact the remainder of the year.
Despite the unanticipated events surrounding recent reimbursement changes as well as the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU, we continue to believe that Celesio represents a strong long-term earnings growth opportunity across retail, wholesale and specialty.
And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior year, driven by market growth, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the prior year second quarter sale of ZEE Medical, growth in this segment was 4%.
In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter. We continue to expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high single digits compared to the prior year and that full year adjusted operating margin will remain flat relative to the prior year.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 1% for the first quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of our nurse triage business, largely offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Technology Solutions operating margin was up significantly relative to the prior year. Our first quarter results benefited from growth in our payer solutions and connectivity businesses, including favorable timing and lower operating expenses.
We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions. Our continued efforts to deliver customer success and improve profitability position our technology businesses well for the future with Change Healthcare. I remain confident in our Technology Solutions outlook for the full year, which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the low 20% range for the segment.
Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are maintaining our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 at a range of $13.43 to $13.93. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"
288195,372571215,1014690,"McKesson Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone.

As John mentioned, today, we reported results which reflect a solid start to fiscal 2017. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational or baseline view of our fiscal 2017 earnings in constant currency. This baseline view excludes the impacts of cost alignment charges from our adjusted earnings as well as a gain on the sale of a business in the first quarter of the prior year.
During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2017 first quarter baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the first quarter baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation.
Now let's move to our results for the first quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.50 per diluted share, which excludes 4 items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.
Baseline EPS was $3.53 per diluted share on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.14 per diluted share included a gain on the sale of the nurse triage business totaling $0.16 per diluted share. Our consolidated results can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the tables accompanying our press release. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 5% in constant currency.
I'll now refer you to Slides 3 and 4 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline gross profit was up 1% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by global procurement benefits, recent business acquisitions and an incremental pretax gain related to antitrust settlement proceeds, largely offset by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity.
First quarter baseline operating expenses decreased 2% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our Cost Alignment Plan. Adjusted other income was $23 million for the quarter, an increase of 53% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $79 million decreased 11% in constant currency for the quarter.
Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate was 27.1%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $37 million or $0.16 per diluted share, driven by an amended accounting standard related to share-based compensation that I mentioned at our Investor Day in late June. I would note that while the impact of this standard may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, in general, the largest effect will likely continue to occur in our first quarter due to the timing of the expiration and vesting of our share-based compensation awards.
For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect a total impact of approximately $0.20 due to this amended accounting standard. As a result of this accounting change, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 30% in fiscal 2017. However, as a reminder, this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
McKesson's baseline net income from continuing operations totaled $805 million in constant currency, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $5 million.
I'll now refer you to Slide 5 of the supplemental presentation. Our first quarter baseline earnings per share of $3.53 increased 18% in constant currency versus the prior year. The year-over-year currency headwind equated to $0.01 per diluted share.
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million. We continue to expect a full year share count of 228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3 of the tables accompanying our press release.
Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $49.2 billion were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency in the quarter, primarily reflecting growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical specialty and Canadian businesses as well as the contribution from our recent acquisitions.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions. Revenues were modestly impacted by approximately $35 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.
Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business.
I'll now refer you to Slide 6 of the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit was flat on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Baseline gross profit reflected the anticipated weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends, customer consolidation headwinds and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer when compared to the prior year.
As we've discussed previously, the year-over-year impact from weaker generic pricing trends will more heavily impact the first half of our fiscal '17. For the full year, we continue to expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price.
Benefiting our first quarter baseline gross profit was the incremental impact of a pretax gain related to an antitrust settlement recorded in the quarter, which was contemplated in our original fiscal '17 guidance. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '16, we recorded a pretax gain of $59 million related to antitrust settlement proceeds. So the year-over-year impact in the most recent quarter from these settlements totaled $83 million. We continue to expect that branded pharmaceutical pricing trends will be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
Let's now move to Slide 7 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter Distribution Solutions segment baseline operating expenses were flat on a constant currency basis. The segment operating expenses benefited from the Cost Alignment Plan actions taken in late fiscal 2016 and lower operating expenses due to the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter of fiscal '16.
I'll now refer you to Slide 8 in the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions first quarter segment baseline operating profit was flat in constant currency at $1.1 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 231 basis points, a decrease of 11 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by the expected weaker generic pricing trends, recent customer consolidation and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, offset by the anticipated antitrust settlement recorded in the quarter, global procurement benefits and lower operating expenses. We continue to expect the segment baseline operating margin to approximate the fiscal 2016 baseline operating margin.
Now turning back to Schedule 3 of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions revenues were down 1% for the quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of the nurse triage business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
I'll now refer you to Slides 9 and 10 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline segment gross profit was up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the timing of a few items that were originally expected later in fiscal '17. First quarter baseline operating expenses in the segment decreased 10% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by actions related to the Cost Alignment Plan.
Let's now move to Slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 53% in constant currency, resulting in an operating margin of 24.55%, up 879 basis points over the prior year. This improvement was driven by our continued focus on higher-margin businesses, lower operating expenses and certain timing benefits. We continue to expect the full year segment baseline operating margin to be in the low 20% range.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory were flat from the prior year at 30 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days.
We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. We continue to expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $270 [ph] million in expected cash payments related to the combination of the Cost Alignment Plan and a settlement with the U.S. government, which we previously disclosed in April of 2015. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.7 billion, with $2.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $114 million for the first quarter.
We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In particular, we have been active on the M&A front, announcing the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare as well as closing 7 acquisitions during the quarter. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share.
I'll now turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook and refer you to Slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year-over-year baseline earnings growth. As John discussed earlier, we are reiterating our fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.43 to $13.93, which excludes approximately $0.12 to $0.15 in expected charges related to the Cost Alignment Plan announced in March of 2016. This range provides baseline earnings growth of 7% to 11% year-over-year.
Our outlook anticipates a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.10 during fiscal 2017, consistent with our recently updated guidance announcement on June 29. And as a reminder, on May 4, we guided that our fiscal '17 results would be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect to generate approximately 48% of our earnings in the first half of the year.
And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our FY '17 adjusted earnings per diluted share.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Justin?"

You heard us talk about oncology in particular, but in several of the specialties, I think we're very well positioned. And the business continues to grow at rates that would be at or above market levels. So we are well positioned. We're pleased with the array of services that we provide. Clearly, the manufacturer and the customer are both important aspects of driving profitability in that business, and we are continuing to expand the relationships in both directions. And we do believe that the manufacturers benefit significantly by using our services and are willing to pay for those services because it certainly reduces a lot of the financial and logistics workloads that they have on their laps. So I hesitate to speak universally about a class of customers, but I think our relationships with the manufacturers are very sound, and those relationships continue to build."

We are maintaining our full year guidance range of $13.43 to $13.93 for fiscal 2017.
Before I dive into the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some recent events that continue to demonstrate our commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. First, we continue to proactively develop our portfolio of businesses. In the past quarter alone, we closed 7 acquisitions, including Biologics, Vantage Oncology and UDG Healthcare. We started the important work to expeditiously integrate and achieve each acquisition's underlying business case, and we divested our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business.
Second, we jointly announced with Change Healthcare the creation of a new company to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions that will help lower healthcare costs; improve patient access and outcomes; and make it simpler for payers, providers and consumers to manage the transition to value-based care. This new healthcare information technology company will offer complementary capabilities and will help enhance opportunities to benefit customers, employees and shareholders. This is a significant undertaking for both McKesson and Change Healthcare during the past few quarters, and I am pleased with our progress in driving this transaction forward.
Last, in May, we announced a strategic sourcing partnership with Walmart. Walmart is a very sophisticated company not just on the logistics side but around their sourcing and procurement operations. The selection of McKesson is a clear endorsement of not only our long-term partnership but also McKesson's world-class pharmaceutical sourcing and procurement capabilities. Building a long-term relationship made sense for Walmart, and we were the right partner.
Our advantage relative to others in the industry is our ability to combine our exceptional operational excellence with our global scale and sourcing expertise. First, it takes quality people that are trained and experienced to make this happen. Second, it takes great partners on the manufacturer side to make the supply chain work effectively. And last, it takes a continued source of knowledge and analytics around what's possible to make great procurement decisions. All of these things position McKesson as the best partner in the industry.
We've had a very busy first quarter, and I'm encouraged by the work of our employees to successfully execute against so many important initiatives.
Turning now to our business results for the quarter. Distribution Solutions revenues were $49.2 billion, up 5% on a constant currency basis. And Distribution Solutions adjusted operating profit was $1.1 billion, flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis and in line with our original expectations.
Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which includes U.S. Pharmaceutical, McKesson Specialty Health and McKesson Canada, drove revenue growth in the first quarter of 5% on a constant currency basis despite the lapping effect of our customer consolidation that occurred late in fiscal 2016.
Revenue in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business met our expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong growth from customers across the retail, institutional and independent channels. Note that effective April 1, we started servicing the combined Albertsons/Safeway network of nearly 1,700 pharmacies in the U.S. under our new 5-year distribution agreement. And I'm pleased with our team's execution to onboard this important customer, which includes the sourcing and distribution of both branded and generic pharmaceuticals.
I'd like to take a moment to highlight our strong and growing community of independent pharmacy customers. Last month, we hosted our annual ideaShare conference for our independent retail pharmacy customers, including significant participation from our Health Mart partners. With approximately 4,700 stores nationwide, Health Mart has grown by 50% over the past 3 years. This growth is attributed largely to, first, our focus on helping our independent retail pharmacy customers deliver and be recognized for top clinical performance; and second, our delivery of innovative solutions and implementation support that helps members compete and grow their business.
Some important tools available to our independent retail pharmacy customers include Health Mart's Pathway to Better Pharmacy Performance and Profit, a step-by-step approach to help members navigate the changes in today's retail pharmacy market and stay ahead of the curve; and myHealthMart, a proprietary online portal that enables pharmacies to proactively manage their business.
Additionally, as a market leader in managed care solutions, McKesson's access health provides the education, expertise and tools pharmacies need to gain access to and compete in preferred networks.
In summary, I'm proud of the value we deliver to our independent pharmacy customers and the innovative services and solutions that set us apart from the competition.
Turning now to McKesson Specialty Health. We again delivered impressive growth in our specialty business driven by the performance in our oncology and other multispecialty categories. I'd like to spend a minute to highlight an example of our progress and commitment towards the transition to value-based care.
The Center for Medical and Medicaid Innovation is developing new payment and delivery models designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of specialty care. Among those specialty models is the Oncology Care Model, or OCM, which aims to provide higher quality. more highly coordinated oncology care at the same or lower cost to Medicare.
Under the OCM, physician practices enter into a payment arrangement that includes financial and performance accountability for care related to chemotherapy. The practices participating in OCM have committed to providing enhanced services to Medicare beneficiaries such as care coordination, navigation and national treatment guidelines for care.
Earlier this month, we announced the 12 practices affiliated with The U.S. Oncology Network, representing approximately 800 physicians, will participate in the OCM. In total, approximately 3,200 physicians were chosen to participate in the OCM, which means our network-affiliated physicians represented 1/4 of all participating physicians. And if we consider customers supported through our Onmark GPO and Vantage Oncology-affiliated practices, McKesson Specialty Health supports nearly 50 practices that have been selected, an unparalleled commitment to value-based oncology.
The OCM marks a major milestone in the shift to value-based cancer care, and we congratulate all of our affiliated practices selected to participate in this innovative program. We remain committed to new care delivery models that will better position our affiliated practices to more effectively operate from a clinical and financial perspective and build further upon our strength in this transformation to value-based care.
Moving to our Canadian business. We had nice growth in the quarter with the results that were in line with our expectations. Our Canadian operations represent a diverse collection of businesses similar to those in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on specialty and retail. We expect to close the previously announced Rexall transaction later this calendar year, which will further enhance McKesson's retail pharmacy capabilities, procurement scale and best-in-class pharmacy care for patients across Canada.
Turning now to our results for international pharmaceutical distribution and services. Revenues for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating performance from Celesio was slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to recent retail pharmacy reimbursement changes in the U.K. While scheduled reimbursement cuts were expected, there were further unanticipated cuts made by the U.K. government effective in April and June this year, which impacted the first quarter and will impact the remainder of the year.
Despite the unanticipated events surrounding recent reimbursement changes as well as the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU, we continue to believe that Celesio represents a strong long-term earnings growth opportunity across retail, wholesale and specialty.
And finally, our Medical-Surgical business performed well in the quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior year, driven by market growth, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the prior year second quarter sale of ZEE Medical, growth in this segment was 4%.
In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment in the first quarter. We continue to expect Distribution Solutions revenue growth of high single digits compared to the prior year and that full year adjusted operating margin will remain flat relative to the prior year.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Revenues were down 1% for the first quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by an anticipated revenue decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of our nurse triage business, largely offset by growth in our other technology businesses. Technology Solutions operating margin was up significantly relative to the prior year. Our first quarter results benefited from growth in our payer solutions and connectivity businesses, including favorable timing and lower operating expenses.
We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions. Our continued efforts to deliver customer success and improve profitability position our technology businesses well for the future with Change Healthcare. I remain confident in our Technology Solutions outlook for the full year, which includes an expectation for achieving adjusted operating margin in the low 20% range for the segment.
Now to wrap up my comments. McKesson's fiscal first quarter results represent solid execution across both segments, and we are maintaining our full year outlook for fiscal 2017 at a range of $13.43 to $13.93. We are extremely well positioned to execute our portfolio approach to capital deployment and deliver value for our shareholders through a mixture of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

As John mentioned, today, we reported results which reflect a solid start to fiscal 2017. Before I get to our results, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational or baseline view of our fiscal 2017 earnings in constant currency. This baseline view excludes the impacts of cost alignment charges from our adjusted earnings as well as a gain on the sale of a business in the first quarter of the prior year.
During my remarks, I will refer to this supplemental slide presentation to review our fiscal 2017 first quarter baseline consolidated earnings and fiscal 2017 earnings outlook. I also plan to reference the first quarter baseline consolidated and segment gross profit, operating expense and operating margin values provided within this presentation.
Now let's move to our results for the first quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $3.50 per diluted share, which excludes 4 items: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition expenses and related adjustments, claim and litigation reserve adjustments and LIFO-related adjustments.
Baseline EPS was $3.53 per diluted share on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.14 per diluted share included a gain on the sale of the nurse triage business totaling $0.16 per diluted share. Our consolidated results can be found on Schedules 2 and 3 of the tables accompanying our press release. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter increased 5% in constant currency.
I'll now refer you to Slides 3 and 4 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline gross profit was up 1% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by global procurement benefits, recent business acquisitions and an incremental pretax gain related to antitrust settlement proceeds, largely offset by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity.
First quarter baseline operating expenses decreased 2% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our Cost Alignment Plan. Adjusted other income was $23 million for the quarter, an increase of 53% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $79 million decreased 11% in constant currency for the quarter.
Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate was 27.1%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $37 million or $0.16 per diluted share, driven by an amended accounting standard related to share-based compensation that I mentioned at our Investor Day in late June. I would note that while the impact of this standard may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, in general, the largest effect will likely continue to occur in our first quarter due to the timing of the expiration and vesting of our share-based compensation awards.
For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect a total impact of approximately $0.20 due to this amended accounting standard. As a result of this accounting change, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 30% in fiscal 2017. However, as a reminder, this rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.
McKesson's baseline net income from continuing operations totaled $805 million in constant currency, excluding after-tax cost alignment charges of $5 million.
I'll now refer you to Slide 5 of the supplemental presentation. Our first quarter baseline earnings per share of $3.53 increased 18% in constant currency versus the prior year. The year-over-year currency headwind equated to $0.01 per diluted share.
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million. We continue to expect a full year share count of 228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results, which can be found on Schedule 3 of the tables accompanying our press release.
Distribution Solutions segment revenues of $49.2 billion were up 5% in constant currency during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in constant currency in the quarter, primarily reflecting growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical specialty and Canadian businesses as well as the contribution from our recent acquisitions.
International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% in constant currency, driven by market growth and acquisitions. Revenues were modestly impacted by approximately $35 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.
Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 2% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business.
I'll now refer you to Slide 6 of the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions baseline gross profit was flat on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Baseline gross profit reflected the anticipated weaker profit contribution from generic pricing trends, customer consolidation headwinds and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer when compared to the prior year.
As we've discussed previously, the year-over-year impact from weaker generic pricing trends will more heavily impact the first half of our fiscal '17. For the full year, we continue to expect a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price.
Benefiting our first quarter baseline gross profit was the incremental impact of a pretax gain related to an antitrust settlement recorded in the quarter, which was contemplated in our original fiscal '17 guidance. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '16, we recorded a pretax gain of $59 million related to antitrust settlement proceeds. So the year-over-year impact in the most recent quarter from these settlements totaled $83 million. We continue to expect that branded pharmaceutical pricing trends will be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
Let's now move to Slide 7 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter Distribution Solutions segment baseline operating expenses were flat on a constant currency basis. The segment operating expenses benefited from the Cost Alignment Plan actions taken in late fiscal 2016 and lower operating expenses due to the sale of ZEE Medical in the second quarter of fiscal '16.
I'll now refer you to Slide 8 in the supplemental presentation. Distribution Solutions first quarter segment baseline operating profit was flat in constant currency at $1.1 billion. The segment adjusted operating margin rate for the quarter was 231 basis points, a decrease of 11 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by the expected weaker generic pricing trends, recent customer consolidation and lower compensation from our branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, offset by the anticipated antitrust settlement recorded in the quarter, global procurement benefits and lower operating expenses. We continue to expect the segment baseline operating margin to approximate the fiscal 2016 baseline operating margin.
Now turning back to Schedule 3 of the tables accompanying our press release. Technology Solutions revenues were down 1% for the quarter to $725 million on a constant currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business and the prior year sale of the nurse triage business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
I'll now refer you to Slides 9 and 10 of the supplemental presentation. First quarter baseline segment gross profit was up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the timing of a few items that were originally expected later in fiscal '17. First quarter baseline operating expenses in the segment decreased 10% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by actions related to the Cost Alignment Plan.
Let's now move to Slide 11 in the supplemental presentation. Baseline segment operating profit increased 53% in constant currency, resulting in an operating margin of 24.55%, up 879 basis points over the prior year. This improvement was driven by our continued focus on higher-margin businesses, lower operating expenses and certain timing benefits. We continue to expect the full year segment baseline operating margin to be in the low 20% range.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding increased 1 day from the prior year to 27 days. Our days sales in inventory were flat from the prior year at 30 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days.
We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. We continue to expect cash flow from operations to grow by approximately 15%, excluding $270 [ph] million in expected cash payments related to the combination of the Cost Alignment Plan and a settlement with the U.S. government, which we previously disclosed in April of 2015. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4.7 billion, with $2.5 billion held offshore. Internal capital spending totaled $114 million for the first quarter.
We continue to deploy capital in line with our portfolio approach. In particular, we have been active on the M&A front, announcing the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare as well as closing 7 acquisitions during the quarter. And yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share.
I'll now turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook and refer you to Slide 12 in the supplemental presentation, which outlines our anticipated year-over-year baseline earnings growth. As John discussed earlier, we are reiterating our fiscal 2017 outlook of $13.43 to $13.93, which excludes approximately $0.12 to $0.15 in expected charges related to the Cost Alignment Plan announced in March of 2016. This range provides baseline earnings growth of 7% to 11% year-over-year.
Our outlook anticipates a foreign currency rate headwind of approximately $0.10 during fiscal 2017, consistent with our recently updated guidance announcement on June 29. And as a reminder, on May 4, we guided that our fiscal '17 results would be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect to generate approximately 48% of our earnings in the first half of the year.
And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our FY '17 adjusted earnings per diluted share.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Justin?"

And then in terms of the change in accounting, our own share-based compensation, as we discussed at Analyst Day, that was going to be $0.16 benefit for Q1 and then only another incremental $0.04 over the balance of the year.

And we think, in particular, our U.S. Oncology Network is prepared to work with manufacturers to do the type of work that will be necessary not only to prove to us that the product produces a similar result at a lower cost but also provide a beachhead or a benchmark from which other customers can be convinced given the rigor and discipline that our network uses to evaluate these types of opportunities.

Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today as events impacting our second quarter results had implications for our outlook for fiscal 2017.
Let's start with our revised fiscal 2017 outlook. In particular, we now provide an update to our expectation of a lower profit contribution, resulting from recent customer pricing activities and lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical inflation trends compared to previous expectations, both of which affect our U.S. Pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions.
As a result of these updates, we now expect $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share, which excludes from adjusted earnings a goodwill impairment charge in our Enterprise Information Solutions business, which James will cover in his comments, as well as estimated charges related to our Cost Alignment Plan that was previously announced in March of 2016.
As we built our plan and entered fiscal 2017, we assumed some moderation around drug inflation activity. In particular, we commented on our expectation for a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increased in price. We also commented that our expectation that branded pharmaceutical price trends would be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
First, the generic price inflation has been largely in line with our original assumption. However, customer pricing and branded inflation continue to evolve. In our first quarter, we witnessed some evidence of inflation and pricing softness in line with our original assumptions. However, the softness became much more pronounced in our second quarter, first, around brand inflation, and later, around customer pricing.
While we generally do not provide specific assumptions around customer pricing activity, we do operate in a competitive environment. And though competitive, we've always been focused on delivering value to our customers, value not just defined by price but by service, innovation that helps our customers' partner manage and run their operations and manage their capital more effectively and innovation that helps our customers connect with patients in a more informed and intimate way. 
Now price is always a consideration. We provide our customers a premium value to our superior service and innovation, for which we expect to get an appropriate price. We believe that delivering premium value builds more sustainable customer relationships and long-term shareholder value. 
Generally speaking, we anticipate pockets of increased competitive activity as part of our normal course of business where [ph] we began to see more recently as competitive activity that is broader than our original expectations, more aggressive and across several areas of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. As I've mentioned in the past, McKesson manages pricing on a centralized basis, although I think all of our customers believe we've been charging fairly for the service we provide and are willing to pay for this service. But a [ph] competitor significantly undercuts our existing pricing, we are compelled to respond. And although we cannot be absolutely assured that recent price concessions will address the recent heightened competitiveness fully, we believe our responses have been appropriate and measured.
We remain committed to our careful and thoughtful approach to customer pricing and to the value we deliver to help differentiate our customers' capabilities and performance relative to their competitors. We believe the services we provide to both our provider customers and our manufacturer customers offer substantially greater value than what either party could develop with a more direct relationship. And we expect that with our focus on the value we deliver, our margins will recover over time.
As for branded inflation, I suspect many of you have tracked the evolving conversation in the U.S. Last month, James highlighted concerns we had around some manufacturers appearing to delay some price increases we would have otherwise anticipated based on their historical and our historical experience. What we've seen this year-to-date are fewer products with price increases, and those price increases are at lower rates than both prior year results and our expectations for the current fiscal year. Given our second quarter performance specific to branded price inflation, we now expect the full year branded pharmaceutical pricing trends to be meaningful but meaningfully below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
Let me spend a minute and talk about how we are compensated for branded pharmaceutical product distribution services. Today, all of our contacts with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are individually negotiated but, generally, are constructed around charging for the service we provide. In almost all cases, the charge is derived as a percent of revenue managed and delivered by McKesson for that specific manufacturer. These charges vary not only by manufacturer but also by the service requirement at the product level.
Clearly, revenue-based fees are all affected at some level by inflation. However, in some cases, the benefit from inflation is greater, given the specifics and the characteristics of individual contracts and the specific behavior of the manufacturers that are a party to these agreements. So although a large majority of our compensation is relatively easy to forecast, inflation-based income derived from these relationships can impact our results on a more variable basis. 
Through these agreements, speculative buying or buying large quantities of product in front of anticipated price increases no longer exists. Essentially, all of McKesson's pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with the manufacturer, unlike the industry standard practice years ago before any contracts presided over the relationships between wholesalers and their manufacturer partners. These charges that happened to -- these changes that happened years ago have translated into more stable inventory levels that are appropriate to meet the customer demands and service levels.
So the takeaway here is that branded inflation still plays a meaningful role, and in some cases, it can be an important part of our overall compensation with specific manufacturers, and we can be impacted by their decisions relative to price increases. Although some contracts of manufacturers may not have specific compensation elements tied to product price changes, our internal branded price inflation assumptions often appeared to be directionally aligned with externally published data. But the mix matters, so even relatively small changes in behavior could be more or less -- could have a more or less impact on our results, depending on the characteristics of that individual manufacturer contract. We'd like to think we do a superior job of exceeding the expectations of these partners, so there should be even some variability in our industry related to results driven by branded and generic inflations.
So what does all this mean moving forward? It means we expect to receive less compensation from branded price increases than we originally anticipated in fiscal 2017. It means we will continue to monitor pricing activities throughout the year, especially in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is typically an important quarter for price increases. And it means we are engaging with our manufacturer partners to ensure we receive appropriate compensation relative to the services and value we deliver amidst a softer pricing environment.
Now turning to our revised outlook for fiscal 2017. We expect the combination of recent competitive pricing and further moderating branded price increased activity while [ph] the combined negative effect on our business by approximately $1.60 to $1.90 per diluted share versus our July fiscal 2017 outlook, with the larger impact coming from competitive pricing.
Turning now back to our second quarter results. In the interest of time, I'll hit a few key themes, and then we'll hand the call over to James to cover our financial performance.
Let me start with the progress we made on integrating the several acquisitions we closed last quarter as well as early progress in Sainsbury's, which we closed at the beginning of September. These are important strategic investments that are tracking to our expectations and contributing positively to our financial performance. We're especially pleased by the stronger-than-expected performance of our Biologics acquisition, which is an important offering to our manufacturing partners in the rapidly growing oncology specialty pharmacy market.
Turning now to some highlights within Distribution Solutions segment for the quarter. Our sourcing partners -- partnership with Walmart is progressing well. We made considerable progress to date in our efforts to establish the new sourcing function, and we are on track to realize benefits from this new venture in fiscal 2018. We remain confident in our assumption that we will service the Rite Aid business through our current fiscal year, given that the acquisition by Walgreens is still pending. We will continue to follow the progress of this transaction as well as any new developments around the opportunity to serve any of the acquired or divested stores.
We are making the fundamental change to the structure in terms of our relationships with both providers and manufacturers as it relates to hundreds of specialty products. We are charging separately for the supply chain value we had across a wide array of product categories and manufacturers. Our conversations with the customers and suppliers around specialty pricing are proceeding as expected, and we are pleased with the responses we are receiving.
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the great work from [ph] our U.S. Pharmaceutical teams that support our customers every day. We started the fiscal year with the successful on boarding of the Albertsons-Safeway network and another successful ideaShare conference with our independent retail pharmacy customers. And in the second quarter, Health Mart stores were ranked highest overall in customer satisfaction among chain drug pharmacies across the U.S. in the J.D. Power 2016 Pharmacy Satisfaction Study. It's great to see recognition for the positive experiences patients receive every day in these pharmacies.
Turning now to our international pharmaceutical distribution and services. As we mentioned in our earnings call last quarter, reimbursement cuts imposed by the U.K. government to retail pharmacy rates as well as the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU have unfavorably impacted Celesio's operating performance. Despite these headwinds, I'm encouraged by the significant progress we made to help shape the long-term opportunities we expect are available to us across the European markets in which we operate.
In addition to our internal focus strategy, such as Six Sigma training and the standard ERP platform across our many geographies, we are engaged with external stakeholders and productive discussions around services we can offer to state-run health systems where wholesalers today often play a limited role or expanding the services a retail pharmacy may deliver to its customers. We continue to make good progress on further developing our opportunities in our European markets.
As for our other Distribution Solutions businesses, such as McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, Medical-Surgical, they're all performing very well, showing strong growth and profitability, including double-digit adjusted operating profit growth year-over-year for all of these businesses in Q2.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm encouraged by the exceptional performance from our Technology Solutions team. Even with considerable distractions to support the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare, this segment delivered solid results. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions in support of a strong future with Change Healthcare while managing the work to retain the Relay Pharmacy business and prepare the EIS business for strategic alternatives.
In Q2, we recorded a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to EIS. As you may recall, we are considering strategic alternatives for EIS, which is part of our broader Technology Solutions strategy that we unveiled earlier this year. Our commitment has been and will always be to the long-term value creation for our customers, employees and shareholders, and we are confident in the direction we are headed with our Technology Solutions businesses.
Now to wrap up my comments. We've spoken for a few quarters about how generics inflation and customer consolidation challenges that we identified last year, which were incorporated into our fiscal 2017 outlook. We've effectively lapped these items at this point in time. However, we recently experienced new challenges around pricing softness in the form of increased competitive pricing activity and lower branded inflation, which I discussed a few moments ago. These new challenges resulted in a lower fiscal second quarter result and a revision to our previous full year outlook for fiscal 2017 of a $13.43 to $13.93 old range to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. 
Our business remains structurally sound. We are in the right businesses in the right markets, and we being scale and efficiency to all stakeholders. Our leadership team and I met with our -- each of our business unit leaders earlier this month. These visits reinforced my conviction that we have the best people in the business making the right decisions every day to help our customers lead the change across the health-care system we serve. We consider it an honor to serve in this capacity, and clearly, our people have the passion necessary to lead through change. The quality and ingenuity of our team give me great confidence in our future.
We have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation. We are extremely well positioned to deploy capital and deliver value for our shareholders through a combination of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we're pleased to announce earlier today an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

Today, I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results.

Today, I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John and I taking your questions.
Before I get to our outlook, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings, excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view the noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter as well as charges or related reversals associated with the Cost Alignment Plan we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes prior year gains on sales of 2 businesses.
To expand on these unusual items, in the second quarter, we recorded a noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million or $1.24 per diluted share associated with our EIS business. Also in the second quarter, we recorded pretax credits of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share related to the Cost Alignment Plan.
Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. As John discussed earlier, based on our reported earnings and expectations for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $13.43 to $13.93 to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. This new range excludes approximately $1.31 to $1.33 from adjusted earnings, driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge and anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the Cost Alignment Plan. Our revised outlook includes the impacts of competitive customer pricing and softness in brand inflation that John just discussed. We expect these 2 headwinds to drive a combined reduction of between approximately $1.60 and $1.90 to our fiscal '17 adjusted EPS. We expect the larger of the 2 impacts to be driven by more competitive pricing. These headwinds will be partially offset by a number of items, including savings from ongoing cost-management efforts, lower interest expense and lower tax rate and the effects of our ongoing capital deployment.
A listing of the key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on Slides 17 and 18. I will not take you through each key assumption on this call. However, I would like to draw your attention to the following significant updates to our revised outlook.
We now expect the Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost-alignment charges, to be approximately 30 to 40 basis points below the fiscal 2016 adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items of 234 basis points.
We now expect our interest expense to be down by a mid-teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. We also expect a full year adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge of approximately 27.5%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are expected to be approximately 226 million for the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share.
As it relates to the progression of our fiscal 2017 results, we expect that our second half results will be more weighted to our fourth quarter. While we are lowering our guidance today, we are promptly taking steps to address the industry headwinds that we have identified. For example, our Cost Alignment Plan and additional ongoing cost-management initiatives continue to bring savings to the company and position us well for future growth, and I am pleased by our strong operating cash flow generation in the first half of the year. 
For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year, excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments related to the Cost Alignment Plan and the settlement agreement with the DEA and DOJ. For the balance of fiscal '17, we expect to continue to deploy capital in line with all 4 elements of our portfolio approach.
Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.72 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $2.94 per diluted share. As a reminder, our second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.31 per diluted share included a $0.14 gain on the sale of the ZEE Medical business. For comparison purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $3.17.
Now I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 3% in constant currency. Second quarter adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic inflation trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity and lower compensation from our branded manufacturer, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and global procurement benefits. Further, as I've previously discussed, we also saw softness in certain branded manufacturer pricing activity and, more recently, increased competitive customer pricing activity.
Second quarter adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 1% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our Cost Alignment Plan as well as ongoing cost-management efforts.
Adjusted other income was $25 million for the quarter, an increase of 47% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $78 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter.
Now moving to taxes. Adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge, was 25.4% driven by our mix of income and multiple discrete tax benefits. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items, totaled $669 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items of $2.94, decreased 7% versus the prior year.
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant-currency revenues of $49.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 2% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues was $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant-currency basis, up 12%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $305 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.
Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter, consistent with my previous comments.
Second quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% on a constant-currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflected increase in expenses related to recently completed acquisitions, substantially offset by our cost-reduction actions.
Distribution Solutions second quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 15% in constant currency at $933 million. The second quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 188 basis points, a decrease of 40 basis points on a constant-currency basis, driven by the same factors as previously discussed.
Technology Solutions revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $680 million on a constant-currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
Second quarter adjusted segment gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 7% on a constant-currency basis. Second quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 6% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, decreased 10% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items, of 20.74%, down 104 basis points relative to the prior year. The reduction was driven primarily by the expected decline of our hospital software business, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding are flat from the prior year at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased 2 days from the prior year to 29 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in days sales in payables relative to the prior year is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals.
We generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first half of our fiscal year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.5 billion, with $2.9 billion held offshore.
In the first half of the year, McKesson paid $2 billion for acquisitions and spent $240 million on internal capital investments. And earlier today, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share and authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program.
Now moving to our announced transaction with Change Healthcare. While the transaction has not yet closed and McKesson and Change Healthcare continue to operate as separate companies, we wanted to provide some updates and clarity around how the transaction will impact McKesson upon a successful closing. We continue to be optimistic that the transaction will close in the first half of calendar year 2017. The assets and liabilities being contributed to NewCo have been reclassified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016.
In addition, we expect that our 70% equity ownership contribution from NewCo will be reported in the other income line. This line item will reflect the pretax equity income from our share of NewCo. At the time of the close of the transaction, McKesson is anticipated to record a significant onetime gain on the divestiture and related contribution of our net assets to NewCo.
Next, I'd like to address the drivers that I previously mentioned that will have an impact on McKesson's EPS results when the transaction closes. First, NewCo will be servicing approximately $6.1 billion of debt with an interest rate of approximately 5% to 7%. That's driving higher interest expense estimated to be between approximately $210 million and $300 million year-over-year after accounting for our 70% share of NewCo's earnings.
Second, as is customary with transactions involving technology companies, we will record fair value adjustments to the contributed businesses deferred revenue, which we expect to reduce reported earnings year-over-year by approximately $150 million to $200 million after adjusting for our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings.
Please note that the deferred revenue range I have provided today is sensitive to our fiscal year-end sales activity. Assuming that the transaction closes on April 1, 2017, the combination of financing costs and accounting-related fair value adjustment is expected to drive between approximately $1.10 and $1.30 in fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS dilution, which will be partially offset by an operating profit benefit, including the first year synergies from our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. This benefit will be higher than the amount that the NTS contributed assets would have generated absent our transaction with Change Healthcare.
While this transaction will initially impact our adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that the creation of NewCo is very much in the best interest of our shareholders. Working with Change Healthcare, we will drive significant customer and financial synergies. In addition, we have a strong partner in Blackstone with a shared focus on value creation and agreed upon part to n IPOs and a plan that allows us to exit the investment in a tax-efficient manner.
In closing, while we are currently being adversely impacted by multiple market conditions, our talented team focused on both gross profit initiatives and expense management, strong cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility underpin the confidence we have in our business.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Noah?"

It happened that year the we were able to fill the margin whole created from that stairstep to the unique opportunity to be the sole provider of the H1 N1 flu vaccine back then, and that give us a string of possibility that allowed us to grow through that challenge. So it does happen from time to time. You have to really probably ask the companies involved in it as to why they would pursue price. But I can tell you that McKesson doesn't believe you can build sustainable relationships with customers or value for shareowners with a price point approach. And I know that at least 1 company in our sector has been pretty public about growing revenues above market and about regaining market share, particularly in the independent space. And so I think that certainly, people have different motives perhaps to grow their business beyond the market. I would tell you what McKesson's been focused on, as we talked about year in and year out is the expansion of the service we provide our customers and the value the we delivered the greatest relationships and expand our margins well we do some. And margin growth comes from solid relationships that are built over time. And from time to time, those relationships can be challenged if the price differential between where they -- where the customer perceives the market price to be and what we're asking for become disconnected. So it has happened before. We've -- we covered through those periods of time. And like I said, I don't think a price-oriented approach to market share is something that's stable in the end anyway."

To try perhaps put a little bit more quantification around that, I would say that the delta, if you will, between the rate of inflation that we expected, the one that we have seen thus far year-to-date is greater than a third reduction versus our original expectations. The other thing I would comment on in terms of the brand income, why this inflation rate is important is that there is both a fixed component and a variable component of the income that we received from branded manufacturers. Now a year or more ago, we were talking about that being roughly 80-20 type split in terms of the fixed component of the equation versus the variable component. As in part, the contracts involved but also in part, those inflation rates have come down the last few months. I'd peg that split more at 90-10, 90% of our income is fixed, 10% is variable.

I can't speak to how our competitors make decisions or how they make their pricing calls in the industry. I can tell you that McKesson is focused on retaining our customer base and create an additional value for our customers as I talked about before charging a fair price. And on that fair price idea, there is plenty of headroom in terms of the value we deliver to the industry that we don't charge for. And as I've seen in the past when we have faced pressures like this, where there's been a reduction in product launches or other things that have happened with some of the profit that pools become more difficult, typically, what we would attempt to do is reduce the level of incremental discounts that we pass on to our customers when we're in those discussions. But clearly, that conversation isn't successful if there are alternatives that are providing something that is even more significant. So I can't -- my best hope is that we demonstrate to our customers that they are going to always get a fair price from us. And in return, they're going to get superior service and tremendous focus on their success, and that's where we plan to stay. And I know at McKesson, at least, we think growing market share through a price-oriented approach ultimately will not be successful because if customers don't want to change, our customers, when they get a better deal come to us and say, ""Hey, listen, can you match this deal because I'd like to stay with you?"" And so that customer pressure to remain with us because they like us always provides McKesson an advantage when we're in these discussions."

Like everybody else, they control their pricing decisions, and we don't have much visibility in anything other rather than historic behavior. And their historic behavior obviously has been rising over the last several years. And if you go back before the more recent years, there's always been a level of, at least in our data, always been a level of inflation that has occurred. And you do hear some manufacturers talking today about having the policy around how much inflation they think they should be able to provide the industry over time. Some of them are making those statements more publicly than others. And clearly, there might be some near-term changes in their behavior that will be different over the longer haul. We do think that innovation requires profitability. We think that the lack of new product launches in the face of generic conversions causes pressure to branded manufacturers, and they ought to have the ability to raise price appropriately on branded drugs to help fund their R&D requirements and their profitability requirements. And so I think that a common person's view would be that we would -- it would still see inflation at some level. I think that the outer balance of inflation that had been experienced in the past by our industry that we would have conversations of that in the past are probably likely to not exist anymore. So I just think those heavy outliers on both brand and generic, those outliers will come in, in which obviously will have an effect. But it's probably a bit early to speculate. I think as we get through the rest of this year, we've given you some assumptions about directionally where we think it's going to be the balance of this year.

And then when we think about the sell-side pressure that you talking about, is that a number that we can take annualized into next year? And I think my point being is that obviously, it's a big EPS hit and when we think about the margin implication, is it fair to assume that you just repriced that portion of the contracts that's offered [indiscernible] for this year? Or have you also gone proactively to your customers and locked in contract that are going to come up in the next year or 2 at any pricing cycle?"

On the sell-side, it's a little bit more difficult to make projections because we're basically in a position where we are reacting to some extent and not being the people that are making the decision. I think that our view is that we have made a very significant change in our pricing practice to match where the market is today. And we, like I said in my other -- to answer that other question was asked, we have seen this kind of event happening in the past as well, and we didn't see a continuation of the event.

Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today as events impacting our second quarter results had implications for our outlook fo",2233,"Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today as events impacting our second quarter results had implications for our outlook for fiscal 2017.
Let's start with our revised fiscal 2017 outlook. In particular, we now provide an update to our expectation of a lower profit contribution, resulting from recent customer pricing activities and lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical inflation trends compared to previous expectations, both of which affect our U.S. Pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions.
As a result of these updates, we now expect $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share, which excludes from adjusted earnings a goodwill impairment charge in our Enterprise Information Solutions business, which James will cover in his comments, as well as estimated charges related to our Cost Alignment Plan that was previously announced in March of 2016.
As we built our plan and entered fiscal 2017, we assumed some moderation around drug inflation activity. In particular, we commented on our expectation for a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increased in price. We also commented that our expectation that branded pharmaceutical price trends would be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
First, the generic price inflation has been largely in line with our original assumption. However, customer pricing and branded inflation continue to evolve. In our first quarter, we witnessed some evidence of inflation and pricing softness in line with our original assumptions. However, the softness became much more pronounced in our second quarter, first, around brand inflation, and later, around customer pricing.
While we generally do not provide specific assumptions around customer pricing activity, we do operate in a competitive environment. And though competitive, we've always been focused on delivering value to our customers, value not just defined by price but by service, innovation that helps our customers' partner manage and run their operations and manage their capital more effectively and innovation that helps our customers connect with patients in a more informed and intimate way. 
Now price is always a consideration. We provide our customers a premium value to our superior service and innovation, for which we expect to get an appropriate price. We believe that delivering premium value builds more sustainable customer relationships and long-term shareholder value. 
Generally speaking, we anticipate pockets of increased competitive activity as part of our normal course of business. We began to see more recently as competitive activity that is broader than our original expectations, more aggressive and across several areas of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. As I've mentioned in the past, McKesson manages pricing on a centralized basis, although I think all of our customers believe we've been charging fairly for the service we provide and are willing to pay for this service. But if a competitor significantly undercuts our existing pricing, we are compelled to respond. And although we cannot be absolutely assured that recent price concessions will address the recent heightened competitiveness fully, we believe our responses have been appropriate and measured.
We remain committed to our careful and thoughtful approach to customer pricing and to the value we deliver to help differentiate our customers' capabilities and performance relative to their competitors. We believe the services we provide to both our provider customers and our manufacturer customers offer substantially greater value than what either party could develop with a more direct relationship. And we expect that with our focus on the value we deliver, our margins will recover over time.
As for branded inflation, I suspect many of you have tracked the evolving conversation in the U.S. Last month, James highlighted concerns we had around some manufacturers appearing to delay some price increases we would have otherwise anticipated based on their historical and our historical experience. What we've seen this year-to-date are fewer products with price increases, and those price increases are at lower rates than both prior year results and our expectations for the current fiscal year. Given our second quarter performance specific to branded price inflation, we now expect the full year branded pharmaceutical pricing trends to be meaningful but meaningfully below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
Let me spend a minute and talk about how we are compensated for branded pharmaceutical product distribution services. Today, all of our contacts with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are individually negotiated but, generally, are constructed around charging for the service we provide. In almost all cases, the charge is derived as a percent of revenue managed and delivered by McKesson for that specific manufacturer. These charges vary not only by manufacturer but also by the service requirement at the product level.
Clearly, revenue-based fees are all affected at some level by inflation. However, in some cases, the benefit from inflation is greater, given the specifics and the characteristics of individual contracts and the specific behavior of the manufacturers that are a party to these agreements. So although a large majority of our compensation is relatively easy to forecast, inflation-based income derived from these relationships can impact our results on a more variable basis. 
Through these agreements, speculative buying or buying large quantities of product in front of anticipated price increases no longer exists. Essentially, all of McKesson's pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with the manufacturer, unlike the industry standard practice years ago before any contracts presided over the relationships between wholesalers and their manufacturer partners. These charges that happened to -- these changes that happened years ago have translated into more stable inventory levels that are appropriate to meet the customer demands and service levels.
So the takeaway here is that branded inflation still plays a meaningful role, and in some cases, it can be an important part of our overall compensation with specific manufacturers, and we can be impacted by their decisions relative to price increases. Although some contracts of manufacturers may not have specific compensation elements tied to product price changes, our internal branded price inflation assumptions often appeared to be directionally aligned with externally published data. But the mix matters, so even relatively small changes in behavior could be more or less -- could have a more or less impact on our results, depending on the characteristics of that individual manufacturer contract. We'd like to think we do a superior job of exceeding the expectations of these partners, so there should be even some variability in our industry related to results driven by branded and generic inflations.
So what does all this mean moving forward? It means we expect to receive less compensation from branded price increases than we originally anticipated in fiscal 2017. It means we will continue to monitor pricing activities throughout the year, especially in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is typically an important quarter for price increases. And it means we are engaging with our manufacturer partners to ensure we receive appropriate compensation relative to the services and value we deliver amidst a softer pricing environment.
Now turning to our revised outlook for fiscal 2017. We expect the combination of recent competitive pricing and further moderating branded price increased activity will have a combined negative effect on our business by approximately $1.60 to $1.90 per diluted share versus our July fiscal 2017 outlook, with the larger impact coming from competitive pricing.
Turning now back to our second quarter results. In the interest of time, I'll hit a few key themes, and then we'll hand the call over to James to cover our financial performance.
Let me start with the progress we made on integrating the several acquisitions we closed last quarter as well as early progress in Sainsbury's, which we closed at the beginning of September. These are important strategic investments that are tracking to our expectations and contributing positively to our financial performance. We're especially pleased by the stronger-than-expected performance of our Biologics acquisition, which is an important offering to our manufacturing partners in the rapidly growing oncology specialty pharmacy market.
Turning now to some highlights within Distribution Solutions segment for the quarter. Our sourcing partners -- partnership with Walmart is progressing well. We made considerable progress to date in our efforts to establish the new sourcing function, and we are on track to realize benefits from this new venture in fiscal 2018. We remain confident in our assumption that we will service the Rite Aid business through our current fiscal year, given that the acquisition by Walgreens is still pending. We will continue to follow the progress of this transaction as well as any new developments around the opportunity to serve any of the acquired or divested stores.
We are making the fundamental change to the structure in terms of our relationships with both providers and manufacturers as it relates to hundreds of specialty products. We are charging separately for the supply chain value we had across a wide array of product categories and manufacturers. Our conversations with the customers and suppliers around specialty pricing are proceeding as expected, and we are pleased with the responses we are receiving.
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the great work from our U.S. Pharmaceutical teams that support our customers every day. We started the fiscal year with the successful on-boarding of the Albertsons-Safeway network and another successful ideaShare conference with our independent retail pharmacy customers. And in the second quarter, Health Mart stores were ranked highest overall in customer satisfaction among chain drug pharmacies across the U.S. in the J.D. Power 2016 Pharmacy Satisfaction Study. It's great to see recognition for the positive experiences patients receive every day in these pharmacies.
Turning now to our international pharmaceutical distribution and services. As we mentioned in our earnings call last quarter, reimbursement cuts imposed by the U.K. government to retail pharmacy rates as well as the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU have unfavorably impacted Celesio's operating performance. Despite these headwinds, I'm encouraged by the significant progress we made to help shape the long-term opportunities we expect are available to us across the European markets in which we operate.
In addition to our internal focus strategy, such as Six Sigma training and the standard ERP platform across our many geographies, we are engaged with external stakeholders and productive discussions around services we can offer to state-run health systems where wholesalers today often play a limited role or expanding the services a retail pharmacy may deliver to its customers. We continue to make good progress on further developing our opportunities in our European markets.
As for our other Distribution Solutions businesses, such as McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, Medical-Surgical, they're all performing very well, showing strong growth and profitability, including double-digit adjusted operating profit growth year-over-year for all of these businesses in Q2.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm encouraged by the exceptional performance from our Technology Solutions team. Even with considerable distractions to support the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare, this segment delivered solid results. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions in support of a strong future with Change Healthcare while managing the work to retain the Relay Pharmacy business and prepare the EIS business for strategic alternatives.
In Q2, we recorded a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to EIS. As you may recall, we are considering strategic alternatives for EIS, which is part of our broader Technology Solutions strategy that we unveiled earlier this year. Our commitment has been and will always be to the long-term value creation for our customers, employees and shareholders, and we are confident in the direction we are headed with our Technology Solutions businesses.
Now to wrap up my comments. We've spoken for a few quarters about how generics inflation and customer consolidation challenges that we identified last year, which were incorporated into our fiscal 2017 outlook. We've effectively lapped these items at this point in time. However, we recently experienced new challenges around pricing softness in the form of increased competitive pricing activity and lower branded inflation, which I discussed a few moments ago. These new challenges resulted in a lower fiscal second quarter result and a revision to our previous full year outlook for fiscal 2017 of a $13.43 to $13.93 old range to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. 
Our business remains structurally sound. We are in the right businesses in the right markets, and we being scale and efficiency to all stakeholders. Our leadership team and I met with our -- each of our business unit leaders earlier this month. These visits reinforced my conviction that we have the best people in the business making the right decisions every day to help our customers lead the change across the health-care system we serve. We consider it an honor to serve in this capacity, and clearly, our people have the passion necessary to lead through change. The quality and ingenuity of our team give me great confidence in our future.
We have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation. We are extremely well positioned to deploy capital and deliver value for our shareholders through a combination of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we're pleased to announce earlier today an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

Today, I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John and I taking your questions.
Before I get to our outlook, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings, excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view the noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter as well as charges or related reversals associated with the Cost Alignment Plan we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes prior year gains on sales of 2 businesses.
To expand on these unusual items, in the second quarter, we recorded a noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million or $1.24 per diluted share associated with our EIS business. Also in the second quarter, we recorded pretax credits of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share related to the Cost Alignment Plan.
Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. As John discussed earlier, based on our reported earnings and expectations for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $13.43 to $13.93 to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. This new range excludes approximately $1.31 to $1.33 from adjusted earnings, driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge and anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the Cost Alignment Plan. Our revised outlook includes the impacts of competitive customer pricing and softness in brand inflation that John just discussed. We expect these 2 headwinds to drive a combined reduction of between approximately $1.60 and $1.90 to our fiscal '17 adjusted EPS. We expect the larger of the 2 impacts to be driven by more competitive pricing. These headwinds will be partially offset by a number of items, including savings from ongoing cost-management efforts, lower interest expense and lower tax rate and the effects of our ongoing capital deployment.
A listing of the key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on Slides 17 and 18. I will not take you through each key assumption on this call. However, I would like to draw your attention to the following significant updates to our revised outlook.
We now expect the Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost-alignment charges, to be approximately 30 to 40 basis points below the fiscal 2016 adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items of 234 basis points.
We now expect our interest expense to be down by a mid-teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. We also expect a full year adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge of approximately 27.5%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are expected to be approximately 226 million for the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share.
As it relates to the progression of our fiscal 2017 results, we expect that our second half results will be more weighted to our fourth quarter. While we are lowering our guidance today, we are promptly taking steps to address the industry headwinds that we have identified. For example, our Cost Alignment Plan and additional ongoing cost-management initiatives continue to bring savings to the company and position us well for future growth, and I am pleased by our strong operating cash flow generation in the first half of the year. 
For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year, excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments related to the Cost Alignment Plan and the settlement agreement with the DEA and DOJ. For the balance of fiscal '17, we expect to continue to deploy capital in line with all 4 elements of our portfolio approach.
Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.72 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $2.94 per diluted share. As a reminder, our second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.31 per diluted share included a $0.14 gain on the sale of the ZEE Medical business. For comparison purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $3.17.
Now I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 3% in constant currency. Second quarter adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic inflation trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity and lower compensation from our branded manufacturer, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and global procurement benefits. Further, as I've previously discussed, we also saw softness in certain branded manufacturer pricing activity and, more recently, increased competitive customer pricing activity.
Second quarter adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 1% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our Cost Alignment Plan as well as ongoing cost-management efforts.
Adjusted other income was $25 million for the quarter, an increase of 47% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $78 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter.
Now moving to taxes. Adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge, was 25.4% driven by our mix of income and multiple discrete tax benefits. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items, totaled $669 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items of $2.94, decreased 7% versus the prior year.
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant-currency revenues of $49.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 2% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues was $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant-currency basis, up 12%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $305 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.
Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter, consistent with my previous comments.
Second quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% on a constant-currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflected increase in expenses related to recently completed acquisitions, substantially offset by our cost-reduction actions.
Distribution Solutions second quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 15% in constant currency at $933 million. The second quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 188 basis points, a decrease of 40 basis points on a constant-currency basis, driven by the same factors as previously discussed.
Technology Solutions revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $680 million on a constant-currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
Second quarter adjusted segment gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 7% on a constant-currency basis. Second quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 6% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, decreased 10% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items, of 20.74%, down 104 basis points relative to the prior year. The reduction was driven primarily by the expected decline of our hospital software business, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding are flat from the prior year at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased 2 days from the prior year to 29 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in days sales in payables relative to the prior year is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals.
We generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first half of our fiscal year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.5 billion, with $2.9 billion held offshore.
In the first half of the year, McKesson paid $2 billion for acquisitions and spent $240 million on internal capital investments. And earlier today, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share and authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program.
Now moving to our announced transaction with Change Healthcare. While the transaction has not yet closed and McKesson and Change Healthcare continue to operate as separate companies, we wanted to provide some updates and clarity around how the transaction will impact McKesson upon a successful closing. We continue to be optimistic that the transaction will close in the first half of calendar year 2017. The assets and liabilities being contributed to NewCo have been reclassified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016.
In addition, we expect that our 70% equity ownership contribution from NewCo will be reported in the other income line. This line item will reflect the pretax equity income from our share of NewCo. At the time of the close of the transaction, McKesson is anticipated to record a significant onetime gain on the divestiture and related contribution of our net assets to NewCo.
Next, I'd like to address the drivers that I previously mentioned that will have an impact on McKesson's EPS results when the transaction closes. First, NewCo will be servicing approximately $6.1 billion of debt with an interest rate of approximately 5% to 7%. That's driving higher interest expense estimated to be between approximately $210 million and $300 million year-over-year after accounting for our 70% share of NewCo's earnings.
Second, as is customary with transactions involving technology companies, we will record fair value adjustments to the contributed businesses deferred revenue, which we expect to reduce reported earnings year-over-year by approximately $150 million to $200 million after adjusting for our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings.
Please note that the deferred revenue range I have provided today is sensitive to our fiscal year-end sales activity. Assuming that the transaction closes on April 1, 2017, the combination of financing costs and accounting-related fair value adjustment is expected to drive between approximately $1.10 and $1.30 in fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS dilution, which will be partially offset by an operating profit benefit, including the first year synergies from our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. This benefit will be higher than the amount that the MTS contributed assets would have generated absent our transaction with Change Healthcare. While this transaction will initially impact our adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that the creation of NewCo is very much in the best interest of our shareholders. Working with Change Healthcare, we will drive significant customer and financial synergies. In addition, we have a strong partner in Blackstone with a shared focus on value creation and agreed upon part to an IPO and a plan that allows us to exit the investment in a tax-efficient manner.
In closing, while we are currently being adversely impacted by multiple market conditions, our talented team focused on both gross profit initiatives and the expense management, strong cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility underpin the confidence we have in our business.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Noah?"

I guess, I have seen this obviously throughout my career, but we also saw it in McKesson that we're -- in particular, we took sort of a step function down with pricing, you may recall. And I think in the early part of '08, we had talked publicly about a significant price-related challenge that we were facing. Now it happened that year that we were able to fill the margin hole created from that stair step through the -- a unique opportunity to be the sole provider of the H1N1 flu vaccine back then, and that gave us a stream of possibility that allowed us to grow through that challenge. So it does happen from time to time. I -- you'd have to really probably ask the companies involved in it as to why they would pursue price. I can tell you that McKesson doesn't believe you can build sustainable relationships with customers or value for shareholders with a price-oriented approach. And I know that at least one company in our sector has been pretty public about growing revenues above market and about regaining market share, particularly in the independent space. And so I think that certainly, people have different motives perhaps to grow their business beyond the market. I would tell you that what McKesson's been focused on as we've talked about year in and year out is the expansion of the service we provide our customers and the value that we deliver to create those relationships and expand our margins while we do so. And margin growth comes from solid relationships that are built over time, and from time to time, those can -- those relationships can be challenged if the price differential between where they -- where the customer perceives the market price to be and what we're asking for become disconnected. So it has happened before. We've -- we covered through those periods of time. And I -- like I said, I don't think a price-oriented approach to market share is something that's stable in the end anyway."

We do have some variability that resides in that part of our business. Clearly, on the -- the manufacturers play a very important role for us, and we're constantly working with the manufacturers to make sure that we've identified the value we deliver and that we're properly reimbursed for that value. We plan to continue to do so. On the customer side, it's not unimportant, I think, to point out that we do have an nice and profitable relationship with customers, the generic portion of our business, albeit we may not make much or any on the brand side. The profit stream we get from generic participation as we've talked about before when we were picking up the Rite Aid generic business or the Target generic business, that generic business is a source of profitability. And there is, obviously, flexibility in how we price those generics, and there's a market for generics. And we have to be responsive to how the market pricing plays for generics.

And today, we've updated that tight commentaries and now being meaningfully below what we saw last year. To try to perhaps put a little bit more quantification around that, I would say that the delta, if you will, between the rate of inflation that we expected and the one that we have seen thus far year-to-date is greater than 1/3 reduction versus our original expectations. The other thing I would comment on in terms of the brand income, why this inflation rate is important, is that there is both a fixed component and a variable component of the income that we receive from branded manufacturers. Now a year or more ago, we were talking about that being a roughly 80-20 type split in terms of the fixed component of the equation versus the variable component. As in part, the contracts have evolved but also in part, as inflation rates have come down in the last few months, I'd peg that split more at 90-10: 90% of our income is fixed. 10% is variable. But obviously, that 10 points is still being able to have a meaningful impact on the financials that we've been talking about today."

I can't speak to how our competitors make their decisions or how they make their pricing calls in the industry. I can tell you that McKesson is focused on retaining our customer base and create an additional value for our customers, as I talked about before, charging a fair price. And on that fair price idea, there is plenty of headroom in terms of the value we deliver to the industry that we don't charge for. And as I've seen in the past when we have faced pressures like this, where there's been a reduction in product launches or other things happened with some of the profit that pulls become more difficult, what typically we would attempt to do is reduce the level of incremental discounts that we pass on to our customers when we're in those discussions. But clearly, that conversation isn't successful if there are alternatives that are providing something that is even more significant. So I can't -- my best hope is that we demonstrate to our customers that they're going to always get a fair price from us. And in return, they're going to get superior service and tremendous focus on their success, and that's where we plan to stay. And I know at McKesson, at least, we think growing market share through a price-oriented approach ultimately will not be successful because customers don't want to change. Our customers, when they get a better deal, come to us and say, ""Hey, listen. Can you match this deal? Because I'd like to stay with you."" And so that customer pressure to remain with us because they like us always provides McKesson an advantage when we're in these discussions."

The",363,"Well, I think the view we have as a year -- sort of a year-to-date view, we have the same information that you have and probably the same visibility, and we're just guessing as to what manufacturers are likely to do going forward, like everybody else. They control their pricing decisions, and we don't have much visibility into anything other than their historic behavior. And their historic behavior obviously has been rising over the last several years. And if you go back before the more recent years, there's always been a level of, at least in our data, always been a level of inflation that has occurred. And you do hear some manufacturers talking today about having the policy around how much inflation they're -- they think they should be able to provide to the industry over time. Some of them are making those statements more publicly than others. And clearly, there might be some near-term changes in their behavior that will be different over the longer haul. We do think that innovation requires profitability. We think that the lack of new product launches in the face of generic conversions causes pressure to branded manufacturers and that they ought to have the ability to raise price appropriately on branded drugs to help fund their R&D requirements and their profitability requirements. And so I think that a common person's view would be that we would -- you would -- you'd still see inflation at some level. So I think that the outer bounds of inflation that had been experienced in the past by our industry, that we've had conversations about in the past, are probably likely to not exist anymore. So I just think those heavy outliers on both brand and generic, those outliers will come in, which obviously will have an effect. But it's probably a little bit early to speculate. And I think as we get through the rest of this year, we've given you some assumptions about directionally where we think it's going to be the balance of this year. As we get into the next fiscal year, we'll give you a sense for where we think it's going to be."

288195,404024707,1064578,"McKesson Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today as events impacting our second quarter results have implications for our outlook f",2233,"Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today as events impacting our second quarter results have implications for our outlook for fiscal 2017.
Let's start with our revised fiscal 2017 outlook. In particular, we now provide an update to our expectation of a lower profit contribution, resulting from recent customer pricing activities and lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical inflation trends compared to previous expectations, both of which affect our U.S. Pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions.
As a result of these updates, we now expect $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share, which excludes from adjusted earnings a goodwill impairment charge in our Enterprise Information Solutions business, which James will cover in his comments, as well as estimated charges related to our Cost Alignment Plan that was previously announced in March of 2016.
As we built our plan and entered fiscal 2017, we assumed some moderation around drug inflation activity. In particular, we commented on our expectation for a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price. We also commented that our expectation that branded pharmaceutical price trends would be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
First, generic price inflation has been largely in line with our original assumption. However, customer pricing and branded inflation continue to evolve. In our first quarter, we witnessed some evidence of inflation and pricing softness in line with our original assumptions. However, the softness became much more pronounced in our second quarter, first, around brand inflation and later, around customer pricing.
While we generally do not provide specific assumptions around customer pricing activity, we do operate in a competitive environment. And though competitive, we've always been focused on delivering value to our customers, value not just defined by price but by service, innovation that helps our customers' partner manage and run their operations and manage their capital more effectively and innovation that helps our customers connect with patients in a more informed and intimate way. 
Now price is always a consideration. We provide our customers a premium value through our superior service and innovation, for which we expect to get an appropriate price. We believe that delivering premium value builds more sustainable customer relationships and long-term shareholder value. 
Generally speaking, we anticipate pockets of increased competitive activity as part of our normal course of business. What we began to see more recently is competitive activity that is broader than our original expectations, more aggressive and across several areas of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. As I've mentioned in the past, McKesson manages pricing on a centralized basis, although I think all of our customers believe we've been charging fairly for the service we provide and are willing to pay for this service. When a competitor significantly undercuts our existing pricing, we are compelled to respond. And although we cannot be absolutely assured that recent price concessions will address the recent heightened competitiveness fully, we believe our responses have been appropriate and measured.
We remain committed to our careful and thoughtful approach to customer pricing and to the value we deliver to help differentiate our customers' capabilities and performance relative to their competitors. We believe the services we provide to both our provider customers and our manufacturer customers offer substantially greater value than what either party could develop with a more direct relationship. And we expect that with our focus on the value we deliver, our margins will recover over time.
As for branded inflation, I suspect many of you have tracked the evolving conversation in the U.S. Last month, James highlighted concerns we had around some manufacturers appearing to delay some price increases we would have otherwise anticipated based on their historical and our historical experience. What we've seen this year, to-date, are fewer products with price increases, and those price increases are at lower rates than both prior year results and our expectations for the current fiscal year. Given our second quarter performance specific to branded price inflation, we now expect full year branded pharmaceutical pricing trends to be meaningful -- meaningfully below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
Let me spend a minute and talk about how we are compensated for branded pharmaceutical product distribution services. Today, all of our contacts with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are individually negotiated but, generally, are constructed around charging for the service we provide. In almost all cases, the charge is derived as a percent of revenue managed and delivered by McKesson for that specific manufacturer. These charges vary not only by manufacturer but also by the service requirement at the product level.
Clearly, revenue-based fees are all affected at some level by inflation. However, in some cases, the benefit from inflation is greater, given the specifics and the characteristics of individual contracts and the specific behavior of the manufacturers that are a party to these agreements. So although a large majority of our compensation is relatively easy to forecast, inflation-based income derived from these relationships can impact our results on a more variable basis. 
Through these agreements, speculative buying or buying large quantities of product in front of anticipated price increases no longer exists. Essentially, all of McKesson's pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with the manufacturer, unlike the industry standard practice years ago before any contracts presided over the relationships between wholesalers and their manufacturer partners. These charges that happened to -- these changes that happened years ago have translated into more stable inventory levels that are appropriate to meet the customer demands and service levels.
So the takeaway here is that branded inflation still plays a meaningful role, and in some cases, it can be an important part of our overall compensation with specific manufacturers, and we can be impacted by their decisions relative to price increases. Although some contracts with manufacturers may not have specific compensation elements tied to product price changes, our internal branded price inflation assumptions often appear to be directionally aligned with externally published data. But the mix matters, so even relatively small changes in behavior could be more or less -- could have a more or less impact on our results depending on the characteristics of that individual manufacturer contract. We'd like to think we do a superior job of exceeding the expectations of these partners, so there should be even some variability in our industry related to results driven by branded and generic inflations.
So what does all this mean moving forward? It means we expect to receive less compensation from branded price increases than we originally anticipated in fiscal 2017. It means we will continue to monitor pricing activities throughout the year, especially in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is typically an important quarter for price increases. And it means we are engaging with our manufacturer partners to ensure we receive appropriate compensation relative to the services and value we deliver amidst a softer pricing environment.
Now turning to our revised outlook for fiscal 2017. We expect the combination of recent competitive pricing and further moderating branded price increase activity will have a combined negative effect on our business by approximately $1.60 to $1.90 per diluted share versus our July fiscal 2017 outlook, with the larger impact coming from competitive pricing.
Turning now back to our second quarter results. In the interest of time, I'll hit a few key themes, and then we'll hand the call over to James to cover our financial performance.
Let me start with the progress we've made on integrating the several acquisitions we closed last quarter, as well as early progress on Sainsbury's, which we closed at the beginning of September. These are important strategic investments that are tracking to our expectations and contributing positively to our financial performance. We were especially pleased by the stronger-than-expected performance of our Biologics acquisition, which is an important offering to our manufacturing partners in the rapidly growing oncology specialty pharmacy market.
Turning now to some highlights within Distribution Solutions segment for the quarter. Our sourcing partners -- partnership with Walmart is progressing well. We made considerable progress to date in our efforts to establish the new sourcing function, and we are on track to realize benefits from this new venture in fiscal 2018. We remain confident in our assumption that we will service the Rite Aid business through our current fiscal year, given that the acquisition by Walgreens is still pending. We will continue to follow the progress of this transaction as well as any new developments around the opportunity to serve any of the acquired or divested stores.
We are making a fundamental change to the structure in terms of our relationship with both providers and manufacturers as it relates to hundreds of specialty products. We are charging separately for the supply chain value we add across a wide array of product categories and manufacturers. Our conversations with customers and suppliers around specialty pricing are proceeding as expected, and we are pleased with the responses we are receiving.
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the great work from our U.S. Pharmaceutical teams that support our customers every day. We started the fiscal year with the successful on-boarding of the Albertsons-Safeway network and another successful ideaShare conference with our independent retail pharmacy customers. And in the second quarter, Health Mart stores were ranked highest overall in customer satisfaction among chain drug pharmacies across the U.S. in the J.D. Power 2016 Pharmacy Satisfaction Study. It's great to see recognition for the positive experiences patients receive every day in these pharmacies.
Turning now to our international pharmaceutical distribution and services. As we mentioned in our earnings call last quarter, reimbursement cuts imposed by the U.K. government to retail pharmacy rates as well as the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU have unfavorably impacted Celesio's operating performance. Despite these headwinds, I'm encouraged by the significant progress we made to help shape the long-term opportunities we expect are available to us across the European markets in which we operate.
In addition to our internal focus strategy, such as Six Sigma training and the standard ERP platform across our many geographies, we are engaged with external stakeholders in productive discussions around services we can offer to state-run health systems, where wholesalers today often play a limited role, or in expanding the services a retail pharmacy may deliver to its customers. We continue to make good progress on further developing our opportunities in our European markets.
As for our other Distribution Solutions businesses, such as McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, Medical-Surgical, they're all performing very well, showing strong growth in profitability, including double-digit adjusted operating profit growth year-over-year for all of these businesses in Q2.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm encouraged by the exceptional performance from our Technology Solutions team. Even with considerable distractions to support the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare, this segment delivered solid results. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions in support of a strong future with Change Healthcare while managing the work to retain the Relay Pharmacy business and prepare the EIS business for strategic alternatives.
In Q2, we recorded a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to EIS. As you may recall, we are considering strategic alternatives for EIS, which is part of our broader Technology Solutions strategy that we unveiled earlier this year. Our commitment has been and will always be to the long-term value creation for our customers, employees and shareholders, and we are confident in the direction we are headed with our Technology Solutions businesses.
Now to wrap up my comments. We've spoken for a few quarters about how generics inflation and customer consolidation challenges that we identified last year, which were incorporated into our fiscal 2017 outlook. We've effectively lapped these items at this point in time. However, we recently experienced new challenges around pricing softness in the form of increased competitive pricing activity and lower branded inflation, which I discussed a few moments ago. These new challenges resulted in a lower fiscal second quarter result and a revision to our previous full year outlook for fiscal 2017 of a $13.43 to $13.93 old range to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. 
Our business remains structurally sound. We are in the right businesses in the right markets, and we bring scale and efficiency to all stakeholders. Our leadership team and I met with our -- each of our business unit leaders earlier this month. These visits reinforced my conviction that we have the best people in the business making the right decisions every day to help our customers lead the change across the healthcare system we serve. We consider it an honor to serve in this capacity, and clearly, our people have the passion necessary to lead through change. The quality and ingenuity of our team give me great confidence in our future.
We have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation. We are extremely well positioned to deploy capital and deliver value for our shareholders through a combination of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we're pleased to announce earlier today an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

Today, I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John",2062,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John and I taking your questions.
Before I get to our outlook, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings, excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view the noncash, pretax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter as well as charges or related reversals associated with the Cost Alignment Plan we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes prior year gains on the sales of 2 businesses.
To expand on these unusual items, in the second quarter, we recorded a noncash, pretax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million or $1.24 per diluted share associated with our EIS business. Also in the second quarter, we recorded pretax credits of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share related to the Cost Alignment Plan.
Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. As John discussed earlier, based on our reported earnings and expectations for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $13.43 to $13.93 to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. This new range excludes approximately $1.31 to $1.33 from adjusted earnings, driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge and anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the Cost Alignment Plan. Our revised outlook includes the impacts of competitive customer pricing and softness in brand inflation that John just discussed. We expect these 2 headwinds to drive a combined reduction of between approximately $1.60 and $1.90 to our fiscal '17 adjusted EPS. We expect the larger of the 2 impacts to be driven by more competitive pricing. These headwinds will be partially offset by a number of items, including savings from ongoing cost-management efforts, lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and the effects of our ongoing capital deployment.
A listing of the key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on Slides 17 and 18. I will not take you through each key assumption on this call. However, I would like to draw your attention to the following significant updates to our revised outlook.
We now expect the Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost-alignment charges, to be approximately 30 to 40 basis points below the fiscal 2016 adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items of 234 basis points.
We now expect our interest expense to be down by a mid-teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. We also expect a full year adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge of approximately 27.5%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are expected to be approximately 226 million for the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share.
As it relates to the progression of our fiscal 2017 results, we expect that our second half results will be more weighted to our fourth quarter. While we are lowering our guidance today, we are promptly taking steps to address the industry headwinds that we have identified. For example, our Cost Alignment Plan and additional ongoing cost-management initiatives continue to bring savings to the company and position us well for future growth, and I am pleased by our strong operating cash flow generation in the first half of the year. 
For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year, excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments related to the Cost Alignment Plan and the settlement agreement with the DEA and DOJ. For the balance of fiscal '17, we expect to continue to deploy capital in line with all 4 elements of our portfolio approach.
Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.72 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $2.94 per diluted share. As a reminder, our second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.31 per diluted share included a $0.14 gain on the sale of the ZEE Medical business. For comparison purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $3.17.
Now I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 3% in constant currency. Second quarter adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic inflation trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity and lower compensation from a branded manufacturer, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and global procurement benefits. Further, as I've previously discussed, we also saw softness in certain branded manufacturer pricing activity and, more recently, increased competitive customer pricing activity.
Second quarter adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 1% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our Cost Alignment Plan as well as ongoing cost-management efforts.
Adjusted other income was $25 million for the quarter, an increase of 47% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $78 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter.
Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge, was 25.4% driven by our mix of income and multiple discrete tax benefits. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items, totaled $669 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items of $2.94, decreased 7% versus the prior year.
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant-currency revenues of $49.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 2% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant-currency basis, up 12%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $305 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.
Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter, consistent with my previous comments.
Second quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% on a constant-currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase in expenses related to recently completed acquisitions, substantially offset by our cost-reduction actions.
Distribution Solutions second quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 15% in constant currency at $933 million. The second quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 188 basis points, a decrease of 40 basis points on a constant-currency basis, driven by the same factors as previously discussed.
Technology Solutions revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $680 million on a constant-currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
Second quarter adjusted segment gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 7% on a constant-currency basis. Second quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 6% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, decreased 10% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items, of 20.74%, down 104 basis points relative to the prior year. The reduction was driven primarily by the expected decline of our hospital software business, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding are flat from the prior year at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased 2 days from the prior year to 29 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in days sales in payables, relative to the prior year, is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals.
We generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first half of our fiscal year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.5 billion, with $2.9 billion held offshore.
In the first half of the year, McKesson paid $2 billion for acquisitions and spent $240 million on internal capital investments. And earlier today, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share and authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program.
Now moving to our announced transaction with Change Healthcare. While the transaction has not yet closed and McKesson and Change Healthcare continue to operate as separate companies, we wanted to provide some updates and clarity around how the transaction will impact McKesson upon a successful closing. We continue to be optimistic that the transaction will close in the first half of calendar year 2017. The assets and liabilities being contributed to NewCo have been reclassified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016.
In addition, we expect that our 70% equity ownership contribution from NewCo will be reported in the other income line. This line item will reflect the pretax equity income from our share of NewCo. At the time of the close of the transaction, McKesson is anticipated to record a significant onetime gain on the divestiture and related contribution of our net assets to NewCo.
Next, I'd like to address the drivers that I have previously mentioned that will have an impact on McKesson's EPS results when the transaction closes. First, NewCo will be servicing approximately $6.1 billion of debt with an interest rate of approximately 5% to 7%. Thus driving higher interest expense estimated to be between approximately $210 million and $300 million year-over-year after accounting for our 70% share of NewCo's earnings.
Second, as is customary with transactions involving technology companies, we will record fair value adjustments to the contributed businesses deferred revenue, which we expect to reduce reported earnings year-over-year by approximately $150 million to $200 million after adjusting for our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings.
Please note that the deferred revenue range I have provided today is sensitive to our fiscal year-end sales activity. Assuming that the transaction closes on April 1, 2017, the combination of financing costs and accounting-related fair value adjustments is expected to drive between approximately $1.10 and $1.30 in fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS dilution, which will be partially offset by an operating profit benefit, including the first year synergies from our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. This benefit will be higher than the amount that the MTS contributed assets would have generated absent our transaction with Change Healthcare. While this transaction will initially impact our adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that the creation of NewCo is very much in the best interests of our shareholders. Working with Change Healthcare, we will drive significant customer and financial synergies. In addition, we have a strong partner in Blackstone with a shared focus on value creation, an agreed upon path to an IPO and a plan that allows us to exit the investment in a tax-efficient manner.
In closing, while we are currently being adversely impacted by multiple market conditions, our talented team focus on both gross profit initiatives and the expense management, strong cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility underpin the confidence we have in our business.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Noah?"

I guess, I have seen this, obviously, throughout my career, but we also saw it at McKesson that where, in particular, we took sort of a step function down with pricing. You may recall, in I think, in the early part of '08, we had talked publicly about a significant price-related challenge that we were facing. Now it happened that year that we were able to fill the margin hole created from that stair step through the -- a unique opportunity to be the sole provider of the H1N1 flu vaccine back then, and that gave us a stream of possibility that allowed us to grow through that challenge. So it does happen from time to time. I -- you'd have to really probably ask the companies involved in it as to why they would pursue price. I can tell you that McKesson doesn't believe you can build sustainable relationships with customers or value for shareholders with a price-oriented approach. And I know that at least one company in our sector has been pretty public about growing revenues above market and about regaining market share, particularly in the independent space. And so I think that, certainly, people have different motives perhaps to grow their business beyond the market. I would tell you that what McKesson's been focused on, as we've talked about year in and year out, is the expansion of the service we provide our customers and the value that we deliver to create those relationships and expand our margins while we do so. And margin growth comes from solid relationships that are built over time, and from time to time, those can -- those relationships can be challenged if the price differential between where they -- where the customer perceives the market price to be and what we're asking for become disconnected. So it has happened before. We've -- we covered through those periods of time. And I -- like I said, I don't think a price-oriented approach to market share is something that's stable in the end anyway."

We do have some variability that resides in that part of our business. Clearly, on the -- the manufacturers play a very important role for us, and we're constantly working with the manufacturers to make sure that we've identified the value that we deliver and that we're properly reimbursed for that value, and we plan to continue to do so. On the customer side, it's not unimportant, I think, to point out that we do have a nice and profitable relationship with customers on the generic portion of our business. Albeit we may not make much or any on the brand side, the profit stream we get from generic participation, as we've talked about before when we were picking up the Rite Aid generic business or the Target generic business, that generic business is a source of profitability. And there is, obviously, flexibility in how we price those generics, and there's a market for generics. And we have to be responsive to how the market pricing plays for generics.

And today, we've updated that tight commentary to now being meaningfully below what we saw last year. To try to perhaps put a little bit more quantification around that, I would say that the delta, if you will, between the rate of inflation that we expected and the one that we have seen thus far year-to-date is greater than a 1/3 reduction versus our original expectations. The other thing I would comment on in terms of the brand income, why this inflation rate is important is that there is both a fixed component and a variable component of the income that we receive from branded manufacturers. Now a year or more ago, we were talking about that being a roughly 80-20 type split in terms of the fixed component of the equation versus the variable component. As, in part, the contracts have evolved [ph] but also in part, as inflation rates have come down in the last few months, I'd peg that split more at 90-10: 90% of our income is fixed, 10% is variable. But obviously, that 10 points has still been able to have a meaningful impact on the financials that we've been talking about today."

So no, I wouldn't point to anything odd around inventory management.

But the working capital initiatives have been important focus for us, and we'll continue to have that. In terms of the first part of your question, the technology businesses, I would -- I wouldn't get into specific growth rates around EIS or any particular segment of the business. Overall, we feel as though our technology segment is performing very nicely. They're very much where we expected them to be at this point in the year. Even though they are -- as John mentioned in his remarks, there's plenty of work going on around setting up the new company or preparing to set up the new company.

John, I guess, like others, I'm surprised to hear you highlight competitive pricing just given how rational the industry has been for so long. And I guess, if I take a step back, this year alone, we've seen the negative impact to profitability from generic pricing moderating. Now we're talking about a slowdown in branded inflation. Is there any thought that those dynamics themselves are what are forcing your competitors to maybe go harder after market share to make up for what seemingly would have created a shortfall in profit? And then, I guess, more importantly, how sustained do you think this competitive behavior could be? Do you think this is more of a one-off, a few accounts that they went after harder?

I can't speak to how our competitors make their decisions or how they make their pricing calls in the industry. I can tell you that McKesson is focused on retaining our customer base and creating additional value for our customers, as I talked about before, and charging a fair price. And on that fair price idea, there is plenty of headroom in terms of the value we deliver to the industry that we don't charge for. And as I've seen in the past when we have faced pressures like this, whether it's been a reduction in product launches or other things happened when some of the profit pools become more difficult, what typically we would attempt to do is reduce the level of incremental discounts that we pass on to our customers when we're in those discussions. But clearly, that conversation isn't successful if there are alternatives that are providing something that is even more significant. So I can't -- my best hope is that we demonstrate to our customers that they're going to always get a fair price from us. And in return, they're going to get superior service and tremendous focus on their success, and that's where we plan to stay. And I know at McKesson, at least, we think growing market share through a price-oriented approach ultimately will not be successful because customers don't want to change. Our customers, when they get a better deal, come to us and say, ""Hey, listen. Can you match this deal? Because I'd like to stay with you."" And so that customer pressure to remain with us because they like us always provides McKesson an advantage when we're in these discussions."

They control their pricing decisions, and we don't have much visibility into anything other than their historic behavior. And their historic behavior obviously has been rising over the last several years. And if you go back before the more recent years, there's always been a level of, at least in our data, always been a level of inflation that has occurred. And you do hear some manufacturers talking today about having a policy around how much inflation they're -- they think they should be able to provide to the industry over time. Some of them are making those statements more publicly than others. And clearly, there might be some near-term changes in their behavior that will be different over the longer haul. We do think that innovation requires profitability. We think that the lack of new product launches in the face of generic conversions causes pressure to the branded manufacturers and that they ought to have the ability to raise price appropriately on branded drugs to help fund their R&D requirements and their profitability requirements. And so I think that a common person's view would be that we would -- you would -- you'd still see inflation at some level. So I think that the outer bounds of inflation that had been experienced in the past by our industry, that we've had conversations about in the past, are probably likely to not exist anymore. So I just think those heavy outliers on both brand and generic, those outliers will come in, which obviously will have an effect. But it's probably a little bit early to speculate. And I think as we get through the rest of this year, we've given you some assumptions about, directionally, where we think it's going to be the balance of this year. As we get into the next fiscal year, we'll give you a sense for where we think it's going to be."

Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today as events impacting our second quarter results have implications for our outlook f",2233,"Thanks, Craig, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call. Before I jump into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to frame our discussion today as events impacting our second quarter results have implications for our outlook for fiscal 2017.
Let's start with our revised fiscal 2017 outlook. In particular, we now provide an update to our expectation of a lower profit contribution, resulting from recent customer pricing activities and lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical inflation trends compared to previous expectations, both of which affect our U.S. Pharmaceutical business within Distribution Solutions.
As a result of these updates, we now expect $12.35 to $12.85 per diluted share, which excludes from adjusted earnings a goodwill impairment charge in our Enterprise Information Solutions business, which James will cover in his comments, as well as estimated charges related to our Cost Alignment Plan that was previously announced in March of 2016.
As we built our plan and entered fiscal 2017, we assumed some moderation around drug inflation activity. In particular, we commented on our expectation for a nominal contribution from generic pharmaceuticals that increase in price. We also commented that our expectation that branded pharmaceutical price trends would be modestly below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
First, generic price inflation has been largely in line with our original assumption. However, customer pricing and branded inflation continue to evolve. In our first quarter, we witnessed some evidence of inflation and pricing softness in line with our original assumptions. However, the softness became much more pronounced in our second quarter, first, around brand inflation and later, around customer pricing.
While we generally do not provide specific assumptions around customer pricing activity, we do operate in a competitive environment. And though competitive, we've always been focused on delivering value to our customers, value not just defined by price but by service, innovation that helps our customers' partner manage and run their operations and manage their capital more effectively and innovation that helps our customers connect with patients in a more informed and intimate way. 
Now price is always a consideration. We provide our customers a premium value through our superior service and innovation, for which we expect to get an appropriate price. We believe that delivering premium value builds more sustainable customer relationships and long-term shareholder value. 
Generally speaking, we anticipate pockets of increased competitive activity as part of our normal course of business. What we began to see more recently is competitive activity that is broader than our original expectations, more aggressive and across several areas of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. As I've mentioned in the past, McKesson manages pricing on a centralized basis, although I think all of our customers believe we've been charging fairly for the service we provide and are willing to pay for this service. When a competitor significantly undercuts our existing pricing, we are compelled to respond. And although we cannot be absolutely assured that recent price concessions will address the recent heightened competitiveness fully, we believe our responses have been appropriate and measured.
We remain committed to our careful and thoughtful approach to customer pricing and to the value we deliver to help differentiate our customers' capabilities and performance relative to their competitors. We believe the services we provide to both our provider customers and our manufacturer customers offer substantially greater value than what either party could develop with a more direct relationship. And we expect that with our focus on the value we deliver, our margins will recover over time.
As for branded inflation, I suspect many of you have tracked the evolving conversation in the U.S. Last month, James highlighted concerns we had around some manufacturers appearing to delay some price increases we would have otherwise anticipated based on their historical and our historical experience. What we've seen this year, to-date, are fewer products with price increases, and those price increases are at lower rates than both prior year results and our expectations for the current fiscal year. Given our second quarter performance specific to branded price inflation, we now expect full year branded pharmaceutical pricing trends to be meaningful -- meaningfully below those experienced in fiscal 2016.
Let me spend a minute and talk about how we are compensated for branded pharmaceutical product distribution services. Today, all of our contacts with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers are individually negotiated but, generally, are constructed around charging for the service we provide. In almost all cases, the charge is derived as a percent of revenue managed and delivered by McKesson for that specific manufacturer. These charges vary not only by manufacturer but also by the service requirement at the product level.
Clearly, revenue-based fees are all affected at some level by inflation. However, in some cases, the benefit from inflation is greater, given the specifics and the characteristics of individual contracts and the specific behavior of the manufacturers that are a party to these agreements. So although a large majority of our compensation is relatively easy to forecast, inflation-based income derived from these relationships can impact our results on a more variable basis. 
Through these agreements, speculative buying or buying large quantities of product in front of anticipated price increases no longer exists. Essentially, all of McKesson's pharmaceutical purchases are done in partnership with the manufacturer, unlike the industry standard practice years ago before any contracts presided over the relationships between wholesalers and their manufacturer partners. These charges that happened to -- these changes that happened years ago have translated into more stable inventory levels that are appropriate to meet the customer demands and service levels.
So the takeaway here is that branded inflation still plays a meaningful role, and in some cases, it can be an important part of our overall compensation with specific manufacturers, and we can be impacted by their decisions relative to price increases. Although some contracts with manufacturers may not have specific compensation elements tied to product price changes, our internal branded price inflation assumptions often appear to be directionally aligned with externally published data. But the mix matters, so even relatively small changes in behavior could be more or less -- could have a more or less impact on our results depending on the characteristics of that individual manufacturer contract. We'd like to think we do a superior job of exceeding the expectations of these partners, so there should be even some variability in our industry related to results driven by branded and generic inflations.
So what does all this mean moving forward? It means we expect to receive less compensation from branded price increases than we originally anticipated in fiscal 2017. It means we will continue to monitor pricing activities throughout the year, especially in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is typically an important quarter for price increases. And it means we are engaging with our manufacturer partners to ensure we receive appropriate compensation relative to the services and value we deliver amidst a softer pricing environment.
Now turning to our revised outlook for fiscal 2017. We expect the combination of recent competitive pricing and further moderating branded price increase activity will have a combined negative effect on our business by approximately $1.60 to $1.90 per diluted share versus our July fiscal 2017 outlook, with the larger impact coming from competitive pricing.
Turning now back to our second quarter results. In the interest of time, I'll hit a few key themes, and then we'll hand the call over to James to cover our financial performance.
Let me start with the progress we've made on integrating the several acquisitions we closed last quarter, as well as early progress on Sainsbury's, which we closed at the beginning of September. These are important strategic investments that are tracking to our expectations and contributing positively to our financial performance. We were especially pleased by the stronger-than-expected performance of our Biologics acquisition, which is an important offering to our manufacturing partners in the rapidly growing oncology specialty pharmacy market.
Turning now to some highlights within Distribution Solutions segment for the quarter. Our sourcing partners -- partnership with Walmart is progressing well. We made considerable progress to date in our efforts to establish the new sourcing function, and we are on track to realize benefits from this new venture in fiscal 2018. We remain confident in our assumption that we will service the Rite Aid business through our current fiscal year, given that the acquisition by Walgreens is still pending. We will continue to follow the progress of this transaction as well as any new developments around the opportunity to serve any of the acquired or divested stores.
We are making a fundamental change to the structure in terms of our relationship with both providers and manufacturers as it relates to hundreds of specialty products. We are charging separately for the supply chain value we add across a wide array of product categories and manufacturers. Our conversations with customers and suppliers around specialty pricing are proceeding as expected, and we are pleased with the responses we are receiving.
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the great work from our U.S. Pharmaceutical teams that support our customers every day. We started the fiscal year with the successful on-boarding of the Albertsons-Safeway network and another successful ideaShare conference with our independent retail pharmacy customers. And in the second quarter, Health Mart stores were ranked highest overall in customer satisfaction among chain drug pharmacies across the U.S. in the J.D. Power 2016 Pharmacy Satisfaction Study. It's great to see recognition for the positive experiences patients receive every day in these pharmacies.
Turning now to our international pharmaceutical distribution and services. As we mentioned in our earnings call last quarter, reimbursement cuts imposed by the U.K. government to retail pharmacy rates as well as the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU have unfavorably impacted Celesio's operating performance. Despite these headwinds, I'm encouraged by the significant progress we made to help shape the long-term opportunities we expect are available to us across the European markets in which we operate.
In addition to our internal focus strategy, such as Six Sigma training and the standard ERP platform across our many geographies, we are engaged with external stakeholders in productive discussions around services we can offer to state-run health systems, where wholesalers today often play a limited role, or in expanding the services a retail pharmacy may deliver to its customers. We continue to make good progress on further developing our opportunities in our European markets.
As for our other Distribution Solutions businesses, such as McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, Medical-Surgical, they're all performing very well, showing strong growth in profitability, including double-digit adjusted operating profit growth year-over-year for all of these businesses in Q2.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. I'm encouraged by the exceptional performance from our Technology Solutions team. Even with considerable distractions to support the creation of a new company with Change Healthcare, this segment delivered solid results. We continue to make steady progress across Technology Solutions in support of a strong future with Change Healthcare while managing the work to retain the Relay Pharmacy business and prepare the EIS business for strategic alternatives.
In Q2, we recorded a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to EIS. As you may recall, we are considering strategic alternatives for EIS, which is part of our broader Technology Solutions strategy that we unveiled earlier this year. Our commitment has been and will always be to the long-term value creation for our customers, employees and shareholders, and we are confident in the direction we are headed with our Technology Solutions businesses.
Now to wrap up my comments. We've spoken for a few quarters about how generics inflation and customer consolidation challenges that we identified last year, which were incorporated into our fiscal 2017 outlook. We've effectively lapped these items at this point in time. However, we recently experienced new challenges around pricing softness in the form of increased competitive pricing activity and lower branded inflation, which I discussed a few moments ago. These new challenges resulted in a lower fiscal second quarter result and a revision to our previous full year outlook for fiscal 2017 of a $13.43 to $13.93 old range to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. 
Our business remains structurally sound. We are in the right businesses in the right markets, and we bring scale and efficiency to all stakeholders. Our leadership team and I met with our -- each of our business unit leaders earlier this month. These visits reinforced my conviction that we have the best people in the business making the right decisions every day to help our customers lead the change across the healthcare system we serve. We consider it an honor to serve in this capacity, and clearly, our people have the passion necessary to lead through change. The quality and ingenuity of our team give me great confidence in our future.
We have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation. We are extremely well positioned to deploy capital and deliver value for our shareholders through a combination of internal capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. And we're pleased to announce earlier today an increase of $4 billion to our existing share repurchase authorization.
With that, I'll turn the call over to James, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. James?"

Today, I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John",2062,"Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will first discuss our fiscal 2017 outlook and then review our second quarter results. In addition, I will provide more information related to the pending Change Healthcare transaction prior to John and I taking your questions.
Before I get to our outlook, I want to note that in addition to our earnings press release and customary tables, we have published a supplemental presentation on our website. This presentation provides an operational view of our fiscal 2017 earnings or adjusted earnings, excluding unusual items. We exclude from this view the noncash, pretax goodwill impairment charge taken in our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment during the second quarter as well as charges or related reversals associated with the Cost Alignment Plan we announced in March 2016. This view also excludes prior year gains on the sales of 2 businesses.
To expand on these unusual items, in the second quarter, we recorded a noncash, pretax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million or $1.24 per diluted share associated with our EIS business. Also in the second quarter, we recorded pretax credits of $10 million or $0.02 per diluted share related to the Cost Alignment Plan.
Now I will focus on our fiscal 2017 outlook. As John discussed earlier, based on our reported earnings and expectations for the remainder of the year, we have lowered our fiscal 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from $13.43 to $13.93 to a new range of $12.35 to $12.85. This new range excludes approximately $1.31 to $1.33 from adjusted earnings, driven by the combination of the EIS goodwill impairment charge and anticipated charges during the fiscal year for the Cost Alignment Plan. Our revised outlook includes the impacts of competitive customer pricing and softness in brand inflation that John just discussed. We expect these 2 headwinds to drive a combined reduction of between approximately $1.60 and $1.90 to our fiscal '17 adjusted EPS. We expect the larger of the 2 impacts to be driven by more competitive pricing. These headwinds will be partially offset by a number of items, including savings from ongoing cost-management efforts, lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and the effects of our ongoing capital deployment.
A listing of the key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2017 outlook can be found in the supplemental slide presentation on Slides 17 and 18. I will not take you through each key assumption on this call. However, I would like to draw your attention to the following significant updates to our revised outlook.
We now expect the Distribution Solutions adjusted operating margin, excluding anticipated cost-alignment charges, to be approximately 30 to 40 basis points below the fiscal 2016 adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items of 234 basis points.
We now expect our interest expense to be down by a mid-teen percentage compared to fiscal 2016. We also expect a full year adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge of approximately 27.5%, which may vary from quarter-to-quarter. Weighted average diluted shares used in the calculation of earnings per share are expected to be approximately 226 million for the year. And as a reminder, given the expected timing of the close of the transaction with Change Healthcare, we are not currently assuming that the creation and operation of the new company will impact our fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share.
As it relates to the progression of our fiscal 2017 results, we expect that our second half results will be more weighted to our fourth quarter. While we are lowering our guidance today, we are promptly taking steps to address the industry headwinds that we have identified. For example, our Cost Alignment Plan and additional ongoing cost-management initiatives continue to bring savings to the company and position us well for future growth, and I am pleased by our strong operating cash flow generation in the first half of the year. 
For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to increase approximately 15% year-over-year, excluding approximately $270 million in cash payments related to the Cost Alignment Plan and the settlement agreement with the DEA and DOJ. For the balance of fiscal '17, we expect to continue to deploy capital in line with all 4 elements of our portfolio approach.
Now let's move to our results for the second quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.72 per diluted share. Our adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $2.94 per diluted share. As a reminder, our second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.31 per diluted share included a $0.14 gain on the sale of the ZEE Medical business. For comparison purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items, was $3.17.
Now I will review our consolidated results. Consolidated revenues for the second quarter increased 3% in constant currency. Second quarter adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% in constant currency year-over-year, driven by the expected weaker profit contribution from generic inflation trends and the impact of previously disclosed customer consolidation activity and lower compensation from a branded manufacturer, partially offset by our recent business acquisitions and global procurement benefits. Further, as I've previously discussed, we also saw softness in certain branded manufacturer pricing activity and, more recently, increased competitive customer pricing activity.
Second quarter adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 1% in constant currency, reflecting actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to our Cost Alignment Plan as well as ongoing cost-management efforts.
Adjusted other income was $25 million for the quarter, an increase of 47% in constant currency, consistent with our fiscal 2017 guidance. Interest expense of $78 million decreased 14% in constant currency for the quarter.
Now moving to taxes. Our adjusted tax rate, excluding the EIS goodwill impairment charge, was 25.4% driven by our mix of income and multiple discrete tax benefits. Our adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items, totaled $669 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS, excluding unusual items of $2.94, decreased 7% versus the prior year.
Wrapping up our consolidated results. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased by 3% year-over-year to 228 million.
Let's now turn to the segment results. Distribution Solutions segment constant-currency revenues of $49.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year during the quarter. North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 2% in constant currency. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $6.6 billion for the quarter on a constant-currency basis, up 12%, driven by acquisitions and market growth. Revenues were impacted by approximately $305 million in unfavorable currency rate movements.
Moving now to the Medical-Surgical business. Revenues were up 4% for the quarter, driven by growth in our primary care business, partially offset by the prior year sale of the ZEE Medical business. Distribution Solutions adjusted gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 6% on a constant-currency basis for the quarter, consistent with my previous comments.
Second quarter Distribution Solutions segment adjusted operating expenses, excluding unusual items, increased 2% on a constant-currency basis. Segment operating expenses reflect an increase in expenses related to recently completed acquisitions, substantially offset by our cost-reduction actions.
Distribution Solutions second quarter segment adjusted operating profit, excluding unusual items, was down 15% in constant currency at $933 million. The second quarter segment adjusted operating margin rate, excluding unusual items, was 188 basis points, a decrease of 40 basis points on a constant-currency basis, driven by the same factors as previously discussed.
Technology Solutions revenues were down 6% for the quarter to $680 million on a constant-currency basis, driven by the anticipated decline in our hospital software business, partially offset by growth in our other technology businesses.
Second quarter adjusted segment gross profit, excluding unusual items, was down 7% on a constant-currency basis. Second quarter adjusted segment operating expenses, excluding unusual items, decreased 6% in constant currency from the prior year, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding unusual items, decreased 10% in constant currency, resulting in an adjusted operating margin, excluding unusual items, of 20.74%, down 104 basis points relative to the prior year. The reduction was driven primarily by the expected decline of our hospital software business, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
I'll now review our balance sheet metrics. As you've heard me discuss before, each of our working capital metrics can be significantly impacted by timing, including which day of the week marks the close of a given quarter. For receivables, our days sales outstanding are flat from the prior year at 26 days. Our days sales in inventory decreased 2 days from the prior year to 29 days, and our days sales in payables increased 6 days from the prior year to 59 days. The increase in days sales in payables, relative to the prior year, is largely due to a steady increase in our generic pharmaceuticals sourcing scale and the fact that generic pharmaceuticals have longer payment terms than branded pharmaceuticals.
We generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations during the first half of our fiscal year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $5.5 billion, with $2.9 billion held offshore.
In the first half of the year, McKesson paid $2 billion for acquisitions and spent $240 million on internal capital investments. And earlier today, the Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share and authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program.
Now moving to our announced transaction with Change Healthcare. While the transaction has not yet closed and McKesson and Change Healthcare continue to operate as separate companies, we wanted to provide some updates and clarity around how the transaction will impact McKesson upon a successful closing. We continue to be optimistic that the transaction will close in the first half of calendar year 2017. The assets and liabilities being contributed to NewCo have been reclassified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016.
In addition, we expect that our 70% equity ownership contribution from NewCo will be reported in the other income line. This line item will reflect the pretax equity income from our share of NewCo. At the time of the close of the transaction, McKesson is anticipated to record a significant onetime gain on the divestiture and related contribution of our net assets to NewCo.
Next, I'd like to address the drivers that I have previously mentioned that will have an impact on McKesson's EPS results when the transaction closes. First, NewCo will be servicing approximately $6.1 billion of debt with an interest rate of approximately 5% to 7%. Thus driving higher interest expense estimated to be between approximately $210 million and $300 million year-over-year after accounting for our 70% share of NewCo's earnings.
Second, as is customary with transactions involving technology companies, we will record fair value adjustments to the contributed businesses deferred revenue, which we expect to reduce reported earnings year-over-year by approximately $150 million to $200 million after adjusting for our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings.
Please note that the deferred revenue range I have provided today is sensitive to our fiscal year-end sales activity. Assuming that the transaction closes on April 1, 2017, the combination of financing costs and accounting-related fair value adjustments is expected to drive between approximately $1.10 and $1.30 in fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS dilution, which will be partially offset by an operating profit benefit, including the first year synergies from our 70% portion of NewCo's earnings. This benefit will be higher than the amount that the MTS contributed assets would have generated absent our transaction with Change Healthcare. While this transaction will initially impact our adjusted EPS, we continue to believe that the creation of NewCo is very much in the best interests of our shareholders. Working with Change Healthcare, we will drive significant customer and financial synergies. In addition, we have a strong partner in Blackstone with a shared focus on value creation, an agreed upon path to an IPO and a plan that allows us to exit the investment in a tax-efficient manner.
In closing, while we are currently being adversely impacted by multiple market conditions, our talented team focus on both gross profit initiatives and the expense management, strong cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility underpin the confidence we have in our business.
Thank you. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Noah?"

You may recall, in I think, in the early part of '08, we had talked publicly about a significant price-related challenge that we were facing. Now it happened that year that we were able to fill the margin hole created from that stair step through the -- a unique opportunity to be the sole provider of the H1N1 flu vaccine back then, and that gave us a stream of possibility that allowed us to grow through that challenge. So it does happen from time to time. I -- you'd have to really probably ask the companies involved in it as to why they would pursue price. I can tell you that McKesson doesn't believe you can build sustainable relationships with customers or value for shareholders with a price-oriented approach. And I know that at least one company in our sector has been pretty public about growing revenues above market and about regaining market share, particularly in the independent space. And so I think that, certainly, people have different motives perhaps to grow their business beyond the market. I would tell you that what McKesson's been focused on, as we've talked about year in and year out, is the expansion of the service we provide our customers and the value that we deliver to create those relationships and expand our margins while we do so. And margin growth comes from solid relationships that are built over time, and from time to time, those can -- those relationships can be challenged if the price differential between where they -- where the customer perceives the market price to be and what we're asking for become disconnected. So it has happened before. We've -- we covered through those periods of time. And I -- like I said, I don't think a price-oriented approach to market share is something that's stable in the end anyway."

There really are 2 factors, and I'll have James talk a little bit about the manufacturers in a minute because that, obviously, when we talk about brand price inflation trends and we tried to quantify once again in our prepared comments how much of this challenge we had this quarter, and we forecast for the year, is coming from that component. We do have some variability that resides in that part of our business. Clearly, on the -- the manufacturers play a very important role for us, and we're constantly working with the manufacturers to make sure that we've identified the value that we deliver and that we're properly reimbursed for that value, and we plan to continue to do so. On the customer side, it's not unimportant, I think, to point out that we do have a nice and profitable relationship with customers on the generic portion of our business. Albeit we may not make much or any on the brand side, the profit stream we get from generic participation, as we've talked about before when we were picking up the Rite Aid generic business or the Target generic business, that generic business is a source of profitability. And there is, obviously, flexibility in how we price those generics, and there's a market for generics. And we have to be responsive to how the market pricing plays for generics.

In terms of when we came into the year, we were assuming that the level of brand manufacturer pricing inflation would be modestly below what we had seen in the previous fiscal year. And today, we've updated that tight commentary to now being meaningfully below what we saw last year. To try to perhaps put a little bit more quantification around that, I would say that the delta, if you will, between the rate of inflation that we expected and the one that we have seen thus far year-to-date is greater than a 1/3 reduction versus our original expectations. The other thing I would comment on in terms of the brand income, why this inflation rate is important is that there is both a fixed component and a variable component of the income that we receive from branded manufacturers. Now a year or more ago, we were talking about that being a roughly 80-20 type split in terms of the fixed component of the equation versus the variable component. As, in part, the contracts have evolved [ph] but also in part, as inflation rates have come down in the last few months, I'd peg that split more at 90-10: 90% of our income is fixed, 10% is variable.

I can't speak to how our competitors make their decisions or how they make their pricing calls in the industry. I can tell you that McKesson is focused on retaining our customer base and creating additional value for our customers, as I talked about before, and charging a fair price. And on that fair price idea, there is plenty of headroom in terms of the value we deliver to the industry that we don't charge for. And as I've seen in the past when we have faced pressures like this, whether it's been a reduction in product launches or other things happened when some of the profit pools become more difficult, what typically we would attempt to do is reduce the level of incremental discounts that we pass on to our customers when we're in those discussions. But clearly, that conversation isn't successful if there are alternatives that are providing something that is even more significant. So I can't -- my best hope is that we demonstrate to our customers that they're going to always get a fair price from us. And in return, they're going to get superior service and tremendous focus on their success, and that's where we plan to stay. And I know at McKesson, at least, we think growing market share through a price-oriented approach ultimately will not be successful because customers don't want to change. Our customers, when they get a better deal, come to us and say, ""Hey, listen. Can you match this deal? Because I'd like to stay with you."" And so that customer pressure to remain with us because they like us always provides McKesson an advantage when we're in these discussions."

They control their pricing decisions, and we don't have much visibility into anything other than their historic behavior. And their historic behavior obviously has been rising over the last several years. And if you go back before the more recent years, there's always been a level of, at least in our data, always been a level of inflation that has occurred. And you do hear some manufacturers talking today about having a policy around how much inflation they're -- they think they should be able to provide to the industry over time. Some of them are making those statements more publicly than others. And clearly, there might be some near-term changes in their behavior that will be different over the longer haul. We do think that innovation requires profitability. We think that the lack of new product launches in the face of generic conversions causes pressure to the branded manufacturers and that they ought to have the ability to raise price appropriately on branded drugs to help fund their R&D requirements and their profitability requirements. And so I think that a common person's view would be that we would -- you would -- you'd still see inflation at some level. So I think that the outer bounds of inflation that had been experienced in the past by our industry, that we've had conversations about in the past, are probably likely to not exist anymore. So I just think those heavy outliers on both brand and generic, those outliers will come in, which obviously will have an effect. But it's probably a little bit early to speculate. And I think as we get through the rest of this year, we've given you some assumptions about, directionally, where we think it's going to be the balance of this year.

So I think we believe we've provided guidance that has reasonable expectations from that perspective and that you can count on the range. That's one of the reasons that the range is somewhat wider, though, is it's somewhat dependent on what happens going forward."

I think it's a difficult question to answer, but I think -- I did try to, at least, bound [ph] the conversation around customer pricing in that this is a pretty significant step-down. And we believe that, that allowed us to maintain the relationships with our customers, given what was a pricing environment where we were higher priced than where we needed to be. And that has been -- that has occurred and is baked into the guidance that we have provided you in terms of the range that we've just refreshed. Now it's -- I think to James' point, it's pretty early to speculate on what branded inflation might be next year and what else might happen with our customer base, but we've tried to give you as much visibility as we possibly can. 
I think -- I know you guys are on a short time frame. Let me close this call if I can and let you know that we -- I know you share with us the disappointment in today's news. This is not what we had expected and certainly not what we want. But despite this downward revision to our outlook, we do believe in and remain committed to the value we demonstrate every day to our customers and our manufacturing partners. And as I mentioned a few moments ago, we believe the increased competitive pricing activity does not build sustainable customer relationships or long-term shareholder value, and we are all about sustainable relationships and creating long-term shareholder value. And we're supported by McKesson's great tradition of customer focus, operational excellence and disciplined execution. And our talented workforce, robust cash flow generation and strong balance sheet position us for the long-term value creation that we strive to obtain. We remain as committed as ever to our value proposition.
