We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong results. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets with particular strength in our United States and United Kingdom bus",639,"Thank you, Andrew and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong results. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets with particular strength in our United States and United Kingdom businesses, continuing our track record of solid execution globally. Importantly, we are also on track with our pending acquisition of Heartland Payments, which we expect to close later this month. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we grew net revenue 6%, expanded margins 50 basis points and increased cash earnings per share 17%, all this despite observing significant incremental foreign currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, each of these metrics exceeded our expectations, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy and operational excellence across the organization. 
Now for more detailed highlights. 
We are especially pleased with our performance in North America where we believe we continue to grow faster than our markets by capturing share in verticals with attractive growth and margin characteristics. 
Organic revenue growth for our U.S. direct business accelerated in the quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. OpenEdge continued its streak of mid to high-teens growth. Our gaming business also continue to deliver strong organic growth, coupled with sound execution of the FIS gaming acquisition that was completed in June. 
In Europe, our U.K. business continues to execute exceptionally well with significant organic revenue growth. Our results also reflect the benefits from the EU interchange regulation that became effective in December 2015. 
Outside of the U.K., Spain maintained its strong track record with yet another quarter of double-digit volume and transaction growth, well in excess of the market rate of growth in Spanish GDP. 
We remain pleased with the performance of our European e-commerce Gateway business, Realex, and we are poised to enter the Spanish markets with new omnichannel offerings in the coming months, following the U.K. launch last fall. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, we produced strong revenue growth on a local currency basis despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in Greater China. Our strategy to diversify distribution in the region by entering new geographic markets and partnerships has been successful. Ezidebit had another outstanding quarter accelerating growth to 20% plus on a local currency basis. Our BPI joint venture also continues to perform in line with our expectations. We have been able to offset macro weakness by solid execution illustrated by margin performance in Asia, which significantly exceeded our expectations. 
We are also building upon our successful partnership with Ezidebit with the acquisition of eWay [ph], a payment gateway and e-commerce technology company in Australia. Similar to Realex in our Ireland, eWay is a leading provider of payment solution to developers and software partners with approximately 25% of the online market. The combination of eWay's cutting-edge products with Ezidebit complements our global omnichannel solution strategy and will create the leading payment technology company in Asia-Pacific with nearly 40,000 merchant customers in Australia and New Zealand. 
We have made considerable progress on our pending acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, which we look to close later this month. This transaction will accelerate transformative growth at a time when both businesses are executing strongly and we continue to be impressed with the people we have met at Heartland. As we have done successfully with APT, PayPros, Ezidebit and Realex, we are confident in our ability to accelerate sales growth at Heartland. 
The goal of our integration is to ensure a frictionless transition postclose, building on the momentum that Global Payments at Heartland's have each had individually as one combined company. We are even more confident in the synergies that we describe at the time of the transaction announcements and could not be more pleased with our proposed partnership. We look forward to welcoming our new colleague shortly. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

We've made substantial progress business in fiscal 2016 and are delighted to report another quarter of strong adjusted net revenue growth, operating margin expansion and cash earnings per share growth despite significant FX headwinds. 
Total company net revenue for the third quarter was $497 million, reflecting growth of 6% versus the third quarter of fiscal 2015 or 11% on a constant currency basis. Importantly, normalized organic net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was high single digits for the quarter at the high end of our cycle guidance. 
Operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 28.7% for the quarter or 110 basis points on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share increased 17% to $0.70 or 28% on a constant currency basis. 
North America net revenue grew 6% in the quarter with operating margin expansion of 70 basis points to 27.2% despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels was high single digits for the quarter and accelerated sequentially relative to fiscal second quarter performance. 
Canada delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations, driven by stable fundamentals. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North America net revenue growth by several hundred basis points. 
As Jeff noted, our European business performed exceptionally well, again, this quarter posting revenue growth of 8%. Adjusting for adverse currency exchange rates, especially the British pound in Europe, European constant currency net revenue growth was 16%. Operating margins in Europe for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 49.7%. 
Asia-Pacific net revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis, despite continued macroeconomic weakness in Greater China. Reported net revenue growth in Asia-Pacific was 3% as a result of significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. 
We are particularly pleased with operating margins in Asia-Pacific for the quarter, which expanded by over 600 basis points. This was driven primarily by growth in our higher margin businesses, predominantly Ezidebit, as well as expense management across the region in light of the broader macro trends. 
Capital expenditures of the quarter totaled $21 million. Free cash flow, defined as net operating cash flows, excluding settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests, was $77 million. 
In connection with our planned acquisition of Heartland, we have engaged in a variety of financing-related activities over the past few months. In February, we amended our existing credit facilities to repay the post-closing of the Heartland transaction. At the same time, given strong interest from existing and new lenders, we entered into a new $735 million delayed draw Term Loan A facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the transaction. The new Term Loan A facility, which we expect to be more cost-effective than our Term Loan B, allowed us to reduce the size of the Term Loan B component of the transaction financing by $735 million to $1.045 billion. In addition, in March, we successfully completed this indication of the $1.045 billion Term Loan B facility on terms and conditions more favorable than we expected in December. 
As a result of these activities we now expect the weighted average pro forma interest rate on our debt facilities to be in the range of 3.75% to 4% as compared to the 4% to 4.25% range we anticipated at the time of the announcement of the transaction. We expect this will generate a meaningful amount of annual interest expense savings relative to our original pro forma assumptions. 
As we approach the closing of the Heartland transaction later this month, we intend to resume more normal capital allocation policies immunity thereafter, although our near-term priority is to return to our targeted leverage ratio we retain sufficient capacity to continue to pursue the capital allocation program we have employed with much success over the past few years. 
As evidenced by the eWay transaction, we remain interested in select acquisitions that augment our strategies globally. Likewise, you should assume that we will return to being a consistent buyer of our stock as a means by which to return capital to shareholders. 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2016. On a constant currency basis, we expect net revenues to be toward the high end of our guidance range of 10% to 12% growth over fiscal 2015. Given the continued weakness we have seen in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, in particular, the British pound, we expect reported revenues to be towards the low end of our previous guidance range of $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion. We are increasing our cash operating margin expectations and now anticipate margins will expand by at least 100 basis points in fiscal 2016 on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share are now expected to grow 16% to 19% over fiscal 2015 and range from $2.93 to $3.
Finally, please note that our outlook does not include the impact of the Heartland's acquisition that we expect to close later this month. We anticipate that the addition of Heartland will add $80 million to $100 million to our net revenues and has de minimis impact on cash earnings per share for fiscal 2016. 
I will now turn the call back to Jeff."

First, I still think we've got plenty of runway on margin enhancement. I think as we said, probably a number of times in the last couple of years, we view margins on a stand-alone basis in the low-30s as achievable and sustainable. Even with terrific margin performance today, we're still not at that level. I think to get to your question about what's driving that growth and undoubtedly scale is an important element of that, but I think it's really been a conscious decision on our part to shift our mix toward businesses that we've U.S.A. attractive and by attractive, I mean growth faster than the rate than market growth with better margin characteristics. So if you look, for example, at OpenEdge, which we talked a lot about, it continues to grow as we said in our prepared remarks at rates 2x to 3x the rate of market growth. If you look as Realex, if you look at Ezidebit, these are all businesses that, Ashwin, that, first, are growing fairly rapidly compared to the market, but second, provide us with opportunities for further margin enhancement prior to Heartland. So I still think we're in the early innings of where we can take the margins that gives you obviously comfort as we look toward Heartland to think about what we might do together as one combined company.

We still have a lot of from relative to overall target level of low-30s to continue to expand margin from here on, on a stand-alone basis. In addition to the items Jeff described, the other things I would call out is specifically are, one, of the acquisitions we continue to do we improve scale end markets that we find attractive that have good dynamics where our business are geared towards higher-margin solutions, such as for example, the eWay transition that we just executed and its contributions to our Australian business and what it will do to margins in Australia to continue to improve those from their already attractive levels. The last thing I would mention is we continue to make investments in our infrastructure to improve our operational leverage. We continue this transformation we started out on several years ago to move away from the holding company, operating company model the business utilized for many years to the single unified operating company structure that David described at the Investor Conference back in October, that's still in process. And I think that continued evolution provides a nice tailwind for margin expansion over time as well."

As it relates to the interchange benefits, as we discussed in context of Spain and also in the case of United States where we had Durbin 4, 5 years ago, we do the interchange benefits a little bit more temporal, that's just a function of over what period of time that the whale rationalize within the marketplace.

As it relates to the certifications, I think the key strength of ours has been early rollout of the EMB we announced probably 1 year ago, at this point maybe a little bit more than 1 year ago as suite of products and services under the names of EdgeShield and GlobalShield that were EMV compliant with encryption and tokenization and NFC kind of all wrapped into one. So I think everybody has had to push on the certification side given the complexity of the U.S. broader ecosystem, so I don't think that that's different really for anyone. But I would say that we're very proud of the fact that we were in market and Heartland was probably very similar in market very early on with the certifications.

As part of a security solution we're bringing to market based on merchant demand. At the same time, we also bring to market what is global expertise in EMV, we've rolled out EMV all over the world. As you might imagine, all the way back to Canada 5 years ago is probably the most recent example of needing to bring EMV to market to improve security for the merchants. When you think about the focus on security suites and solutions, we've been able to drive some new sales around security, but EMV, itself, is in no way an economic tailwind for us. It's a process for us in terms of migration of making sure the ecosystem is more secure. From that perspective, from an ecosystem perspective, our metrics are really right in line with what you might see from the industry at large, measured migration, consistent migration is our theme, driven by merchant demand after merchant education from Global Payments. One thing I would note for you though is when you think about our key direct portfolios things like OpenEdge, which is full of dentis offices, veterinary clinics, dry cleaners, those are not high demand verticals for EMV migration. So we're working with the pace our merchants want to work, we're trying to drive more education, drive more migration. As Jeff noted before, certifications are in very good shape. We're just moving along with the market, in some cases a little ahead of the market. One more reminder in terms of percentage when you see them banded about by industry payers, we have a very focused portfolio at this Heartland on small to medium merchants around the country. You won't find big-box retailers in our portfolio. You won't find them by and large at Heartland's portfolio either. So just remember that when we talk about the level of migration and the pace. We've got a lot of small to medium merchants to go through as so the rest of the industry. We're going through them very consistently. Very happy with the progress, I think our merchants are as well. We're managing charge with the merchants, which is maybe a follow-up you might want to ask. In terms if there's a minor uptick, but very manageable so far. And I think again, that's the results of years of global experience managing EMV, managing the shift and being able to help our margin through it."

I think I still view it frankly and when it is estimated to make investments into our systems and I'm still waiting for the return on that investment to some degree. Over time, obviously, I think we expect that to come but to David's point, our focus has really been heretofore to ensuring that our merchants have all the tools available to them to become compliant, working at a pace that aligns with their desires to become EMV compliant. We haven't really viewed it as an economic return opportunity thus afar.

As we noted in our prepared comments, we lost the bundle in the fall in the U.K. We're bringing it to Spain in the not-too-distant future.

So one of the things that we pointed out in our prepared remarks is we've been very successful in Asia-Pacific by adding new markets and by increasing our presence in markets that have been performing well. So we talk a lot about Australia, we just responded to Steven talking about eWay and Ezidebit. Of course, we have our joint a venture with Bank of the Philippine Islands, which were also performing in line with our expectations in that market before the JV and we increased our size to the second largest presence in that market thereafter. As a result, we've been able to grow, to answer your question, we've been able to grow the Asian Pacific business 9% on a constant currency basis this quarter. So I'd say, we're still getting very good growth in Greater China, which I define as mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau as a percentage of the business in Asia-Pacific has been reduced from probably, a number of years ago, probably about half of it, so maybe around 30% currently and that largely a result of targeted additions in other markets like Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. We also continue to grow very well in markets like Singapore beyond the 2 or 3 that I just listed. So I would say there's been a fair amount of revenue growth it seems about 2/3 of Asia-Pacific, Tien-tsin, coming from markets other than as a percentage of revenue other than Greater China providing, in the case of Ezidebit, 20% plus growth. It's not like we're going to have a dramatic impact on the revenue growth in any one quarter, Greater China, that is. So I think a lot of it is coming from the mix of business, particularly that Ezidebit is a much higher margin than the overall company, as well as Asia, by itself. And that's how I think about it.

So I would note, first and foremost, we're 1 year plus beyond the acquisition. We now, I think, in our minds, fully integrated Ezidebit so that is creating an environment where incremental margins at Ezi are improving and obviously it's already higher than our Asia average margins, and so it's increasing from there and accelerating from there. So I think that's contributing to it. But as it relates to the expense side, I think what we really try to do is look at our core business in Asia-Pacific outside of Australia and to some degree the Philippines where we have the joint venture with BPI and really try to rationalize the size of the expense base relative to the outlook for that market over the next 12 to 18 months. And the reality is we do expect continued weakness in China, hopefully, we've seen before, but we don't expect it to rebound dramatically in the near term. So we really try to reposition the business to ride out what we expect to be a soft spot in the cycle in the Greater China markets and position the business for continued success. And I think you're seeing the results of that play through in margins this quarter."

A couple of lessons learned, we're finding very strong demand for the bundled solution in the U.K. The place where we're working the hardest is probably on the joint sales proposition and being able to take what you might think of as a traditional sale and marry to it a more technology-enabled piece of the sale. So the gateway married to the acquiring, married to the reporting, married to the fraud and credit management you have to be able to provide. All those tools are there, probably the place where we've learned the more lessons more has been on making those joint sales calls and enabling and equipping traditional sales folks to be able to sell either the early stages of e-commerce enablement to small to medium merchant or sell the entire bundle. The good news is with the demand the demand we've had and the low of execution we've seen, it has not affected our sales trajectory. In fact, we're very pleased with the sales coming out in the back of the demand, but it is a more technical sale. So being able to equip your salespeople on a global basis to sell more technology enabled transaction processing is a challenge of its own. We feel like we've learned a lot in that early integration between the U.K. and the Ireland that will serve us well in Spain particularly. Its allowed us, Tim, to think more specifically about how you target a market and how you focus a piece of the sales force on the macro payments themselves on micro merchants, a piece of the sales force on small to medium and then joint calling of experts maybe from Ireland in addition to Spain on large to national merchants and certainly joint calling between all of your regions, as well as your technical experts in a place Ireland where Realex is based on multiregional or multi-market or regional accounts. So really how you go-to-market has been where you learn lessons. And again, we're fortunate enough to be learning them in a situation where the sales are right at target or above in many cases, so we feel good about those pieces. If you step back a little bit and think about this, the second pieces -- the second and third pieces of this is really partners and software developers. As you enter new markets, you want to continue the momentum you have with channel partners, so ISVs, card providers, folks like that. You also want to develop and foster relationship with developers, the press to shops of this world when you've seen the press even from other providers and e-commerce world. So in specific markets, you've got certain ISVs, card providers, as well as software providers. You're also taking a regional partners with you. So being able to go-to-market and manage the direct sales as I described earlier in a specific region, the face-to-face married to technology, as well as the local channel partners, local software providers and with that an overlay of the regional folks and, in many cases, the global software providers, it's a little tricky and it comes down again to market segmentation and how you compensate and drive the direct sales force to certain behaviors you want to target the segments, make sure they don't trip over each other and make sure that you can drive joint sales. That's all a bit financial global we're really pretty please with the pieces, so pleased that we went ahead and deployed $50 million of more capital in Australia to continue executing the same strategy where we can take this bundle with Ezidebit and eWay to market and drive deeper penetration already the leading provider of small- to medium-sized retail e-commerce in Australia. So long-winded answer, I realize, but it's actually been a great deal of learning, a great deal of really excellent execution by our teams in Ireland, in the U.K. and now about to be in Spain, this led us to sort of feel pretty good about the execution levels we're seeking credited something we spent a lot of time describing at the Investor Day in October, omnichannel, global capabilities that we think we are uniquely positioned to sell."

I would say we're still seeing some weakness in certain markets, particularly the pound and today is another example. I would point to say not only is the U.S. dollar sort of secularly strong, the volatility in some of these major currencies is outstanding. You see pound moving 1.5 point or 2 points intraday, for example, obviously makes a very difficult to forecast FX with any sort of certainty as we think and as we look forward. I think we are as we get into fiscal '17, particularly as we get into the back half of fiscal 17, hopefully we're going to be in a environment where we're starting to anniversary some of the stronger headwinds. But I certainly don't do think that we're approaching anytime soon an environment where the U.S. dollars going to weaken relative to most of the major currencies around the world to which we have exposure. I think we're in a sort of secular bull market for the U.S. dollar. I expect to continue for some time. There's just not a lot out there that would cause me to believe the dollar is going to weaken. But as we continue to anniversary some of these bigger moves, for example, we anniversary the strong euro move in Q3 of this year unfortunately, that was more than offset by an equally strong move downward in the pound at relatively the same time. So we have good exposure to a fair number of currencies. To Jeff's earlier point, part of the benefit of the Heartland transaction is that it does derisk currency exposure to the company on a macro basis, we'll be 2/3 U.. a dollar denominated business going forward and that obviously will diminish some of the FX exposure that we have globally. But I'm hopeful to get into an environment we're in '17, we're leasing most of the strong headwinds begin to diminish to some degree."

Still grows in the mid- to high-teens. The revenue production is really, really impressive. That's all at increasing margins that are higher than the company's margin, so back to several other questions earlier today. In terms of the existing verticals, we remain very, very low penetrated, so that's not perfect grammar. But really, I don't think we have a vertical that's more than 20% penetrated anywhere in any of our key verticals. So you think invest, we talk about those a lot, pharma, we think about parking garages, all those very low levels we've got a sales force that's focused on driving deeper penetration into those verticals. At the same time though, we're looking for other places to grow. So we mentioned the Heartland description before we don't have an education vertical in OpenEdge, we don't do restaurant and hospitality the opportunity to drive deeper penetration of those verticals by OpenEdge to complement the direct sales force about what you asked in your first question, it's there, it's real we continue to work on that in integration planning. The other couple of things we have is we literally entered a new vertical in the United States that we weren't in before just in the last couple of weeks. We entered the unattended payment vertical in the United States with a brand-new partner, large ISC who plays in that space, you're talking about car washes, more parking, vending, things like that, that's new and unique for OpenEdge, sort of brand new vertical, effectively worth 0% penetration of that vertical as we sit here today, but we know how to manage the ecosystem  of partners, merchants, leads and marketing to drive that. And then maybe, happiest news of all in terms of how we think about growing that OpenEdge beyond just the United States, the global opportunity is real. We're really pleased we actually have opened up OpenEdge and launched it in the U.K. this quarter, so we have a staff there, dedicated sales folks, dedicated product folks. Remember, back to October, in the Investor Day, one of our key pillars of accelerating global growth was the global expansion of integrated payments, OpenEdge, driving the Canada, driving United Kingdom. So we've now launched our business in the U.K. We can bring that dedicated and product and ecosystem to the United Kingdom to work with ISV to drive the benefits of technology integration that don't exist of the U.K. as they exist in the U.S. today. And best still, we can drive existing partners into the United Kingdom. So U.S.-based ISVs and software providers provide near-term sales opportunities. In fact, we're going to bring a few customers live in the U.K. in just the next few months coming from U.S.-based ISVs where we're extending their franchise, extending the integrated payments benefit out to the U.K. for them. So more to come on this, but really, OpenEdge is poised for more global growth but still continued excellent execution in the United States as we go forward."

We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong results. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets with particular strength in our United States and United Kingdom businesses, continuing our track record of solid execution globally. Importantly, we are also on track with our pending acquisition of Heartland Payments, which we expect to close later this month. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we grew net revenue 6%, expanded margins 50 basis points and increased cash earnings per share of 17%, all this despite absorbing significant incremental foreign currency headwind. On a constant currency basis, each of these metrics exceeded our expectations, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy and operational excellence across the organization. 
Now for more detailed highlights. 
We are especially pleased with our performance in North America where we believe we continue to grow faster than our markets by capturing share in verticals with attractive growth and margin characteristics. 
Organic net revenue growth for our U.S. direct business accelerated in the quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. OpenEdge continued its streak of mid- to high-teens growth. Our gaming business also continued to deliver strong organic growth, coupled with sound execution of the FIS gaming acquisition that was completed in June. 
In Europe, our U.K. business continues to execute exceptionally well with significant organic revenue growth. Our results also reflect the benefits from the EU interchange regulation that became effective in December 2015. 
Outside of the U.K., Spain maintained its strong track record with yet another quarter of double-digit volume and transaction growth, well in excess of the market rate of growth and the Spanish GDP. 
We remain pleased with the performance of our European e-commerce Gateway business, Realex, and we are poised to enter the Spanish markets with new omnichannel offerings in the coming months, following the U.K. launch last fall. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, we produced strong revenue growth on a local currency basis despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in Greater China. Our strategy to diversify distribution in the region by entering new geographic markets and partnerships has been successful. Ezidebit had another outstanding quarter, accelerating growth to 20% plus on a local currency basis. Our BPI joint venture also continues to perform in line with our expectations. We have been able to offset macro weakness by solid execution, illustrated by margin performance in Asia, which significantly exceeded our expectations. 
We are also building upon our successful partnership with Ezidebit with the acquisition of eWAY a payment gateway and e-commerce technology company in Australia. Similar to Realex in our Ireland, eWAY is a leading provider of payment solution to developers and software partners, with approximately 25% of the online market. The combination of eWAY's cutting-edge products with Ezidebit complements our global omnichannel solution strategy and will create the leading payment technology company in Asia-Pacific with nearly 40,000 merchant customers in Australia and New Zealand. 
We have made considerable progress on our pending acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, which we look to close later this month. This transaction will accelerate transformative growth, at a time when both businesses are executing strongly, and we continue to be impressed with the people we have met at Heartland. As we have done successfully with APT, PayPros, Ezidebit and Realex, we are confident in our ability to accelerate sales growth at Heartland. 
The goal of our integration is to ensure a frictionless transition post close, building on the momentum that Global Payments and Heartland have each had individually as one combined company. We are even more confident in the synergies that we described at the time of the transaction announcement and could not be more pleased with our proposed partnership. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues shortly. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

We've made substantial progress in this business in fiscal 2016, and are delighted to report another quarter of strong adjusted net revenue growth, operating margin expansion and cash earnings per share growth despite significant FX headwind. 
Total company net revenue for the third quarter was $497 million, reflecting growth of 6% versus the third quarter of fiscal 2015 or 11% on a constant currency basis. Importantly, normalized organic net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was high single digits for the quarter at the high end of our cycle guidance. 
Operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 28.7% for the quarter or 110 basis points on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share increased 17% to $0.70 or 28% on a constant currency basis. 
North American net revenue grew 6% in the quarter with operating margin expansion of 70 basis points to 27.2%, despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels was high single digits for the quarter and accelerated sequentially relative to fiscal second quarter performance. 
Canada delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations, driven by stable fundamentals. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North American net revenue growth by several hundred basis points. 
As Jeff noted, our European business performed exceptionally well again this quarter, posting revenue growth of 8%. Adjusting for adverse currency exchange rates, especially the British pound in Europe, European constant currency net revenue growth was 16%. Operating margins in Europe for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 49.7%. 
Asia-Pacific net revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis, despite continued macroeconomic weakness in Greater China. Reported net revenue growth in Asia-Pacific was 3% as a result of significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. 
We are particularly pleased with operating margins in Asia-Pacific for the quarter, which expanded by over 600 basis points. This was driven primarily by growth in our higher margin businesses, predominantly Ezidebit, as well as expense management across the region in light of the broader macro trends. 
Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $21 million. Free cash flow, defined as net operating cash flows, excluding settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests, was $77 million. 
In connection with our planned acquisition of Heartland, we have engaged in a variety of financing-related activities over the past few months. In February, we amended our existing credit facilities to retain them, post-closing of the Heartland transaction. At the same time, given strong interest from existing and new lenders, we entered into a new $735 million delayed-draw Term Loan A facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the transaction. The new Term Loan A facility, which we expect to be more cost-effective than our Term Loan B, allowed us to reduce the size of the Term Loan B component of the transaction financing by $735 million to $1.045 billion. In addition, in March, we successfully completed syndication of the $1.045 billion Term Loan B facility on terms and conditions more favorable than we expected in December. 
As a result of these activities, we now expect the weighted average pro forma interest rate on our debt facilities to be in the range of 3.75% to 4% as compared to the 4% to 4.25% range we anticipated at the time of the announcement of the transaction. We expect this will generate a meaningful amount of annual interest expense savings relative to our original pro forma assumptions. 
As we approach the closing of the Heartland transaction later this month, we intend to resume more normal capital allocation policies immediately thereafter, although our near-term priority is to return to our targeted leverage ratio, we've retained sufficient capacity to continue to pursue the capital allocation program we have employed with much success over the past few years. 
As evidenced by the eWAY transaction, we remain interested in select acquisitions that augment our strategies globally. Likewise, you should assume that we will return to being a consistent buyer of our stock as a means by which to return capital to shareholders. 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2016. On a constant currency basis, we expect net revenues to be towards the high end of our guidance range of 10% to 12% growth over fiscal 2015. Given the continued weakness we have seen in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, in particular, the British pound, we expect reported revenues to be towards the low end of our previous guidance range of $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion. We are increasing our cash operating margin expectation and now anticipate margins will expand by at least 100 basis points in fiscal 2016 on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share are now expected to grow 16% to 19% over fiscal 2015 and range from $2.93 to $3.
Finally, please note that our outlook did not include the impact of the Heartland's acquisition that we expect to close later this month. We anticipate that the addition of Heartland will add $80 million to $100 million to our net revenues and have a de minimis impact on cash earnings per share for fiscal 2016. 
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

This merger furthers the 4 pillars of our strategy described in our October Investor Day: Grow and control direct distribution through the addition of 300,000 new merchants; add distinctive products and services in new markets, such as the K-12 and university educational markets; leverage our combined technological and operational advantages by increasing transactions nearly 50% on a pro forma basis; and continue to invest in our global businesses to generate superior returns. This is truly an exciting time, and I look forward to speaking with you in July as one combined company. Andrew?"

First, I still think we've got plenty of runway on margin enhancement. I think as we said, probably a number of times in the last couple of years, we view margins on a stand-alone basis in the low-30s as achievable and sustainable. Even with terrific margin performance today, we're still not at that level. I think, to get to your question about what's driving that growth, undoubtedly scale is an important element of that, but I think it's really been a conscious decision on our part to shift our mix toward businesses that we've view as attractive, and by attractive, I mean, growing faster than the rate of market growth with better margin characteristics. So if you look, for example, at OpenEdge, which we talk a lot about, that continues to grow, as we said in our prepared remarks, at rates 2x to 3x the rate of market growth. If you look as Realex, if you look at Ezidebit, these are all businesses that, Ashwin, that, first, are growing fairly rapidly compared to their markets, but second, provide us with opportunities for further margin enhancement, prior to Heartland. So I still think we're in the early innings of where we can take the margins. That gives us, obviously, a lot of comfort, as we look toward Heartland, to think about what we might do together as one combined company. Cameron, you want to?"

We still have a lot of room, relative to our overall target level of low-30s, to continue to expand margin from here on, on a stand-alone basis. In addition to the items Jeff described, the other things I would call out specifically are, one, the acquisitions we continue to do we to improve scale in markets that we find attractive, that have good dynamics, where our business are geared towards higher-margin solutions, such as, for example, the eWAY transaction that we just executed and its contributions to our Australian business, and what was there in the margins in Australia, to continue to improve those from their already attractive levels. The last thing I would mention is, we continue to make investments in our infrastructure to improve our operational leverage. We continue this transformation we started out on, several years ago, to move away from the holding company, operating company model the business utilized for many years to the single unified operating company structure that David described at the Investor Conference back in October. That's still in process. And I think that continued evolution provides a nice tailwind for margin expansion over time as well."

Our view on that continues to strengthen, meaning there is relatively a little overlap as we see it. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we believe that we're even more confident today in the synergies, that we described in December sitting here, and not in April.

So certainly, the performance in the U.K., that I think we described last quarter on the call, has significantly exceeded our expectations, really all year and probably for the last 18 months. So it's a little bit more of that. As it relates to the interchange benefit, as we discussed in context of Spain, and also in the case of United States when we had Durbin 4 or 5 years ago, we do the interchange benefits a little bit more temporal, that's just a function of over what period of time that will rationalize within the marketplace. But that business as it relates to that elements of its growth has also met, in what we -- what our expectations were heading into the third quarter.

At this point, maybe a little bit more than 1 year ago, as a suite of products and services under the names of EdgeShield and GlobalShield that were EMV compliant with encryption and tokenization and NFC, kind of all wrapped into one.

Its a part of a security solution we're bringing to market, based on merchants demand. At the same time, we also bring into market, what is global expertise in EMV. We've rolled out EMV all over the world. As you might imagine, all the way back to Canada 5 years ago, it's probably the most recent example of needing to bring EMV to market to improve security for the merchants. When you think about the focus on security suites and solutions, we've been able to drive some new sales around security, but EMV, itself, is in no way an economic tailwind for us. It's a process for us, in terms of migration, of making sure the ecosystem is more secure. From that perspective, from an ecosystem perspective, our metrics are really right in line with what you might see from the industry at large, measured migration, consistent migration is our theme, driven by merchant demand after merchant education from Global Payments. One thing I would note for you though, is when you think about our key direct portfolios, things like OpenEdge, which is full of dentist offices, veterinary clinics, dry cleaners, those are not high demand verticals for EMV migration. So we're working with the pace our merchants want to work, we're trying to drive more education to drive more migration. As Jeff noted before, our certifications are in very good shape. We're just moving along with the market, in some cases a little ahead of the market. One more reminder in terms of percentages when you see them banded about by industry payers, we have a very focused portfolio at this Heartland on small and the medium merchants around the country. You won't find big-box retailers in our portfolio. You won't find them, by and large, in Heartland's portfolio either. So just remember that, when we talk about the level of migration and the pace. We've got a lot of small to medium merchants to go through as does the rest of the industry. We're going through them very consistently. Very happy with the progress. I think our merchants are as well. We're managing chargebacks with the merchants, which may be a follow-up you might want to ask. In terms, there's a minor uptick, but very manageable so far. And I think again, that's the results of years of global experience managing EMV, managing the shift and being able to help our merchant through it."

I think for Global Payments, in particular, EMV has certainly not been a tailwind as it relates to our financial results. I think I still view it, frankly, as a headwind in the sense that we had to make investments into our systems, and I'm still waiting for the return on that investment to some degree."

It obviously enhances our omni solution -- omnichannel solution strategy, that we spoke at great length about in October at our Investor Day. I think bringing that asset to our portfolio into Australia really positions us to accelerate our omnichannel solutions capability in market. And we really looked at it very simply as a buy versus build opportunity. We're delighted with Realex and what it's been able to bring to our portfolio. As we noted in our prepared comments, we launched the bundle in the fall in the U.K. We're bringing it to Spain in the not-too-distant future. But as it is related to Australia, this was a very unique opportunity to buy the market leader. From an e-com point of view, couple it with our existing presence with Ezidebit, which we've been thrilled, with their performance to create the leading technology-enabled distribution platform in the Asia-Pacific region. So with a fantastic opportunity. And one of the side benefits of structuring the Heartland transaction the way we did is, we've maintained the financial capacity to be able to do these types of things.

So I think as you look at eWay, and as you look at Erste, which we expect to close by the end of this fiscal year, I think to Cameron's point, those are pretty good examples of the types of transactions that we have sheets out on today, which is to say whilst we're at the lower end of what we have invested in transactions, nonetheless very meaningful from a strategic and new markets point of view.

So one of the things that we pointed out in our prepared remarks is that we've been very successful in Asia-Pacific by adding new markets and by increasing our presence in markets that have been performing well. So we talked a lot about Australia, we just responded to Steven, talking about eWAY and Ezidebit. Of course, we have our joint a venture with Bank of the Philippine Islands, which were also performing in line with our expectations in that market before the JV and we increased our size to the second largest presence in that market thereafter. As a result, we've been able to grow, to answer your question, we've been able to grow the Asian Pacific business 9% on a constant currency basis this quarter. So I'd say, we're still getting very good growth, and Greater China, which I define as mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, as a percentage of the business in Asia-Pacific, has been reduced from probably, a number of years ago, probably about half of it, so maybe around 30% currently, and that largely is a result of targeted additions in other markets like Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. We also continue to grow very well in markets like Singapore, beyond the 2 or 3 that I've just listed. So I would say there's been a fair amount of revenue growth. It seems about 2/3 of Asia-Pacific, Tien-tsin, coming from markets other than -- as a percentage of revenue, other than Greater China providing, in the case of Ezidebit, 20% plus growth. It's not really going to have all that dramatic impact on the revenue growth in any one quarter, Greater China, that is. So I think a lot of it's coming from the mix of business, particularly that Ezidebit is in a much higher margin than the overall company, as well as Asia, by itself. And that's how I think about it. Cameron, you can comment maybe a little bit on the expense side."

We now, I think, in our minds, fully integrated Ezidebit, so that is creating an environment where incremental margins at Ezi are improving, and obviously it's already higher than our Asia average margins, so and it's increasing from there and accelerating from there. So I think that's contributing to it. But as it relates to the expense side, I think what we really try to do is look at our core business in Asia-Pacific, outside of Australia and to some degree the Philippines, where we have the joint venture with BPI, and really try to rationalize the size of the expense base relative to the outlook for that market over the next 12 to 18 months. And the reality is, we do expect a continued weakness in China. Hopefully, we've seen before, but we don't expect it to rebound dramatically in the near term. So we really try to reposition the business to ride out what we expect to be a soft spot in the cycle in the Greater China markets and position the business for continued success. And I think you're seeing the results of that play through in margins this quarter."

A couple of lessons learned, we're finding very strong demand for the bundled solution in the U.K. The place where we're working the hardest is probably on the joint sales proposition and being able to take what you might think of as a traditional sale and marry to it a more technology-enabled piece of the sale. So the gateway married to the acquiring, married to the reporting, married to the fraud and credit management you have to be able to provide. All those tools are there, probably the place where we've learned the more lessons has been on making those joint sales calls and enabling and equipping traditional sales folks to be able to sell either the early stages of e-commerce enablement to small to medium merchant or sell the entire bundle. The good news is with the demand the demand we've had and the level of execution we've seen, it has not affected our sales trajectory. In fact, we're very pleased with the sales coming out in the back of the demand, but it is a more technical sale. So being able to equip your salespeople on a global basis to sell more technology enabled transaction processing is a challenge of its own. We feel like we've learned a lot in that early integration between the U.K. and Ireland, that will serve us well in Spain, particularly. Its allowed us, Tim, to think more specifically about how you target a market and how you focus a piece of the sales force on the macro payments -- themselves on micro merchants, a piece of the sales force on small to medium, and then joint calling of experts, maybe from Ireland, in addition to Spain on large to national merchants and certainly joint calling between all of your regions, as well as your technical experts in a place Ireland where Realex is based on multiregional or multi-market or regional accounts. So really how you go-to-market has been where we've learned lessons. And again, we're fortunate enough to be learning them in a situation where the sales are right at target, or above in many cases, so we feel good about those pieces. And if you step back a little bit and think about this, the second pieces -- the second and third pieces of this is really partners and software developers. As you enter new markets, you want to continue the momentum you have with channel partners, so ISVs, card providers, folks like that. You also want to develop and foster your relationship with developers, the press to shops of this world, you've seen the press, even from other providers in the e-commerce world. So in specific markets, you've got certain ISVs, card providers, as well as software providers. You're also taking your regional partners with you. So being able to go-to-market and manage the direct sales, as I described earlier, in a specific region, the face-to-face married to the technology, as well as local channel partners, local software providers and with that an overlay of the regional folks and, in many cases, the global software providers. It's a little tricky, and it comes down again to market segmentation and how you compensate and drive the direct sales force to certain behaviors you want to target the segments, make sure they don't trip over each other and make sure that you can drive joint sales. That's all a bit infancy in global. We're really pretty please with the pieces, so pleased that we went ahead and deployed $50 million of more capital in Australia to continue executing the same strategy where we can take this bundle with Ezidebit and eWAY to market and drive even deeper penetration of what's already the leading provider of small- to medium-sized retail e-commerce in Australia. So long-winded answer, I realize, but it's actually been a great deal of learning, a great deal of really excellent execution by our teams in Ireland, in the U.K. and now about to be in Spain. This led us to sort of feel really good about the execution levels we're seeing, That was something we spent a lot of time describing at the Investor Day in October. Omnichannel, global capabilities that we think we are uniquely positioned to sell."

I would say we're still seeing some weakness in certain markets, particularly the pound, and today as another example, I would point to say not only is the U.S. dollar sort of secularly strong, the volatility in some of these major currencies is astounding. You see pound moving 1.5 point or 2 points intraday, for example, obviously makes it very difficult to forecast FX, with any sort of certainty, as we think and as we look forward. I think we are, as we get into fiscal '17, particularly as we get into the back half of fiscal 17, hopefully we're going to be in an environment where we're starting to anniversary some of the stronger headwinds. But I certainly don't do think that we're approaching anytime soon an environment where the U.S. dollar's going to weaken relative to most of the major currencies around the world to which we have exposure. I think we're in a sort of secular bull market for the U.S. dollar. I expect that to continue for some time. There's just not a lot out there that would cause me to believe the dollar is going to weaken. But as we continue to anniversary some of these bigger moves, for example, we anniversary the strong euro move in Q3 of this year. Unfortunately, that was more than offset by an equally strong move downward in the pound at relatively the same time. So we have good exposure to a fair number of currencies. To Jeff's earlier point, part of the benefit of the Heartland transaction is that it does derisk currency exposure to the company on a macro basis, we'll be 2/3 U.S. dollar denominated business going forward and that obviously will diminish some of the FX exposure that we have globally. But I'm hopeful to get into an environment we're in '17, we're seeing most of the strong headwinds begin to diminish to some degree."

We've spent a lot more time with them. So I think not a lot of changes at all as you might imagine going forward. And their trajectory right now is really impressive. So it's more a matter of making sure we can figure out how to accelerate that with more product, maybe a different way to think about enhancing the traditional distribution with again, additional product out of Heartland commerce and the other business units that are already in place there, so really pleased with the pieces, really pleased with the sales force and the trajectory and no plans to change anything we described to you December."

So we continue to be very pleased with OpenEdge. It still grows in the mid- to high-teens. The revenue production is really, really impressive. That's all at increasing margins that are higher than the company's margin. So back to several of the other questions earlier today. In terms of existing verticals, we remain very, very low penetrated, so that's not perfect grammar. But really, I don't think we have a vertical that's more than 20% penetrated anywhere in any of our key verticals. So you think of vets and dentists, we talk about those a lot, pharma, we think about parking garages, all those very low levels, we've got a sales force that's focused on driving deeper penetration into those verticals. At the same time though, we're looking for other places to grow. So we mentioned in the Heartland description before, where we don't have an education vertical in OpenEdge, we don't do restaurant and hospitality. The opportunity to drive deeper penetration in those verticals by OpenEdge to complement the direct sales force about what you asked in your first question, it's there, it's real, we continue to work on that in integration planning. The other couple of things we have is, we literally entered a new vertical in the United States that we weren't in before just in the last couple of weeks. We entered the unattended payments vertical in the United States with a brand-new partner, a large ISV who plays in that space, you're talking about car washes, more parking, vending, things like that. That's new and unique for OpenEdge, sort of brand new vertical, effectively worth 0% penetration in that vertical as we sit here today, but we know how to manage the ecosystem of partners, merchants, leads and marketing to drive that. And then maybe, happiest news of all, in terms of how we think about growing that OpenEdge beyond just the United States, the global opportunity is real. We're really pleased to announce we actually have opened up OpenEdge and launched it in the U.K. this quarter, so we have a staff there, dedicated sales folks, dedicated product folks. Remember, back to October, in the Investor Day, one of our key pillars of accelerating global growth was the global expansion of integrated payments, OpenEdge, driving the Canada, driving United Kingdom. So we've now launched our business in the U.K. We can bring that dedicated and product and ecosystem to the United Kingdom to work with the ISV's to drive the benefits of technology integration that don't exist in the U.K. as they exist in the U.S. today. And better still, we can drive existing partners into the United Kingdom. So U.S.-based ISVs and software providers provide near-term sales opportunities. In fact, we're going to bring a few customers live in the U.K. in just the next few months coming from U.S.-based ISVs where we're extending their franchise, extending the integrated payments benefit out to the U.K. for them. So more to come on this, but really, OpenEdge is poised for more global growth but still continued excellent execution in the United States as we go forward."

We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong results.

We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong results. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets with particular strength in our United States and United Kingdom businesses, continuing our track record of solid execution globally. Importantly, we are also on track with our pending acquisition of Heartland Payments, which we expect to close later this month. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we grew net revenue 6%, expanded margins 50 basis points and increased cash earnings per share of 17%, all this despite absorbing significant incremental foreign currency headwind. On a constant currency basis, each of these metrics exceeded our expectations, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy and operational excellence across the organization. 
Now for more detailed highlights. 
We are especially pleased with our performance in North America where we believe we continue to grow faster than our markets by capturing share in verticals with attractive growth and margin characteristics. 
Organic net revenue growth for our U.S. direct business accelerated in the quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. OpenEdge continued its streak of mid- to high-teens growth. Our gaming business also continued to deliver strong organic growth, coupled with sound execution of the FIS gaming acquisition that was completed in June. 
In Europe, our U.K. business continues to execute exceptionally well with significant organic revenue growth. Our results also reflect the benefits from the EU interchange regulation that became effective in December 2015. 
Outside of the U.K., Spain maintained its strong track record with yet another quarter of double-digit volume and transaction growth, well in excess of the market rate of growth and the Spanish GDP. 
We remain pleased with the performance of our European e-commerce Gateway business, Realex, and we are poised to enter the Spanish markets with new omnichannel offerings in the coming months, following the U.K. launch last fall. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, we produced strong revenue growth on a local currency basis despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in Greater China. Our strategy to diversify distribution in the region by entering new geographic markets and partnerships has been successful. Ezidebit had another outstanding quarter, accelerating growth to 20% plus on a local currency basis. Our BPI joint venture also continues to perform in line with our expectations. We have been able to offset macro weakness by solid execution, illustrated by margin performance in Asia, which significantly exceeded our expectations. 
We are also building upon our successful partnership with Ezidebit with the acquisition of eWAY, a payment gateway and e-commerce technology company in Australia. Similar to Realex in Ireland, eWAY is a leading provider of payment solution to developers and software partners, with approximately 25% of the online market. The combination of eWAY's cutting-edge products with Ezidebit complements our global omnichannel solution strategy and will create the leading payment technology company in Asia-Pacific with nearly 40,000 merchant customers in Australia and New Zealand. 
We have made considerable progress on our pending acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, which we look to close later this month. This transaction will accelerate transformative growth, at a time when both businesses are executing strongly, and we continue to be impressed with the people we have met at Heartland. As we have done successfully with APT, PayPros, Ezidebit and Realex, we are confident in our ability to accelerate sales growth at Heartland. 
The goal of our integration is to ensure a frictionless transition post close, building on the momentum that Global Payments and Heartland have each had individually as one combined company. We are even more confident in the synergies that we described at the time of the transaction announcement and could not be more pleased with our proposed partnership. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues shortly. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

We've made substantial progress in this business in fiscal 2016, and are delighted to report another quarter of strong adjusted net revenue growth, operating margin expansion and cash earnings per share growth despite significant FX headwinds. 
Total company net revenue for the third quarter was $497 million, reflecting growth of 6% versus the third quarter of fiscal 2015 or 11% on a constant currency basis. Importantly, normalized organic net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was high single digits for the quarter at the high end of our cycle guidance. 
Operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 28.7% for the quarter or 110 basis points on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share increased 17% to $0.70 or 28% on a constant currency basis. 
North American net revenue grew 6% in the quarter with operating margin expansion of 70 basis points to 27.2%, despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels was high single digits for the quarter and accelerated sequentially relative to fiscal second quarter performance. 
Canada delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations, driven by stable fundamentals. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North American net revenue growth by several hundred basis points. 
As Jeff noted, our European business performed exceptionally well again this quarter, posting revenue growth of 8%. Adjusting for adverse currency exchange rates, especially the British pound in euro, European constant currency net revenue growth was 16%. Operating margins in Europe for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 49.7%. 
Asia-Pacific net revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis, despite continued macroeconomic weakness in Greater China. Reported net revenue growth in Asia-Pacific was 3% as a result of significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. 
We are particularly pleased with operating margins in Asia-Pacific for the quarter, which expanded by over 600 basis points. This was driven primarily by growth in our higher margin businesses, predominantly Ezidebit, as well as expense management across the region in light of the broader macro trends. 
Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $21 million. Free cash flow, defined as net operating cash flows, excluding settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests, was $77 million. 
In connection with our planned acquisition of Heartland, we have engaged in a variety of financing-related activities over the past few months. In February, we amended our existing credit facilities to retain them, post-closing of the Heartland transaction. At the same time, given strong interest from existing and new lenders, we entered into a new $735 million delayed-draw Term Loan A facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the transaction. The new Term Loan A facility, which we expect to be more cost-effective than our Term Loan B, allowed us to reduce the size of the Term Loan B component of the transaction financing by $735 million to $1.045 billion. In addition, in March, we successfully completed syndication of the $1.045 billion Term Loan B facility on terms and conditions more favorable than we expected in December. 
As a result of these activities, we now expect the weighted average pro forma interest rate on our debt facilities to be in the range of 3.75% to 4% as compared to the 4% to 4.25% range we anticipated at the time of the announcement of the transaction. We expect this will generate a meaningful amount of annual interest expense savings relative to our original pro forma assumptions. 
As we approach the closing of the Heartland transaction later this month, we intend to resume more normal capital allocation policies immediately thereafter, although our near-term priority is to return to our targeted leverage ratio, we've retained sufficient capacity to continue to pursue the capital allocation program we have employed with much success over the past few years. 
As evidenced by the eWAY transaction, we remain interested in select acquisitions that augment our strategies globally. Likewise, you should assume that we will return to being a consistent buyer of our stock as a means by which to return capital to shareholders. 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2016. On a constant currency basis, we expect net revenues to be towards the high end of our guidance range of 10% to 12% growth over fiscal 2015. Given the continued weakness we have seen in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, in particular, the British pound, we expect reported revenues to be towards the low end of our previous guidance range of $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion. We are increasing our cash operating margin expectation and now anticipate margins will expand by at least 100 basis points in fiscal 2016 on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share are now expected to grow 16% to 19% over fiscal 2015 and range from $2.93 to $3.
Finally, please note that our outlook did not include the impact of the Heartland's acquisition that we expect to close later this month. We anticipate that the addition of Heartland will add $80 million to $100 million to our net revenues and have a de minimis impact on cash earnings per share for fiscal 2016. 
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

First, I still think we've got plenty of runway on margin enhancement. I think as we said, probably a number of times in the last couple of years, we view margins on a stand-alone basis in the low-30s as achievable and sustainable. Even with terrific margin performance today, we're still not at that level. I think, to get to your question about what's driving that growth, undoubtedly scale is an important element of that, but I think it's really been a conscious decision on our part to shift our mix toward businesses that we've view as attractive, and by attractive, I mean, growing faster than the rate of market growth with better margin characteristics. So if you look, for example, at OpenEdge, which we talk a lot about, that continues to grow, as we said in our prepared remarks, at rates 2x to 3x the rate of market growth. If you look as Realex, if you look at Ezidebit, these are all businesses that, Ashwin, that, first, are growing fairly rapidly compared to their markets, but second, provide us with opportunities for further margin enhancement, prior to Heartland. So I still think we're in the early innings of where we can take the margins.

We still have a lot of room, relative to our overall target level of low-30s, to continue to expand margin from here on, on a stand-alone basis. In addition to the items Jeff described, the other things I would call out specifically are, one, the acquisitions we continue to do to improve scale in markets that we find attractive, that have good dynamics, where our business are geared towards higher-margin solutions, such as, for example, the eWAY transaction that we just executed and its contributions to our Australian business, and what it will do to margins in Australia, to continue to improve those from their already attractive levels. The last thing I would mention is, we continue to make investments in our infrastructure to improve our operational leverage. We continue this transformation we started out on, several years ago, to move away from the holding company, operating company model the business utilized for many years to the single unified operating company structure that David described at the Investor Conference back in October. That's still in process. And I think that continued evolution provides a nice tailwind for margin expansion over time as well."

I would say it's probably something different, meaning we probably had now 18 months of very solid new sales growth, organic sales execution in that market, yet the benefit of the interchange regulation really picked up in December of 2015. So certainly, the performance in the U.K., that I think we described last quarter on the call, has significantly exceeded our expectations, really all year and probably for the last 18 months. So it's a little bit more of that. As it relates to the interchange benefit, as we discussed in context of Spain, and also in the case of United States when we had Durbin 4 or 5 years ago, we do the interchange benefits a little bit more temporal, that's just a function of over what period of time that will rationalize within the marketplace. But that business as it relates to that elements of its growth has also met, in what we -- what our expectations were heading into the third quarter.

As it relates to certifications, I think the key strength of ours has been early rollout of the EMV. We announced probably 1 year ago. At this point, maybe a little bit more than 1 year ago, as a suite of products and services under the names of EdgeShield and GlobalShield that were EMV compliant with encryption and tokenization and NFC, kind of all wrapped into one. So I think everybody has had to push on the certification side, given the complexity of the U.S. broader ecosystem, so I don't think that that's different, really, for anyone. But I would say that we're very proud of the fact that we were in market, and I think, Heartland is probably very similar in market very early on with the certifications.

Its a part of a security solution we're bringing to market, based on merchant demand. At the same time, we also bring into market, what is global expertise in EMV. We've rolled out EMV all over the world. As you might imagine, all the way back to Canada 5 years ago, it's probably the most recent example of needing to bring EMV to market to improve security for the merchants. When you think about the focus on security suites and solutions, we've been able to drive some new sales around security, but EMV, itself, is in no way an economic tailwind for us. It's a process for us, in terms of migration, of making sure the ecosystem is more secure. From that perspective, from an ecosystem perspective, our metrics are really right in line with what you might see from the industry at large, measured migration, consistent migration is our theme, driven by merchant demand after merchant education from Global Payments. One thing I would note for you though, is when you think about our key direct portfolios, things like OpenEdge, which is full of dentist offices, veterinary clinics, dry cleaners, those are not high demand verticals for EMV migration. So we're working with the pace our merchants want to work, we're trying to drive more education to drive more migration. As Jeff noted before, our certifications are in very good shape. We're just moving along with the market, in some cases a little ahead of the market. One more reminder in terms of percentages when you see them bandied about by industry players, we have a very focused portfolio, as does Heartland, on small and the medium merchants around the country. You won't find big-box retailers in our portfolio. You won't find them, by and large, in Heartland's portfolio either. So just remember that, when we talk about the level of migration and the pace. We've got a lot of small to medium merchants to go through as does the rest of the industry. We're going through them very consistently. Very happy with the progress. I think our merchants are as well. We're managing chargebacks with the merchants, which may be a follow-up you might want to ask. In terms, there's a minor uptick, but very manageable so far. And I think again, that's the results of years of global experience managing EMV, managing the shift and being able to help our merchant through it."

Of course, we have our joint a venture with Bank of the Philippine Islands, which were also performing in line with our expectations, in that market before the JV and we increased our size to the second largest presence in that market thereafter. As a result, we've been able to grow, to answer your question, we've been able to grow the Asian Pacific business 9% on a constant currency basis this quarter. So I'd say, we're still getting very good growth, and Greater China, which I define as mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, as a percentage of the business in Asia-Pacific, has been reduced from probably, a number of years ago, probably about half of it, so maybe around 30% currently, and that largely is a result of targeted additions in other markets like Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. We also continue to grow very well in markets like Singapore, beyond the 2 or 3 that I've just listed. So I would say there's been a fair amount of revenue growth. It seems about 2/3 of Asia-Pacific, Tien-tsin, coming from markets other than -- as a percentage of revenue, other than Greater China providing, in the case of Ezidebit, 20% plus growth. It's not really going to have all that dramatic impact on the revenue growth in any one quarter, Greater China, that is. So I think a lot of it's coming from the mix of business, particularly that Ezidebit is in a much higher margin than the overall company, as well as Asia, by itself. And that's how I think about it. Cameron, you can comment maybe a little bit on the expense side."

So I would note, first and foremost, we're 1 year plus beyond the acquisition. We now, I think, in our minds, fully integrated Ezidebit, so that is creating an environment where incremental margins at Ezi are improving, and obviously it's already higher than our Asia average margins, so and it's increasing from there and accelerating from there. So I think that's contributing to it. But as it relates to the expense side, I think what we really try to do is look at our core business in Asia-Pacific, outside of Australia and to some degree the Philippines, where we have the joint venture with BPI, and really try to rationalize the size of the expense base relative to the outlook for that market over the next 12 to 18 months. And the reality is, we do expect a continued weakness in China. Hopefully, we've seen before, but we don't expect it to rebound dramatically in the near term. So we really try to reposition the business to ride out what we expect to be a soft spot in the cycle in the Greater China markets and position the business for continued success. And I think you're seeing the results of that play through in margins this quarter."

Their ability to forecast, predict and manage their business to produce results in line with our expectations, in light of, what is obviously a continued soft macroeconomic environment, has been fantastic. So I'll start there. I think we continue to see, sort of our code for stable fundamentals is the combination of stable low single-digit transaction volume growth and relatively stable spreads. So when we talk about fundamentals for Canada, our expectation is the combination of transaction volume growth and stable spread is going to produce low single-digit growth in local currency in that market. We've been consistently doing that now for probably 8 to 10 quarters, I would say, and I remain very pleased with how that team has performed in light of the broader macro issues."

A couple of lessons learned, we're finding very strong demand for the bundled solution in the U.K. The place where we're working the hardest is probably on the joint sales proposition and being able to take what you might think of as a traditional sale and marry to it a more technology-enabled piece of the sale. So the gateway married to the acquiring, married to the reporting, married to the fraud and credit management you have to be able to provide. All those tools are there, probably the place where we've learned the most lessons has been on making those joint sales calls and enabling and equipping traditional sales folks to be able to sell either the early stages of e-commerce enablement to small to medium merchant or sell the entire bundle. The good news is with the demand we've had and the level of execution we've seen, it has not affected our sales trajectory. In fact, we're very pleased with the sales coming out in the back of the demand, but it is a more technical sale. So being able to equip your salespeople on a global basis to sell more technology enabled transaction processing is a challenge of its own. We feel like we've learned a lot in that early integration between the U.K. and Ireland, that will serve us well in Spain, particularly. It's allowed us, Tim, to think more specifically about how you target a market and how you focus a piece of the sales force on the macro payments -- themselves on micro merchants, a piece of the sales force on small to medium, and then joint calling of experts, maybe from Ireland, in addition to Spain on large to national merchants and certainly joint calling between all of your regions, as well as your technical experts in a place like Ireland where Realex is based on multiregional or multi-market or regional accounts. So really how you go-to-market has been where we've learned lessons. And again, we're fortunate enough to be learning them in a situation where the sales are right at target, or above in many cases, so we feel good about those pieces. And if you step back a little bit and think about this, the second pieces -- the second and third pieces of this is really partners and software developers. As you enter new markets, you want to continue the momentum you have with channel partners, so ISVs, card providers, folks like that. You also want to develop and foster your relationship with developers, the Presta [ph] shops of this world, you've seen the press, even from other providers in the e-commerce world. So in specific markets, you've got certain ISVs, card providers, as well as software providers. You're also taking your regional partners with you. So being able to go-to-market and manage the direct sales, as I described earlier, in a specific region, the face-to-face married to the technology, as well as local channel partners, local software providers and with that an overlay of the regional folks and, in many cases, the global software providers. It's a little tricky, and it comes down again to market segmentation and how you compensate and drive the direct sales force to certain behaviors you want to target the segments, make sure they don't trip over each other and make sure that you can drive joint sales. That's all a bit infancy in global. We're really, really pleased with the pieces, so pleased that we went ahead and deployed $50 million of more capital in Australia to continue executing the same strategy where we can take this bundle with Ezidebit and eWAY to market and drive even deeper penetration of what's already the leading provider of small- to medium-sized retail e-commerce in Australia. So long-winded answer, I realize, but it's actually been a great deal of learning, a great deal of really excellent execution by our teams in Ireland, in the U.K. and now about to be in Spain. This led us to sort of feel really good about the execution levels we're seeing, relative to something we spent a lot of time describing at the Investor Day in October. Omnichannel, global capabilities that we think we are uniquely positioned to sell."

I would say we're still seeing some weakness in certain markets, particularly the pound, and today as another example, I would point to say not only is the U.S. dollar sort of secularly strong, the volatility in some of these major currencies is astounding. You see pound moving 1.5 point or 2 points intraday, for example, obviously makes it very difficult to forecast FX, with any sort of certainty, as we think and as we look forward. I think we are, as we get into fiscal '17, particularly as we get into the back half of fiscal 17, hopefully we're going to be in an environment where we're starting to anniversary some of the stronger headwinds. But I certainly don't do think that we're approaching anytime soon an environment where the U.S. dollar's going to weaken relative to most of the major currencies around the world to which we have exposure. I think we're in a sort of secular bull market for the U.S. dollar. I expect that to continue for some time. There's just not a lot out there that would cause me to believe the dollar is going to weaken. But as we continue to anniversary some of these bigger moves, for example, we anniversary the strong euro move in Q3 of this year. Unfortunately, that was more than offset by an equally strong move downward in the pound at relatively the same time. So we have good exposure to a fair number of currencies. To Jeff's earlier point, part of the benefit of the Heartland transaction is that it does derisk currency exposure to the company on a macro basis, we'll be 2/3 U.S. dollar denominated business going forward and that obviously will diminish some of the FX exposure that we have globally. But I'm hopeful to get into an environment we're in '17, we're seeing most of the strong headwinds begin to diminish to some degree."

So we continue to be very pleased with OpenEdge. It still grows in the mid- to high-teens. The revenue production is really, really impressive. That's all at increasing margins that are higher than the company's margin. So back to several of the other questions earlier today. In terms of existing verticals, we remain very, very low penetrated, so that's not perfect grammar. But really, I don't think we have a vertical that's more than 20% penetrated anywhere in any of our key verticals. So you think of vets and dentists, we talk about those a lot, pharma, we think about parking garages, all those very low levels, we've got a sales force that's focused on driving deeper penetration into those verticals. At the same time though, we're looking for other places to grow. So we mentioned in the Heartland description before, where we don't have an education vertical in OpenEdge, we don't do restaurant and hospitality. The opportunity to drive deeper penetration in those verticals by OpenEdge to complement the direct sales force about what you asked in your first question, it's there, it's real, we continue to work on that in integration planning. The other couple of things we have is, we literally entered a new vertical in the United States that we weren't in before just in the last couple of weeks. We entered the unattended payments vertical in the United States with a brand-new partner, a large ISV who plays in that space, you're talking about car washes, more parking, vending, things like that. That's new and unique for OpenEdge, so a brand new vertical, effectively we are at 0% penetration in that vertical as we sit here today, but we know how to manage the ecosystem of partners, merchants, leads and marketing to drive that. And then maybe, happiest news of all, in terms of how we think about growing that OpenEdge beyond just the United States, the global opportunity is real. We're really pleased to announce we actually have opened up OpenEdge and launched it in the U.K. this quarter, so we have a staff there, dedicated sales folks, dedicated product folks. Remember, back to October, in the Investor Day, one of our key pillars of accelerating global growth was the global expansion of integrated payments, OpenEdge, driving the Canada, driving United Kingdom. So we've now launched our business in the U.K. We can bring that dedicated and product and ecosystem to the United Kingdom to work with the ISV's to drive the benefits of technology integration that don't exist in the U.K. as they exist in the U.S. today. And better still, we can drive existing partners into the United Kingdom. So U.S.-based ISVs and software providers provide near-term sales opportunities. In fact, we're going to bring a few customers live in the U.K. in just the next few months coming from U.S.-based ISVs where we're extending their franchise, extending the integrated payments benefit out to the U.K. for them. So more to come on this, but really, OpenEdge is poised for more global growth but still continued excellent execution in the United States as we go forward."

We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong results. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets with particular strength in our United States and United Kingdom",642,"Thank you, Andrew, and thanks to everyone, for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report another quarter of very strong results. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets with particular strength in our United States and United Kingdom businesses, continuing our track record of solid execution globally. Importantly, we are also on track with our pending acquisition of Heartland Payments, which we expect to close later this month. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we grew net revenue 6%, expanded margins 50 basis points and increased cash earnings per share of 17%, all this despite absorbing significant incremental foreign currency headwind. On a constant currency basis, each of these metrics exceeded our expectations, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy and operational excellence across the organization. 
Now for more detailed highlights. 
We are especially pleased with our performance in North America where we believe we continue to grow faster than our markets by capturing share in verticals with attractive growth and margin characteristics. 
Organic net revenue growth for our U.S. direct business accelerated in the quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. OpenEdge continued its streak of mid- to high-teens growth. Our gaming business also continued to deliver strong organic growth, coupled with sound execution of the FIS gaming acquisition that was completed in June. 
In Europe, our U.K. business continues to execute exceptionally well with significant organic revenue growth. Our results also reflect the benefits from the EU interchange regulation that became effective in December 2015. 
Outside of the U.K., Spain maintained its strong track record with yet another quarter of double-digit volume and transaction growth, well in excess of the market rate of growth and the Spanish GDP. 
We remain pleased with the performance of our European e-commerce Gateway business, Realex, and we are poised to enter the Spanish markets with new omnichannel offerings in the coming months, following the U.K. launch last fall. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, we produced strong revenue growth on a local currency basis despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in Greater China. Our strategy to diversify distribution in the region by entering new geographic markets and partnerships has been successful. Ezidebit had another outstanding quarter, accelerating growth to 20% plus on a local currency basis. Our BPI joint venture also continues to perform in line with our expectations. We have been able to offset macro weakness by solid execution, illustrated by margin performance in Asia, which significantly exceeded our expectations. 
We are also building upon our successful partnership with Ezidebit with the acquisition of eWAY, a payment gateway and e-commerce technology company in Australia. Similar to Realex in Ireland, eWAY is a leading provider of payment solution to developers and software partners, with approximately 25% of the online market. The combination of eWAY's cutting-edge products with Ezidebit complements our global omnichannel solution strategy and will create the leading payment technology company in Asia-Pacific with nearly 40,000 merchant customers in Australia and New Zealand. 
We have made considerable progress on our pending acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems, which we look to close later this month. This transaction will accelerate transformative growth, at a time when both businesses are executing strongly, and we continue to be impressed with the people we have met at Heartland. As we have done successfully with APT, PayPros, Ezidebit and Realex, we are confident in our ability to accelerate sales growth at Heartland. 
The goal of our integration is to ensure a frictionless transition post close, building on the momentum that Global Payments and Heartland have each had individually as one combined company. We are even more confident in the synergies that we described at the time of the transaction announcement and could not be more pleased with our proposed partnership. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues shortly. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

We've made substantial progress in this business in fiscal 2016, and are delighted to report another quarter of strong adjusted net revenue growth, operating margin expansion and cash earnings per share growth des",877,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We've made substantial progress in this business in fiscal 2016, and are delighted to report another quarter of strong adjusted net revenue growth, operating margin expansion and cash earnings per share growth despite significant FX headwinds. 
Total company net revenue for the third quarter was $497 million, reflecting growth of 6% versus the third quarter of fiscal 2015 or 11% on a constant currency basis. Importantly, normalized organic net revenue growth on a constant currency basis was high single digits for the quarter at the high end of our cycle guidance. 
Operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 28.7% for the quarter or 110 basis points on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share increased 17% to $0.70 or 28% on a constant currency basis. 
North American net revenue grew 6% in the quarter with operating margin expansion of 70 basis points to 27.2%, despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels was high single digits for the quarter and accelerated sequentially relative to fiscal second quarter performance. 
Canada delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations, driven by stable fundamentals. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North American net revenue growth by several hundred basis points. 
As Jeff noted, our European business performed exceptionally well again this quarter, posting revenue growth of 8%. Adjusting for adverse currency exchange rates, especially the British pound in euro, European constant currency net revenue growth was 16%. Operating margins in Europe for the quarter increased 10 basis points to 49.7%. 
Asia-Pacific net revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis, despite continued macroeconomic weakness in Greater China. Reported net revenue growth in Asia-Pacific was 3% as a result of significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. 
We are particularly pleased with operating margins in Asia-Pacific for the quarter, which expanded by over 600 basis points. This was driven primarily by growth in our higher margin businesses, predominantly Ezidebit, as well as expense management across the region in light of the broader macro trends. 
Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $21 million. Free cash flow, defined as net operating cash flows, excluding settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests, was $77 million. 
In connection with our planned acquisition of Heartland, we have engaged in a variety of financing-related activities over the past few months. In February, we amended our existing credit facilities to retain them, post-closing of the Heartland transaction. At the same time, given strong interest from existing and new lenders, we entered into a new $735 million delayed-draw Term Loan A facility to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the transaction. The new Term Loan A facility, which we expect to be more cost-effective than our Term Loan B, allowed us to reduce the size of the Term Loan B component of the transaction financing by $735 million to $1.045 billion. In addition, in March, we successfully completed syndication of the $1.045 billion Term Loan B facility on terms and conditions more favorable than we expected in December. 
As a result of these activities, we now expect the weighted average pro forma interest rate on our debt facilities to be in the range of 3.75% to 4% as compared to the 4% to 4.25% range we anticipated at the time of the announcement of the transaction. We expect this will generate a meaningful amount of annual interest expense savings relative to our original pro forma assumptions. 
As we approach the closing of the Heartland transaction later this month, we intend to resume more normal capital allocation policies immediately thereafter, although our near-term priority is to return to our targeted leverage ratio, we've retained sufficient capacity to continue to pursue the capital allocation program we have employed with much success over the past few years. 
As evidenced by the eWAY transaction, we remain interested in select acquisitions that augment our strategies globally. Likewise, you should assume that we will return to being a consistent buyer of our stock as a means by which to return capital to shareholders. 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2016. On a constant currency basis, we expect net revenues to be towards the high end of our guidance range of 10% to 12% growth over fiscal 2015. Given the continued weakness we have seen in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, in particular, the British pound, we expect reported revenues to be towards the low end of our previous guidance range of $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion. We are increasing our cash operating margin expectation and now anticipate margins will expand by at least 100 basis points in fiscal 2016 on a constant currency basis. Cash earnings per share are now expected to grow 16% to 19% over fiscal 2015 and range from $2.93 to $3.
Finally, please note that our outlook did not include the impact of the Heartland's acquisition that we expect to close later this month. We anticipate that the addition of Heartland will add $80 million to $100 million to our net revenues and have a de minimis impact on cash earnings per share for fiscal 2016. 
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

First, I still think we've got plenty of runway on margin enhancement. I think as we said, probably a number of times in the last couple of years, we view margins on a stand-alone basis in the low-30s as achievable and sustainable. Even with terrific margin performance today, we're still not at that level. I think, to get to your question about what's driving that growth, undoubtedly scale is an important element of that, but I think it's really been a conscious decision on our part to shift our mix toward businesses that we've view as attractive, and by attractive, I mean, growing faster than the rate of market growth with better margin characteristics. So if you look, for example, at OpenEdge, which we talk a lot about, that continues to grow, as we said in our prepared remarks, at rates 2x to 3x the rate of market growth. If you look as Realex, if you look at Ezidebit, these are all businesses that, Ashwin, that, first, are growing fairly rapidly compared to their markets, but second, provide us with opportunities for further margin enhancement, prior to Heartland. So I still think we're in the early innings of where we can take the margins. That gives us, obviously, a lot of comfort, as we look toward Heartland, to think about what we might do together as one combined company. Cameron, you want to?"

We still have a lot of room, relative to our overall target level of low-30s, to continue to expand margin from here on, on a stand-alone basis. In addition to the items Jeff described, the other things I would call out specifically are, one, the acquisitions we continue to do to improve scale in markets that we find attractive, that have good dynamics, where our business are geared towards higher-margin solutions, such as, for example, the eWAY transaction that we just executed and its contributions to our Australian business, and what it will do to margins in Australia, to continue to improve those from their already attractive levels. The last thing I would mention is, we continue to make investments in our infrastructure to improve our operational leverage. We continue this transformation we started out on, several years ago, to move away from the holding company, operating company model the business utilized for many years to the single unified operating company structure that David described at the Investor Conference back in October. That's still in process. And I think that continued evolution provides a nice tailwind for margin expansion over time as well."

Our view on that continues to strengthen, meaning there is relatively a little overlap as we see it.

So certainly, the performance in the U.K., that I think we described last quarter on the call, has significantly exceeded our expectations, really all year and probably for the last 18 months. So it's a little bit more of that. As it relates to the interchange benefit, as we discussed in context of Spain, and also in the case of United States when we had Durbin 4 or 5 years ago, we do the interchange benefits a little bit more temporal, that's just a function of over what period of time that will rationalize within the marketplace.

That means all of the growth that Cameron's talking about, the acceleration in growth, comes from our direct control channels, so another very consistent quarter. We've been talking about the ISO for quite some time as a flat, maybe low single-digit grower. It continues to perform in that range. As to the migration you're talking about, and maybe I'll be even more specific, appreciate though the way you phrased your question. You're really talking about Mercury, and the migration of Mercury accounts that will be leaving us did actually occur over the course of this past quarter. So by the end of our February, the month of February, our third quarter, the migrations were completed. And we talked -- as we talked about any number of times, that impact is already reflected in the guidance. You can tell from the performance we delivered in the United States this quarter, just how minor this migration is, in terms of affecting Global Payments overall."

As it relates to certifications, I think the key strength of ours has been early rollout of the EMV. We announced probably 1 year ago. At this point, maybe a little bit more than 1 year ago, as a suite of products and services under the names of EdgeShield and GlobalShield that were EMV compliant with encryption and tokenization and NFC, kind of all wrapped into one. So I think everybody has had to push on the certification side, given the complexity of the U.S. broader ecosystem, so I don't think that that's different, really, for anyone. But I would say that we're very proud of the fact that we were in market, and I think, Heartland is probably very similar in market very early on with the certifications.

It's a part of a security solution we're bringing to market, based on merchant demand. At the same time, we also bring into market, what is global expertise in EMV. We've rolled out EMV all over the world. As you might imagine, all the way back to Canada 5 years ago, it's probably the most recent example of needing to bring EMV to market to improve security for the merchants. When you think about the focus on security suites and solutions, we've been able to drive some new sales around security, but EMV, itself, is in no way an economic tailwind for us. It's a process for us, in terms of migration, of making sure the ecosystem is more secure. From that perspective, from an ecosystem perspective, our metrics are really right in line with what you might see from the industry at large, measured migration, consistent migration is our theme, driven by merchant demand after merchant education from Global Payments. One thing I would note for you though, is when you think about our key direct portfolios, things like OpenEdge, which is full of dentist offices, veterinary clinics, dry cleaners, those are not high demand verticals for EMV migration. So we're working with the pace our merchants want to work, we're trying to drive more education to drive more migration. As Jeff noted before, our certifications are in very good shape. We're just moving along with the market, in some cases a little ahead of the market. One more reminder in terms of percentages when you see them bandied about by industry players, we have a very focused portfolio, as does Heartland, on small and the medium merchants around the country. You won't find big-box retailers in our portfolio. You won't find them, by and large, in Heartland's portfolio either. So just remember that, when we talk about the level of migration and the pace. We've got a lot of small to medium merchants to go through as does the rest of the industry. We're going through them very consistently. Very happy with the progress. I think our merchants are as well. We're managing chargebacks with the merchants, which may be a follow-up you might want to ask. In terms, there's a minor uptick, but very manageable so far. And I think again, that's the results of years of global experience managing EMV, managing the shift and being able to help our merchant through it."

As we noted in our prepared comments, we launched the bundle in the fall in the U.K. We're bringing it to Spain in the not-too-distant future. But as it is related to Australia, this was a very unique opportunity to buy the market leader. From an e-com point of view, couple it with our existing presence with Ezidebit, which we've been thrilled, with their performance to create the leading technology-enabled distribution platform in the Asia-Pacific region.

So one of the things that we pointed out in our prepared remarks is that we've been very successful in Asia-Pacific by adding new markets and by increasing our presence in markets that have been performing well. So we talked a lot about Australia, we just responded to Steven, talking about eWAY and Ezidebit. Of course, we have our joint a venture with Bank of the Philippine Islands, which were also performing in line with our expectations, in that market before the JV and we increased our size to the second largest presence in that market thereafter. As a result, we've been able to grow, to answer your question, we've been able to grow the Asian Pacific business 9% on a constant currency basis this quarter. So I'd say, we're still getting very good growth, and Greater China, which I define as mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, as a percentage of the business in Asia-Pacific, has been reduced from probably, a number of years ago, probably about half of it, so maybe around 30% currently, and that largely is a result of targeted additions in other markets like Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines. We also continue to grow very well in markets like Singapore, beyond the 2 or 3 that I've just listed. So I would say there's been a fair amount of revenue growth. It seems about 2/3 of Asia-Pacific, Tien-tsin, coming from markets other than -- as a percentage of revenue, other than Greater China providing, in the case of Ezidebit, 20% plus growth. It's not really going to have all that dramatic impact on the revenue growth in any one quarter, Greater China, that is. So I think a lot of it's coming from the mix of business, particularly that Ezidebit is in a much higher margin than the overall company, as well as Asia, by itself. And that's how I think about it. Cameron, you can comment maybe a little bit on the expense side."

So I think that's contributing to it. But as it relates to the expense side, I think what we really try to do is look at our core business in Asia-Pacific, outside of Australia and to some degree the Philippines, where we have the joint venture with BPI, and really try to rationalize the size of the expense base relative to the outlook for that market over the next 12 to 18 months. And the reality is, we do expect a continued weakness in China. Hopefully, we've seen before, but we don't expect it to rebound dramatically in the near term. So we really try to reposition the business to ride out what we expect to be a soft spot in the cycle in the Greater China markets and position the business for continued success. And I think you're seeing the results of that play through in margins this quarter."

But despite having a very good quarter it wasn't quite as good as Q1. So I do think that's a fair point, as you think about sort of setting your model up for fiscal '17. Outside of that, it's just again, and I talked to many of you guys about this is, it's sort of assessing the FX impact on results and trying to figure out how to overlay those on top of annualization of acquisition that we've made and how all of that plays through the financials. Obviously, happy to talk more offline, as that I'll think about that. But obviously, the volatility around the FX and the amount of headwind we've seen from FX does make it a little bit difficult from time to time to try to get reported results forecasted correctly quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year."

A couple of lessons learned, we're finding very strong demand for the bundled solution in the U.K. The place where we're working the hardest is probably on the joint sales proposition and being able to take what you might think of as a traditional sale and marry to it a more technology-enabled piece of the sale. So the gateway married to the acquiring, married to the reporting, married to the fraud and credit management you have to be able to provide. All those tools are there, probably the place where we've learned the most lessons has been on making those joint sales calls and enabling and equipping traditional sales folks to be able to sell either the early stages of e-commerce enablement to small to medium merchant or sell the entire bundle. The good news is with the demand we've had and the level of execution we've seen, it has not affected our sales trajectory. In fact, we're very pleased with the sales coming out in the back of the demand, but it is a more technical sale. So being able to equip your salespeople on a global basis to sell more technology enabled transaction processing is a challenge of its own. We feel like we've learned a lot in that early integration between the U.K. and Ireland, that will serve us well in Spain, particularly. It's allowed us, Tim, to think more specifically about how you target a market and how you focus a piece of the sales force on the macro payments -- themselves on micro merchants, a piece of the sales force on small to medium, and then joint calling of experts, maybe from Ireland, in addition to Spain on large to national merchants and certainly joint calling between all of your regions, as well as your technical experts in a place like Ireland where Realex is based on multiregional or multi-market or regional accounts. So really how you go-to-market has been where we've learned lessons. And again, we're fortunate enough to be learning them in a situation where the sales are right at target, or above in many cases, so we feel good about those pieces. And if you step back a little bit and think about this, the second pieces -- the second and third pieces of this is really partners and software developers. As you enter new markets, you want to continue the momentum you have with channel partners, so ISVs, card providers, folks like that. You also want to develop and foster your relationship with developers, the Presta [ph] shops of this world, you've seen the press, even from other providers in the e-commerce world. So in specific markets, you've got certain ISVs, card providers, as well as software providers. You're also taking your regional partners with you. So being able to go-to-market and manage the direct sales, as I described earlier, in a specific region, the face-to-face married to the technology, as well as local channel partners, local software providers and with that an overlay of the regional folks and, in many cases, the global software providers. It's a little tricky, and it comes down again to market segmentation and how you compensate and drive the direct sales force to certain behaviors you want to target the segments, make sure they don't trip over each other and make sure that you can drive joint sales. That's all a bit infancy in global. We're really, really pleased with the pieces, so pleased that we went ahead and deployed $50 million of more capital in Australia to continue executing the same strategy where we can take this bundle with Ezidebit and eWAY to market and drive even deeper penetration of what's already the leading provider of small- to medium-sized retail e-commerce in Australia. So long-winded answer, I realize, but it's actually been a great deal of learning, a great deal of really excellent execution by our teams in Ireland, in the U.K. and now about to be in Spain. This led us to sort of feel really good about the execution levels we're seeing, relative to something we spent a lot of time describing at the Investor Day in October. Omnichannel, global capabilities that we think we are uniquely positioned to sell."

I would say we're still seeing some weakness in certain markets, particularly the pound, and today as another example, I would point to say not only is the U.S. dollar sort of secularly strong, the volatility in some of these major currencies is astounding. You see pound moving 1.5 point or 2 points intraday, for example, obviously makes it very difficult to forecast FX, with any sort of certainty, as we think and as we look forward. I think we are, as we get into fiscal '17, particularly as we get into the back half of fiscal 17, hopefully we're going to be in an environment where we're starting to anniversary some of the stronger headwinds. But I certainly don't do think that we're approaching anytime soon an environment where the U.S. dollar's going to weaken relative to most of the major currencies around the world to which we have exposure. I think we're in a sort of secular bull market for the U.S. dollar. I expect that to continue for some time. There's just not a lot out there that would cause me to believe the dollar is going to weaken. But as we continue to anniversary some of these bigger moves, for example, we anniversary the strong euro move in Q3 of this year. Unfortunately, that was more than offset by an equally strong move downward in the pound at relatively the same time. So we have good exposure to a fair number of currencies. To Jeff's earlier point, part of the benefit of the Heartland transaction is that it does derisk currency exposure to the company on a macro basis, we'll be 2/3 U.S. dollar denominated business going forward and that obviously will diminish some of the FX exposure that we have globally. But I'm hopeful to get into an environment we're in '17, we're seeing most of the strong headwinds begin to diminish to some degree."

So we continue to be very pleased with OpenEdge. It still grows in the mid- to high-teens. The revenue production is really, really impressive. That's all at increasing margins that are higher than the company's margin. So back to several of the other questions earlier today. In terms of existing verticals, we remain very, very low penetrated, so that's not perfect grammar. But really, I don't think we have a vertical that's more than 20% penetrated anywhere in any of our key verticals. So you think of vets and dentists, we talk about those a lot, pharma, we think about parking garages, all those very low levels, we've got a sales force that's focused on driving deeper penetration into those verticals. At the same time though, we're looking for other places to grow. So we mentioned in the Heartland description before, where we don't have an education vertical in OpenEdge, we don't do restaurant and hospitality. The opportunity to drive deeper penetration in those verticals by OpenEdge to complement the direct sales force about what you asked in your first question, it's there, it's real, we continue to work on that in integration planning. The other couple of things we have is, we literally entered a new vertical in the United States that we weren't in before just in the last couple of weeks. We entered the unattended payments vertical in the United States with a brand-new partner, a large ISV who plays in that space, you're talking about car washes, more parking, vending, things like that. That's new and unique for OpenEdge, so a brand new vertical, effectively we are at 0% penetration in that vertical as we sit here today, but we know how to manage the ecosystem of partners, merchants, leads and marketing to drive that. And then maybe, happiest news of all, in terms of how we think about growing that OpenEdge beyond just the United States, the global opportunity is real. We're really pleased to announce we actually have opened up OpenEdge and launched it in the U.K. this quarter, so we have a staff there, dedicated sales folks, dedicated product folks. Remember, back to October, in the Investor Day, one of our key pillars of accelerating global growth was the global expansion of integrated payments, OpenEdge, driving the Canada, driving United Kingdom. So we've now launched our business in the U.K. We can bring that dedicated and product and ecosystem to the United Kingdom to work with the ISV's to drive the benefits of technology integration that don't exist in the U.K. as they exist in the U.S. today. And better still, we can drive existing partners into the United Kingdom. So U.S.-based ISVs and software providers provide near-term sales opportunities. In fact, we're going to bring a few customers live in the U.K. in just the next few months coming from U.S.-based ISVs where we're extending their franchise, extending the integrated payments benefit out to the U.K. for them. So more to come on this, but really, OpenEdge is poised for more global growth but still continued excellent execution in the United States as we go forward."

We are delighted with our strong performance in fiscal 2016 highlighting another year of solid execution that generated significant growth across our markets. We also made substantial progress in our strategic objectives, including the successful completion of our merger with Heartland in April, a landmark transaction for Global Payments.
For the year, we delivered net revenue growth of 11%, increased operating margin 50 basis points and grew cash earnings per share 18%. Each of these results exceeded our fiscal 2016 budget expectations as well as the cycle guidance we set forth at our Investor Day last October. We are most proud of our ability to accelerate net revenue growth and maintain a consistent level of operating margin expansion and cash EPS growth versus last fiscal, notwithstanding the incremental impacts of foreign currency. 
We expect continued positive momentum in fiscal 2017 as we expand direct distribution, deliver innovative products globally, leverage our technology and operating environments and prudently deploy capital. And, of course, our partnership with Heartland is at the core of this strategy. 
We are very pleased with early results at Heartland. Our combined senior management team is in place and has hit the ground running. New sales at Heartland have set internal records over the last 3 months we've begun to see the anticipated benefits of revenue enhancements across our businesses. We closed our first global cross-sell in June and jointly closed Heartland's largest ever new sale when we signed a major U.S. national restaurant customer in May.
We are already executing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth by enabling sales of our Heartland Campus Solutions, School Solutions and Commerce, point-of-sales payment technology globally as we head into fiscal and calendar 2017. 
Since the closing of the merger on April 22, we have also focused on executing our integration planes, which are critical to the realization of expense synergies. We have successfully completed the first 90-day actions, which consisted of substantial reductions in force facility closures, vendor rationalization and duplicate expense elimination. We are well down the path toward realizing the expense synergies we outlined for fiscal 2017 and beyond. 
And we have not been busy just with Heartland during fiscal 2016. We continue to make progress on the 2 key strategic initiatives to accelerate transformative growth that we described during our Investor Day. International expansion of our OpenEdge, integrated solutions business and continued development of our omnichannel solutions offerings. 
For OpenEdge, we are now lives and driving sales of our solutions to outside of the United States. We recently signed a contract with one of our largest existing ISPs to deliver integrated solutions to their customers in the United Kingdom. We are also pleased with our progress in Canada where we now have 30 ISB bar [ph] partners. We will shortly launch OpenEdge marketing campaigns with both local and U.S.-based partners to further accelerate penetration of our integrated solutions market. 
Our omnichannel solutions businesses had another very good year in fiscal 2016. We added over 4,000 new e-commerce customers in the U.K. and Ireland and signed several enterprise e-commerce clients in the U.K. in the fourth quarter based on the strength of our realized platform. Its scalability, reliability and performance. 
We are well positioned to accelerate growth and we expect to rollout out bundled e-commerce solution in Spain imminently. In addition, we plan to integrate Heartland to e-commerce offering in the United States with our global e-commerce solutions to create best-of-breed omnichannel capabilities before the end of calendar 2016. Furthermore, activation of eWAY also expands the scope of our offerings in the Asia-Pacific region providing us with global reach that is unmatched in our industry. 
Now for quarterly highlights. Our North American business has again delivered strong results. Our U.S. direct channel has generated high single-digit organic revenue growth led by OpenEdge. Canada continued its steady performance in local currency resulting from strong new sales, terrific execution and stable business fundamentals. 
Our European business has again generated solid results. We saw double-digit volume and transaction growth in Spain for the fifth consecutive quarter, well in excess of market price. Outside of Spain, our businesses in the U.K. and Continental Europe performed in line with our expectations. 
While we were disappointed with the result of the recent U.K. EU referendum, we have been preparing for that potential outcome for some time. We had contingency plans in place, which were executed immediately after the result. We do not expect any material impact on operations or earnings expectations as a consequence. We continue to monitor the impact of the referendum and we'll take further actions as conditions warrant. It is also worth noting that our U.S. business is now 2/3 of our net revenue post Heartland with the U.K. now representing single digits of our company's net revenue. 
Asia delivered high single-digit organic net revenue growth in local currency. Much like last quarter, we also generated substantial operating margin expansion as we reacted quickly last fall to emerging macro headwinds in Greater China markets. 
Finally, we remain delighted with our Ezidebit business, which reported accelerated revenue growth above 20% on a local currency basis. Our investment in the eWAY partnership in April highlights the confidence we have in our Australian colleagues and our optimism for this market.
Finally, a word about the change to our fiscal year that we announced today. Last July, we began the journey to provide enhanced comparability of our results with our peers. I believe this change will be the final piece of the puzzle to allow our stakeholders to better compare our performance to that of our competitors. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

We executed our largest ever transaction in our merger with Heartland, successfully raised $4.5 billion t",1459,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2016 was another terrific year for Global Payments, and included a number of significant milestones. We executed our largest ever transaction in our merger with Heartland, successfully raised $4.5 billion to finance growth, completed our first stock split in 10 years and lastly we're added to the S&P 500 index. Importantly, we accomplished all of these, while also producing strong financial performance throughout the year. 
Total company net revenue for fiscal 2016 was $2.17 billion, reflecting growth of 11% versus fiscal 2015, or 17% on a constant currency basis.
Operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 29.2%. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded 120 basis points. 
Cash earnings per share increased 18% to $2.98 per share, or 29% on a constant currency basis. For each of these measures, we exceeded our cycle guidance on a stated databases and substantially exceeded it on a constant currency basis. 
For the fourth quarter, total company net revenue was $621 million, a 25% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, or 27% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin was 28.1%, an expansion of 40 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 70 basis points. 
Cash earnings per share grew 14% to $0.73, or 16% on a constant currency basis. Relative to our expectations in April, currency impacted fourth quarter cash earnings per share by roughly $0.01 to $0.02. 
Naturally, fourth quarter performance reflects the results of Heartland from April 22, which were in line with the expectations we shared during our April call. 
Now for detailed segment highlights for the quarter. Our North American segment, which now includes Heartland, saw net revenue growth of 36% and operating margin expansion of 30 basis points, despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points. 
Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels calculated as if we owned Heartland and the FIS gaming business in both this period and in fiscal 2015 was high single digits for the quarter. 
Canada once again delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North American net revenue growth by over 100 basis points for the quarter. 
As Jeff noted, our European business performed well again this quarter, posting revenue growth of 7% on a constant currency basis. Reported net revenue growth for Europe was 3% due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound in Europe. As a reminder, we also annualized our acquisition of Realex in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
European operating margin was 47.8%, declining from prior year, primarily due to investments we are making to further expand our omnichannel solutions business and foreign currency impacts. 
Asia net revenue grew 15% or 19% on a constant currency basis, despite ongoing macroeconomic weakness in our Greater China markets. 
Organic constant currency revenue growth, adjusting for both the BPI and eWAY transaction, was high single digits for the quarter, accelerating sequentially from our fiscal third quarter. 
Once again, we're particularly pleased with operating margins in Asia-Pacific, which expanded by over 400 basis points to 26.3%. This was primarily driven by the continued strong growth in our Ezidebit business as well as the expense management program we implemented in the fall of 2015. 
Shortly after closing the Heartland merger, we entered into a $50 million accelerated share repurchase agreement bringing total share repurchases in the quarter to 711,000 shares for approximately $53 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repurchased a further 638,000 shares for approximately $44 million.
Now turning to our fiscal 2017 outlook. On a constant currency basis, we expect fiscal 2017 net revenue to range from $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, reflecting growth of 50% to 54% over fiscal 2016. We anticipate foreign currency headwinds will impact net revenue growth by 200 to 300 basis points for the year, resulting in expected reported net revenues of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. 
Operating margin is expected to expand by up to 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. After reflecting the anticipated impact of foreign currency headwinds, we expect reported operating margin to expand by up to 40 basis points. We are particularly pleased with our outlook for operating margin expansion as we expect to be able to absorb the anticipated margin degradation from Heartland and still expand operating margins on a constant currency basis toward the high end of our cycle guidance.
We expect cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to range from $3.50 to $3.60, reflecting growth of 17% to 21% over fiscal 2016. After giving rise to anticipated foreign currency headwinds, particularly the significant weakness we have seen in the pound resulting from the Brexit referendum, we expect reported cash earnings per share to range from $3.4o to $3.50, reflecting growth of 14% to 17%. 
We are forecasting the most significant foreign currency impacts in the first 2 quarters of the year. As a result, we expect roughly 47% to 48% of our cash earnings per share to be contributed in the first 2 fiscal quarters and the balance to be realized in the back half of the fiscal year. This is essentially the inverse of fiscal 2016.
With respect to the more detailed assumptions that underlie this outlook, we expect North American net revenue to grow nearly 70% in fiscal 2017, including FX headwind from the Canadian dollar. This growth reflects the addition of Heartland and our expectations that our combined U.S. direct businesses will generate organic growth in the high single digits. Canadian net revenue growth assumptions remain in the low single digits in local currency. 
We expect to North America operating margin to expand for the year as we anticipate being able to more than offset the margin impacts of Heartland with operating efficiencies and synergies. 
In Europe, we expect net revenue on a constant currency basis to grow in the mid-teens, including the impacts of the Erste transaction. FX headwinds in Europe, especially the British pound, are forecasted to impact net revenues by several hundred basis points, resulting in expected reported growth in the high single digits. 
Operating margin in Europe is expected to decline in fiscal 2017, [indiscernible] did integration cost associated with our Erste joint venture and the impacts of foreign currency headwinds. Much of the degradation is anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2017 when we expect to realize a substantial portion of the integration-related expenses and absorb a considerable amount of the foreign currency impacts. 
Asia-Pacific is expected to deliver U.S. dollar net revenue growth in the low double digits. Operating margin is expected to remain relatively consistent in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. 
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 is projected to approach 30%. And our diluted weighted average share count is expected to approach $156 million. We anticipated that we will invest approximately $140 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017.
With the completion of the Heartland merger, our near-term capital allocation priority is to reduce debt and return to our targeted leverage ratio. As such, we expect a majority of our free cash flow in fiscal 2017 to support debt reduction. However, we have sufficient capital available to continue to pursue select acquisitions that augment our strategies like the eWAY partnership we executed in Q4. You should assume we will continue to be a consistent buyer of our stock as a means by which to return capital to shareholders. That said, our outlook for fiscal 2017 does not include any assumptions with respect to future share repurchases. 
As Jeff referenced, we are pleased to announce about our Board of Directors has approved the change in our fiscal year end from May 31 to December 31. Our first fiscal year on a calendar year basis will begin January 1, 2017. As a result, we will report a 7-month fiscal period for the period June 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. We will host our Q1 and Q2 fiscal 2017 earnings call as customary and we'll then transition to calendar quarter reporting beginning with the first quarter of calendar year 2017. With our forthcoming change in fiscal year-end, we're providing an early preview of our outlook for calendar year 2017 to assist with this transition. 
Building off of our constant currency guidance for fiscal 2017, we would preliminary expect constant currency net revenue of approximately $3.375 billion to $3.5 billion for calendar 2017. In addition, we would anticipate cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to be in the range of $3.75 to $4 for calendar 2017. 
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

That fall the buckets that we talked about back in December and April, primarily on the executive side, on the operating side and on the technology side. on The revenue enhancements, as you know, at the time that we announced the transaction, December as well as in April, we talked about 1% to 2% incremental revenue growth over the cycle. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've already had some early wins coming work out of our work with the folks over at Heartland, but we haven't yet included that in our fiscal '17 estimates as we have not included those in the guidance we gave in December and April.

Perhaps, more importantly, however, I think we're very much on track to realize the full run rate synergies that we had targeted with respect to the transaction, the $125 million in fiscal '18 and beyond. So I think from an expense point of view, we feel very good about where we are, have a lot of positive momentum going into fiscal '17 to exceed the expectations we had for the full year. But as I said before, we're very focused on that ultimate run rate number and are well on track to achieve that expectation."

But if you told me a few months ago, we've already closed our first cross boarded deal in Canada, I would have been surprised. Really pleased as to where the sales force are working together. So we are equipping that Heartland sales force to do cross-borders as we speak with an initial focus on Canada, followed by Europe and the U.K. We're also adding in targeted, I would call, the surgical addition to sales folks in white space territories that don't have full coverage, which is outside of the plan and kind of a unique synergy we've run across in the last few months. And maybe as interesting to go back to some of the things we've talked about in earlier calls, we're enabling the technology businesses, the software businesses like TouchNet, the campus solutions business to sell software and Global Payments processing in Canada and Puerto Rico with U.K. and Europe to follow shortly and the same for the commerce businesses around the world and beginning to process of enabling those going forward."

With respect to your second question around interchange, the interchange benefits came into effect in December as we talked about in the U.K. Obviously, the interchange benefit themselves are transitory benefits as they have been in other markets where we've seen such changes over the course of time, including the U.S. back in 2012 and, of course, Spain in 2014. So over the course of time, we do expect the markets to rationalize as pricing benefits. We're seeing in the U.K. what we expect to see and have seen in other markets as it relates to these transitory benefits. Over time they'll get rationalized away and spreads will return to preinterchange reduction levels over 12 to 18 months time frame and I think the U.K.'s very much on that track currently. One element to note with the U.K. is we did see some early adoption of the [indiscernible] rule in Q4 '15. So these reduce some debit interchange, excuse me, in Q4 '15. MasterCard also reduced some credit interchange in fiscal 2015. So we have started to begin to annualize some of the early benefits from SEPA but the largest change obviously came into effect in December of '15."

So I think we've been able to absorb with that degradation and expand margins this year at a level consistent with our cycle guidance on a constant currency basis. So I think when you roll it all together, we obviously are expecting margin expansion in North America. We are expecting a little bit of margin headwind in Europe, as I noted on the prepared remarks, largely as a result of integration cost for the Erste transaction and currency. In Asia, we expect to maintain the significant margin improvement that we achieved in fiscal '16. When you roll that together, Vista, with North America no being almost 70% of the combined business, the margin expansion in North America really drives the total company margin expansion."

I would say the second element that impacted Europe in Q4, as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we started to begin to annualize some of the early benefits from interchange reductions in the U.K., in particular. Last year, MasterCard, in the fourth quarter of '15, lowered credit interchange from on average roughly 100 bps to 80 bps. And Visa changed, debit interchange from [indiscernible] transaction to 20 basis points plus the [indiscernible]. So those early benefits from the SEPA regulation that didn't become effective until December, we began to annualize in Q4 of this year, which created a little bit of headwind. Europe still grew high single digits on a constant currency basis, that's in line with our overall expectation for Europe, so I would say it was quarter Europe was that was very much consistent with our overall expectations."

We are preparing to launch a bundled solution in Spain similar to what we launched in the U.K. earlier in the fall, that's coming in the next few months. So we did make investments to prepare for that market rollout, which we think will be obviously be helpful to accelerate the growth in Spain. So those investments were a little bit of a drag on margin in Q4. But on the grand scheme of things, we really try to target margin expansion for the total company, which once again we achieved this quarter. And we're very pleased with the level of margin expansion that we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016.

We added about $2.8 billion of incremental debt associated with the Heartland transaction [indiscernible] pay a little bit of that off over the course of the year. Our weighted average cost of debt is around 3 75 to 4, so in that ballpark. And then as a reminder, the legacy debt that we had was repriced as well as part of transactions, so there's probably incremental 100 basis points on that. So it's going to be in the same sort of probably 3 50 range for the historical debt. So all in, that gets you to an interest rate expense assumption that's it's going to be in the north of $160 million range for fiscal '17."

We, I think, are looking at our fifth consecutive quarter of growing transactions and volumes in the double digits where we're going well above the rate of market growth and couldn't be more delighted with our partnership with [indiscernible]. And we see nothing but really with tail winds in that market. GDP has remained very solid in of the markets and our execution has been terrific.

For the full fiscal '17 guide, obviously, we're going to see the most FX headwinds in Q1 and Q2, in particular, but primarily, Q1. So still expect growth in Q1 over fiscal '16 and same for Q2. But it will ramp in the back half of the year as we hope currency headwinds will begin to abate, number one. And number two, it's important to recognize that synergies ramp over the course of time as well. So as we're executing on synergies and taking expenses out of the business, the benefits of those actions ramp up over the course of the fiscal year as we roll into the fiscal '18 as well. So those 2 things combine, create an environment where the back half will be a little bit stronger than the first half but the overall expectations for the year, I think, are very, very attractive."

Now we have dollar amounts tied to every one of those activities, but there's obviously execution that needs to be done to realize those synergies. So as we sit here today, we expect to achieve synergies in excess of the original $50 million-ish guide that we provided when we originally announced the deal in fiscal -- or at the end, I'm sorry, of December for fiscal '17. But more importantly, as I said in my comments earlier, we're well on track to meet the overall run rate synergy expectations by at the time we get into fiscal '18 and beyond of $125 million a year. As you know, with synergies, you have realized synergies in particular period but you also measure the run rates of the actions you have taken and how their country but into the overall run rate expectation that we have of $125 million. So I think it's a little early to, I think, try to put more specific numbers around where we think we're going to end up from a synergy point of view, but I want would want to leave you with certainly our perspective, which is we have a high degree of confidence on being able to exit of synergies for fiscal '17 relative to what we originally anticipated in and certainly feel very, very confident in our ability to deliver on the total of run rate synergy that we had the premise in the original transaction economics."

We are delighted with our strong performance in fiscal 2016, highlighting another year of solid execution that generated significant growth across our markets. We also made substantial progress on our strategic objectives, including the successful completion of our merger with Heartland in April, a landmark transaction for Global Payments.
For the year, we delivered net revenue growth of 11%, increased operating margin 50 basis points and grew cash earnings per share 18%. Each of these results exceeded our fiscal 2016 budget expectations as well as the cycle guidance we set forth at our Investor Day last October. We are most proud of our ability to accelerate net revenue growth and maintain a consistent level of operating margin expansion and cash EPS growth versus last fiscal notwithstanding the incremental impacts of foreign currency. We expect continued positive momentum in fiscal 2017 as we expand direct distribution, deliver innovative products globally, leverage our technology and operating environments and prudently deploy capital. And of course, our partnership with Heartland is at the core of this strategy.
We are very pleased with early results at Heartland. Our combined senior management team is in place and has hit the ground running. New sales at Heartland have set internal records over the last 3 months. And we have begun to see the anticipated benefits of revenue enhancements across our businesses. We closed our first global cross-sell in June and jointly closed Heartland's largest-ever new sale when we signed a major U.S. national restaurant customer in May. We are already executing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth by enabling sales of our Heartland Campus Solutions, School Solutions and commerce point-of-sale payment technology globally as we head into fiscal and calendar 2017. Since the closing of the merger on April 22, we have also focused on executing our integration plans, which are critical to the realization of expense synergies. We have successfully completed the first 90-day actions, which consisted of substantial reductions in force, facility closures, vendor rationalization and duplicate expense elimination. We are well down the path toward realizing the expense synergies we outlined for fiscal 2017 and beyond.
And we have not been busy just with Heartland during fiscal 2016. We continue to make progress on the 2 key strategic initiatives to accelerate transformative growth that we described during our Investor Day: international expansion of our OpenEdge integrated solutions business and continued development of our omni-channel solutions offerings. For OpenEdge, we are now live and driving sales of our solutions outside of the United States. We recently signed a contract with one of our largest existing ISVs to deliver integrated solutions to their customers in the United Kingdom. We are also pleased with our progress in Canada, where we now have 30 ISV and VAR partners. We will shortly launch OpenEdge marketing campaigns with both local and U.S.-based partners to further accelerate penetration of our integrated solutions in market. Our omni-channel solutions businesses had another very good year in fiscal 2016. We added over 4,000 new e-commerce customers in the U.K. and Ireland and signed several enterprise e-commerce clients in the U.K. in the fourth quarter based on the strength of our Realex platform. It's scalability, reliability and performance.
We are well positioned to accelerate growth, and we expect to roll out our bundled e-commerce solution in Spain imminently. In addition, we plan to integrate Heartland's e-commerce offering in the United States with our global e-commerce solutions to create best-of-breed omni-channel capabilities before the end of calendar 2016. Furthermore, our acquisition of eWAY also expands the scope of our offerings in the Asia Pacific region, providing us with global reach that is unmatched in our industry.
Now for quarterly highlights.
Our North American businesses again delivered strong results. Our U.S. direct channels generated high single-digit organic revenue growth led by OpenEdge. Canada continued its steady performance in local currency resulting from strong new sales, terrific execution and stable business fundamentals. Our European businesses again generated solid results. We saw double-digit volume and transaction growth in Spain for the fifth consecutive quarter, well in excess of market growth. Outside of Spain, our businesses in the U.K. and Continental Europe performed in line with our expectations.
While we were disappointed with the result of the recent U.K. EU referendum, we have been preparing for that potential outcome for some time. We have contingency plans in place which were executed immediately after the result. We do not expect any material impact on operations or earnings expectations as a consequence. We continue to monitor the impact of the referendum, and we'll take further actions as conditions warrant. It is also worth noting that our U.S. business is now 2/3 of our net revenue post Heartland, with the U.K. now representing single digits of our company's net revenue.
Asia delivered high single-digit organic net revenue growth in local currency. Much like last quarter, we also generated substantial operating margin expansion as we reacted quickly last fall to emerging macro headwinds across our Greater China markets.
Finally, we remain delighted with our Ezidebit business, which reported accelerated revenue growth above 20% on a local currency basis. Our investment in the eWAY partnership in April highlights the confidence we have in our Australian colleagues and our optimism for this market.
Finally, a word about the change to our fiscal year that we announced today. Last July, we began the journey to provide enhanced comparability of our results with our peers. I believe this change will be the final piece of the puzzle to allow our stakeholders to better compare our performance to that of our competitors.
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

And good morning, everyone.Fiscal 2016 was another terrific year for Global Payments and included a number of significant milestones. We executed our largest-ever transaction in our merger with Heartland; successfully raised $4.5 billion t",1463,"Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone.
Fiscal 2016 was another terrific year for Global Payments and included a number of significant milestones. We executed our largest-ever transaction in our merger with Heartland; successfully raised $4.5 billion to finance growth; completed our first stock split in 10 years; and lastly, were added to the S&P 500 index. Importantly, we accomplished all of this while also producing strong financial performance throughout the year.
Total company net revenue for fiscal 2016 was $2.17 billion, reflecting growth of 11% versus fiscal 2015, or 17% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 29.2%. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded 120 basis points. Cash earnings per share increased 18% to $2.98 per share, or 29% on a constant currency basis. For each of these measures, we exceeded our cycle guidance on a stated basis and substantially exceeded it on a constant currency basis.
For the fourth quarter, total company net revenue was $621 million, a 25% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, or 27% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin was 28.1%, an expansion of 40 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 70 basis points. Cash earnings per share grew 14% to $0.73, or 16% on a constant currency basis. Relative to our expectations in April, currency impacted fourth quarter cash earnings per share by roughly $0.01 to $0.02.
Naturally, fourth quarter performance reflects the results of Heartland from April 22, which were in line with the expectations we shared during our April call.
Now for detailed segment highlights for the quarter.
Our North America segment, which now includes Heartland, saw net revenue growth of 36% and operating margin expansion of 30 basis points despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels calculated as if we owned Heartland and the FIS Gaming Business in both this period and in fiscal 2015 was high single digits for the quarter.
Canada once again delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North American net revenue growth by over 100 basis points for the quarter.
As Jeff noted, our European business performed well again this quarter, posting revenue growth of 7% on a constant currency basis. Reported net revenue growth for Europe was 3% due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound in Europe. As a reminder, we also annualized our acquisition of Realex in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. European operating margin was 47.8%, declining from prior year primarily due to investments we are making to further expand our omni-channel solutions business and foreign currency impacts.
Asia net revenue grew 15%, or 19% on a constant currency basis, despite ongoing macroeconomic weakness in our Greater China markets. Organic constant currency revenue growth, adjusting for both the BPI and eWAY transactions, was high single digits for the quarter, accelerating sequentially from our fiscal third quarter.
Once again, we're particularly pleased with the operating margin in Asia Pacific, which expanded by over 400 basis points to 26.3%. This was primarily driven by the continued strong growth in our Ezidebit business as well as the expense management program we implemented in the fall of 2015.
Shortly after closing the Heartland merger, we entered into a $50 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, bringing total share repurchases in the quarter to 711,000 shares for approximately $53 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repurchased a further 638,000 shares for approximately $44 million.
Now turning to our fiscal 2017 outlook.
On a constant currency basis, we expect fiscal 2017 net revenue to range from $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, reflecting growth of 50% to 54% over fiscal 2016. We anticipate foreign currency headwinds will impact net revenue growth by 200 to 300 basis points for the year, resulting in expected reported net revenues of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.
Operating margin is expected to expand by up to 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. After reflecting the anticipated impacts of foreign currency headwinds, we expect reported operating margin to expand by up to 40 basis points. We are particularly pleased with our outlook for operating margin expansion, as we expect to be able to absorb the anticipated margin degradation from Heartland and still expand operating margins on a constant currency basis toward the high end of our cycle guidance.
We expect cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to range from $3.50 to $3.60, reflecting growth of 17% to 21% over fiscal 2016. After giving rise to anticipated foreign currency headwinds, particularly the significant weakness we have seen in the pound resulting from the Brexit referendum, we expect reported cash earnings per share to range from $3.40 to $3.50, reflecting growth of 14% to 17%. We are forecasting the most significant foreign currency impacts in the first 2 quarters of the year. As a result, we expect roughly 47% to 48% of our cash earnings per share to be contributed in the first 2 fiscal quarters and the balance to be realized in the back half of the fiscal year. This is essentially the inverse of fiscal 2016.
With respect to the more detailed assumptions that underlie this outlook, we expect North American net revenues to grow nearly 70% in fiscal 2017, including FX headwind from the Canadian dollar. This growth reflects the addition of Heartland and our expectation that our combined U.S. direct businesses will generate organic growth in the high single digits. Canadian net revenue growth assumptions remain in the low single digits in local currency. We expect to North America operating margin to expand for the year, as we anticipate being able to more than offset the margin impacts of Heartland with operating efficiencies and synergies.
In Europe, we expect net revenue on a constant currency basis to grow in the mid-teens, including the impacts of the Erste transaction. FX headwinds in Europe, especially the British pound, are forecasted to impact net revenues by several hundred basis points, resulting in expected reported growth in the high single digits. Operating margin in Europe is expected to decline in fiscal 2017, partly due to integration costs associated with our Erste joint venture and the impacts of foreign currency headwinds. Much of the degradation is anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2017, when we expect to realize a substantial portion of the integration-related expenses and absorb a considerable amount of the foreign currency impacts.
Asia Pacific is expected to deliver U.S. dollar net revenue growth in the low double digits. Operating margin is expected to remain relatively consistent in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 is projected to approach 30%. And our diluted weighted average share count is expected to approach 156 million. We anticipate that we will invest approximately $140 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017.
With the completion of the Heartland merger, our near-term capital allocation priority is to reduce debt and return to our targeted leverage ratio. As such, we expect a majority of our free cash flow in fiscal 2017 to support debt reduction. However, we have sufficient capital available to continue to pursue select acquisitions that augment our strategies, like the eWAY partnership we executed in Q4. You should also assume we will continue to be a consistent buyer of our stock, as a means by which to return capital to shareholders. That said, our outlook for fiscal 2017 does not include any assumptions with respect to future share repurchases.
As Jeff referenced, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved the change in our fiscal year-end from May 31 to December 31. Our first fiscal year on a calendar year basis will begin January 1, 2017. As a result, we will report a 7-month fiscal period for the period June 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. We will host our Q1 and Q2 Fiscal 2017 Earnings Calls as customary. And we'll then transition to calendar quarter reporting, beginning with the first quarter of calendar year 2017. With our forthcoming change in fiscal year-end, we are providing an early preview of our outlook for calendar year 2017 to assist with this transition.
Building off of our constant currency guidance for fiscal 2017, we would preliminary expect constant currency net revenue of approximately $3.375 billion to $3.5 billion for calendar 2017. In addition, we would anticipate cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to be in the range of $3.75 to $4 for calendar 2017.
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

I'll start, and I'm sure Cameron and David will add to this. First, on the cost synergies side, as I said in the releasee this morning, we're well down the path on where we expect to be on expense synergies, in particular relative to the $50 million that we talked about in fiscal '17. Today, we believe we're running ahead of that target of $50 million for a fiscal 2017 realization. That falls in the buckets that we've talked about back in December and April, primarily on the executive side, on the operating side and on the technology side. On the revenue enhancements, as you know, at the time when we announced the transaction in December, as well as in April, we talked about 1% to 2% incremental revenue growth over the cycle. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've already had some early wins coming off our work, out of our work with the folks over at Heartland, but we haven't yet included that in our fiscal '17 estimates as we did not include those in the guidance we gave in December and April.

Perhaps more importantly, however, I think we're very much on track to realize the full run rate synergies that we had targeted with respect to the transaction, the $125 million in fiscal '18 and beyond. So I think, from an expense point of view, we feel very good about where we are, have a lot of positive momentum going into fiscal '17 to exceed the expectations we had for the full year, but as I said before, we're very focused on that ultimate run rate number and are well on track to achieve that expectation."

Really pleased as to where the sales forces are working together. So we are equipping that Heartland sales force to do cross-border sales as we speak, with an initial focus on Canada, followed by Europe and the U.K. We're also adding in targeted, I would call them the, surgical additions in sales folks in white spaces, white space territories we don't have full coverage, which is outside the plan and have kind of a unique synergy we've run across in the last few months. And maybe as interesting, to go back to some of the things we've talked about in earlier calls, we're enabling the technology businesses, the software businesses like TouchNet, the Campus Solutions business to sell software and Global Payments processings in Canada and Puerto Rico, with U.K. and Europe to follow shortly; and the same for the commerce businesses around the world and beginning the process of enabling those going forward."

As it relates to pricing, there is no assumption in our fiscal '17 guidance for any sort of pricing changes with respect to the Heartland portfolio. So that's a fairly easy one to address. With respect to your second question, around interchange, the interchange benefits came into effect in December, as we've talked about, in the U.K. Obviously, the interchange benefits themselves are transitory benefits, as they have been in other markets where we've seen such changes over the course of time, including the U.S. back in 2012 and of course Spain in 2014. So over the course of time, we do expect the market to rationalize those pricing benefits. We're seeing in the U.K. what we expect to see and have seen in other markets as it relates to these transitory benefits. Over time, they'll get rationalized away and spreads will return to pre-interchange reduction levels over a 12 to 18 months time frame. And I think the U.K. is very much on that track currently. One element to note with the U.K. is we did see some early adoption of the SEPA rules in Q4 '15. So Visa reduced some debit interchange in Q4 '15. MasterCard also reduced some credit interchange in fiscal 2015. So we have started to begin to annualize some of the early benefits from SEPA, but the largest changes obviously came into effect in December of '15."

So I think the constant currency guide that we've provided today is towards the high end of that expectation. I think we're particularly pleased with that, as we said before, because as you know Heartland comes in at a lower margin than Global Payments has operated at historically. So I think we've been able to absorb that degradation and expand margins this year at a level consistent with our cycle guidance on a constant currency basis. So I think, when you roll it all together, we obviously are expecting margin expansion in North America. We are expecting a little bit of margin headwind in Europe, as I noted on the prepared remarks, largely as a result of integration costs for the Erste transaction and currency. In Asia, we expect to maintain the significant margin improvement that we achieved in fiscal '16. When you roll that together, obviously with North America now being almost 70% of the combined business, the margin expansion in North America really drives the total company margin expansion."

If you deconstruct the parts a little bit, our core direct distribution businesses in the U.S., which includes our traditional go-to-market core direct business, OpenEdge, our gaming business, again, still growing high single digits. That's our expectation next year, led obviously by OpenEdge, as Jeff mentioned earlier, which we continue to expect to grow in the mid- to high-teens level. If you look at the Heartland side, again, their direct sales business, we expect to grow high single digits consistent with the trends we've seen in that business. Their integrated businesses, same with ours [ph], are growing double digit. You roll all that together again and you have a business that's very well poised to grow organically in the high single-digit range in fiscal '17 and beyond.

So that's a big chunk of the difference, as a starting point. I would say the second element that impacted Europe in Q4, as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we started to begin to annualize some of the early benefits from interchange reductions in the U.K. in particular. Last year, MasterCard, in the fourth quarter of '15, lowered credit interchange from on average roughly 100 bps to 80 bps. And Visa changed debit interchange from 8p a [ph] transaction to 20 basis points [indiscernible]. So those early benefits from the SEPA regulation that didn't actually become effective until December, we began to annualize in Q4 this year, which created a little bit of headwind.

You can see from our fiscal '17 guide that we're forecasting anywhere maybe $0.10 to $0.15 of currency headwind in fiscal '17 as a result of primarily weakness in the pound stemming from the Brexit referendum in the U.K. So you can sort of extrapolate that further into calendar '17, but sitting here today, on July 28, it's very difficult, I think, with any sort of accuracy to predict what currencies may do in calendar 2017. Frankly, at some point, I hope to annualize these fairly significant headwinds. I sort of view flat as the new up from a currency point of view. So I think, when you get to flat, you can kind of get a sense, from the guide we've given for calendar '17 as the earnings power of the business, that we're able to generate -- notwithstanding the FX headwinds over the past couple of years, but if we can get to normal FX environments, obviously 20% cash earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis is fairly attractive and well ahead of our cycle guidance and well ahead of what I think our peers and other industry participants are able to produce."

We continue to drive that growth in the dentists, the pharmas with things we've talked about. Again, highly competitive. Every deal is competitive in this space, but we win more than our fair share with the integrated solutions we drive. On the Heartland side, you've got the education verticals, the 2: the one for our K-12 and the one for universities. That combination is double digits as well; and the same thing, competitive deals but we're driving and winning more than our share. I think the final piece of this is really the commerce businesses, where we have got new assets, where we're just beginning to pursue restaurant and hospitality.

Our weighted average cost of debt is somewhere around 3.75% to 4%, so in that ballpark.

For the full fiscal '17 guide, obviously we're going to see the most FX headwinds in Q1 and in Q2 in particular but primarily Q1. So still expect good growth in Q1 over fiscal '16 and same for Q2; but it will ramp in the back half of the year as, we hope, currency headwinds will begin to abate, number one. And number two, it's important to recognize that synergies ramp over the course of time as well. So as we're executing on synergies and taking expenses out of the business, the benefits of those actions ramp over the course of the fiscal year as we roll into fiscal '18 as well. So those 2 things combined create an environment where the back half will be a little bit stronger than the first half. But the overall expectations for the year, I think, are very attractive."

So if I think of the $50 million synergy for fiscal '17 layered in that you're making investments basically for the first half of the year, that would imply fairly strong move from investment to benefits in the latter half, which would mathematically seem to carry us to a synergy pace about $125 million. And I think you've partly addressed this in a previous reply with regards to the EPS guidance, but why not just bring up the synergy target at this point if you're already seeing that is the question."

So what I would start with is, when we look at our fiscal '17 expectations, there's a lot of activities that are in progress today. Now we have dollar amounts tied to every one of those activities, but there's obviously execution that needs to be done to realize those synergies. So as we sit here today, we expect to achieve synergies in excess of the original $50 million-ish guide that we provided when we originally announced the deal in fiscal -- or at the end of, I'm sorry, December for fiscal '17. But more importantly, as I said in my comments earlier, we're well on track to meet the overall run rate synergy expectation by the time we get into fiscal '18 and beyond of $125 million a year. As you know, with synergies, you have realized synergies in a particular period, but then you also measure the run rates of the actions you have taken and how they're contributing to the overall run rate expectation that we have of $125 million. So I think it's a little early to, I think, try to put more specific numbers around where we think we're going to get, end up from a synergy point of view, but I would want to leave you with certainly our perspective, which is we have a high degree of confidence on being able to accelerate synergies for fiscal '17 relative to what we originally anticipated and certainly feel very, very confident in our ability to deliver on the total run rate synergy that we had premised in the original transaction economics."

We are delighted with our strong performance in fiscal 2016, highlighting another year of solid execution that generated significant growth across our markets. We also made substantial progress on our strategic objectives, including the successful completion of our merger with Heartland in April, a landmark transaction for Global Payments.
For the year, we delivered net revenue growth of 11%, increased operating margin 50 basis points and grew cash earnings per share 18%. Each of these results exceeded our fiscal 2016 budget expectations as well as the cycle guidance we set forth at our Investor Day last October. We are most proud of our ability to accelerate net revenue growth and maintain a consistent level of operating margin expansion and cash EPS growth versus last fiscal, notwithstanding the incremental impacts of foreign currency. We expect continued positive momentum in fiscal 2017 as we expand direct distribution, deliver innovative products globally, leverage our technology and operating environments and prudently deploy capital. And of course, our partnership with Heartland is at the core of this strategy.
We are very pleased with early results at Heartland. Our combined senior management team is in place and has hit the ground running. New sales at Heartland have set internal records over the last 3 months. And we have begun to see the anticipated benefits of revenue enhancements across our businesses. We closed our first global cross-sell in June and jointly closed Heartland's largest-ever new sale when we signed a major U.S. national restaurant customer in May. We are already executing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth by enabling sales of our Heartland Campus Solutions, School Solutions and commerce point-of-sale payment technology globally as we head into fiscal and calendar 2017. Since the closing of the merger on April 22, we have also focused on executing our integration plans, which are critical to the realization of expense synergies. We have successfully completed the first 90-day actions, which consisted of substantial reductions in force, facility closures, vendor rationalization and duplicate expense elimination. We are well down the path toward realizing the expense synergies we outlined for fiscal 2017 and beyond.
And we have not been busy just with Heartland during fiscal 2016. We continue to make progress on the 2 key strategic initiatives to accelerate transformative growth that we described during our Investor Day: international expansion of our OpenEdge integrated solutions business and continued development of our omni-channel solutions offerings. For OpenEdge, we are now live and driving sales of our solutions outside of the United States. We recently signed a contract with one of our largest existing ISVs to deliver integrated solutions to their customers in the United Kingdom. We are also pleased with our progress in Canada, where we now have 30 ISV and VAR partners. We will shortly launch OpenEdge marketing campaigns with both local and U.S.-based partners to further accelerate penetration of our integrated solutions in market. Our omni-channel solutions businesses had another very good year in fiscal 2016. We added over 4,000 new e-commerce customers in the U.K. and Ireland and signed several enterprise e-commerce clients in the U.K. in the fourth quarter based on the strength of our Realex platform. It's scalability, reliability and performance.
We are well positioned to accelerate growth, and we expect to roll out our bundled e-commerce solution in Spain imminently. In addition, we plan to integrate Heartland's e-commerce offering in the United States with our global e-commerce solutions to create best-of-breed omni-channel capabilities before the end of calendar 2016. Furthermore, our acquisition of eWAY also expands the scope of our offerings in the Asia Pacific region, providing us with global reach that is unmatched in our industry.
Now for quarterly highlights.
Our North American businesses again delivered strong results. Our U.S. direct channels generated high single-digit organic revenue growth led by OpenEdge. Canada continued its steady performance in local currency resulting from strong new sales, terrific execution and stable business fundamentals. Our European businesses again generated solid results. We saw double-digit volume and transaction growth in Spain for the fifth consecutive quarter, well in excess of market growth. Outside of Spain, our businesses in the U.K. and Continental Europe performed in line with our expectations.
While we were disappointed with the result of the recent U.K. EU referendum, we had been preparing for that potential outcome for some time. We had contingency plans in place which were executed immediately after the result. We do not expect any material impact on operations or earnings expectations as a consequence. We continue to monitor the impact of the referendum, and we'll take further actions as conditions warrant. It is also worth noting that our U.S. business is now 2/3 of our net revenue post Heartland, with the U.K. now representing single digits of our company's net revenue.
Asia delivered high single-digit organic net revenue growth in local currency. Much like last quarter, we also generated substantial operating margin expansion as we reacted quickly last fall to emerging macro headwinds across our Greater China markets.
Finally, we remain delighted with our Ezidebit business, which reported accelerated revenue growth above 20% on a local currency basis. Our investment in the eWAY partnership in April highlights the confidence we have in our Australian colleagues and our optimism for this market.
Finally, a word about the change to our fiscal year that we announced today. Last July, we began the journey to provide enhanced comparability of our results with our peers. I believe this change will be the final piece of the puzzle to allow our stakeholders to better compare our performance to that of our competitors.
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

And good morning, everyone.Fiscal 2016 was another terrific year for Global Payments and included a number of significant milestones. We executed our largest-ever transaction in our merger with Heartland; successfully raised $4.5 billion t",1461,"Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone.
Fiscal 2016 was another terrific year for Global Payments and included a number of significant milestones. We executed our largest-ever transaction in our merger with Heartland; successfully raised $4.5 billion to finance growth; completed our first stock split in 10 years; and lastly, were added to the S&P 500 index. Importantly, we accomplished all of this while also producing strong financial performance throughout the year.
Total company net revenue for fiscal 2016 was $2.17 billion, reflecting growth of 11% versus fiscal 2015, or 17% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 29.2%. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded 120 basis points. Cash earnings per share increased 18% to $2.98 per share, or 29% on a constant currency basis. For each of these measures, we exceeded our cycle guidance on a stated basis and substantially exceeded it on a constant currency basis.
For the fourth quarter, total company net revenue was $621 million, a 25% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, or 27% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin was 28.1%, an expansion of 40 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 70 basis points. Cash earnings per share grew 14% to $0.73, or 16% on a constant currency basis. Relative to our expectations in April, currency impacted fourth quarter cash earnings per share by roughly $0.01 to $0.02.
Naturally, fourth quarter performance reflects the results of Heartland from April 22, which were in line with the expectations we shared during our April call.
Now for detailed segment highlights for the quarter.
Our North America segment, which now includes Heartland, saw net revenue growth of 36% and operating margin expansion of 30 basis points despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels calculated as if we owned Heartland and the FIS Gaming Business in both this period and in fiscal 2015 was high single digits for the quarter.
Canada once again delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North American net revenue growth by over 100 basis points for the quarter.
As Jeff noted, our European business performed well again this quarter, posting revenue growth of 7% on a constant currency basis. Reported net revenue growth for Europe was 3% due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound in Europe. As a reminder, we also annualized our acquisition of Realex in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. European operating margin was 47.8%, declining from prior year primarily due to investments we are making to further expand our omni-channel solutions business and foreign currency impacts.
Asia net revenue grew 15%, or 19% on a constant currency basis, despite ongoing macroeconomic weakness in our Greater China markets. Organic constant currency revenue growth, adjusting for both the BPI and eWAY transactions, was high single digits for the quarter, accelerating sequentially from our fiscal third quarter.
Once again, we're particularly pleased with operating margin in Asia Pacific, which expanded by over 400 basis points to 26.3%. This was primarily driven by the continued strong growth in our Ezidebit business as well as the expense management program we implemented in the fall of 2015.
Shortly after closing the Heartland merger, we entered into a $50 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, bringing total share repurchases in the quarter to 711,000 shares for approximately $53 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repurchased a further 638,000 shares for approximately $44 million.
Now turning to our fiscal 2017 outlook.
On a constant currency basis, we expect fiscal 2017 net revenue to range from $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, reflecting growth of 50% to 54% over fiscal 2016. We anticipate foreign currency headwinds will impact net revenue growth by 200 to 300 basis points for the year, resulting in expected reported net revenues of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.
Operating margin is expected to expand by up to 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. After reflecting the anticipated impact of foreign currency headwinds, we expect reported operating margin to expand by up to 40 basis points. We are particularly pleased with our outlook for operating margin expansion, as we expect to be able to absorb the anticipated margin degradation from Heartland and still expand operating margins on a constant currency basis toward the high end of our cycle guidance.
We expect cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to range from $3.50 to $3.60, reflecting growth of 17% to 21% over fiscal 2016. After giving rise to anticipated foreign currency headwinds, particularly the significant weakness we have seen in the pound resulting from the Brexit referendum, we expect reported cash earnings per share to range from $3.40 to $3.50, reflecting growth of 14% to 17%. We are forecasting the most significant foreign currency impact in the first 2 quarters of the year. As a result, we expect roughly 47% to 48% of our cash earnings per share to be contributed in the first 2 fiscal quarters and the balance to be realized in the back half of the fiscal year. This is essentially the inverse of fiscal 2016.
With respect to the more detailed assumptions that underlie this outlook, we expect North American net revenues to grow nearly 70% in fiscal 2017, including FX headwinds from the Canadian dollar. This growth reflects the addition of Heartland and our expectation that our combined U.S. direct businesses will generate organic growth in the high single digits. Canadian net revenue growth assumptions remain in the low single digits in local currency. We expect North America operating margin to expand for the year, as we anticipate being able to more than offset the margin impacts of Heartland with operating efficiencies and synergies.
In Europe, we expect net revenue on a constant currency basis to grow in the mid-teens, including the impact of the Erste transaction. FX headwinds in Europe, especially the British pound, are forecasted to impact net revenues by several hundred basis points, resulting in expected reported growth in the high single digits. Operating margin in Europe is expected to decline in fiscal 2017, largely due to integration costs associated with our Erste joint venture and the impacts of foreign currency headwinds. Much of the degradation is anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2017, when we expect to realize a substantial portion of the integration-related expenses and absorb a considerable amount of the foreign currency impacts.
Asia Pacific is expected to deliver U.S. dollar net revenue growth in the low double digits. Operating margin is expected to remain relatively consistent in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 is projected to approach 30%. And our diluted weighted average share count is expected to approach 156 million. We anticipate that we will invest approximately $140 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017.
With the completion of the Heartland merger, our near-term capital allocation priority is to reduce debt and return to our targeted leverage ratio. As such, we expect a majority of our free cash flow in fiscal 2017 to support debt reduction. However, we have sufficient capital available to continue to pursue select acquisitions that augment our strategies, like the eWAY partnership we executed in Q4. You should also assume we will continue to be a consistent buyer of our stock, as a means by which to return capital to shareholders. That said, our outlook for fiscal 2017 does not include any assumptions with respect to future share repurchases.
As Jeff referenced, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a change in our fiscal year-end from May 31 to December 31. Our first fiscal year on a calendar year basis will begin January 1, 2017. As a result, we will report a 7-month fiscal period for the period June 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. We will host our Q1 and Q2 Fiscal 2017 Earnings Calls as customary and will then transition to calendar quarter reporting beginning with the first quarter of calendar year 2017. With our forthcoming change in fiscal year-end, we are providing an early preview of our outlook for calendar year 2017 to assist with this transition.
Building off of our constant currency guidance for fiscal 2017, we would preliminary expect constant currency net revenue of approximately $3.375 billion to $3.5 billion for calendar 2017. In addition, we would anticipate cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to be in the range of $3.75 to $4 for calendar 2017.
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

That falls in the buckets that we've talked about back in December and April, primarily on the executive side, on the operating side and on the technology side.

Really pleased as to the way the sales forces are working together. So we are equipping that Heartland sales force to do cross-border sales as we speak, with an initial focus on Canada, followed by Europe and the U.K. We're also adding in targeted, I would call them, surgical additions of sales folks in white spaces -- white space territories we don't have full coverage, which is outside the plan and a kind of a unique synergy we've run across in the last few months. And maybe as interesting, to go back to some of the things we've talked about in earlier calls, we're enabling the technology businesses, the software businesses like TouchNet, the Campus Solutions business to sell software and Global Payments processing in Canada and Puerto Rico, with U.K. and Europe to follow shortly; and the same for the commerce businesses around the world and beginning the process of enabling those going forward."

As it relates to pricing, there is no assumption in our fiscal '17 guidance for any sort of pricing changes with respect to the Heartland portfolio. So that's a fairly easy one to address. With respect to your second question, around interchange, the interchange benefits came into effect in December, as we talked about, in the U.K. Obviously, the interchange benefits themselves are transitory benefits, as they have been in other markets where we've seen such changes over the course of time, including the U.S. back in 2012 and of course Spain in 2014. So over the course of time, we do expect the market to rationalize those pricing benefits. We're seeing in the U.K. what we expect to see and have seen in other markets as it relates to these transitory benefits. Over time, they'll get rationalized away and spreads will return to pre-interchange reduction levels over a 12- to 18-month time frame. And I think the U.K. is very much on that track currently. One element to note with the U.K. is we did see some early adoption of the SEPA rules in Q4 '15. So Visa reduced some debit interchange in Q4 '15.

So I think the constant currency guide that we've provided today is towards the high end of that expectation. I think we're particularly pleased with that, as we said before, because as you know Heartland comes in at a lower margin than Global Payments has operated at historically. So I think we've been able to absorb that degradation and expand margins this year at a level consistent with our cycle guidance on a constant currency basis. So I think, when you roll it all together, we obviously are expecting margin expansion in North America. We are expecting a little bit of margin headwind in Europe, as I noted on the prepared remarks, largely as a result of integration costs for the Erste transaction and currency. In Asia, we expect to maintain the significant margin improvement that we achieved in fiscal '16. When you roll that together, obviously with North America now being almost 70% of the combined business, the margin expansion in North America really drives the total company margin expansion."

If you deconstruct the parts a little bit, our core direct distribution businesses in the U.S., which includes our traditional go-to-market core direct business, OpenEdge, our gaming business, again, still growing high single digits. That's our expectation next year, led obviously by OpenEdge, as Jeff mentioned earlier, which we continue to expect to grow in the mid- to high-teens level. If you look at the Heartland side, again, their direct sales business, we expect to grow high single digits consistent with the trends we've seen in that business. Their integrated businesses, similar to ours, are growing double digit. You roll all that together again and you have a business that's very well poised to grow organically in the high single-digit range in fiscal '17 and beyond.

So that's a big chunk of the difference, as a starting point. I would say the second element that impacted Europe in Q4, as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we started to begin to annualize some of the early benefits from interchange reductions in the U.K. in particular. Last year, MasterCard, in the fourth quarter of '15, lowered credit interchange from on average roughly 100 bps to 80 bps. And Visa changed debit interchange from 8p a transaction to 20 basis points plus 1p. So those early benefits from the SEPA regulation that didn't actually become effective until December, we began to annualize in Q4 of this year, which created a little bit of headwind. Europe still grew high single digits on a constant currency basis. That's in line with our overall expectation for Europe, so I would say it was a quarter, Europe-wise, that was very much consistent with our overall expectations."

One is bringing in these new global initiatives, like more e-com business, certainly the fastest-growing part of that market; and certainly with OpenEdge, where we're up to 30 partners. And we're just really beginning to build that sort of purpose-built ecosystem I've talked about before of partners, campaign management and our sales teams to accelerate growth. So early stages, hence you've seen from Cameron very traditional Canadian expectations for now for '17, which I'm expecting our Canadian team to beat this year. And then beyond that, it's the Heartland synergies, so being able to take the products, whether it's education products or the commerce point-of-sale cloud software across border to Canada, and just being able to take the U.S.-based customers and prospects that our Heartland sales force will close in the coming months and quarters and take those and extend those to Canada as well. So we think we've got lots of tools to accelerate Canada now really for the first time in the last 5 years in Global Payments."

We also have OpenEdge, which is a fantastic business; and our vertical gaming and Greater Giving businesses, but we have not had a direct sales force like this. And another hidden benefit of Heartland, they have a true e-commerce solution for the United States as well, great product folks, a great development team, an actual product end-market that's seeing success. In fact, we actually signed a record number of e-commerce customers in Heartland during the June quarter as well. So we're seeing increasing momentum that fuels our confidence both about integration overall and the type of accelerated growth the 2 companies can deliver that Cameron described earlier."

We continue to drive that growth in the dentists, the pharmas, the things we've talked about. Again, highly competitive. Every deal is competitive in this space, but we win more than our fair share with the integrated solutions we drive. On the Heartland side, you've got the education verticals, the 2: the one for K-12 and the one for universities. That combination is double digits as well; and the same thing, competitive deals but we're driving and winning more than our share. I think the final piece of this is really the commerce businesses, where we have got new assets, where we're just beginning to pursue restaurant and hospitality.

We have about $2.8 billion of incremental debt associated with the Heartland transaction. Naturally, we will pay a little bit of that off over the course of the year. Our weighted average cost of debt is somewhere around 3.75% to 4%, so in that ballpark. And then as a reminder, the legacy debt that we had was repriced as well as part of the transaction, so there's probably an incremental 100 basis points on that, so it's going to be in the same sort of probably 3.50% range for the historical debt.

So we're very bullish on our execution in Spain. We, I think, are looking at our fifth consecutive quarter of growing transactions and volumes in the double digits. We're growing well above the rate of market growth and couldn't be more delighted with our partnership with Caixa. And we see nothing but really tailwinds in that market. GDP has remained very solid in the market and our execution has been terrific.

For the full fiscal '17 guide, obviously we're going to see the most FX headwinds in Q1 and in Q2, in particular, but primarily Q1. So still expect good growth in Q1 over fiscal '16 and same for Q2; but it will ramp in the back half of the year as, we hope, currency headwinds will begin to abate, number one. And number two, it's important to recognize that synergies ramp over the course of time as well. So as we're executing on synergies and taking expenses out of the business, the benefits of those actions ramp over the course of the fiscal year as we roll into fiscal '18 as well. So those 2 things, combined, create an environment where the back half will be a little bit stronger than the first half. But the overall expectations for the year, I think, are very attractive."

So as we sit here today, we expect to achieve synergies in excess of the original $50 million-ish guide that we provided when we originally announced the deal in fiscal -- or at the end of, I'm sorry, December for fiscal '17. But more importantly, as I said in my comments earlier, we're well on track to meet the overall run rate synergy expectation by the time we get into fiscal '18 and beyond of $125 million a year. As you know, with synergies, you have realized synergies in a particular period, but then you also measure the run rate of the actions you have taken and how they're contributing to the overall run rate expectation that we have of $125 million. So I think it's a little early to, I think, try to put more specific numbers around where we think we're going to get -- end up from a synergy point of view, but I would want to leave you with certainly our perspective, which is we have a high degree of confidence on being able to accelerate synergies for fiscal '17 relative to what we originally anticipated and certainly feel very, very confident in our ability to deliver on the total run rate synergy that we had premised in the original transaction economics."

We are delighted with our strong performance in fiscal 2016, highlighting another year of solid execution that generated significant growth across our markets. We also made substantial progress on our strategic objectives, including the successful completion of our merger with Heartland in April, a landmark transaction for Global Payments.
For the year, we delivered net revenue growth of 11%, increased operating margin 50 basis points and grew cash earnings per share 18%. Each of these results exceeded our fiscal 2016 budget expectations as well as the cycle guidance we set forth at our Investor Day last October. We are most proud of our ability to accelerate net revenue growth and maintain a consistent level of operating margin expansion and cash EPS growth versus last fiscal, notwithstanding the incremental impacts of foreign currency. We expect continued positive momentum in fiscal 2017 as we expand direct distribution, deliver innovative products globally, leverage our technology and operating environments and prudently deploy capital. And of course, our partnership with Heartland is at the core of this strategy.
We are very pleased with early results at Heartland. Our combined senior management team is in place and has hit the ground running. New sales at Heartland have set internal records over the last 3 months. And we have begun to see the anticipated benefits of revenue enhancements across our businesses. We closed our first global cross-sell in June and jointly closed Heartland's largest-ever new sale when we signed a major U.S. national restaurant customer in May. We are already executing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth by enabling sales of our Heartland Campus Solutions, School Solutions and commerce point-of-sale payment technology globally as we head into fiscal and calendar 2017. Since the closing of the merger on April 22, we have also focused on executing our integration plans, which are critical to the realization of expense synergies. We have successfully completed the first 90-day actions, which consisted of substantial reductions in force, facility closures, vendor rationalization and duplicate expense elimination. We are well down the path toward realizing the expense synergies we outlined for fiscal 2017 and beyond.
And we have not been busy just with Heartland during fiscal 2016. We continue to make progress on the 2 key strategic initiatives to accelerate transformative growth that we described during our Investor Day: international expansion of our OpenEdge integrated solutions business and continued development of our omni-channel solutions offerings. For OpenEdge, we are now live and driving sales of our solutions outside of the United States. We recently signed a contract with one of our largest existing ISVs to deliver integrated solutions to their customers in the United Kingdom. We are also pleased with our progress in Canada, where we now have 30 ISV and VAR partners. We will shortly launch OpenEdge marketing campaigns with both local and U.S.-based partners to further accelerate penetration of our integrated solutions in market. Our omni-channel solutions businesses had another very good year in fiscal 2016. We added over 4,000 new e-commerce customers in the U.K. and Ireland and signed several enterprise e-commerce clients in the U.K. in the fourth quarter based on the strength of our Realex platform. It's scalability, reliability and performance.
We are well positioned to accelerate growth, and we expect to roll out our bundled e-commerce solution in Spain imminently. In addition, we plan to integrate Heartland's e-commerce offering in the United States with our global e-commerce solutions to create best-of-breed omni-channel capabilities before the end of calendar 2016. Furthermore, our acquisition of eWAY also expands the scope of our offerings in the Asia Pacific region, providing us with global reach that is unmatched in our industry.
Now for quarterly highlights.
Our North American businesses again delivered strong results. Our U.S. direct channels generated high single-digit organic revenue growth led by OpenEdge. Canada continued its steady performance in local currency resulting from strong new sales, terrific execution and stable business fundamentals. Our European businesses again generated solid results. We saw double-digit volume and transaction growth in Spain for the fifth consecutive quarter, well in excess of market growth. Outside of Spain, our businesses in the U.K. and Continental Europe performed in line with our expectations.
While we were disappointed with the result of the recent U.K. EU referendum, we had been preparing for that potential outcome for some time. We had contingency plans in place which were executed immediately after the result. We do not expect any material impact on operations or earnings expectations as a consequence. We continue to monitor the impact of the referendum, and we'll take further actions as conditions warrant. It is also worth noting that our U.S. business is now 2/3 of our net revenue post Heartland, with the U.K. now representing single digits of our company's net revenue.
Asia delivered high single-digit organic net revenue growth in local currency. Much like last quarter, we also generated substantial operating margin expansion as we reacted quickly last fall to emerging macro headwinds across our Greater China markets.
Finally, we remain delighted with our Ezidebit business, which reported accelerated revenue growth above 20% on a local currency basis. Our investment in the eWAY partnership in April highlights the confidence we have in our Australian colleagues and our optimism for this market.
Finally, a word about the change to our fiscal year that we announced today. Last July, we began the journey to provide enhanced comparability of our results with our peers. I believe this change will be the final piece of the puzzle to allow our stakeholders to better compare our performance to that of our competitors.
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."
813574,373713810,1017693,"Global Payments Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Global Payments Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone.Fiscal 2016 was another terrific year for Global Payments and included a number of significant milestones. We executed our largest-ever transaction in our merger with Heartland; successfully raised $4.5 billion t",1461,"Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone.
Fiscal 2016 was another terrific year for Global Payments and included a number of significant milestones. We executed our largest-ever transaction in our merger with Heartland; successfully raised $4.5 billion to finance growth; completed our first stock split in 10 years; and lastly, were added to the S&P 500 index. Importantly, we accomplished all of this while also producing strong financial performance throughout the year.
Total company net revenue for fiscal 2016 was $2.17 billion, reflecting growth of 11% versus fiscal 2015, or 17% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 29.2%. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded 120 basis points. Cash earnings per share increased 18% to $2.98 per share, or 29% on a constant currency basis. For each of these measures, we exceeded our cycle guidance on a stated basis and substantially exceeded it on a constant currency basis.
For the fourth quarter, total company net revenue was $621 million, a 25% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, or 27% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin was 28.1%, an expansion of 40 basis points. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 70 basis points. Cash earnings per share grew 14% to $0.73, or 16% on a constant currency basis. Relative to our expectations in April, currency impacted fourth quarter cash earnings per share by roughly $0.01 to $0.02.
Naturally, fourth quarter performance reflects the results of Heartland from April 22, which were in line with the expectations we shared during our April call.
Now for detailed segment highlights for the quarter.
Our North America segment, which now includes Heartland, saw net revenue growth of 36% and operating margin expansion of 30 basis points despite unfavorable currency trends in Canada. On a constant currency basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points. Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct channels calculated as if we owned Heartland and the FIS Gaming Business in both this period and in fiscal 2015 was high single digits for the quarter.
Canada once again delivered solid growth in local currency, in line with expectations. The weak Canadian dollar impacted North American net revenue growth by over 100 basis points for the quarter.
As Jeff noted, our European business performed well again this quarter, posting revenue growth of 7% on a constant currency basis. Reported net revenue growth for Europe was 3% due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound in Europe. As a reminder, we also annualized our acquisition of Realex in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. European operating margin was 47.8%, declining from prior year primarily due to investments we are making to further expand our omni-channel solutions business and foreign currency impacts.
Asia net revenue grew 15%, or 19% on a constant currency basis, despite ongoing macroeconomic weakness in our Greater China markets. Organic constant currency revenue growth, adjusting for both the BPI and eWAY transactions, was high single digits for the quarter, accelerating sequentially from our fiscal third quarter.
Once again, we're particularly pleased with operating margin in Asia Pacific, which expanded by over 400 basis points to 26.3%. This was primarily driven by the continued strong growth in our Ezidebit business as well as the expense management program we implemented in the fall of 2015.
Shortly after closing the Heartland merger, we entered into a $50 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, bringing total share repurchases in the quarter to 711,000 shares for approximately $53 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repurchased a further 638,000 shares for approximately $44 million.
Now turning to our fiscal 2017 outlook.
On a constant currency basis, we expect fiscal 2017 net revenue to range from $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, reflecting growth of 50% to 54% over fiscal 2016. We anticipate foreign currency headwinds will impact net revenue growth by 200 to 300 basis points for the year, resulting in expected reported net revenues of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.
Operating margin is expected to expand by up to 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. After reflecting the anticipated impact of foreign currency headwinds, we expect reported operating margin to expand by up to 40 basis points. We are particularly pleased with our outlook for operating margin expansion, as we expect to be able to absorb the anticipated margin degradation from Heartland and still expand operating margins on a constant currency basis toward the high end of our cycle guidance.
We expect cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to range from $3.50 to $3.60, reflecting growth of 17% to 21% over fiscal 2016. After giving rise to anticipated foreign currency headwinds, particularly the significant weakness we have seen in the pound resulting from the Brexit referendum, we expect reported cash earnings per share to range from $3.40 to $3.50, reflecting growth of 14% to 17%. We are forecasting the most significant foreign currency impact in the first 2 quarters of the year. As a result, we expect roughly 47% to 48% of our cash earnings per share to be contributed in the first 2 fiscal quarters and the balance to be realized in the back half of the fiscal year. This is essentially the inverse of fiscal 2016.
With respect to the more detailed assumptions that underlie this outlook, we expect North American net revenues to grow nearly 70% in fiscal 2017, including FX headwinds from the Canadian dollar. This growth reflects the addition of Heartland and our expectation that our combined U.S. direct businesses will generate organic growth in the high single digits. Canadian net revenue growth assumptions remain in the low single digits in local currency. We expect North America operating margin to expand for the year, as we anticipate being able to more than offset the margin impacts of Heartland with operating efficiencies and synergies.
In Europe, we expect net revenue on a constant currency basis to grow in the mid-teens, including the impact of the Erste transaction. FX headwinds in Europe, especially the British pound, are forecasted to impact net revenues by several hundred basis points, resulting in expected reported growth in the high single digits. Operating margin in Europe is expected to decline in fiscal 2017, largely due to integration costs associated with our Erste joint venture and the impacts of foreign currency headwinds. Much of the degradation is anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2017, when we expect to realize a substantial portion of the integration-related expenses and absorb a considerable amount of the foreign currency impacts.
Asia Pacific is expected to deliver U.S. dollar net revenue growth in the low double digits. Operating margin is expected to remain relatively consistent in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 is projected to approach 30%. And our diluted weighted average share count is expected to approach 156 million. We anticipate that we will invest approximately $140 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017.
With the completion of the Heartland merger, our near-term capital allocation priority is to reduce debt and return to our targeted leverage ratio. As such, we expect a majority of our free cash flow in fiscal 2017 to support debt reduction. However, we have sufficient capital available to continue to pursue select acquisitions that augment our strategies, like the eWAY partnership we executed in Q4. You should also assume we will continue to be a consistent buyer of our stock, as a means by which to return capital to shareholders. That said, our outlook for fiscal 2017 does not include any assumptions with respect to future share repurchases.
As Jeff referenced, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a change in our fiscal year-end from May 31 to December 31. Our first fiscal year on a calendar year basis will begin January 1, 2017. As a result, we will report a 7-month fiscal period for the period June 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. We will host our Q1 and Q2 Fiscal 2017 Earnings Calls as customary and will then transition to calendar quarter reporting beginning with the first quarter of calendar year 2017. With our forthcoming change in fiscal year-end, we are providing an early preview of our outlook for calendar year 2017 to assist with this transition.
Building off of our constant currency guidance for fiscal 2017, we would preliminary expect constant currency net revenue of approximately $3.375 billion to $3.5 billion for calendar 2017. In addition, we would anticipate cash earnings per share on a constant currency basis to be in the range of $3.75 to $4 for calendar 2017.
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

Today, we believe we're running ahead of that target of $50 million for fiscal 2017 realization. That falls in the buckets that we've talked about back in December and April, primarily on the executive side, on the operating side and on the technology side. On the revenue enhancements, as you know, at the time when we announced the transaction in December, as well as in April, we talked about 1% to 2% incremental revenue growth over the cycle. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've already had some early wins coming of our work -- out of our work with the folks over at Heartland, but we haven't yet included that in our fiscal '17 estimates as we did not include those in the guidance we gave in December and April.

Perhaps more importantly, however, I think we're very much on track to realize the full run rate synergies that we had targeted with respect to the transaction, the $125 million in fiscal '18 and beyond. So I think, from an expense point of view, we feel very good about where we are, have a lot of positive momentum going into fiscal '17 to exceed the expectations we had for the full year, but as I said before, we're very focused on that ultimate run rate number and are well on track to achieve that expectation."

Really pleased as to the way the sales forces are working together. So we are equipping that Heartland sales force to do cross-border sales as we speak, with an initial focus on Canada, followed by Europe and the U.K. We're also adding in targeted, I would call them, surgical additions of sales folks in white spaces -- white space territories we don't have full coverage, which is outside the plan and a kind of a unique synergy we've run across in the last few months. And maybe as interesting, to go back to some of the things we've talked about in earlier calls, we're enabling the technology businesses, the software businesses like TouchNet, the Campus Solutions business to sell software and Global Payments processing in Canada and Puerto Rico, with U.K. and Europe to follow shortly; and the same for the commerce businesses around the world and beginning the process of enabling those going forward."

As it relates to pricing, there is no assumption in our fiscal '17 guidance for any sort of pricing changes with respect to the Heartland portfolio. So that's a fairly easy one to address. With respect to your second question, around interchange, the interchange benefits came into effect in December, as we talked about, in the U.K. Obviously, the interchange benefits themselves are transitory benefits, as they have been in other markets where we've seen such changes over the course of time, including the U.S. back in 2012 and of course Spain in 2014. So over the course of time, we do expect the market to rationalize those pricing benefits. We're seeing in the U.K. what we expect to see and have seen in other markets as it relates to these transitory benefits. Over time, they'll get rationalized away and spreads will return to pre-interchange reduction levels over a 12- to 18-month time frame. And I think the U.K. is very much on that track currently. One element to note with the U.K. is we did see some early adoption of the SEPA rules in Q4 '15. So Visa reduced some debit interchange in Q4 '15. MasterCard also reduced some credit interchange in fiscal 2015. So we have started to begin to annualize some of the early benefits from SEPA, but the largest changes obviously came into effect in December of '15."

So I think we've been able to absorb that degradation and expand margins this year at a level consistent with our cycle guidance on a constant currency basis. So I think, when you roll it all together, we obviously are expecting margin expansion in North America. We are expecting a little bit of margin headwind in Europe, as I noted on the prepared remarks, largely as a result of integration costs for the Erste transaction and currency. In Asia, we expect to maintain the significant margin improvement that we achieved in fiscal '16. When you roll that together, obviously with North America now being almost 70% of the combined business, the margin expansion in North America really drives the total company margin expansion."

That's our expectation next year, led obviously by OpenEdge, as Jeff mentioned earlier, which we continue to expect to grow in the mid- to high-teens level. If you look at the Heartland side, again, their direct sales business, we expect to grow high single digits consistent with the trends we've seen in that business. Their integrated businesses, similar to ours, are growing double digit.

First of all, in Q3, it was 15% on a constant currency growth basis. And that included inorganic growth from Realex, which we didn't have this quarter as Realex annualized in the fourth quarter. So that's a big chunk of the difference, as a starting point. I would say the second element that impacted Europe in Q4, as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we started to begin to annualize some of the early benefits from interchange reductions in the U.K. in particular. Last year, MasterCard, in the fourth quarter of '15, lowered credit interchange from on average roughly 100 bps to 80 bps. And Visa changed debit interchange from 8p a transaction to 20 basis points plus 1p. So those early benefits from the SEPA regulation that didn't actually become effective until December, we began to annualize in Q4 of this year, which created a little bit of headwind. Europe still grew high single digits on a constant currency basis. That's in line with our overall expectation for Europe, so I would say it was a quarter, Europe-wise, that was very much consistent with our overall expectations."

Obviously, currency had a fairly significant impact on margins, particularly in Europe. The other item I mentioned in my prepared remarks, again, relates to investments we're making in our e-com omni-channel solutions business in Europe. We're continuing to invest in that platform. We are preparing to launch a bundled solution in Spain similar to what we launched in the U.K. earlier in the fall. That's coming in the next few months, so we did make investments to prepare for that market rollout, which we think will obviously be helpful to accelerating growth in Spain. So those investments were a little bit of a drag on margin in Q4, but in the grand scheme of things, we really try to target margin expansion for the total company, which once again we achieved this quarter. And we're very pleased with the level of margin expansion that we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016, Europe being nearly 50% margin. Our goal is to largely sustain or close to sustain that level of margin and really looking to drive total company margin expansion through North America primarily."

We also have plans in the event that things change further. We also have plans to make additional decisions around our European businesses if that's what's needed. I would say, though, if you back up, that hasn't happened today. So as we said in our commentary, that post Heartland, our U.K. business is single digits as a matter of revenue on -- of our businesses. I think we've shown with what we've done in Asia over the last year that to the extent that there are emerging headwinds, that we'll get ahead of those, as we did in the fall of 2015 in Asia.

Cameron, I think, talked about the eWAY transaction that we consummated in the fourth quarter of '16 driving additional omni-channel and e-commerce activity in Australia and New Zealand. We're looking at a bunch of technology-related businesses in Asia primarily. Obviously, we think we're relatively full up here, post Heartland, in North America. And then as Cameron mentioned, we just closed our Erste JV on June 1, and we think we have a fair amount of work ahead of us to continue that integration over the next period of time. So I think, when you look at opportunities sitting here today, those are likely to be more weighted towards Asia, but of course we're flexible and it depends on what comes available for sale."

Frankly, at some point, I hope to annualize these fairly significant headwinds. I sort of view flat as the new up from a currency point of view. So I think, when you get to flat, you can kind of get a sense, from the guide we've given for calendar '17 as the earnings power of the business that we're able to generate, notwithstanding the FX headwinds over the past couple of years, but if we can get to normal FX environment, obviously 20% cash earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis is fairly attractive and well ahead of our cycle guidance and well ahead of what I think our peers and other industry participants are able to produce."

I think, as a concept, to get to your other point, the idea that there is more volumes going through digital wallets, through 2 partners, like a Visa and a PayPal, is really nothing but good news for our business longer term."

That kind of implies high single-digit accretion year 1, which is pretty attractive from our point of view and obviously an acceleration from what we originally announced on the deal in the December time frame. Obviously, we've seen $0.10 of -- $0.10, maybe plus, of incremental FX headwind. So there's a little bit of noise around FX, but on an apples-to-apples basis, we're kind of looking at fiscal '17 being high single-digit accretion from Heartland, and that's pretty exciting."

Our weighted average cost of debt is somewhere around 3.75% to 4%, so in that ballpark. And then as a reminder, the legacy debt that we had was repriced as well as part of the transaction, so there's probably an incremental 100 basis points on that, so it's going to be in the same sort of probably 3.50% range for the historical debt.

As we get to September and annualize the annualization of the interchange benefit, I know it gets complicated, we would expect revenue growth to trend back to the same level of transaction and volume growth that we're seeing in that market, which is double digits to mid-teens. So we're very bullish on our execution in Spain. We, I think, are looking at our fifth consecutive quarter of growing transactions and volumes in the double digits. We're growing well above the rate of market growth and couldn't be more delighted with our partnership with Caixa. And we see nothing but really tailwinds in that market. GDP has remained very solid in the market and our execution has been terrific. So as we get into fiscal '17 and get past the first quarter, we expect Spain revenue growth to return to that double-digit level. And it's obviously an important driver for our overall expectations for European organic growth in fiscal '17."

One is the quarterly distribution of earnings in fiscal '17 because of the FX headwinds, in particular, are likely to be sort of the inverse of what we saw in fiscal '16. So we expect 47% to 48% of the earnings to be distributed in the first 2 quarters, combined, and the balance 52% to 53% in the back 2 quarters, which to your point will roll into the new calendar year. For the full fiscal '17 guide, obviously we're going to see the most FX headwinds in Q1 and in Q2, in particular, but primarily Q1. So still expect good growth in Q1 over fiscal '16 and same for Q2; but it will ramp in the back half of the year as, we hope, currency headwinds will begin to abate, number one. And number two, it's important to recognize that synergies ramp over the course of time as well. So as we're executing on synergies and taking expenses out of the business, the benefits of those actions ramp over the course of the fiscal year as we roll into fiscal '18 as well. So those 2 things, combined, create an environment where the back half will be a little bit stronger than the first half. But the overall expectations for the year, I think, are very attractive."

But more importantly, as I said in my comments earlier, we're well on track to meet the overall run rate synergy expectation by the time we get into fiscal '18 and beyond of $125 million a year. As you know, with synergies, you have realized synergies in a particular period, but then you also measure the run rate of the actions you have taken and how they're contributing to the overall run rate expectation that we have of $125 million. So I think it's a little early to, I think, try to put more specific numbers around where we think we're going to get -- end up from a synergy point of view, but I would want to leave you with certainly our perspective, which is we have a high degree of confidence on being able to accelerate synergies for fiscal '17 relative to what we originally anticipated and certainly feel very, very confident in our ability to deliver on the total run rate synergy that we had premised in the original transaction economics."

We are delighted to report a strong start to our fiscal 2017 continuing the positive momentum we have seen in our business. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets during the first quarter with particular strength in Heartland, OpenEdge and our United Kingdom and Asia businesses. While delivering these results, we also made substantial progress integrating Heartland and are ahead of our expectations in realizing synergies from the merger. 
For the first quarter, we delivered high single digit organic direct net revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% on a constant-currency basis. We are also particular pleased with our ability to expand operating margin in North America, which includes the addition of Heartland for the full quarter. 
Our North American businesses performed very well in the quarter led by our U.S. direct sales channels, which generated high single digit organic net revenue growth. This was primarily driven by strength in new sales at Heartland and OpenEdge, each of which accelerated sequentially. Further, Heartland achieved an all-time new sales record in August demonstrating continued momentum in that channel. 
In Europe, we generated strong local currency revenue growth in the first quarter, including double-digit growth in our U.K. business, which accelerated from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Spain delivered impressive results and we, again, saw double-digit volume and transaction growth well in excess of the rate of market growth. We also continue to make strides advancing our e-commerce and omni solutions businesses in Europe, and I'm delighted to announce that we are now live with Realex in Spain. 
Our businesses in Continental Europe, including our joint venture with Erste Bank [ph] in central Europe that closed in early June performed in line with our expectations. 
Lastly, Asia's performance in the first quarter was exceptional. We accelerated organic net revenue growth to the low double digits resulting in the highest rate of growth in this market in several quarters. Our traditional Asia markets performed very well and once again, our Ezidebit business contributed meaningful to results in the region with over 20% organic growth this quarter. 
Just 5 months since closing in our partnership with Heartland, we've established our go-to-market strategy across distribution channels and verticals, identified new opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and have began rationalizing corporate support, operating and technology environments. The progress we have made demonstrates our continued relentless focus on execution, which positions us well to achieve synergy targets, and importantly, to drive a number of incremental growth initiatives. 
We are already realizing revenue enhancements through our various distribution channels here in the United States and abroad. In addition to initial cross sales in Canada we discussed in July, we are now sharing sales leads from Heartland with all of our regions around the world. In the U.S., we have combined our traditional direct sales forces and have configured our platforms to be able to sell either Global Payments or Heartland Payment solutions to new customers. We have also enabled both our Campus Solutions and Heartland commerce point-of-sale software products on Global Payments platform in Canada opening up opportunities for both new sales and the migration of existing Heartland software customers to Global Payments. 
Finally, our investment in enhancing our School Solutions technology platform supported record payments volume growth and flawless execution during the peak school enrollment season. Given our extensive planning, focus and strong execution, we are also realizing expense synergies ahead of initial expectations. We have made significant progress in merging corporate functions, consolidating facilities and operating centers and developing our future technology architecture model for key systems across the combined organization. 
As part of this effort, we selected Heartland's Jeffersonville facility as our go forward U.S. operating center and plan to close our Owings Mills facility by early calendar 2017. This allows us to leverage Global Payments worldwide, unified operating environment in the Jeffersonville facility to create a scalable world-class service center to support our global operations. 
Lastly, we are completing  our migration plans to consolidate our technology environments to achieve our future state model, which is critical to achieving our full expense synergy expectations. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

Total company net reven",821,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We reported another quarter of strong financial performance, while also making significant progress on our Heartland integration efforts and executing synergy plans ahead of expectations. 
Total company net revenue for the first quarter was $817 million, a 52% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating margin was 29.5%, or 29.9% on a constant-currency basis consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 for the first quarter, reflecting growth of 9% or 15% on a constant-currency basis. 
Our North America segment grew net revenues by 79% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and operating margin expanded 80 basis points despite the inclusion of Heartland, which has a lower-margin profile relative to Global Payments' historical levels. We are practically pleased with our ability to expand margins in North America as this is the first period that includes Heartland for the full quarter. 
Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct sales channels calculated as if we own Heartland in both this period and in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was high single digits for the quarter. This was primarily driven by our Heartland sales channel, which generated high single digit organic growth and OpenEdge, which produced yet another quarter of mid-teens growth. 
Canada again, delivered solid performance with low single digit growth in local currency consistent with our expectations. The Canadian dollar remained the headwind in the quarter, albeit less severe than we experienced in fiscal 2016. 
Our European business performed very well this quarter delivering 11% net revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. Reported growth for Europe was 2% compared to the prior year due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound which declined nearly 14% year-over-year. Growth in Europe was primarily driven by low double digit net revenue growth in the United Kingdom and the continued expansion of our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions businesses as well as the addition of the Erste joint venture. 
European operating margin of 47.9% declined from the previous year as expected due primarily to integration cost associated with the Erste transaction and foreign currency impacts. As we noted in our July call, we anticipate a significant portion of these integration costs in currency headwinds will be realized in the first half of fiscal 2017. 
As expected, we have yet to see a real impact on our business resulting from the U.K. EU referendum, except, of course, for the devaluation of the pound. In fact, as Jeff noted, our in the U.K. accelerated this quarter despite the outcome of the referendum. We will continue to monitor developments going forward to assess potential implication for our business. 
As Jeff mentioned, Asia-Pacific had an outstanding quarter with 17% net revenue growth and operating margins of 28.4% an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. Growth in Asia was primarily driven by low double-digit organic growth in the region, including Ezidebit as well as the addition of the BPI joint venture and Eway [ph]. 
Excluding Heartland integration cost, we generated free cash flow of approximately $107 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. 
Capital expenditures totaled $38 million for the quarter. In addition, we reduced outstanding debt during the first quarter by $44 million and since the date of our last call, we repurchased an additional 379,000 shares for $28 million. 
Our current share repurchase authorization capacity is $191 million. As a reminder, we continue to expect to use the majority of our free cash flow this year to support debt production. 
As Jeff mentioned, our integration of Heartland is tracking ahead of schedule, and we now expect to realize over $60 million of expense synergies in fiscal 2017 as compared to our prior estimate of over $50 million. We are delighted with the progress we are making and have been able to execute on the planned synergies more quickly than previously assumed further positioning us to achieve our full expected run rate synergies from the merger. 
Given the strong performance in the first quarter, and our updated expectation for synergy realization for the year, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2017. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.55, reflecting growth of 16% to 19% over fiscal 2016. In addition, we now expect operating margin to expand by 50 basis points for the year. 
We continue to expect net revenue to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion or growth of 47% to 52% over fiscal 2016. It is worth noting this outlook reflects our expectation that foreign currencies will be marginally weaker for the remainder of the year relative to our forecast when we guided back in July. 
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

So I would say in the first quarter, the margin declined in Europe were pretty much exactly what we anticipated. And if you look at the 2 primary drivers, one being Erste and our integration efforts specifically around the Erste joint venture and the second being currency, they probably each contributed about a half of the decline in margin that we saw in Europe, that 450 basis points in the first quarter. So about half and half coming from Erste and currency. I think as you worked through the year I would expect that to get progressively little bit better. Some of the FX headwinds will begin to abate as we get into the back half of the year. And as we continue with the integration efforts on Erste, I would expect most of that work to be done in the first few quarters of the year such that by the time to we get to Q4, sitting here today, I would anticipate we'd be back to flat to expanding margins in Europe, which as we talked about in the past with margins nearing 50%, our objective in Europe is really to sustain that level of margin, not really looking to expand those margins for that particular segment."

We're really fortunate in a couple of ways. One is Heartland fits beautifully into our overall strategy of running an operating company, creating leverage, getting on common platforms, and chasing that capital that result in benefits and pouring into products and distribution, that's exactly the calculus we're really running everyday when we think about where to go from here. So I'll give a couple of examples. While the teams are working hard on how we combine platforms, I know we put call centers together and what we do to better serve customers more efficiently, our sales teams and our marketing teams are working on actually driving the top line growth. You can do both at once. For example, we ordered the first Heartland merchant to a global payments platform, that took a fair amount of technology investment, can puts us well ahead of platform migration, makes the platform migration not an emergency as we get to that over the next year or so that allows our Heartland sales force to be that much more productive. They can now sell the entire sphere of product that Global Payments and Heartland have together and the products don't -- perfectly overlap. There are some VAR integration that Heartland doesn't have, Heartland couldn't sell a CyberSource gateway integration, for example, Heartland do not have cash advance product like Global Payments has. All of these things can now be sold by that 1,500-person sales force. We can now sell in Canada and Puerto Rico out of that by enabling the platform, by having our teams work on that while separate teams are working on expense synergies and driving more and more efficiencies out of the infrastructure. So we're spending an awful lot of time in these parallel tracks, planting a lot of seeds, hitting a lot singles on the way to what we expect, which is really going to be accelerating growth above what we think it can be over the next couple of years with these enhanced sales capabilities. Beyond even that, we're making little investments like accelerating sales hirings. Sales reps are up a little bit over where they were when we closed the deal, that's conscious. We're filling in white spaces that weren't covered. That the choice we made Global Payments with the Heartland leadership team, an opportunity to invest a little early in what can become nice calendar '17 sales in areas really underserved by our combined sales force of the date. We're sharing leads, as Jeff said in his comments with Hong Kong, U.K., Canada, that doesn't take anything away from our ability to perform our synergy work and get to our expense synergies at all. In fact, it's just wonderful volume to put at the top of this very efficient engine we run. Heck, we've automated the sales lead sharing process with half [ph] with Canada. And as you might imagine, that's a likely place for a lot of volume to come overtime. So we really feel good the way we're putting selective targeted investment back into the sales model, while being able in parallel to keep driving our synergies and not in any way degrade customer service. So the pieces are working well together right now."

It's going to take some time to scale these as you talk about combining disruption platforms, combining technology environments to efficiently create opportunities across our products and enhance the revenue growth of the combined business credits going to take time to scale back to a point where you're seeing a more meaningful impact from the revenue enhancements actually on our performance.

So very much as Cameron said, we're very much in the mode of planting seeds, things [indiscernible] work now that will bear the fruit '17 to '18 and beyond. In addition to the direct sales synergies I described earlier, we're doing the same thing with Campus Solutions. Our TouchNet software platform, the one that powers Campus Solutions is now integrated with Global Payments, our technology platforms in Canada, that means we can sell net new customers. We can go back and to touch that existing customer base and sell merchants on payment, payments from Global Payments and we're beginning to build a pipeline. That same platform is now certified for Puerto Rico. We're ready to go in Puerto Rico as well. So as you can see again, planting a few more seeds. The same what's been historically called the Heartland commerce, the point-of-sale cloud software solutions. We just certified our retail point-of-sale solutions for Canada, again, for payments in Canada. We have 40 dealers in Canada now with portfolios. We can look to migrate those to our payments. We can obviously sell net new. We're working with target markets then in Europe and Asia to continue expanding that. Lots of really good exciting activity that at this moment is very much at the margin that Cameron directly says, it's deals here and there, it's pipelines building, all with the focus on that 1% to 2% again being at the high end of that range or beating that range over time."

If you think about the cycle guidance that we provided historically, Andrew, the single-digit rate of organic growth, that's obviously what we believe this business can produce over time. With North America now being 75% of the business, if it's not growing near that level it's going to be very difficult for the overall company to grow at that level. So I think it's fair to say that is our goal as we think about our North American business more broadly. That doesn't mean Canada is going to be anything different than what we expected to be, which is a low single grower in local currency, hopefully, Canadian dollar headwinds will abate here at some point. But we do believe as we continue to obviously progress, the combination of Heartland and Global Payments in the U.S. with North America should accelerate towards that level, allowing the overall company to achieve the high single digit rate of organic net revenue growth that we expect to achieve over the cycle."

But actually, coexisting, beautifully, right now. In fact, they're working directly together on our go-to-market strategies, particularly as we think about some of our large competitors in the integrated space that we can chase with these new assets. I remind you that when we look at volume, we look at verticals. Less than 5%, it's really actually less than 3% overlap between OpenEdge and its verticals that it serves and what we get at Heartland commerce that because Heartland commerce is primarily restaurant and hospitality, there's very little restaurant and very will hospitality in the OpenEdge portfolio. That allows us to think about a channel strategy for hospitality that really has us as the ISV working with dealers and working with direct sales to sell the combined software and payment solutions of the go-forward Global Payments. It allows OpenEdge to continue to focusing on what it does best, which is just managing the ecosystem between ISVs and merchants, working the targeted marketing to sales, adding new partners, while still working to actually add new merchants to existing partners. I'd also say OpenEdge still isn't the same position it was a year or after several years of mid-teens growth, really successful growth, we've got lots of opportunity inside the existing partner base. So we've got a nice little wall for like the better metaphor right now, Andrew, between the market served really by commerce and the commerce assets and the markets served by OpenEdge. And as we bring more and more cloud technology to market, we can be more and more thoughtful and surgical with our channel strategies and again, chase some of to big players in hospitality, which we think is a real opportunity for sales growth over time as well."

So certainly, we think one of the important trends in the marketplace is a lower cost of acceptance as well as a good macroeconomic backdrop for those markets. As I think we've said over time, reductions in cost to our merchants are really nothing but good news for our business but those ultimately gets competed away over a period of time. So I think it's good news as their deals go down. The market tends to be efficient over periods of time. So our benefits as time goes on us tends to get compete away, yet the merchants continue to benefit with lower cost of acceptance than they had previously. It's hard to back that out of the underlying economic growth in the markets that we're in. But if you look at our experience, for example, in Spain, which early adopted the interchange reductions, here, we are now 2 years beyond the first adoption of the interchange reductions in our business has grown, as we said in our prepared remarks, probably at 1.5 to 2x the rate of market growth for each of the last 6 quarters. How much of that is attributable to the lower cost of acceptance, the fantastic partner we have in Caixa [ph], in the Spanish markets kind of hard to disaggregate.

So I would say is I really think it's a combination of attacking the white markets with the right people and the right model. So in most of the markets which we compete, United States is a good example, as David deluded to, we're very specific about the markets that we go after and how we do it. So to David's response about, for example, in OpenEdge, an integrated vertical markets, we're selling technology solutions into markets like themselves like dental, veterinary, et cetera that are higher growth in the overall rate of GDP growth in the U.S. economy plus the adoption of electronic commerce. And we're doing it with better technology, better people, better services and ultimately, therefore, better margins. So I think Bob, perhaps a reflection of the  [indiscernible] market that we go about, how we attack them in our point of value differentiation relative to our peers that really is driving the financial rate of growth. I'd also say that there's an element of very good sales focus and execution. If you look at our results in Asia, for example, we get to really lap some of the macroeconomic headwinds that you saw starting in the second quarter of our fiscal last year in Asia, yet business is usual. Asian markets, for us, accelerate their growth, as Cameron and I each noted. In Canada, I just think that's very sales execution, in markets like Singapore and Malaysia and the Philippines with and without our partners at BPI. So the conscious investments we've made, Bob, as a company into markets that are large, diverse and growing with higher rates of vertical market growth and the average and better margin opportunities are really paying dividends, and that's why I think you're seeing in our results. Conversely, we're really not in the large merchants category, for example, in the United States with some of our peers are. And I think a lot of the data, Bob, that you're referring to reflects the large retailer, for example, market which in general is not a market we're perpetually focused at either at legacy Global or at Heartland."

But I think, and we touched a lot of this in the last question that you asked, that I think what you're seeing is the result of a period of investment that we've made in our business over period of time that's really bearing fruit. I think David very nicely described the investments we've made in sales, in Heartland and in legacy Global Payments that really resulting in dividends not just in the United States but around the world, the investments we've made in our technology environment since fiscal '12 and fiscal '13 are really bearing fruit. So from that point of view, I think we're differentiated in terms of where we place chips on the table. In terms of what we're worried about, I think it all starts with, for us, in our peers in the industry, what is the macroeconomic environment look like, most of us are GDP-plus derivative type businesses and therefore it's important that we operate in healthy economic environments. For example, we talked about much of fiscal '16 in Asia where for a number of quarters, the latter 3 quarters in fiscal '16, we've had a headwind in Greater China. I think we've been able to show throughout fiscal '16 and our results now in '17, our guidance show that we're able to take whatever actions we need to take quickly to preserve  margin and to reposition our business quickly. So there's no doubt, at the end of the day, that a healthy economy is an important driver globally of our results. So I think it's important in terms of what we worry about a health economic environment for us globally to see the growth those businesses. We also need to make the right decisions about technology investments, which is where I started. Many of the things that we invested now, we will see returns in 12, 18, 24 months from now. It's important to get those things right. So in terms of what we worry about, we worry about putting the wrong chips in the wrong place in the table such that we've made investment hadn't born fruit. Happily that's not the case. But we worry a lot is the strategy about whether it's the right investment to make today to returns in the future."

And obviously, in our industry you're always worried about security. We do believe that the combination of EMV [ph] encryption tokenization is great for overall healthy industry overall.

Our bogey in most of the markets that we're in is where are Visa and MasterCard are growing transactionally, that's one way of getting a rate of market growth. For those markets that we're in, we're not in every sub-vertical market that Visa and MasterCard are in but where it's relevant for us what's the rate of the transaction of growth, number one. Number two, what is GDP growing in those markets plus 200 to 300 basis points of increment reflecting the transition from paper to electronic means. So if you just fill that and there's obviously a lot of market that we're in, we're in 30 countries physically today around the world, would you say, in general, across all of our markets, the bogey is around 5% market rate of growth, some are higher or some are lower. But in general, it's around 5% rate of growth. If you look at our cycle guidance, which we talked about again this morning, we target high single digit organic rate of revenue growth plus margin expansion, et cetera. So the way about it Dan is if we're targeting high single digits, if the rate of market growth is 5%, and we talked about this last year or last October in our Investor Day, we certainly think that we're capturing share in the aggregate. Now some of that is because we're in better markets, some of that is because we think we have a good differentiated sales force, some of that is because we think have steady operating environment, et cetera, but nonetheless, the math is the math. And I would say that in most of the markets around the world, we do think that we're capturing share. If you look at United States, for example, in our OpenEdge business, which Cameron and David just described, mid-teens growth is probably 3x the rate of mid-single digit market rate growth, more broadly speaking transactionally in the United States. Now we're not filling people growing at that rate at the end of the day, so I don't think it's just us. But certainly, I think traditional channels that we refer to as more relationship driven are not growing at mid-teens. And I certainly think it's fair to say that their market share gains in the technology enabled distribution area, whether it's Heartland commerce or whether it's OpenEdge relative to the more traditional, for example, financial institutional channel, where you see rates of growth that tend to be less than the market claw around low single digits. So I think it's been a conscious effort if you think about that the market is in each market that we're in, what the bogeys are, how are we going to invest in growth rates that are north of the market. It's for a lot of reasons, but at the end of the day it comes down to smart investment that take share."

Don't know that I would expect that every single quarter but certainly, we think we're in a place and have started to lap certainly as we get into Q2 and Q3 some of the macro headwinds in the Greater China market, that Jeff described earlier. I think we feel great about the overall prospects to be able to achieve low double-digit growth in Asia overall for the year, including high single to low double organic growth."

There really isn't anything specific to call out. We've got terrific productivity. As I said earlier, reps are up a little bit but it's only really at the margin and the productivity coming with the additional reps is where we want it to be. So it's not just a volume thing or something on those lines in terms of just more reps to create more sales. The quality of sales is good, the retention is very good right now. I think that on the pure payments basis, EMV is not driving these sales. I realize that's a popular topic of conversation but it has more to participants industry overall rather than us directly us as a payment technology provider. So I think we're very happy with the pieces. I would tell you that the combination of being able to sell other products in addition to payments does make for better, stronger sales and more sales. So selling payroll, selling some of the other products, selling our ACH [ph] base products for online customers, obviously enhances the payment sales as well. But I really -- I don't have a single thing at which to point the engines working well, the leadership is in place and the machining and tooling underlies managing this  1,500 person complex sales force is working well."

That wasn't our expectation for organic revenue growth, goes right around 20%. As we sit today, they've now exceeded it for a number of quarters so j.what I would tell you is we have a fantastic management team in place in Australia and New Zealand. They have essentially taken an integrated model, which is what Ezidebit is, think of it as OpenEdge based in Australia and New Zealand and certainly relative to one of the last questions, are doing nothing but capturing share in that marketplace environment. So if you are probably look at the rate for our organic transitional growth for Visa and MasterCard and their peers in Australia and New Zealand, it would not be anywhere near 20%. So clearly, Ezidebit has very good model and a very good team and they're doing all the right things. We also did spend a lot of time talking about it because it's not organic with the integration of eway [ph] which is something we announced in April has also gone very well. I think it shows, which has 25% the online market in Australia and Zealand.

So I think we remain cautious probably as it relates the pound specifically, practically in light of business relative to the overall size of Global Payments. The unfortunate reality is a lot of other currencies tend to be trading in sympathy in the pound as well. So we've seen weakness, albeit maybe not as severe as we've seen in the pound. We've seen general weakness across the board in most of the major currencies to which we have exposure. So I do think it would end up being almost an additional full point for the full year, particularly in light of my view and I think our view, that when you get to December, I think we expect the Fed to raise I think in a rising rate environment rate here in the U.S. it's going to continue to put pressure on the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar, which causes us again to bake in a little more FX headwind into our forecast for the remainder of the year."

We are delighted to report a strong start to our fiscal 2017, continuing the positive momentum we have seen in our business. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets during the first quarter, with particular strength in Heartland, OpenEdge and our United Kingdom and Asia businesses. While delivering these results, we also made substantial progress integrating Heartland and are ahead of our expectations in realizing synergies from the merger. 
For the first quarter, we delivered high single-digit organic direct net revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% on a constant currency basis. We are also particularly pleased with our ability to expand operating margin in North America, which includes the addition of Heartland for the full quarter. 
Our North American businesses performed very well in the quarter, led by our U.S. direct sales channels, which generated high single-digit organic net revenue growth. This was primarily driven by strength in new sales at Heartland and OpenEdge, each of which accelerated sequentially. Further, Heartland achieved an all-time new sales record in August, demonstrating continued momentum in that channel. 
In Europe, we generated strong local-currency revenue growth in the first quarter, including double-digit growth in our U.K. business, which accelerated from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Spain delivered impressive results, and we again saw a double-digit volume and transaction growth well in excess of the rate of market growth. We also continue to make strides advancing our e-commerce and omnisolutions businesses in Europe. And I am delighted to announce that we are now live with Realex in Spain. 
Our businesses in Continental Europe, including our joint venture with Erste Bank in Central Europe that closed in early June, performed in line with our expectations. 
Lastly, Asia's performance in the first quarter was exceptional. We accelerated organic net revenue growth to the low double digits, resulting in the highest rate of growth in this market in several quarters. Our traditional Asia markets performed very well, and once again, our Ezidebit business contributed meaningfully to results in the region, with over 20% organic growth this quarter. 
Just 5 months since closing on our partnership with Heartland, we have established our go-to-market strategy across distribution channels and verticals, identified new opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and have begun rationalizing corporate support, operating and technology environments. The progress we have made demonstrates our continued relentless focus on execution, which positions us well to achieve synergy targets and, importantly, to drive a number of incremental growth initiatives. 
We are already realizing revenue enhancements through our various distribution channels here in the United States and abroad. In addition to initial cross-sales in Canada we discussed in July, we are now sharing sales leads from Heartland with all of our regions around the world. 
In the U.S., we have combined our traditional direct sales forces and have configured our platforms to be able to sell either Global Payments or Heartland Payment solutions to new customers. We have also enabled both our Campus Solutions and Heartland Commerce point-of-sale software products on Global Payments platforms in Canada, opening up opportunities for both new sales and the migration of existing Heartland software customers to Global Payments. 
Finally, our investment in enhancing our School Solutions technology platform supported record payments volume growth and flawless execution during the peak school enrollment season. 
Given our extensive planning, focus and strong execution, we are also realizing expense synergies ahead of initial expectations. We have made significant progress in merging corporate functions, consolidating facilities and operating centers and developing our future-state technology architecture model for key systems across the combined organization. 
As part of this effort, we selected Heartland's Jeffersonville facility as our go-forward U.S. operating center and plan to close our Owings Mills facility by early calendar 2017. This allows us to leverage Global Payments' worldwide unified operating environment in the Jeffersonville facility to create a scalable world-class service center to support our global operations. 
Lastly, we are completing migration plans to consolidate our technology environments to achieve our future-state model, which is critical to achieving our full expense synergy expectations. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

We reported another quarter of strong financial performance while also making significant progress on our Heartland integration efforts and executing synergy plans ahead of expectations. Total company net revenu",823,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We reported another quarter of strong financial performance while also making significant progress on our Heartland integration efforts and executing synergy plans ahead of expectations. 
Total company net revenue for the first quarter was $817 million, a 52% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating margin was 29.5% or 29.9% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 for the first quarter, reflecting growth of 9% or 15% on a constant currency basis. 
Our North America segment grew net revenues by 79% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And operating margin expanded 80 basis points despite the inclusion of Heartland, which has a lower-margin profile relative to Global Payments' historical levels. We are particularly pleased with our ability to expand margins in North America as this is the first period that includes Heartland for the full quarter. 
Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct sales channels, calculated as if we owned Heartland in both this period and in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, was high single digits for the quarter. This was primarily driven by our Heartland sales channel, which generated high single-digit organic growth, and OpenEdge, which produced yet another quarter of midteens growth. 
Canada again delivered solid performance, with low single-digit growth in local currency, consistent with our expectations. The Canadian dollar remained a headwind in the quarter, albeit less severe than we experienced in fiscal 2016. 
Our European business performed very well this quarter, delivering 11% net revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Reported growth for Europe was 2% compared to the prior year due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound which declined nearly 14% year-over-year. Growth in Europe was primarily driven by low double-digit net revenue growth in the United Kingdom and the continued expansion of our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions businesses as well as the addition of the Erste joint venture. 
European operating margin of 47.9% declined from the previous year as expected due primarily to integration costs associated with the Erste transaction and foreign currency impacts. As we noted in our July call, we anticipate a significant portion of these integration costs and currency headwinds will be realized in the first half of fiscal 2017. 
As expected, we have yet to see any real impact on our business resulting from the U.K. EU referendum, except, of course, for the devaluation of the pound. In fact, as Jeff noted, our business in the U.K. accelerated this quarter despite the outcome of the referendum. We will continue to monitor developments going forward to assess potential implication for our business. 
As Jeff mentioned, Asia Pacific had an outstanding quarter, with 17% net revenue growth and operating margins of 28.4%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. Growth in Asia was primarily driven by low double-digit organic growth in the region, including Ezidebit as well as the addition of the BPI joint venture and eWAY. 
Excluding Heartland integration costs, we generated free cash flow of approximately $107 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. 
Capital expenditures totaled $38 million for the quarter. In addition, we reduced outstanding debt during the first quarter by $44 million, and since the date of our last call, we repurchased an additional 379,000 shares for $28 million. Our current share repurchase authorization capacity is $191 million. As a reminder, we continue to expect to use a majority of our free cash flow this year to support debt reduction. 
As Jeff mentioned, our integration of Heartland is tracking ahead of schedule, and we now expect to realize over $60 million of expense synergies in fiscal 2017 as compared to our prior estimate of over $50 million. We are delighted with the progress we are making and have been able to execute on planned synergies more quickly than previously assumed, further positioning us to achieve our full expected run rate synergies from the merger. 
Given the strong performance in the first quarter and our updated expectation for synergy realization for the year, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2017. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.55, reflecting growth of 16% to 19% over fiscal 2016. In addition, we now expect operating margin to expand by up to 50 basis points for the year. 
We continue to expect net revenue to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion or growth of 47% to 52% over fiscal 2016. It is worth noting this outlook reflects our expectation that foreign currencies will be marginally weaker for the remainder of the year relative to our forecast when we guided back in July. 
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

So I would say in the first quarter, the margin declines in Europe were pretty much exactly what we anticipated. And if you look at the 2 primary drivers, one being Erste and our integration efforts specifically around the Erste joint venture and the second being currency, they probably each contributed about 1/2 of the decline in margin that we saw in Europe, that 450 basis points in the first quarter. So about half and half coming from Erste and currency. I think as you work through the year, I would expect that to get progressively a little bit better. Some of the FX headwinds will begin to abate as we get into the back half of the year. And as we continue with the integration efforts on Erste, I would expect most of that work to be done in the first few quarters of the year such that by the time we get to Q4, sitting here today, I would anticipate we'd be back to flat to expanding margins in Europe, which, as we talked about in the past, with margins nearing 50%, our objective in Europe is really to sustain that level of margin, not really looking to expand those margins for that particular segment."

I think you're asking about the revenue guide and why the revenue guide perhaps wasn't increased in the quarter. I think inherently, you can think of it as an increase because we are now forecasting more FX headwind than we were when we guided in July. So I think you can essentially look at it as an implicit increase. We're absorbing more FX headwind on the top line yet maintaining that overall revenue guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. We did obviously increase our expectation around margin expansion for the full year as well, which is driving obviously the increase in earnings per share guidance we're going through as well. So I think we do see obviously revenue tracking ahead of what we would have anticipated, but we're also currently forecasting more FX headwind than we were back in July, is the short answer."

As we talked about on the call, we've already combined our direct sales forces in the U.S. market, so where do I attribute that growth that's being driven by the combination of our direct sales forces, we combined our traditional direct book with Heartland's direct book. So it's a little difficult to say specifically what Heartland drove in the quarter versus what Global Payments drove. We did, however, achieve the overall expectation we have for the business, which is growing our U.S. direct sales channels in that high single-digit range, which we are obviously very pleased with, while also continuing to make progress on progressing some of the revenue enhancements and revenue synergies that we expect to achieve over time."

I'd also say in terms of the health of the merchant base at Heartland that their attrition is running low relative to their own expectations and our expectations going into the deal as well. So as Cameron mentioned in his remarks, our ability to accelerate their growth, minimize any merchant or sales rep disruption while taking the expense actions that we've taken on a combined basis, is something that we're particularly pleased about, by way of background."

It's one we talk about all the time here, the sort of the balance of sales productivity, product investment, synergies. We're really fortunate in a couple of ways. One is Heartland fits beautifully into our overall strategy of running an operating company, right, creating leverage, getting on common platforms and chasing that capital that results in benefit and pouring it into product and distribution. That's exactly the calculus we're really running every day when we think about where to go from here. So I'll give you a couple of examples. While the teams are working hard on how we combine platforms and how we put call centers together and what we do to better serve customers more efficiently, our sales teams and our marketing teams are working on actually driving the top line growth. You can do both at once. For example, we boarded the first Heartland merchant to a Global Payments platform. That took a fair amount of technology investment, make -- can put us well ahead of having to do platform migrations, makes the platform migration not an emergency as we get to that over the next year or so, that allows our Heartland sales force to be that much more productive. They can now sell the entire sphere of products that Global Payments and Heartland have together, and the products don't -- they perfectly overlap. There is a VAR integration that Heartland doesn't have. Heartland couldn't sell a CyberSource gateway integration, for example. Heartland did not have a cash advance product like Global Payments has. All these things can now be sold by that 1,500-person sales force. We can now sell in Canada and Puerto Rico out of that by enabling the platform, by having our teams work on that while separate teams are working on expense synergies and driving more and more efficiencies out of the infrastructure. So we're spending an awful lot of time in these parallel tracks, planting a lot of seeds, hitting a lot of singles on the way to what we expect, which is really going to be accelerating growth above what we think it can be over the next couple of years with these enhanced sales capabilities. Beyond even that, we're making little investments like accelerating sales hiring. Sales reps are up a little bit over where they were when we closed the deal. That's conscious. We're filling in white spaces that weren't covered. That's a choice we made, Global Payments with the Heartland sales leadership team, an opportunity to invest a little early in what can become nice calendar '17 sales in areas really underserved by our combined sales forces to date. We're sharing leads, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, with Hong Kong, U.K., Canada. That doesn't take anything away from our ability to perform our synergy work and get to our expense synergies at all. In fact, it's just wonderful volume to put at the top of this very efficient engine we run. Heck, we've automated the sales lead sharing process with Canada. And as you might imagine, that's a likely place for a lot of volume to come over time. So we really feel good about the way we're putting selective targeted investment back into the sales model while being able in parallel to keep driving our synergies and not in any way degrade customer service. So the pieces are working well together right now."

I think David gave a very wholesome answer as it relates to qualitatively what we've been doing to drive revenue enhancements across our U.S. businesses. The thing that I would add is, sitting here today, it's important to note that the revenue enhancements we've achieved thus far, they're helpful on the margin, but they're not significant enough to really move the needle as of yet. David talked about continuing to invest in these opportunities such that over time, we expect to be able to realize the 1% to 2% incremental revenue growth target that we provided when we announced the deal, generated from revenue enhancements, so $30 million to $60 million or so. It's going to take some time to scale these. So you talk about combining distribution platforms, combining technology environments to efficiently create opportunities across all products and enhance the revenue growth of the combined business. It's going to take time to scale that to a point where you're seeing a more meaningful impact from the revenue enhancements actually on our performance.

When we think, Steven, about how to go at the synergies, certainly my expectation as you get out to the time frame Cameron was talking about is -- will be the high end of those, and we're certainly shooting to beat that rate. In addition to the direct sales synergies, the real strategy we think about, Heartland combined with Global Payments, is going to all the way across all of the Heartland global assets, figuring out how to combine the best of both and then globalize everything. So very much as Cameron said, we're very much in the mode of planting seeds, doing some spadework now that will bear the fruit '17 to '18 and beyond. In addition to the direct sales synergies I described earlier, we're doing the same thing with Campus Solutions. Our TouchNet software platform, the one that powers Campus Solutions, is now integrated with Global Payments, our technology platforms in Canada. That means we can sell net new customers. We can go back into TouchNet's existing customer base and sell merchants on payment -- payments from Global Payments, and we're beginning to build that pipeline. That same platform is now certified for Puerto Rico. We're ready to go in Puerto Rico as well. So you can see again, planting a few more seeds. The same with what's been historically called Heartland commerce, the point-of-sale cloud software solutions. We just certified our retail point-of-sale solution for Canada, again, for payments in Canada. We have 40 dealers in Canada now with portfolios. We can look to migrate those to our payments. We can obviously sell net new. We're working with target markets then in Europe and Asia to continue expanding that. Lots of really good, exciting activity that at this moment is very much at the margin. As Cameron quite directly said, it's deals here and there, it's pipelines building, all with a focus on that 1% to 2% and, again, being at the high end of that range or beating that range over time."

That doesn't mean Canada is going to be anything different than what we expect it to be, which is a low single-digit grower in local currency. Hopefully, Canadian dollar headwinds will abate here at some point.

I'll take the first pass at this. They're actually coexisting beautifully right now. In fact, they're working directly together on our go-to-market strategies particularly as we think about some of our large competitors in the integrated space that we can chase with these new assets. I'd remind you that when we look at volume, we look at verticals. Less than 5% -- it's really actually less than 3% overlap between OpenEdge and its verticals that it serves and what we get in Heartland commerce. That's because Heartland commerce is primarily restaurant and hospitality. There's very little restaurant and very little hospitality in the OpenEdge portfolio. That allows us to think about a channel strategy for hospitality that really has us as the ISV working with dealers and working with direct sales to sell the combined software and payment solutions of the go-forward Global Payments. It allows OpenEdge to continue focusing on what it does best, which is managing that ecosystem between the ISVs and merchants, working on the targeted marketing with sales, adding new partners while still working to actually add new merchants to existing partners. I'd also say OpenEdge still is in the same position it was a year ago after several years of mid-teens growth, really successful growth. We've got lots of opportunity inside the existing partner base. So we've got a nice little wall, for lack of a better metaphor right now, Andrew, between the markets served really by commerce and the commerce assets and the markets served by OpenEdge. And as we bring more and more cloud technology to market, we can be more and more thoughtful and surgical with our channel strategies and, again, chase some of the big players in hospitality, which we think is a real opportunity for sales growth over time as well."

The $3.75 to $4 on a constant currency basis relative to fiscal '16 was really designed to help you guys and the market in general with the transition to a new calendar year. But we're not specifically updating that today. We are naturally updating our fiscal '17 guide, as you correctly stated, raising that from $3.25 to $3.50 to our current $3.45 to $3.55. So I think that obviously suggests very good momentum as we're going into calendar '17, and you can draw your own conclusion from that. I think the one, obviously, item that we continue to grapple with is FX headwind. And as I suggested on the call today, we believe, even in that guide, in that raised guide on cash earnings per share -- excuse me, adjusted earnings per share, that we're going to be absorbing more FX headwind in those results. So as we get to calendar '17, early calendar '17, we'll provide a guide for calendar '17 that obviously reflects our expectation for the business as well as what we think the obviously FX impacts will be for the calendar period."

So as we said in our remarks this morning, our European businesses and, in particular, our U.K. business has performed exceptionally well during the quarter. So certainly, we think one of the important trends in the marketplace is a lower cost of acceptance as well as a good macroeconomic backdrop for those markets. As I think we've said over time, reductions in costs to our merchants are really nothing but good news for our business, but those ultimately get competed away over a period of time. So I think it's good news. As their bills go down, the market tends to be efficient over a period of time. So our benefit as time goes on us tends to get competed away, yet the merchants continue to benefit with lower cost of acceptance than they had had previously. It's hard to back that out of the underlying economic growth in the markets that we're in. But if you look at our experience, for example, in Spain, which early-adopted the interchange reductions, here we are now 2 years beyond the first adoption of the interchange reductions, and our business has grown, as we've said in our prepared remarks, probably at 1.5 to 2x the rate of market growth for each of the last 6 quarters. How much of that is attributable to the lower cost of acceptance, the fantastic partner we have in Caixa in the Spanish market is kind of hard to disaggregate, but I think there's no doubt, David, that around the world, lower cost of acceptance for our customers is really nothing but a good thing."

So as we've said in our remarks this morning, we're very pleased with the initial progress in our Erste joint venture, which encompasses a number of countries in Continental Europe. I do believe that part of the rationale on behalf of Erste Bank for considering a joint venture was the change in competitive and technology dynamics in the markets in which they're in, in Continental Europe. So we certainly continue to pursue other venture partners in Europe. I think that the number of technological- and market-based changes that you're seeing going around Europe today do nothing but help our ability to create value for our partners. I think they've been -- we've been able to show for a very long period of time in many markets how we've been able to create very good returns for our shareholders and our partners.

So what I would say is I really think it's a combination of attacking the right markets with the right people and the right model. So in most of the markets which we compete, the United States is a good example, as David alluded to, we're very specific about the markets that we go after and how we do it. So to David's response about, for example, in OpenEdge and integrated vertical markets, we're selling technology solutions into markets that themselves, like dental, veterinary, et cetera, that are higher growth than the overall rate of GDP growth in the U.S. economy plus the adoption of electronic commerce. And we're doing it with better technology, better people, better services and, ultimately, therefore, better margins. So I think, Bob, it's perhaps a reflection of the way we go about the markets that we go about, how we attack them and our point of value differentiation relative to our peers that really is driving the incremental rate of growth. I'd also say that there's an element of very good sales focus and execution. If you look at our results in Asia, for example, we get to really lap some of the macroeconomic headwinds that you saw starting in the second quarter of our fiscal last year in Asia, yet business as usual. Asian markets for us accelerated their growth, as Cameron and I each noted. In Canada, I just think that's very sales execution, in markets like Singapore and Malaysia and the Philippines with and without our partners at BPI. So the conscious investments we've made, Bob, as a company into markets that are large, diverse and growing with higher rates of vertical market growth than the average and better margin opportunities are really paying dividends. And that's why I think you're seeing in our results. Conversely, we're really not in the large merchant category, for example, in the United States that some of our peers are, and I think a lot of the data, Bob, that you're referring to reflects the large retailer, for example, market, which in general is not a market we're particularly focused at either at legacy Global or at Heartland."

So I'll start and ask David and Cameron to join in as well. But I think -- and we touched a lot of this in the last question that you asked, but I think what you're seeing is the result of a period of investment that we've made in our business over a period of time that's really bearing fruit. I think David very nicely described the investments we made in sales in Heartland and in legacy Global Payments. They're really resulting in dividends not just in the United States but around the world. The investments we've made in our technology environment since fiscal '12 and fiscal '13 are really bearing fruit. So from that point of view, I think we're differentiated there in terms of where we place chips on the table. In terms of what we're worried about, I think it all starts with, for us and our peers in the industry, what does the macroeconomic environment look like. Most of us are GDP plus derivative-type businesses, and, therefore, it's important that we operate in healthy economic environments. For example, we talked about much of fiscal '16 in Asia where, for a number of quarters, the latter 3 quarters in fiscal '16, we had a headwind in Greater China. I think we've been able to show -- throughout fiscal '16 and our results now in '17, our guidance show that we're able to take whatever actions we need to take quickly to preserve  margin and to reposition our business quickly. But there's no doubt at the end of the day that a healthy economy is an important driver globally of our results. So I think it's important in terms of what we worry about that a healthy economic environment for us globally to begin to see -- to grow those businesses. We also need to make the right decisions around technology investments, which is where I started. Many of the things that we invest in now, we will see returns in 12, 18, 24 months from now. It's important to get those things right. So in terms of what we worry about, we worry about we putting the wrong chips in the wrong place in the table such that we've made investments that hadn't borne fruit. Happily, that's not been the case. What we worry a lot is does strategy matter about whether it's the right investment to make today for returns in the future?"

But we're thinking about those as the right way to think about servicing customers, allowing them to take care and to like their consumers at the point of interaction, at the point of sale. And obviously, in our industry, you're always worried about security. We do believe that the combination of EMV, encryption, tokenization is great for overall health of the industry overall. Consumer confidence, we go back to the secular questions that we were talking about earlier, I think Paul's question, maybe it was David's, around adoption, things like that. Obviously, security is a big piece of that. We invest heavily there. We're trying to find the right balance as well as the returns.

We're not in e",501,"Yes, Dan, it's Jeff. So I'll start with that. So our bogey in most of the markets that we're in is where are Visa and MasterCard growing transactionally. So that's one way of getting at rate of market growth for those markets that we're in. We're not in every sub-vertical market that Visa and MasterCard are in. But where it's relevant for us, what's the rate of the transaction growth, number one? And number two, what is GDP growing in those markets plus 200 to 300 basis points of increment reflecting the transition from paper to electronic means? So if you just fill that, and there's obviously a lot of markets that we're in, we're in 30 countries physically today around the world, well, you'd say in general, across all of our markets, the bogey is around 5% market rate of growth. Some are higher, some are lower. But in general, it's around 5% rate of growth. If you look at our cycle guidance, which we talked about again this morning, we target high single-digit organic rate of revenue growth plus margin expansion, et cetera. So the way we think about it, Dan, is if we're targeting high single digits, if the rate of market growth is 5%, and we talked about this last year or last October in our Investor Day, we certainly think that we're capturing share in the aggregate. Now some of that is because we're in better markets. Some of that is because we think we have a good, differentiated sales force. Some of that is because we think have steady operating environments, et cetera. But nonetheless, the math is the math. And I would say that in most of the markets around the world, we do think that we're capturing share. If you look at United States, for example, in our OpenEdge business, which Cameron and David just described, today mid-teens growth is probably 3x the rate of mid-single digit market rate growth, more broadly speaking transactionally, in the United States. Now we're not the only people growing at that rate at the end of the day. So I don't think it's just us. But certainly, I think traditional channels that we refer to as more relationship driven are not growing at kind of mid-teens. And I certainly think it's fair to say that there's market share gains, I mean, in technology-enabled distribution area, whether it's Heartland commerce or whether it's OpenEdge, relative to the more traditional, for example, financial institutional channel, where you see rates of growth that tend to be less than the market or around low single digit. So I think it's been a conscious effort. So you think about what the market is in each market that we're in, what the bogeys are, how we're going to invest and grow at rates that are north of the market. It's for a lot of reasons. But I think at the end of the day, it comes down to smart investments that take share."

I realize that's a popular topic of conversation that has more to it; other participants in this industry overall rather than us directly as a payment technology provider. So I think we're very happy with the pieces. I would tell you that the combination of being able to sell other products in addition to payments does make for better, stronger sale and more sales. So selling payroll, selling some of the other products, selling our ACH-based product to our online customers obviously enhances the payment sales as well.

We partnered with those guys a number of years ago. It's been just over 2 years now this month. We didn't model out high 20s growth. That wasn't our expectation for organic revenue growth. It was right around 20%. As we sit today, they've now exceeded it for a number of quarters. So what I would tell you is we have a fantastic management team in place in Australia and New Zealand. They have essentially taken an integrated model, which is what Ezidebit is, think of it as OpenEdge based in Australia and New Zealand, and certainly, relative to one of the last questions, are doing nothing but capturing share in that marketplace environment. So if you were probably to go look at the rate of organic transactional growth for Visa and MasterCard and their peers in Australia and New Zealand, it would not be anywhere near 20%. So clearly, Ezidebit has a very good model with a very good team, and they're doing all the right things. We also didn't spend a lot of time talking about it because it's not organic. But their integration of eWAY, which is something we announced in April, has also gone very well, and I think it shows the -- which has 25% of the online market in Australia and Zealand. I just think it just shows the flexibility and capacity and our confidence level in our management team in Australia, New Zealand and Asia to accelerate growth while they're busy growing their own business well into the 20s."

I would say the guide itself doesn't suggest an increase -- or, excuse me, a decrease in the effective tax rate. That not what's driving the increase in the guide. It's really the Q1 performance, coupled with our outlook for the remainder of the year, the increase in expense synergies that we're targeting now for fiscal '17 relative to the Heartland transaction, obviously offset slightly by some incremental FX headwinds."

We're now seeing it go down around $1.27. It was $1.30 for most of September. It was -- obviously a little higher on average for Q1. So I think we remain cautious probably as it relates to the pound specifically, particularly in light of the size of that business relative to the overall size of Global Payments. The unfortunate reality is a lot of other currencies tend to be trading in sympathy with the pound, it appears, as well. So we've seen weakness, albeit maybe not as severe as we've seen in the pound. We've seen general weakness across the board in most of the major currencies to which we have exposure. So I do think it could end up being almost an additional full point for the full year, particularly in light of my view and I think our view that when you get to December, I think we expect the Fed to raise. I think in a rising rate environment here in the U.S., it's going to continue to put pressure on foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which causes us, again, to bake in a little more FX headwind into our forecast for the remainder of the year."

We are delighted to report a strong start to our fiscal 2017, continuing the positive momentum we have seen in our business. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets during the first quarter, with particular strength in Heartland, OpenEdge and our United Kingdom and Asia businesses. While delivering these results, we also made substantial progress integrating Heartland and are ahead of our expectations in realizing synergies from the merger. 
For the first quarter, we delivered high single-digit organic direct net revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% on a constant currency basis. We are also particularly pleased with our ability to expand operating margin in North America, which includes the addition of Heartland for the full quarter. 
Our North American businesses performed very well in the quarter, led by our U.S. direct sales channels, which generated high single-digit organic net revenue growth. This was primarily driven by strength in new sales at Heartland and OpenEdge, each of which accelerated sequentially. Further, Heartland achieved an all-time new sales record in August, demonstrating continued momentum in that channel. 
In Europe, we generated strong local-currency revenue growth in the first quarter, including double-digit growth in our U.K. business, which accelerated from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Spain delivered impressive results, and we again saw a double-digit volume and transaction growth well in excess of the rate of market growth. We also continue to make strides advancing our e-commerce and omnisolutions businesses in Europe. And I am delighted to announce that we are now live with Realex in Spain. 
Our businesses in Continental Europe, including our joint venture with Erste Bank in Central Europe that closed in early June, performed in line with our expectations. 
Lastly, Asia's performance in the first quarter was exceptional. We accelerated organic net revenue growth to the low double digits, resulting in the highest rate of growth in this market in several quarters. Our traditional Asia markets performed very well and, once again, our Ezidebit business contributed meaningfully to results in the region with over 20% organic growth this quarter. 
In just 5 months since closing on our partnership with Heartland, we have established our go-to-market strategy across distribution channels and verticals, identified new opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and have begun rationalizing corporate support, operating and technology environments. The progress we have made demonstrates our continued relentless focus on execution, which positions us well to achieve synergy targets and, importantly, to drive a number of incremental growth initiatives. 
We are already realizing revenue enhancements through our various distribution channels here in the United States and abroad. In addition to the initial cross-sales in Canada we discussed in July, we are now sharing sales leads from Heartland with all of our regions around the world. 
In the U.S., we have combined our traditional direct sales forces and have configured our platforms to be able to sell either Global Payments or Heartland Payment solutions to new customers. We have also enabled both our Campus Solutions and Heartland Commerce point-of-sale software products on Global Payments platforms in Canada, opening up opportunities for both new sales and the migration of existing Heartland software customers to Global Payments. 
Finally, our investment in enhancing our School Solutions technology platform supported record payments volume growth and flawless execution during the peak school enrollment season. 
Given our extensive planning, focus and strong execution, we are also realizing expense synergies ahead of initial expectations. We have made significant progress in merging corporate functions, consolidating facilities and operating centers and developing our future-state technology architecture model for key systems across the combined organization. 
As part of this effort, we selected Heartland's Jeffersonville facility as our go-forward U.S. operating center and plan to close our Owings Mills facility by early calendar 2017. This allows us to leverage Global Payments' worldwide, unified operating environment in the Jeffersonville facility to create a scalable world-class service center to support our global operations. 
Lastly, we are completing migration plans to consolidate our technology environments to achieve our future-state model, which is critical to achieving our full expense synergy expectations. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

We reported another quarter of strong financial performance while also making significant progress on our Heartland integration efforts and executing synergy plans ahead of expectations. Total company net revenu",823,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We reported another quarter of strong financial performance while also making significant progress on our Heartland integration efforts and executing synergy plans ahead of expectations. 
Total company net revenue for the first quarter was $817 million, a 52% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating margin was 29.5% or 29.9% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 for the first quarter, reflecting growth of 9% or 15% on a constant currency basis. 
Our North America segment grew net revenues by 79% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And operating margin expanded 80 basis points despite the inclusion of Heartland, which has a lower-margin profile relative to Global Payments' historical levels. We are particularly pleased with our ability to expand margins in North America as this is the first period that includes Heartland for the full quarter. 
Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct sales channels, calculated as if we owned Heartland in both this period and in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, was high single digits for the quarter. This was primarily driven by our Heartland sales channel, which generated high single-digit organic growth, and OpenEdge, which produced yet another quarter of mid-teens growth. 
Canada again delivered solid performance, with low single-digit growth in local currency, consistent with our expectations. The Canadian dollar remained a headwind in the quarter, albeit less severe than we experienced in fiscal 2016. 
Our European business performed very well this quarter, delivering 11% net revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Reported growth for Europe was 2% compared to the prior year due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound which declined nearly 14% year-over-year. Growth in Europe was primarily driven by low double-digit net revenue growth in the United Kingdom and the continued expansion of our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions businesses as well as the addition of the Erste joint venture. 
European operating margin of 47.9% declined from the previous year as expected due primarily to integration costs associated with the Erste transaction and foreign currency impacts. As we noted in our July call, we anticipate a significant portion of these integration costs and currency headwinds will be realized in the first half of fiscal 2017. 
As expected, we have yet to see any real impact on our business resulting from the U.K. EU referendum, except, of course, for the devaluation of the pound. In fact, as Jeff noted, our business in the U.K. accelerated this quarter despite the outcome of the referendum. We will continue to monitor developments going forward to assess potential implications for our business. 
As Jeff mentioned, Asia Pacific had an outstanding quarter, with 17% net revenue growth and operating margins of 28.4%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. Growth in Asia was primarily driven by low double-digit organic growth in the region, including Ezidebit as well as the addition of the BPI joint venture and eWAY. 
Excluding Heartland integration costs, we generated free cash flow of approximately $107 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. 
Capital expenditures totaled $38 million for the quarter. In addition, we reduced outstanding debt during the first quarter by $44 million, and since the date of our last call, we repurchased an additional 379,000 shares for $28 million. Our current share repurchase authorization capacity is $191 million. As a reminder, we continue to expect to use a majority of our free cash flow this year to support debt reduction. 
As Jeff mentioned, our integration of Heartland is tracking ahead of schedule, and we now expect to realize over $60 million of expense synergies in fiscal 2017 as compared to our prior estimate of over $50 million. We are delighted with the progress we are making and have been able to execute on planned synergies more quickly than previously assumed, further positioning us to achieve our full expected run rate synergies from the merger. 
Given the strong performance in the first quarter and our updated expectation for synergy realization for the year, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2017. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, reflecting growth of 16% to 19% over fiscal 2016. In addition, we now expect operating margin to expand by up to 50 basis points for the year. 
We continue to expect net revenue to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion or growth of 47% to 52% over fiscal 2016. It is worth noting this outlook reflects our expectation that foreign currencies will be marginally weaker for the remainder of the year relative to our forecast when we guided back in July. 
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

So I would say in the first quarter, the margin declines in Europe were pretty much exactly what we anticipated. And if you look at the 2 primary drivers, one being Erste and our integration efforts specifically around the Erste joint venture and the second being currency, they probably each contributed about 1/2 of the decline in margin that we saw in Europe, that 450 basis points in the first quarter. So about half and half coming from Erste and currency. I think as you work through the year, I would expect that to get progressively a little bit better. Some of the FX headwinds will begin to abate as we get into the back half of the year. And as we continue with the integration efforts on Erste, I would expect most of that work to be done in the first few quarters of the year such that by the time we get to Q4, sitting here today, I would anticipate we'd be back to flat to expanding margins in Europe, which, as we've talked about in the past, with margins nearing 50%, our objective in Europe is really to sustain that level of margin, not really looking to expand those margins for that particular segment."

We did note that the U.S. direct businesses grew high single digits this quarter, in line with our expectations, including Heartland, of course, on a normalized basis. Breaking out the components, I would say, is a little more difficult, not really feasible by virtue of the fact that we are combining these businesses. And as more time progresses, the more difficult it's going to be to look at the business in the U.S., in particular, and say what was legacy Heartland and what was legacy Global Payments. As we talked about on the call, we've already combined our direct sales forces in the U.S. market, so where do I attribute that growth that's being driven by the combination of our direct sales forces, we've combined our traditional direct book with Heartland's direct book. So it's a little difficult to say specifically what Heartland drove in the quarter versus what Global Payments drove. We did, however, achieve the overall expectation we had for the business, which is growing our U.S. direct sales channels in that high single-digit range, which we were, obviously, very pleased with, while also continuing to make progress on progressing some of the revenue enhancements and revenue synergies that we expect to achieve over time."

I'd also say in terms of the health of the merchant base at Heartland that their attrition is running low relative to their own expectations and our expectations going into the deal as well. So as Cameron mentioned in his remarks, our ability to accelerate their growth, minimize any merchant or sales rep disruption while taking the expense actions that we've taken on a combined basis, is something that we're particularly pleased about, by way of background."

It's one we talk about all the time here, the sort of the balance of sales productivity, product investment, synergies. We're really fortunate in a couple of ways. One is Heartland fits beautifully into our overall strategy of running an operating company, right, creating leverage, getting on common platforms and chasing that capital, that resultant benefit and pouring it into product and distribution. That's exactly the calculus we're really running every day when we think about where to go from here. So I'll give you a couple of examples. While the teams are working hard on how we combine platforms and how we put call centers together and what we do to better serve customers more efficiently, our sales teams and our marketing teams are working on actually driving the top line growth. You can do both at once. For example, we boarded the first Heartland merchant to a Global Payments platform. That took a fair amount of technology investment, make -- puts us well ahead of having to do platform migrations, makes the platform migration not an emergency as we get to that over the next year or so, but it allows our Heartland sales force to be that much more productive. They can now sell the entire sphere of products that Global Payments and Heartland have together, and the products don't perfectly overlap. There are some VAR integrations that Heartland doesn't have. Heartland couldn't sell a CyberSource gateway integration, for example. Heartland did not have a cash advance product like Global Payments has. All these things can now be sold by that 1,500-person sales force. We can now sell in Canada and Puerto Rico out of that by enabling the platform, by having our teams work on that while separate teams are working on expense synergies and driving more and more efficiencies out of the infrastructure. So we're spending an awful lot of time in these parallel tracks, planting a lot of seeds, hitting a lot of singles on the way to what we expect, which is really going to be accelerating growth above what we think it can be over the next couple of years with these enhanced sales capabilities. Beyond even that, we're making little investments like accelerating sales hiring. Sales reps are up a little bit over where they were when we closed the deal. That's conscious. We're filling in white spaces that weren't covered. That's a choice we made, Global Payments with the Heartland sales leadership team, an opportunity to invest a little early in what can become nice calendar '17 sales in areas really underserved by our combined sales forces to date. We're sharing leads, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, with Hong Kong, U.K., Canada. That doesn't take anything away from our ability to perform our synergy work and get to our expense synergies at all. In fact, it's just wonderful volume to put at the top of this very efficient engine we run. Heck, we've automated the sales lead sharing process with Canada. And as you might imagine, that's a likely place for a lot of volume to come over time. So we really feel good about the way we're putting selective targeted investment back into the sales model while being able, in parallel, to keep driving our synergies and not in any way degrade customer service. So the pieces are working well together right now."

I think David gave a very wholesome answer as it relates to, qualitatively, what we've been doing to drive revenue enhancements across our U.S. businesses. The thing that I would add is, sitting here today, it's important to note that the revenue enhancements we've achieved thus far, they're helpful on the margin, but they're not significant enough to really move the needle as of yet. David talked about continuing to invest in these opportunities such that, over time, we expect to be able to realize the 1% to 2% incremental revenue growth target that we provided when we announced the deal, generated from revenue enhancement, so $30 million to $60 million or so. 
It's going to take some time to scale these. As you talk about combining distribution platforms, combining technology environments to efficiently create opportunities to cross-sell products and enhance the revenue growth of the combined business. It's going to take time to scale that to a point where you're seeing a more meaningful impact from the revenue enhancements actually on our performance. But we expect, over the next couple of years, to get to that point. And we do continue to believe that the overall revenue synergy target that we provided, again, is a realizable target, and we think we have great momentum early towards achieving that ultimate goal."

When we think, Steven, about how to go after synergies, certainly my expectation, as you get out to the time frame that Cameron is talking about, is we'll be the high end of those, and we're certainly shooting to beat that rate. In addition to the direct sales synergies, the real strategy we think about, Heartland combined with Global Payments, is going all the way across all of the Heartland global assets, figuring out how to combine the best of both and then globalize everything. So very much as Cameron said, we're very much in the mode of planting seeds, doing some spadework now that will bear the fruit '17 to '18 and beyond. In addition to the direct sales synergies I described earlier, we're doing the same thing with Campus Solutions. Our TouchNet software platform, the one that powers Campus Solutions, is now integrated with Global Payments, our technology platforms in Canada. That means we can sell net new customers. We can go back into TouchNet's existing customer base and sell merchants on payment -- payments from Global Payments, and we're beginning to build that pipeline. That same platform is now certified for Puerto Rico. We're ready to go in Puerto Rico as well. So you can see again, planting a few more seeds. The same with what's been historically called Heartland commerce, the point-of-sale cloud software solutions. We just certified our retail point-of-sale solution for Canada, again, for payments in Canada. We have 40 dealers in Canada now with portfolios. We can look to migrate those to our payments. We can obviously sell net new. We're working with target markets then in Europe and Asia to continue expanding that. Lots of really good, exciting activity that at this moment is very much at the margins. Cameron quite directly said, it's deals here and there, it's pipelines building, all with a focus on that 1% to 2% and, again, being at the high end of that range or beating that range over time."

That doesn't mean Canada is going to be anything different than what we expect it to be, which is a low single-digit grower in local currency. Hopefully, Canadian dollar headwinds will abate here at some point.

I'll take the first pass at this. They're actually coexisting beautifully right now. In fact, they're working directly together on our go-to-market strategies particularly as we think about some of our large competitors in the integrated space that we can chase with these new assets. I'd remind you that when we look at volume, we look at verticals. Less than 5% -- it's really actually less than 3% overlap between OpenEdge and its verticals that it serves and what we get in Heartland commerce. That's because Heartland commerce is primarily restaurant and hospitality. There's very little restaurant and very little hospitality in the OpenEdge portfolio. That allows us to think about a channel strategy for hospitality that really has us as the ISV working with dealers and working with direct sales to sell the combined software and payment solutions of the go-forward Global Payments. It allows OpenEdge to continue focusing on what it does best, which is managing that ecosystem between ISVs and end merchants, working on the targeted marketing, the sales, adding new partners while still working to actually add new merchants to existing partners. I'd also say OpenEdge still is in the same position it was a year ago after several years of mid-teens growth, really successful growth. We've got lots of opportunity inside the existing partner base. So we've got a nice little wall, for lack of a better metaphor right now, Andrew, between the markets served really by commerce and the commerce assets and the markets served by OpenEdge. And as we bring more and more cloud technology to market, we can be more and more thoughtful and surgical with our channel strategies and, again, chase some of the big players in hospitality, which we think is a real opportunity for sales growth over time as well."

So as we said in our remarks this morning, our European businesses and, in particular, our U.K. business has performed exceptionally well during the quarter. So certainly, we think one of the important trends in the marketplace is a lower cost of acceptance as well as a good macroeconomic backdrop for those markets. As I think we've said over time, reductions in costs to our merchants are really nothing but good news for our business, but those ultimately get competed away over a period of time. So I think it's good news. As their bills go down, the market tends to be efficient over periods of time. So our benefit as time goes on us tends to get competed away, yet the merchants continue to benefit with lower cost of acceptance than they had, had previously. It's hard to back that out of the underlying economic growth in the markets that we're in. But if you look at our experience, for example, in Spain, which early-adopted the interchange reductions, here we are now 2 years beyond the first adoption of the interchange reductions, and our business has grown, as we said in our prepared remarks, probably at 1.5 to 2x the rate of market growth for each of the last 6 quarters. How much of that is attributable to the lower cost of acceptance, the fantastic partner we have in Caixa in the Spanish market is kind of hard to disaggregate, but I think there's no doubt, David, that around the world, lower cost of acceptance for our customers is really nothing but a good thing."

So as we've said in our remarks this morning, we're very pleased with the initial progress in our Erste joint venture, which encompasses a number of countries in Continental Europe. I do believe that part of the rationale on behalf of Erste Bank for considering a joint venture was a change in competitive and technology dynamics in the markets in which they're in, in Continental Europe. So we certainly continue to pursue other venture partners in Europe. I think that the number of technological- and market-based changes that you're seeing going around Europe today do nothing but help our ability to create value for our partners. I think we've been -- we've been able to show for a very long period of time in many markets how we've been able to create very good returns for our shareholders and our partners.

So what I would say is I really think it's a combination of attacking the right markets with the right people and the right model. So in most of the markets which we compete, the United States is a good example, as David alluded to, we're very specific about the markets that we go after and how we do it. So to David's response about, for example, in OpenEdge in the integrated vertical markets, we're selling technology solutions into markets that themselves, like dental, veterinary, et cetera, that are higher growth than the overall rate of GDP growth in the U.S. economy plus the adoption of electronic commerce. And we're doing it with better technology, better people, better services and, ultimately, therefore, better margins. So I think, Bob, it's perhaps a reflection of the way we go about the markets that we go about, how we attack them and our point of value differentiation relative to our peers that really is driving the incremental rate of growth. I'd also say that there's an element of very good sales focus and execution. If you look at our results in Asia, for example, we've yet to really lap some of the macroeconomic headwinds that you saw starting in the second quarter of our fiscal last year in Asia, yet business as usual. Asian markets for us accelerated their growth, as Cameron and I each noted. To be candid, I just think that's very good sales execution in markets like Singapore and Malaysia and the Philippines with and without our partners at BPI. So the conscious investments we've made, Bob, as a company into markets that are large, diverse and growing with higher rates of vertical market growth than the average and better margin opportunities are really paying dividends. And that's what I think you're seeing in our results. Conversely, we're really not in the large merchant category, for example, in the United States, as some of our peers are, and I think a lot of the data, Bob, that you're referring to reflects the large retailer, for example, market, which in general is not a market we're particularly focused at either at legacy Global or at Heartland."

So I'll start and ask David and Cameron to join in as well. But I think -- and we touched a lot of this in the last question that you asked, but I think what you're seeing is the result of a period of investment that we've made in our business over a period of time that's really bearing fruit. I think David very nicely described the investments we made in sales in Heartland and in legacy Global Payments that are really resulting in dividends not just in the United States but around the world. The investments we've made in our technology environment since fiscal '12 and fiscal '13 are really bearing fruit. So from that point of view, I think we're differentiated a bit in terms of where we've placed chips on the table. In terms of what we're worried about, I think it all starts with, for us and our peers in the industry, what does the macroeconomic environment look like. Most of us are GDP plus derivative-type businesses, and, therefore, it's important that we operate in healthy economic environments. For example, we talked about much of fiscal '16 in Asia where, for a number of quarters, the latter 3 quarters in fiscal '16, we had a headwind in Greater China. I think we've been able to show -- throughout fiscal '16 and our results now in '17 and our guidance show that we're able to take whatever actions we need to take quickly to preserve margin and to reposition our business quickly. But there's no doubt at the end of the day that a healthy economy is an important driver globally of our results. So I think it's important in terms of what we worry about that a healthy economic environment for us globally so we continue to grow those businesses. We also need to make the right decisions around technology investments, which is where I started. Many of the things that we invest in now, we will see returns in 12, 18, 24 months from now. It's important to get those things right. So in terms of what we worry about, we worry about are we putting the wrong chips in the wrong place on the table such that we've made investments that haven't borne fruit. Happily, that's not been the case, but we worry a lot as a strategy matter about whether those are the right investment to make today for returns in the future?"

But we're thinking about those as the right way to think about servicing customers, allowing them to take care and delight their consumers at the point of interaction, at the point of sale. And obviously, in our industry, you're always worried about security. We do believe that the combination of EMV, encryption, tokenization is great for overall health of the industry, overall consumer confidence. When you go back to the secular questions that we were talking about earlier, I think Paul's question, maybe it was David's, around adoption, things like that. Obviously, security is a big piece of that. We invest heavily there. We're trying to find the right balance, as well, for returns.

So that's one way of getting at rate of market growth for those markets that we're in. We're not in every sub-vertical market that Visa and MasterCard are in. But where it's relevant for us, what's the rate of the transaction growth, number one? Number two, what is GDP growing in those markets plus 200 to 300 basis points of increment reflecting the transition from paper to electronic means? So if you distill that, and there's obviously a lot of markets that we're in, we're in 30 countries physically today around the world, what you would say, in general, across all of our markets, the bogey is around 5% market rate of growth. Some are higher, some are lower but, in general, it's around 5% rate of growth. If you look at our cycle guidance, which we talked about again this morning, we target high single-digit organic rate of revenue growth plus margin expansion, et cetera. So the way we think about it, Dan, is if we're targeting high single digits, if the rate of market growth is 5%, and we talked about this last year or last October in our Investor Day, we certainly think that we're capturing share in the aggregate. Now some of that is because we're in better markets. Some of that is because we think we have a good, differentiated sales force. Some of that is because we think have steady operating environments, et cetera. But nonetheless, the math is the math. And I would say that in most of the markets around the world, we do think that we're capturing share. If you look at the United States, for example, in our OpenEdge business, which Cameron and David just described today, mid-teens growth is probably 3x the rate of mid-single digit market rate growth, more broadly speaking, transactionally, in the United States. Now we're not the only people growing at that rate at the end of the day. So I don't think it's just us. But certainly, I think traditional channels that we refer to as more relationship driven are not growing at mid-teens. And I certainly think it's fair to say that there's market share gain in the technology-enabled distribution area, whether it's Heartland commerce or whether it's OpenEdge, relative to the more traditional, for example, financial institutional channel, where you see rates of growth that tend to be less than the market, call it around low single digit. So I think it's been a conscious effort to think about what the market is in each market that we're in, what the bogeys are, how we're going to invest and grow at rates that are north of the market. It's for a lot of reasons. But I think at the end of the day, it comes down to smart investments that take share."

So it's not just a volume thing or something along those lines in terms of just more reps create more sales. The quality of sales is good. The retention is very good right now. I think that on a pure payments basis, EMV is not driving these sales. I realize that's a popular topic of conversation but that has more to do with other participants in this industry overall rather than us directly as a payment technology provider. So I think we're very happy with the pieces. I would tell you that the combination of being able to sell other products in addition to payments does make for a better, stronger sale and more sales. So selling payroll, selling some of the other products, selling our ACH-based products to our online customers, obviously, enhances the payment sales as well.

It was right around 20%. As we've said today, they've now exceeded it for a number of quarters. So what I would tell you is we have a fantastic management team in place in Australia and New Zealand. They have essentially taken an integrated model, which is what Ezidebit is, think of it as OpenEdge based in Australia and New Zealand, and certainly, relative to one of the last questions, are doing nothing but capturing share in that marketplace environment. So if you were probably to go look at the rate of organic transactional growth for Visa and MasterCard and their peers in Australia and New Zealand, it would not be anywhere near 20%. So clearly, Ezidebit has a very good model with a very good team, and they're doing all the right things. We also didn't spend a lot of time talking about it because it's not organic. But their integration of eWAY, which is something we announced in April, has also gone very well, and I think it shows the -- which has 25% of the online market in Australia and New Zealand. And I just think it just shows the flexibility and capacity and our confidence level in our management team in Australia and New Zealand and Asia to accelerate growth while they're busy growing their own business well into the 20s."

The margin change obviously helps. But as I'll note, we're absorbing more FX in there as well. I think, overall, tax rate, I think the expectation remains pretty much the same as what we described back in July. We think it's going to approach 30%. It was 28.5%. So 28.5%, 29%, something in that ballpark, sort of approaching kind of the high 20s to 30% range remains our expectation for tax rate. I would say the guide itself doesn't suggest an increase -- or, excuse me, a decrease in the effective tax rate. That not what's driving the increase in the guide. It's really the Q1 performance, coupled with our outlook for the remainder of the year, the increase in expense synergies that we're targeting now for fiscal '17 relative to the Heartland transaction, obviously offset slightly by some incremental FX headwinds."

We're now seeing it down around $1.27. It was $1.30 for most of September. It was -- obviously a little higher on average for Q1. So I think we remain cautious, probably as it relates to the pound specifically, particularly in light of the size of that business relative to the overall size of Global Payments. The unfortunate reality is a lot of other currencies tend to be trading in sympathy with the pound, it appears, as well. So we've seen weakness, albeit maybe not as severe as we've seen in the pound. We've seen general weakness across the board in most of the major currencies to which we have exposure. So I do think it could end up being almost an additional full point for the full year, particularly in light of my view and I think our view that when you get to December, I think we expect the Fed to raise. I think in a rising rate environment here in the U.S., it's going to continue to put pressure on foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which causes us, again, to bake in a little more FX headwind into our forecast for the remainder of the year."

We are delighted to report a strong start to our fiscal 2017, continuing the positive momentum we have seen in our business. We accelerated organic growth across our key markets during the first quarter, with particular strength in Heartland, OpenEdge and our United Kingdom and Asia businesses. While delivering these results, we also made substantial progress integrating Heartland and are ahead of our expectations in realizing synergies from the merger. 
For the first quarter, we delivered high single-digit organic direct net revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% on a constant currency basis. We are also particularly pleased with our ability to expand operating margin in North America, which includes the addition of Heartland for the full quarter. 
Our North American businesses performed very well in the quarter, led by our U.S. direct sales channels, which generated high single-digit organic net revenue growth. This was primarily driven by strength in new sales at Heartland and OpenEdge, each of which accelerated sequentially. Further, Heartland achieved an all-time new sales record in August, demonstrating continued momentum in that channel. 
In Europe, we generated strong local-currency revenue growth in the first quarter, including double-digit growth in our U.K. business, which accelerated from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Spain delivered impressive results, and we again saw a double-digit volume and transaction growth well in excess of the rate of market growth. We also continue to make strides advancing our e-commerce and omnisolutions businesses in Europe. And I am delighted to announce that we are now live with Realex in Spain. 
Our businesses in Continental Europe, including our joint venture with Erste Bank in Central Europe that closed in early June, performed in line with our expectations. 
Lastly, Asia's performance in the first quarter was exceptional. We accelerated organic net revenue growth to the low double digits, resulting in the highest rate of growth in this market in several quarters. Our traditional Asia markets performed very well and, once again, our Ezidebit business contributed meaningfully to results in the region with over 20% organic growth this quarter. 
In just 5 months since closing on our partnership with Heartland, we have established our go-to-market strategy across distribution channels and verticals, identified new opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and have begun rationalizing corporate support, operating and technology environments. The progress we have made demonstrates our continued relentless focus on execution, which positions us well to achieve synergy targets and, importantly, to drive a number of incremental growth initiatives. 
We are already realizing revenue enhancements through our various distribution channels here in the United States and abroad. In addition to the initial cross-sales in Canada we discussed in July, we are now sharing sales leads from Heartland with all of our regions around the world. 
In the U.S., we have combined our traditional direct sales forces and have configured our platforms to be able to sell either Global Payments or Heartland Payment solutions to new customers. We have also enabled both our Campus Solutions and Heartland Commerce point-of-sale software products on Global Payments platforms in Canada, opening up opportunities for both new sales and the migration of existing Heartland software customers to Global Payments. 
Finally, our investment in enhancing our School Solutions technology platform supported record payments volume growth and flawless execution during the peak school enrollment season. 
Given our extensive planning, focus and strong execution, we are also realizing expense synergies ahead of initial expectations. We have made significant progress in merging corporate functions, consolidating facilities and operating centers and developing our future-state technology architecture model for key systems across the combined organization. 
As part of this effort, we selected Heartland's Jeffersonville facility as our go-forward U.S. operating center and plan to close our Owings Mills facility by early calendar 2017. This allows us to leverage Global Payments' worldwide, unified operating environment in the Jeffersonville facility to create a scalable world-class service center to support our global operations. 
Lastly, we are completing migration plans to consolidate our technology environments to achieve our future-state model, which is critical to achieving our full expense synergy expectations. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Cameron."

We reported another quarter of strong financial performance while also making significant progress on our Heartland integration efforts and executing synergy plans ahead of expectations. Total company net revenu",823,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We reported another quarter of strong financial performance while also making significant progress on our Heartland integration efforts and executing synergy plans ahead of expectations. 
Total company net revenue for the first quarter was $817 million, a 52% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating margin was 29.5% or 29.9% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 for the first quarter, reflecting growth of 9% or 15% on a constant currency basis. 
Our North America segment grew net revenues by 79% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And operating margin expanded 80 basis points despite the inclusion of Heartland, which has a lower-margin profile relative to Global Payments' historical levels. We are particularly pleased with our ability to expand margins in North America as this is the first period that includes Heartland for the full quarter. 
Normalized organic net revenue growth in our U.S. direct sales channels, calculated as if we owned Heartland in both this period and in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, was high single digits for the quarter. This was primarily driven by our Heartland sales channel, which generated high single-digit organic growth, and OpenEdge, which produced yet another quarter of mid-teens growth. 
Canada again delivered solid performance, with low single-digit growth in local currency, consistent with our expectations. The Canadian dollar remained a headwind in the quarter, albeit less severe than we experienced in fiscal 2016. 
Our European business performed very well this quarter, delivering 11% net revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Reported growth for Europe was 2% compared to the prior year due to significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the pound which declined nearly 14% year-over-year. Growth in Europe was primarily driven by low double-digit net revenue growth in the United Kingdom and the continued expansion of our e-commerce and omnichannel solutions businesses as well as the addition of the Erste joint venture. 
European operating margin of 47.9% declined from the previous year as expected due primarily to integration costs associated with the Erste transaction and foreign currency impacts. As we noted in our July call, we anticipate a significant portion of these integration costs and currency headwinds will be realized in the first half of fiscal 2017. 
As expected, we have yet to see any real impact on our business resulting from the U.K. EU referendum, except, of course, for the devaluation of the pound. In fact, as Jeff noted, our business in the U.K. accelerated this quarter despite the outcome of the referendum. We will continue to monitor developments going forward to assess potential implications for our business. 
As Jeff mentioned, Asia Pacific had an outstanding quarter, with 17% net revenue growth and operating margins of 28.4%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. Growth in Asia was primarily driven by low double-digit organic growth in the region, including Ezidebit as well as the addition of the BPI joint venture and eWAY. 
Excluding Heartland integration costs, we generated free cash flow of approximately $107 million this quarter. We define free cash flow as net operating cash flows, excluding the impact of settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. 
Capital expenditures totaled $38 million for the quarter. In addition, we reduced outstanding debt during the first quarter by $44 million, and since the date of our last call, we repurchased an additional 379,000 shares for $28 million. Our current share repurchase authorization capacity is $191 million. As a reminder, we continue to expect to use a majority of our free cash flow this year to support debt reduction. 
As Jeff mentioned, our integration of Heartland is tracking ahead of schedule, and we now expect to realize over $60 million of expense synergies in fiscal 2017 as compared to our prior estimate of over $50 million. We are delighted with the progress we are making and have been able to execute on planned synergies more quickly than previously assumed, further positioning us to achieve our full expected run rate synergies from the merger. 
Given the strong performance in the first quarter and our updated expectation for synergy realization for the year, we are increasing our outlook for fiscal 2017. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.45 to $3.55, reflecting growth of 16% to 19% over fiscal 2016. In addition, we now expect operating margin to expand by up to 50 basis points for the year. 
We continue to expect net revenue to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion or growth of 47% to 52% over fiscal 2016. It is worth noting this outlook reflects our expectation that foreign currencies will be marginally weaker for the remainder of the year relative to our forecast when we guided back in July. 
I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

So I would say in the first quarter, the margin declines in Europe were pretty much exactly what we anticipated. And if you look at the 2 primary drivers, one being Erste and our integration efforts specifically around the Erste joint venture and the second being currency, they probably each contributed about 1/2 of the decline in margin that we saw in Europe, that 450 basis points in the first quarter. So about half and half coming from Erste and currency. I think as you work through the year, I would expect that to get progressively a little bit better. Some of the FX headwinds will begin to abate as we get into the back half of the year. And as we continue with the integration efforts on Erste, I would expect most of that work to be done in the first few quarters of the year such that by the time we get to Q4, sitting here today, I would anticipate we'd be back to flat to expanding margins in Europe, which, as we've talked about in the past, with margins nearing 50%, our objective in Europe is really to sustain that level of margin, not really looking to expand those margins for that particular segment."

We did note that the U.S. direct businesses grew high single digits this quarter, in line with our expectations, including Heartland, of course, on a normalized basis. Breaking out the components, I would say, is a little more difficult, not really feasible by virtue of the fact that we are combining these businesses. And as more time progresses, the more difficult it's going to be to look at the business in the U.S., in particular, and say what was legacy Heartland and what was legacy Global Payments. As we talked about on the call, we've already combined our direct sales forces in the U.S. market, so where do I attribute that growth that's being driven by the combination of our direct sales forces, we've combined our traditional direct book with Heartland's direct book. So it's a little difficult to say specifically what Heartland drove in the quarter versus what Global Payments drove. We did, however, achieve the overall expectation we had for the business, which is growing our U.S. direct sales channels in that high single-digit range, which we were, obviously, very pleased with, while also continuing to make progress on progressing some of the revenue enhancements and revenue synergies that we expect to achieve over time."

I'd also say in terms of the health of the merchant base at Heartland that their attrition is running low relative to their own expectations and our expectations going into the deal as well. So as Cameron mentioned in his remarks, our ability to accelerate their growth, minimize any merchant or sales rep disruption while taking the expense actions that we've taken on a combined basis, is something that we're particularly pleased about, by way of background."

It's one we talk about all the time here, the sort of the balance of sales productivity, product investment, synergies. We're really fortunate in a couple of ways. One is Heartland fits beautifully into our overall strategy of running an operating company, right, creating leverage, getting on common platforms and chasing that capital, that resultant benefit and pouring it into product and distribution. That's exactly the calculus we're really running every day when we think about where to go from here. So I'll give you a couple of examples. While the teams are working hard on how we combine platforms and how we put call centers together and what we do to better serve customers more efficiently, our sales teams and our marketing teams are working on actually driving the top line growth. You can do both at once. For example, we boarded the first Heartland merchant to a Global Payments platform. That took a fair amount of technology investment, make -- puts us well ahead of having to do platform migrations, makes the platform migration not an emergency as we get to that over the next year or so, but it allows our Heartland sales force to be that much more productive. They can now sell the entire sphere of products that Global Payments and Heartland have together, and the products don't perfectly overlap. There are some VAR integrations that Heartland doesn't have. Heartland couldn't sell a CyberSource gateway integration, for example. Heartland did not have a cash advance product like Global Payments has. All these things can now be sold by that 1,500-person sales force. We can now sell in Canada and Puerto Rico out of that by enabling the platform, by having our teams work on that while separate teams are working on expense synergies and driving more and more efficiencies out of the infrastructure. So we're spending an awful lot of time in these parallel tracks, planting a lot of seeds, hitting a lot of singles on the way to what we expect, which is really going to be accelerating growth above what we think it can be over the next couple of years with these enhanced sales capabilities. Beyond even that, we're making little investments like accelerating sales hiring. Sales reps are up a little bit over where they were when we closed the deal. That's conscious. We're filling in white spaces that weren't covered. That's a choice we made, Global Payments with the Heartland sales leadership team, an opportunity to invest a little early in what can become nice calendar '17 sales in areas really underserved by our combined sales forces to date. We're sharing leads, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, with Hong Kong, U.K., Canada. That doesn't take anything away from our ability to perform our synergy work and get to our expense synergies at all. In fact, it's just wonderful volume to put at the top of this very efficient engine we run. Heck, we've automated the sales lead sharing process with Canada. And as you might imagine, that's a likely place for a lot of volume to come over time. So we really feel good about the way we're putting selective targeted investment back into the sales model while being able, in parallel, to keep driving our synergies and not in any way degrade customer service. So the pieces are working well together right now."

The thing that I would add is, sitting here today, it's important to note that the revenue enhancements we've achieved thus far, they're helpful on the margin, but they're not significant enough to really move the needle as of yet. David talked about continuing to invest in these opportunities such that, over time, we expect to be able to realize the 1% to 2% incremental revenue growth target that we provided when we announced the deal, generated from revenue enhancement, so $30 million to $60 million or so. 
It's going to take some time to scale these. As you talk about combining distribution platforms, combining technology environments to efficiently create opportunities to cross-sell products and enhance the revenue growth of the combined business. It's going to take time to scale that to a point where you're seeing a more meaningful impact from the revenue enhancements actually on our performance.

When we think, Steven, about how to go after synergies, certainly my expectation, as you get out to the time frame that Cameron is talking about, is we'll be the high end of those, and we're certainly shooting to beat that rate. In addition to the direct sales synergies, the real strategy we think about, Heartland combined with Global Payments, is going all the way across all of the Heartland global assets, figuring out how to combine the best of both and then globalize everything. So very much as Cameron said, we're very much in the mode of planting seeds, doing some spadework now that will bear the fruit '17 to '18 and beyond. In addition to the direct sales synergies I described earlier, we're doing the same thing with Campus Solutions. Our TouchNet software platform, the one that powers Campus Solutions, is now integrated with Global Payments, our technology platforms in Canada. That means we can sell net new customers. We can go back into TouchNet's existing customer base and sell merchants on payment -- payments from Global Payments, and we're beginning to build that pipeline. That same platform is now certified for Puerto Rico. We're ready to go in Puerto Rico as well. So you can see again, planting a few more seeds. The same with what's been historically called Heartland commerce, the point-of-sale cloud software solutions. We just certified our retail point-of-sale solution for Canada, again, for payments in Canada. We have 40 dealers in Canada now with portfolios. We can look to migrate those to our payments. We can obviously sell net new. We're working with target markets then in Europe and Asia to continue expanding that. Lots of really good, exciting activity that at this moment is very much at the margins. Cameron quite directly said, it's deals here and there, it's pipelines building, all with a focus on that 1% to 2% and, again, being at the high end of that range or beating that range over time."

So I think it's fair to say that is our goal as we think about our North American business more broadly. That doesn't mean Canada is going to be anything different than what we expect it to be, which is a low single-digit grower in local currency. Hopefully, Canadian dollar headwinds will abate here at some point. But we do believe as we continue to obviously progress the combination of Heartland and Global Payments in the U.S., that North America should accelerate towards that level, allowing the overall company to achieve the high single-digit rate of organic net revenue growth that we expect to achieve over the cycle."

I'll take the first pass at this. They're actually coexisting beautifully right now. In fact, they're working directly together on our go-to-market strategies particularly as we think about some of our large competitors in the integrated space that we can chase with these new assets. I'd remind you that when we look at volume, we look at verticals. Less than 5% -- it's really actually less than 3% overlap between OpenEdge and its verticals that it serves and what we get in Heartland commerce. That's because Heartland commerce is primarily restaurant and hospitality. There's very little restaurant and very little hospitality in the OpenEdge portfolio. That allows us to think about a channel strategy for hospitality that really has us as the ISV working with dealers and working with direct sales to sell the combined software and payment solutions of the go-forward Global Payments. It allows OpenEdge to continue focusing on what it does best, which is managing that ecosystem between ISVs and end merchants, working on the targeted marketing, the sales, adding new partners while still working to actually add new merchants to existing partners. I'd also say OpenEdge still is in the same position it was a year ago after several years of mid-teens growth, really successful growth. We've got lots of opportunity inside the existing partner base. So we've got a nice little wall, for lack of a better metaphor right now, Andrew, between the markets served really by commerce and the commerce assets and the markets served by OpenEdge. And as we bring more and more cloud technology to market, we can be more and more thoughtful and surgical with our channel strategies and, again, chase some of the big players in hospitality, which we think is a real opportunity for sales growth over time as well."

So as we said in our remarks this morning, our European businesses and, in particular, our U.K. business has performed exceptionally well during the quarter. So certainly, we think one of the important trends in the marketplace is a lower cost of acceptance as well as a good macroeconomic backdrop for those markets. As I think we've said over time, reductions in costs to our merchants are really nothing but good news for our business, but those ultimately get competed away over a period of time. So I think it's good news. As their bills go down, the market tends to be efficient over periods of time. So our benefit as time goes on us tends to get competed away, yet the merchants continue to benefit with lower cost of acceptance than they had, had previously. It's hard to back that out of the underlying economic growth in the markets that we're in. But if you look at our experience, for example, in Spain, which early-adopted the interchange reductions, here we are now 2 years beyond the first adoption of the interchange reductions, and our business has grown, as we said in our prepared remarks, probably at 1.5 to 2x the rate of market growth for each of the last 6 quarters.

So as we've said in our remarks this morning, we're very pleased with the initial progress in our Erste joint venture, which encompasses a number of countries in Continental Europe. I do believe that part of the rationale on behalf of Erste Bank for considering a joint venture was a change in competitive and technology dynamics in the markets in which they're in, in Continental Europe. So we certainly continue to pursue other venture partners in Europe. I think that the number of technological- and market-based changes that you're seeing going around Europe today do nothing but help our ability to create value for our partners. I think we've been -- we've been able to show for a very long period of time in many markets how we've been able to create very good returns for our shareholders and our partners. And I think the changes in Europe provide us another opportunity to do the same, and we expect that our partners at Erste will be similarly happy. So from that point of view, David, we continue to pursue those ventures, and we hope to do more in the future."

So what I would say is I really think it's a combination of attacking the right markets with the right people and the right model. So in most of the markets which we compete, the United States is a good example, as David alluded to, we're very specific about the markets that we go after and how we do it. So to David's response about, for example, in OpenEdge in the integrated vertical markets, we're selling technology solutions into markets that themselves, like dental, veterinary, et cetera, that are higher growth than the overall rate of GDP growth in the U.S. economy plus the adoption of electronic commerce. And we're doing it with better technology, better people, better services and, ultimately, therefore, better margins. So I think, Bob, it's perhaps a reflection of the way we go about the markets that we go about, how we attack them and our point of value differentiation relative to our peers that really is driving the incremental rate of growth. I'd also say that there's an element of very good sales focus and execution. If you look at our results in Asia, for example, we've yet to really lap some of the macroeconomic headwinds that you saw starting in the second quarter of our fiscal last year in Asia, yet business as usual. Asian markets for us accelerated their growth, as Cameron and I each noted. To be candid, I just think that's very good sales execution in markets like Singapore and Malaysia and the Philippines with and without our partners at BPI. So the conscious investments we've made, Bob, as a company into markets that are large, diverse and growing with higher rates of vertical market growth than the average and better margin opportunities are really paying dividends. And that's what I think you're seeing in our results. Conversely, we're really not in the large merchant category, for example, in the United States, as some of our peers are, and I think a lot of the data, Bob, that you're referring to reflects the large retailer, for example, market, which in general is not a market we're particularly focused at either at legacy Global or at Heartland."

So I'll start and ask David and Cameron to join in as well. But I think -- and we touched a lot of this in the last question that you asked, but I think what you're seeing is the result of a period of investment that we've made in our business over a period of time that's really bearing fruit. I think David very nicely described the investments we made in sales in Heartland and in legacy Global Payments that are really resulting in dividends not just in the United States but around the world. The investments we've made in our technology environment since fiscal '12 and fiscal '13 are really bearing fruit. So from that point of view, I think we're differentiated a bit in terms of where we've placed chips on the table. In terms of what we're worried about, I think it all starts with, for us and our peers in the industry, what does the macroeconomic environment look like. Most of us are GDP plus derivative-type businesses, and, therefore, it's important that we operate in healthy economic environments. For example, we talked about much of fiscal '16 in Asia where, for a number of quarters, the latter 3 quarters in fiscal '16, we had a headwind in Greater China. I think we've been able to show -- throughout fiscal '16 and our results now in '17 and our guidance show that we're able to take whatever actions we need to take quickly to preserve margin and to reposition our business quickly. But there's no doubt at the end of the day that a healthy economy is an important driver globally of our results. So I think it's important in terms of what we worry about that a healthy economic environment for us globally so we continue to grow those businesses. We also need to make the right decisions around technology investments, which is where I started. Many of the things that we invest in now, we will see returns in 12, 18, 24 months from now. It's important to get those things right. So in terms of what we worry about, we worry about are we putting the wrong chips in the wrong place on the table such that we've made investments that haven't borne fruit. Happily, that's not been the case, but we worry a lot as a strategy matter about whether those are the right investment to make today for returns in the future?"

But we're thinking about those as the right way to think about servicing customers, allowing them to take care and delight their consumers at the point of interaction, at the point of sale. And obviously, in our industry, you're always worried about security. We do believe that the combination of EMV, encryption, tokenization is great for overall health of the industry, overall consumer confidence. When you go back to the secular questions that we were talking about earlier, I think Paul's question, maybe it was David's, around adoption, things like that. Obviously, security is a big piece of that. We invest heavily there. We're trying to find the right balance, as well, for returns. So we think about those couple of things in addition to what Jeff described."

So that's one way of getting at rate of market growth for those markets that we're in. We're not in every sub-vertical market that Visa and MasterCard are in. But where it's relevant for us, what's the rate of the transaction growth, number one? Number two, what is GDP growing in those markets plus 200 to 300 basis points of increment reflecting the transition from paper to electronic means? So if you distill that, and there's obviously a lot of markets that we're in, we're in 30 countries physically today around the world, what you would say, in general, across all of our markets, the bogey is around 5% market rate of growth. Some are higher, some are lower but, in general, it's around 5% rate of growth. If you look at our cycle guidance, which we talked about again this morning, we target high single-digit organic rate of revenue growth plus margin expansion, et cetera. So the way we think about it, Dan, is if we're targeting high single digits, if the rate of market growth is 5%, and we talked about this last year or last October in our Investor Day, we certainly think that we're capturing share in the aggregate. Now some of that is because we're in better markets. Some of that is because we think we have a good, differentiated sales force. Some of that is because we think have steady operating environments, et cetera. But nonetheless, the math is the math. And I would say that in most of the markets around the world, we do think that we're capturing share. If you look at the United States, for example, in our OpenEdge business, which Cameron and David just described today, mid-teens growth is probably 3x the rate of mid-single digit market rate growth, more broadly speaking, transactionally, in the United States. Now we're not the only people growing at that rate at the end of the day. So I don't think it's just us. But certainly, I think traditional channels that we refer to as more relationship driven are not growing at mid-teens. And I certainly think it's fair to say that there's market share gain in the technology-enabled distribution area, whether it's Heartland commerce or whether it's OpenEdge, relative to the more traditional, for example, financial institutional channel, where you see rates of growth that tend to be less than the market, call it around low single digit. So I think it's been a conscious effort to think about what the market is in each market that we're in, what the bogeys are, how we're going to invest and grow at rates that are north of the market. It's for a lot of reasons. But I think at the end of the day, it comes down to smart investments that take share."

So it's not just a volume thing or something along those lines in terms of just more reps create more sales. The quality of sales is good. The retention is very good right now. I think that on a pure payments basis, EMV is not driving these sales. I realize that's a popular topic of conversation but that has more to do with other participants in this industry overall rather than us directly as a payment technology provider. So I think we're very happy with the pieces. I would tell you that the combination of being able to sell other products in addition to payments does make for a better, stronger sale and more sales. So selling payroll, selling some of the other products, selling our ACH-based products to our online customers, obviously, enhances the payment sales as well. But really, I don't have a single thing at which to point, Tien-tsin, that's different from where things were. I think the engine is working well. The leadership is in place.

When we partnered with those guys a number of years ago, it's been just over 2 years now this month, we didn't model out high 20s growth. That wasn't our expectation for organic revenue growth. It was right around 20%. As we've said today, they've now exceeded it for a number of quarters. So what I would tell you is we have a fantastic management team in place in Australia and New Zealand. They have essentially taken an integrated model, which is what Ezidebit is, think of it as OpenEdge based in Australia and New Zealand, and certainly, relative to one of the last questions, are doing nothing but capturing share in that marketplace environment. So if you were probably to go look at the rate of organic transactional growth for Visa and MasterCard and their peers in Australia and New Zealand, it would not be anywhere near 20%. So clearly, Ezidebit has a very good model with a very good team, and they're doing all the right things. We also didn't spend a lot of time talking about it because it's not organic. But their integration of eWAY, which is something we announced in April, has also gone very well, and I think it shows the -- which has 25% of the online market in Australia and New Zealand. And I just think it just shows the flexibility and capacity and our confidence level in our management team in Australia and New Zealand and Asia to accelerate growth while they're busy growing their own business well into the 20s."

The unfortunate reality is a lot of other currencies tend to be trading in sympathy with the pound, it appears, as well. So we've seen weakness, albeit maybe not as severe as we've seen in the pound.
