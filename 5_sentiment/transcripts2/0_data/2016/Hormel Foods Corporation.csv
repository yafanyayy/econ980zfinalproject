Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, a 1%",283,"Thank you, Jana, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report record results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016. Earnings in the second quarter were $0.40 per share, up a robust 21% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, a 1% increase despite lower turkey volumes at Jennie-O Turkey Store and soft export demand in our International segment. 
We reached an agreement to sell Diamond Crystal Brands in the second quarter and completed the transaction in recent days. This business, which was part of our Specialty Foods segment, represented approximately $260 million of annual sales. While Diamond Crystal Brands performed acceptably, it did not fit our long-term strategic priorities. As a result of the transaction, there was a small goodwill impairment recorded this quarter to reflect the final sales price. Our Specialty Foods Group will retain Hormel Health Labs, a provider of nutritional foods and beverages developed specifically for individuals with special dietary needs, which was previously a part of Diamond Crystal Brands. We continue to ensure a smooth transition for the customers and employees of Diamond Crystal Brands.
In addition to our earnings release this morning, we also announced the acquisition of Justin's LLC, a pioneer in the specialty nut butter category. The acquisition comes with the fast-growing JUSTIN'S brand of natural and organic products, a strong management team, access to new customers and several manufacturing agreements. The deal is subject to the customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in the United States and is expected to close within 60 days. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will provide additional details about the JUSTIN'S acquisition and also take you through each segment."

Since Justin's was founded in 2004, the business has experienced tremendous growth. Looking forward, we expect Justin's to grow at low double-digit rates from a starting point of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2017 net sales. Justin's will report into the Grocery Products segment.
Justin's enhances our scale in the nut butter category, complementing our SKIPPY brand positioning very nicely. The JUSTIN'S brand gives us a great platform in natural and organic specialty not butter spreads, the fastest-growing portion of the nut butter category. JUSTIN'S also further balances our portfolio of brands towards younger, more health-conscious and on-the-go consumers with their pioneering squeeze packs, a portable snack that comes in all 7 of JUSTIN'S nut butter flavors. We intend to leverage key Hormel Foods resources and supply chain, finance and R&D, while leaving their mission and vision unchanged. We look forward to working with the Justin's team in Boulder, Colorado and finalizing the acquisition in the coming weeks. I will now take you through each segment. 
Grocery Products segment profit was up 21% for the quarter. Input cost tailwinds and improved plant efficiencies drove the gains. Sales were up 1%, led by SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL Chili, WHOLLY GUACAMOLE and our HERDEZ line of authentic Mexican products. Sales for our chunk meats business and COMPLEATS microwave meals were down this quarter. 
Our SKIPPY peanut butter products had a great quarter. Our traditional jarred peanut butter continues to capture share in the marketplace as our sales team gains additional distribution. Our most recent innovation, SKIPPY P.B. bites, has had many early successes and key measures such as trial and repeat are meeting our internal targets. The company continues to leverage its iconic brands in new and innovative ways. And this past April, we opened the new 14,000 square foot SPAM Museum located in downtown Austin, Minnesota. We invite you to come and visit our new family of friendly museum.
Refrigerated Foods second quarter operating profit increased 13%, with sales up 7% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from strong pork operating margins, the addition of the Applegate business and great results from our foodservice business. We saw growth from many of our value-added products, including retail sales of Hormel NATURAL CHOICE lunchmeat, HORMEL pepperoni and HORMEL party trays. Our foodservice value-added products experienced solid growth led by brands such as the AUSTIN BLUES line of products, HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats.
When we announced the Applegate acquisition in 2015, one of our top priorities was to tackle the supply constraints we identified during the acquisition. While staying true to Applegate's mission of changing the meat we eat, we have secured additional supplies, and the team is working to gain back distribution that was lost when supplies were pressured. Applegate remains on track to deliver earnings results consistent with our initial guidance for this business. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store's second quarter segment profit increased 20%, while sales decreased 4%. Results were impacted by the lingering effects of avian influenza as flocks lost in 2015 created shortfalls in operations and sales. Production volumes have now returned to normalized levels, and we remain optimistic that avian influenza is behind us. However, the team continues to be diligent and heightened biosecurity remains a top focus. We remain focused on gaining back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak, but we did enjoy growth this quarter in our JENNIE-O lean ground turkey, retail bacon and Oven Ready product lines. 
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 74%. The increase was aided in part by a favorable comparison to expenses last year related to the closure of the CytoSport production facility. Operational synergies captured in the current year within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain also contributed to the increase.
MUSCLE MILK sports nutrition products posted excellent results, in addition to launching many new innovative items such as Muscle milk protein smoothies. The gains made by CytoSport team were offset by lower Contract Packaging sales, resulting in a 5% decrease in the sales this quarter. 
International's operating profit decreased 33%, and sales declined 17%. Weak exports of our SPAM and SKIPPY family of products, in addition to soft pork export markets, contributed to the declines. Our China meat business had a difficult comparison to last year in addition to pressures from higher pork raw material costs. Our SKIPPY business in mainland China experienced nice growth this quarter. We expect input cost tailwinds to continue for Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products. We look for these segments to continue driving year-over-year gains in sales and operating profits through increases in our value-added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store production is now at normalized levels, and we are positioned to deliver growth in the back half of the year, provided there are no significant recurrences of avian influenza. 
The team is investing in their fourth Make The Switch advertising campaign, highlighting turkey as an alternative to beef. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the second half of the year.
Specialty Foods segment may show year-over-year sales and earnings declines due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. Positive sales trends in the MUSCLE MILK brand and incremental sales from new innovative MUSCLE MILK products will offset some of the sales declines. With the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and to reflect the enhanced margin profile of CytoSport, we are increasing our segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods to 11% to 14%, up from the previously guided 8% to 11%. 
We look for the International segment to return to growth in the second half, to increase export sales of our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products, along with gradual improvement in our China retail meats business. 
We continue to reinvest into our businesses for increased through advertising and marketing support for brands such as HORMEL Pepperoni, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, MUSCLE MILK protein products and Jennie-O Turkey. 
As a result of the strong second quarter and continued confidence in our position heading into the back half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.50 to $1.56 per share to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $215.4 million, up 20% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40, a 21% increase. Sales for the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion compared to $2.28 billion for the same period last year, a 1% increase. Turkey supply shortages and lower exports pressured sales during the quarter. Volume for the second quarter was 1.28 billion pounds, down less than 1% from the same quarter last year. 
As Jeff and Jim mentioned, we have reached an agreement to acquire Justin's LLC. The purchase price is $286 million. The transaction is structured to provide an ongoing cash flow benefit resulting from the tax amortization of the stepped-up basis of assets. The net present value of this tax cash flow benefit is estimated to be about $70 million. We expect fiscal 2016 to include about 4 months of results from Justin's, with a slightly negative impact earnings after factoring in the expected transaction costs and fair value adjustments. We estimate accretion associated with the deal to be approximately $0.01 for fiscal 2017. We expect to gain supply chain synergies that will be implemented over the next several years. We plan to finance this transaction with cash on hand and a short-term draw from our credit facility. Following the close, we will remain in a strong financial position to fund any other capital needs. 
Advertising expense for the quarter was $48.8 million compared to $39.5 million last year, as we continue to build on our brand investment. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.6% versus 34.6% in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 529.9 million compared to 528.1 million last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 543.8 million shares compared to 540.9 million last year. We repurchased 160,000 shares of common stock, spending $6.4 million in the second quarter. We have 15.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66.4 million compared to $27.3 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.1 million compared to $33 million last year. 
As Jim mentioned earlier, we raised our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance range to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. This guidance includes the sale of our Diamond Crystal business and the acquisition of Justin's LLC. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. 
We paid our 351st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 16, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share.

It -- ultimately, we feel we have a really nice position being within a 4-hour concentric circle of our operating plant and our production lines that allows for the maximum freshness of product.

Earnings in the second quarter were $0.40 per share, up a robust 21% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, a 1% increase despite lower turkey volumes at Jennie-O Turkey Store and soft export demand in our International segment. 
We reached an agreement to sell Diamond Crystal Brands in the second quarter and completed the transaction in recent days. This business, which was part of our Specialty Foods segment, represented approximately $260 million of annual sales. While Diamond Crystal Brands performed acceptably, it did not fit our long-term strategic priorities. As a result of the transaction, there was a small goodwill impairment recorded this quarter to reflect the final sales price. Our Specialty Foods Group will retain Hormel Health Labs, a provider of nutritional foods and beverages developed specifically for individuals with special dietary needs, which was previously a part of Diamond Crystal Brands. We continue to ensure a smooth transition for the customers and employees of Diamond Crystal Brands.
In addition to our earnings release this morning, we also announced the acquisition of Justin's LLC, a pioneer in the specialty nut butter category. The acquisition comes with the fast-growing JUSTIN'S brand of natural and organic products, a strong management team, access to new customers and several manufacturing agreements. The deal is subject to the customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in the United States, and is expected to close within 60 days. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will provide additional details about the Justin's acquisition and also take you through each segment."

Since Justin's was founded in 2004, the business has experienced tremendous growth. Looking forward, we expect Justin's to grow at low double-digit rates from a starting point of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2017 net sales. Justin's will report into the Grocery Products segment.
Justin's enhances our scale in the nut butter category, complementing our SKIPPY brand positioning very nicely. The JUSTIN'S brand gives us a great platform in natural and organic specialty nut butter spreads, the fastest-growing portion of the nut butter category. JUSTIN'S also further balances our portfolio of brands towards younger, more health-conscious and on-the-go consumers with their pioneering squeeze packs, a portable snack that comes in all 7 of JUSTIN'S nut butter flavors. We intend to leverage key Hormel Foods resources and supply chain, finance and R&D, while leaving their mission and vision unchanged. We look forward to working with the Justin's team in Boulder, Colorado and finalizing the acquisition in the coming weeks. I will now take you through each segment. 
Grocery Products segment profit was up 21% for the quarter. Input cost tailwinds and improved plant efficiencies drove the gains. Sales were up 1%, led by SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL Chili, WHOLLY GUACAMOLE and our Herdez line of authentic Mexican products. Sales for our chunk meats business and Compleats microwave meals were down this quarter. 
Our SKIPPY peanut butter products had a great quarter. Our traditional jarred peanut butter continues to capture share in the marketplace as our sales team gains additional distribution. Our most recent innovation, SKIPPY P.B. Bites, has had many early successes and key measures such as trial and repeat are meeting our internal targets. The company continues to leverage its iconic brands in new and innovative ways. And this past April, we opened the new 14,000 square foot SPAM Museum located in downtown Austin, Minnesota. We invite you to come and visit our new family friendly museum.
Refrigerated Foods second quarter operating profit increased 13%, with sales up 7% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from strong pork operating margins, the addition of the Applegate business and great results from our foodservice business. We saw growth from many of our value-added products, including retail sales of HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE lunchmeat, HORMEL pepperoni and HORMEL party trays. Our foodservice value-added products experienced solid growth led by brands such as the AUSTIN BLUES line of products, HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats.
When we announced the Applegate acquisition in 2015, one of our top priorities was to tackle the supply constraints we identified during the acquisition. While staying true to Applegate's mission of changing the meat we eat, we have secured additional supplies, and the team is working to gain back distribution that was lost when supplies were pressured. Applegate remains on track to deliver earnings results consistent with our initial guidance for this business. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store's second quarter segment profit increased 20%, while sales decreased 4%. Results were impacted by the lingering effects of avian influenza as flocks lost in 2015 created shortfalls in operations and sales. Production volumes have now returned to normalized levels, and we remain optimistic that avian influenza is behind us. However, the team continues to be diligent and heightened biosecurity remains a top focus. We remain focused on gaining back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak, but we did enjoy growth this quarter in our JENNIE-O lean ground turkey, retail bacon and OVEN READY product lines. 
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 74%. The increase was aided in part by a favorable comparison to expenses last year related to the closure of the CytoSport production facility. Operational synergies captured in the current year within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain also contributed to the increase.
MUSCLE MILK sports nutrition products posted excellent results, in addition to launching many new innovative items such as MUSCLE MILK protein smoothies. The gains made by our CytoSport team were offset by lower Contract Packaging sales, resulting in a 5% decrease in sales this quarter. 
International's operating profit decreased 33%, and sales declined 17%. Weak exports of our SPAM and SKIPPY family of products, in addition to soft pork export markets, contributed to the declines. Our China meat business had a difficult comparison to last year in addition to pressures from higher pork raw material costs. Our SKIPPY business in Mainland China experienced nice growth this quarter. We expect input cost tailwinds to continue for Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products. We look for these segments to continue driving year-over-year gains in sales and operating profits through increases in our value-added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store production is now at normalized levels, and we are positioned to deliver growth in the back half of the year, provided there are no significant reoccurrences of avian influenza. 
The team is investing in their fourth Make The Switch advertising campaign, highlighting turkey as an alternative to beef. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the second half of the year.
The Specialty Foods segment may show year-over-year sales and earnings declines due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. Positive sales trends in the MUSCLE MILK brand and incremental sales from new innovative MUSCLE MILK products will offset some of the sales declines. With the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and to reflect the enhanced margin profile of CytoSport, we are increasing our segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods to 11% to 14%, up from the previously guided 8% to 11%. 
We look for the International segment to return to growth in the second half, to increase export sales of our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products, along with gradual improvement in our China retail meats business. We continue to reinvest into our businesses through increased advertising and marketing support for brands such as HORMEL Pepperoni, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, MUSCLE MILK protein products and Jennie-O Turkey. 
As a result of the strong second quarter and continued confidence in our position heading into the back half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.50 to $1.56 per share to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $215.4 million, up 20% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40, a 21% increase. Sales for the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion compared to $2.28 billion for the same period last year, a 1% increase. Turkey supply shortages and lower exports pressured sales during the quarter. Volume for the second quarter was 1.28 billion pounds, down less than 1% from the same quarter last year. 
As Jeff and Jim mentioned, we have reached an agreement to acquire Justin's LLC. The purchase price is $286 million. The transaction is structured to provide an ongoing cash flow benefit resulting from the tax amortization of the stepped-up basis of assets. The net present value of this tax cash flow benefit is estimated to be about $70 million. We expect fiscal 2016 to include about 4 months of results from Justin's with a slightly negative impact to earnings after factoring in the expected transaction costs and fair value adjustments. We estimate accretion associated with the deal to be approximately $0.01 for fiscal 2017. We expect to gain supply chain synergies that will be implemented over the next several years. We plan to finance this transaction with cash on hand and a short-term draw from our credit facility. Following the close, we will remain in a strong financial position to fund any other capital needs. 
Advertising expense for the quarter was $48.8 million compared to $39.5 million last year, as we continue to build on our brand investment. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.6% versus 34.6% in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 529.9 million compared to 528.1 million last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 543.8 million shares compared to 540.9 million last year. We repurchased 160,000 shares of common stock, spending $6.4 million in the second quarter. We have 15.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66.4 million compared to $27.3 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.1 million compared to $33 million last year. 
As Jim mentioned earlier, we raised our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance range to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. This guidance includes the sale of our Diamond Crystal business and the acquisition of Justin's LLC. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We paid our 351st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 16, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share.

Earnings in the second quarter were $0.40 per share, up a robust 21% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, a 1% increase despite lower turkey volumes at Jennie-O Turkey Store and soft export demand in our International segment. 
We reached an agreement to sell Diamond Crystal Brands in the second quarter and completed the transaction in recent days. This business, which was part of our Specialty Foods segment, represented approximately $260 million of annual sales. While Diamond Crystal Brands performed acceptably, it did not fit our long-term strategic priorities. As a result of the transaction, there was a small goodwill impairment recorded this quarter to reflect the final sales price. Our Specialty Foods Group will retain Hormel Health Labs, a provider of nutritional foods and beverages developed specifically for individuals with special dietary needs, which was previously a part of Diamond Crystal Brands. We continue to ensure a smooth transition for the customers and employees of Diamond Crystal Brands.
In addition to our earnings release this morning, we also announced the acquisition of Justin's LLC, a pioneer in the specialty nut butter category. The acquisition comes with the fast-growing Justin's brand of natural and organic products, a strong management team, access to new customers and several manufacturing agreements. The deal is subject to the customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in the United States, and is expected to close within 60 days. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will provide additional details about the Justin's acquisition and also take you through each segment."

Since Justin's was founded in 2004, the business has experienced tremendous growth. Looking forward, we expect Justin's to grow at low double-digit rates from a starting point of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2017 net sales. Justin's will report into the Grocery Products segment.
Justin's enhances our scale in the nut butter category, complementing our SKIPPY brand positioning very nicely. The JUSTIN'S brand gives us a great platform in natural and organic specialty nut butter spreads, the fastest-growing portion of the nut butter category. JUSTIN'S also further balances our portfolio of brands towards younger, more health-conscious and on-the-go consumers with their pioneering squeeze packs, a portable snack that comes in all 7 of JUSTIN'S nut butter flavors. We intend to leverage key Hormel Foods resources and supply chain, finance and R&D, while leaving their mission and vision unchanged. We look forward to working with the Justin's team in Boulder, Colorado and finalizing the acquisition in the coming weeks. I will now take you through each segment. 
Grocery Products segment profit was up 21% for the quarter. Input cost tailwinds and improved plant efficiencies drove the gains. Sales were up 1%, led by SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL Chili, WHOLLY GUACAMOLE and our Herdez line of authentic Mexican products. Sales for our chunk meats business and Compleats microwave meals were down this quarter. 
Our SKIPPY peanut butter products had a great quarter. Our traditional jarred peanut butter continues to capture share in the marketplace as our sales team gains additional distribution. Our most recent innovation, SKIPPY P.B. Bites, has had many early successes and key measures such as trial and repeat are meeting our internal targets. The company continues to leverage its iconic brands in new and innovative ways. And this past April, we opened the new 14,000 square foot SPAM Museum located in downtown Austin, Minnesota. We invite you to come and visit our new family friendly museum.
Refrigerated Foods second quarter operating profit increased 13%, with sales up 7% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from strong pork operating margins, the addition of the Applegate business and great results from our foodservice business. We saw growth from many of our value-added products, including retail sales of HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE lunchmeat, HORMEL pepperoni and HORMEL party trays. Our foodservice value-added products experienced solid growth led by brands such as the AUSTIN BLUES line of products, HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats.
When we announced the Applegate acquisition in 2015, one of our top priorities was to tackle the supply constraints we identified during the acquisition. While staying true to Applegate's mission of changing the meat we eat, we have secured additional supplies, and the team is working to gain back distribution that was lost when supplies were pressured. Applegate remains on track to deliver earnings results consistent with our initial guidance for this business. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store's second quarter segment profit increased 20%, while sales decreased 4%. Results were impacted by the lingering effects of avian influenza as flocks lost in 2015 created shortfalls in operations and sales. Production volumes have now returned to normalized levels, and we remain optimistic that avian influenza is behind us. However, the team continues to be diligent and heightened biosecurity remains a top focus. We remain focused on gaining back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak, but we did enjoy growth this quarter in our JENNIE-O lean ground turkey, retail bacon and OVEN READY product lines. 
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 74%. The increase was aided in part by a favorable comparison to expenses last year related to the closure of the CytoSport production facility. Operational synergies captured in the current year within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain also contributed to the increase. MUSCLE MILK sports nutrition products posted excellent results, in addition to launching many new innovative items such as MUSCLE MILK protein smoothies. The gains made by our CytoSport team were offset by lower Contract Packaging sales, resulting in a 5% decrease in sales this quarter. 
International's operating profit decreased 33%, and sales declined 17%. Weak exports of our SPAM and SKIPPY family of products, in addition to soft pork export markets, contributed to the declines. Our China meat business had a difficult comparison to last year in addition to pressures from higher pork raw material costs. Our SKIPPY business in Mainland China experienced nice growth this quarter. We expect input cost tailwinds to continue for Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products. We look for these segments to continue driving year-over-year gains in sales and operating profits through increases in our value-added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store production is now at normalized levels, and we are positioned to deliver growth in the back half of the year, provided there are no significant reoccurrences of avian influenza.  The team is investing in their fourth Make The Switch advertising campaign, highlighting turkey as an alternative to beef. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the second half of the year.
The Specialty Foods segment may show year-over-year sales and earnings declines due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. Positive sales trends in the MUSCLE MILK brand and incremental sales from new innovative MUSCLE MILK products will offset some of the sales declines. With the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and to reflect the enhanced margin profile of CytoSport, we are increasing our segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods to 11% to 14%, up from the previously guided 8% to 11%. 
We look for the International segment to return to growth in the second half, through increased export sales of our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products, along with gradual improvement in our China retail meats business. We continue to reinvest into our businesses through increased advertising and marketing support for brands such as HORMEL Pepperoni, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, MUSCLE MILK protein products and Jennie-O Turkey. As a result of the strong second quarter and continued confidence in our position heading into the back half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.50 to $1.56 per share to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $215.4 million, up 20% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40, a 21% increase. Sales for the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion compared to $2.28 billion for the same period last year, a 1% increase. Turkey supply shortages and lower exports pressured sales during the quarter. Volume for the second quarter was 1.28 billion pounds, down less than 1% from the same quarter last year. 
As Jeff and Jim mentioned, we have reached an agreement to acquire Justin's LLC. The purchase price is $286 million. The transaction is structured to provide an ongoing cash flow benefit resulting from the tax amortization of the stepped-up basis of assets. The net present value of this tax cash flow benefit is estimated to be about $70 million. We expect fiscal 2016 to include about 4 months of results from Justin's with a slightly negative impact to earnings after factoring in the expected transaction costs and fair value adjustments. We estimate accretion associated with the deal to be approximately $0.01 for fiscal 2017. We expect to gain supply chain synergies that will be implemented over the next several years. We plan to finance this transaction with cash on hand and a short-term draw from our credit facility. Following the close, we will remain in a strong financial position to fund any other capital needs. 
Advertising expense for the quarter was $48.8 million compared to $39.5 million last year, as we continue to build on our brand investment. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.6% versus 34.6% in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 529.9 million compared to 528.1 million last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 543.8 million shares compared to 540.9 million last year. We repurchased 160,000 shares of common stock, spending $6.4 million in the second quarter. We have 15.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66.4 million compared to $27.3 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.1 million compared to $33 million last year.  As Jim mentioned earlier, we raised our fiscal 2016 earning guidance range to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. This guidance includes the sale of our Diamond Crystal business and the acquisition of Justin's LLC. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We paid our 351st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 16, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share.

Earnings in the second quarter were $0.40 per share, up a robust 21% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, a 1% increase despite lower turkey volumes at Jennie-O Turkey Store and soft export demand in our International segment. 
We reached an agreement to sell Diamond Crystal Brands in the second quarter and completed the transaction in recent days. This business, which was part of our Specialty Foods segment, represented approximately $260 million of annual sales. While Diamond Crystal Brands performed acceptably, it did not fit our long-term strategic priorities. As a result of the transaction, there was a small goodwill impairment recorded this quarter to reflect the final sales price. Our Specialty Foods Group will retain Hormel Health Labs, a provider of nutritional foods and beverages developed specifically for individuals with special dietary needs, which was previously a part of Diamond Crystal Brands. We continue to ensure a smooth transition for the customers and employees of Diamond Crystal Brands.
In addition to our earnings release this morning, we also announced the acquisition of Justin's LLC, a pioneer in the specialty nut butter category. The acquisition comes with the fast-growing Justin's brand of natural and organic products, a strong management team, access to new customers and several manufacturing agreements. The deal is subject to the customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in the United States, and is expected to close within 60 days. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will provide additional details about the Justin's acquisition and also take you through each segment."

Since Justin's was founded in 2004, the business has experienced tremendous growth. Looking forward, we expect Justin's to grow at low double-digit rates from a starting point of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2017 net sales. Justin's will report into the Grocery Products segment.
Justin's enhances our scale in the nut butter category, complementing our SKIPPY brand positioning very nicely. The JUSTIN'S brand gives us a great platform in natural and organic specialty nut butter spreads, the fastest-growing portion of the nut butter category. JUSTIN'S also further balances our portfolio of brands towards younger, more health-conscious and on-the-go consumers with their pioneering squeeze packs, a portable snack that comes in all 7 of JUSTIN'S nut butter flavors. We intend to leverage key Hormel Foods resources and supply chain, finance and R&D, while leaving their mission and vision unchanged. We look forward to working with the Justin's team in Boulder, Colorado and finalizing the acquisition in the coming weeks. I will now take you through each segment. 
Grocery Products segment profit was up 21% for the quarter. Input cost tailwinds and improved plant efficiencies drove the gains. Sales were up 1%, led by SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL Chili, WHOLLY GUACAMOLE and our Herdez line of authentic Mexican products. Sales for our chunk meats business and Compleats microwave meals were down this quarter. 
Our SKIPPY peanut butter products had a great quarter. Our traditional jarred peanut butter continues to capture share in the marketplace as our sales team gains additional distribution. Our most recent innovation, SKIPPY P.B. Bites, has had many early successes and key measures such as trial and repeat are meeting our internal targets. The company continues to leverage its iconic brands in new and innovative ways. And this past April, we opened the new 14,000 square foot SPAM Museum located in downtown Austin, Minnesota. We invite you to come and visit our new family friendly museum.
Refrigerated Foods second quarter operating profit increased 13%, with sales up 7% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from strong pork operating margins, the addition of the Applegate business and great results from our foodservice business. We saw growth from many of our value-added products, including retail sales of HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE lunchmeat, HORMEL pepperoni and HORMEL party trays. Our foodservice value-added products experienced solid growth led by brands such as the AUSTIN BLUES line of products, HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats.
When we announced the Applegate acquisition in 2015, one of our top priorities was to tackle the supply constraints we identified during the acquisition. While staying true to Applegate's mission of changing the meat we eat, we have secured additional supplies, and the team is working to gain back distribution that was lost when supplies were pressured. Applegate remains on track to deliver earnings results consistent with our initial guidance for this business. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store's second quarter segment profit increased 20%, while sales decreased 4%. Results were impacted by the lingering effects of avian influenza as flocks lost in 2015 created shortfalls in operations and sales. Production volumes have now returned to normalized levels, and we remain optimistic that avian influenza is behind us. However, the team continues to be diligent and heightened biosecurity remains a top focus. We remain focused on gaining back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak, but we did enjoy growth this quarter in our JENNIE-O lean ground turkey, retail bacon and OVEN READY product lines. 
Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 74%. The increase was aided in part by a favorable comparison to expenses last year related to the closure of the CytoSport production facility. Operational synergies captured in the current year within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain also contributed to the increase. MUSCLE MILK sports nutrition products posted excellent results, in addition to launching many new innovative items such as MUSCLE MILK protein smoothies. The gains made by our CytoSport team were offset by lower Contract Packaging sales, resulting in a 5% decrease in sales this quarter. 
International's operating profit decreased 33%, and sales declined 17%. Weak exports of our SPAM and SKIPPY family of products, in addition to soft pork export markets, contributed to the declines. Our China meat business had a difficult comparison to last year in addition to pressures from higher pork raw material costs. Our SKIPPY business in Mainland China experienced nice growth this quarter. We expect input cost tailwinds to continue for Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products. We look for these segments to continue driving year-over-year gains in sales and operating profits through increases in our value-added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store production is now at normalized levels, and we are positioned to deliver growth in the back half of the year, provided there are no significant reoccurrences of avian influenza.  The team is investing in their fourth Make The Switch advertising campaign, highlighting turkey as an alternative to beef. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the second half of the year.
The Specialty Foods segment may show year-over-year sales and earnings declines due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. Positive sales trends in the MUSCLE MILK brand and incremental sales from new innovative MUSCLE MILK products will offset some of the sales declines. With the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and to reflect the enhanced margin profile of CytoSport, we are increasing our segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods to 11% to 14%, up from the previously guided 8% to 11%. 
We look for the International segment to return to growth in the second half, through increased export sales of our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products, along with gradual improvement in our China retail meats business. We continue to reinvest into our businesses through increased advertising and marketing support for brands such as HORMEL Pepperoni, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, MUSCLE MILK protein products and Jennie-O Turkey. As a result of the strong second quarter and continued confidence in our position heading into the back half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.50 to $1.56 per share to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter."

Sales for the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion compared to $2.28 billion for the same period last year, a 1% increase. Turkey supply shortages and lower exports pressured sales during the quarter. Volume for the second quarter was 1.28 billion pounds, down less than 1% from the same quarter last year. 
As Jeff and Jim mentioned, we have reached an agreement to acquire Justin's LLC. The purchase price is $286 million. The transaction is structured to provide an ongoing cash flow benefit resulting from the tax amortization of the stepped-up basis of assets. The net present value of this tax cash flow benefit is estimated to be about $70 million. We expect fiscal 2016 to include about 4 months of results from Justin's with a slightly negative impact to earnings after factoring in the expected transaction costs and fair value adjustments. We estimate accretion associated with the deal to be approximately $0.01 for fiscal 2017. We expect to gain supply chain synergies that will be implemented over the next several years. We plan to finance this transaction with cash on hand and a short-term draw from our credit facility. Following the close, we will remain in a strong financial position to fund any other capital needs. 
Advertising expense for the quarter was $48.8 million compared to $39.5 million last year, as we continue to build on our brand investment. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.6% versus 34.6% in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 529.9 million compared to 528.1 million last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 543.8 million shares compared to 540.9 million last year. We repurchased 160,000 shares of common stock, spending $6.4 million in the second quarter. We have 15.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66.4 million compared to $27.3 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.1 million compared to $33 million last year.  As Jim mentioned earlier, we raised our fiscal 2016 earning guidance range to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. This guidance includes the sale of our Diamond Crystal business and the acquisition of Justin's LLC. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We paid our 351st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 16, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share.

Before we get into this quarter's results, I want to express my appreciation for all the contributions Jody Feragen has made to Hormel Foods.

Before we get into this quarter's results, I want to express my appreciation for all the contributions Jody Feragen has made to Hormel Foods. As previously announced, Jody will be retiring as CFO at the end of the fiscal year, so this will be her last earnings call. Jody has been a dynamite CFO. During her tenure, our team has delivered exceptional returns to our shareholders. She was instrumental in helping to complete over $2.7 billion in strategic acquisitions that have transformed our portfolio, and she oversaw close to $1.6 billion in dividends delivered to our shareholders. Jody also led numerous initiatives across the accounting, treasury, information technology, corporate development and investor relations areas that have made our company better. Jody will be missed around the office, and we wish her well in her well-earned retirement with her husband Wayne. 
Hormel Foods is fortunate to have a very strong bench of talent throughout our organization, and the accounting and finance areas are no exception. Jim Snee will assume the CFO position upon Jody's retirement, with a deep knowledge of all areas of finance and accounting, emanating from his experience at Hormel Foods as Controller, Treasurer and in numerous other roles. We have the utmost confidence in Jim's leadership and capabilities in this new role. 
Now on to the results. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter results of $0.36 per share, up 33% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, up 5%, while volume was up 1%. 3 of our 5 segments reported sales and volumes and earnings growth Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and International all posted excellent results. Grocery Products enjoyed modest top line growth, though earnings were flat for the quarter. The Specialty Foods segment saw declines in sales and earnings due to the previously announced divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands in May. 
I would like to take this opportunity to reconfirm that our long-term goals of 5% sales growth and 10% bottom line growth continue to be appropriate for our company. While we recognize any given year may deviate from these goals, we believe they are achievable over the long run due to our proven ability to build strong brands that resonate with consumers, innovate in categories where we compete, make strategic acquisitions and achieve balanced growth in various market conditions. 
For the past 2 years, we have also provided segment margin ranges. These ranges were intended to offer enhanced clarity to our business. Unfortunately, we believe they have added elements of confusion as they have not always been aligned with our primary performance goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line growth, and they were not intended to be quarterly ranges. In light of this, we have decided to curtail the practice of providing segment-labeled ranges going forward. However, we will provide an updated total company margin target during the fourth quarter call that we feel is achievable over the next 3 to 5 years. This long-term total company margin target will be consistent with and supported by our company growth goals. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will take you through each segment."

Refrigerated Foods third quarter operating profit increased 24%, with sales up 9% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from the addition of the Applegate business, favorable market conditions and great results from our foodservice business. And in addition, prior year results did include $8.6 million in Applegate transaction costs. 
Our foodservice value-added product showed robust growth, led by brands such as HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, OLD SMOKEHOUSE bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats. We also saw sales growth from many of our retail products, including HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE lunchmeat and HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store third quarter segment profit increased 59% on a 20% increase in sales. Production volumes returned to normalized levels during the quarter, which enabled the foodservice and deli teams to deliver strong volume sales and margin gains. We also saw nice retail sales growth in Jennie-O Turkey bacon. 
Our retail division at Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to gain back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak last year, even as competitive activity has heightened in the broader ground meats category. International sales and operating profits both increased 5%. Strong exports of fresh pork, SKIPPY peanut butter and SPAM luncheon meats all contributed to the increase in sales and earnings. 
Our China business posted strong earnings growth, as SKIPPY peanut butter products more than offset declines in processed meats. Higher pork costs continue to pressure the domestic retail China business. 
Grocery Products segment profit was flat for the quarter as earnings from value-added products did not offset increased advertising expenses and acquisition transaction cost related to the Justin's deal. Sales were up 3%, aided by the inclusion of Justin's specialty nut butters and strong sales from SKIPPY peanut butter, SPAM luncheon meat and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE. 
Our Grocery Products team continues to deliver exciting and innovative new products such as SKIPPY P.B. Bites and Herdez guacamole salsa. Both recently introduced products are exceeding our expectations in the marketplace. 
Specialty Foods segment profit decreased 13% and sales decreased 25%, primarily due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands and reductions in contract manufacturing sales. Our CytoSport team posted strong growth for MUSCLE MILK protein beverages and powders once again this quarter. We continue to be pleased with the new MUSCLE MILK protein smoothies, which have been well received by consumers. 
Now as we look forward into the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to continue growing sales and earnings through increases in value-added products in both the retail and foodservice channels. 
Our early view on fiscal 2017 shows a roughly 2% to 3% increase in hog supply. With the majority of new industry capacity coming online starting in the summer of 2017, we expect to see favorable market conditions through most of fiscal 2017. 
Jennie-O Turkey Store is positioned to show strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter and continues to be focused on regaining distribution. Lower grain input cost should continue to be a tailwind in the fourth quarter. 
As we announced in the second quarter call, we are excited to be back on air in the second half of the year with our various successful Make The Switch campaign. We expect this advertising campaign to help improve distribution and growth of our Jennie-O ground turkey products. We expect continued growth in our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products to drive fourth quarter results for the International segment. Grocery Products is expected to show strong sales growth, driven by the inclusion of Justin's and positive momentum in SKIPPY peanut butter and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. 
The MUSCLE MILK brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories, and we expect that to continue. We're also very excited about the innovations the CytoSport team will be delivering in the fourth quarter. The Specialty Foods segment will not show year-over-year sales and earnings growth due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. 
And finally, we continue to focus our marketing and advertising efforts on brands such as HORMEL Pepperoni, Applegate, HORMEL BLACK LABEL bacon, HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE, SPAM and Jennie-O. These marketing and advertising efforts are supplemented by the great work being done by our direct sales forces in both retail and foodservice channels. And we are extremely proud to report that just this week, Hormel Foods was ranked #1 in the 50 Best Companies to Sell For ranking by selling Power Magazine. This is a huge honor for the company and is further confirmation of the strength of our brands and sales teams. 
So as a result of the strong third quarter performance, onetime gains from various discrete tax events and continued confidence in our business, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.56 to $1.60 per share to $1.60 to $1.64 per share. And our early look into fiscal 2017 shows us once again growing sales and earnings. We will have more precise guidance for you on our fourth quarter call. 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

Sales for the third quarter totaled $2.30 billion compared to $2.19 billion for the same period last year, a 5% increase. 4 of our 5 segments delivered revenue increases. Specialty Foods sales declined due primarily to the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands. Volume for the third quarter was 1.22 billion pounds, up 1% from the same quarter last year. Tonnage was negatively impacted by the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture. 
The Jennie-O Turkey Store results for the third quarter included a $9.6 million mark-to-market loss on hedges due to temporary ineffectiveness. Advertising expense for the quarter was $52.6 million compared to $33.9 million last year as we continued to invest in our brands across all 5 segments. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 28.6% versus 35.6% in fiscal 2015. The rate was favorably impacted by $14 million of onetime discrete tax items associated primarily with an international entity restructuring. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 32% and 32.5%, including the onetime discrete items from the third quarter. 
Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was a 529.7 million compared to 528.5 million shares last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 542.2 million shares compared to 541.2 million last year. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock, spending $38.6 million in the third quarter. We have 14.3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. 
Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66 million compared to $41.8 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.6 million compared to $33.3 million last year. We paid our 352nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter.

And you're dealing at variable to both sales and earnings for each business unit when you get into a margin like that. I'd point to our performance at Jennie-O Turkey Store this quarter is a good example of why we believe the segment margin percentage is maybe a less meaningful measure. On an operating percentage basis, you could look at Q3 and say, ""Oh, that was a bad quarter for Jennie-O Turkey Store because it's operating margins fell.""

Where it has been if you continue to be in a fairly deflationary protein price environment for at least the next 18 months, which to me would suggest that to get anywhere close to that 5% and maybe it's more like 3% to 4% organic, volumes are going to have to carry a bigger portion of that total mix.

Because you look at in Grocery and Refrigerated specifically, and there doesn't seem to be a tremendous amount of organic volume growth.

279042,377810882,1037041,"Hormel Foods Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 18, 2016",2016-08-18,"Earnings Calls","Hormel Foods Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Before we get into this quarter's results, I want to express my appreciation for all the contributions Jody Feragen has made to Hormel Foods.

Before we get into this quarter's results, I want to express my appreciation for all the contributions Jody Feragen has made to Hormel Foods. As previously announced, Jody will be retiring as CFO at the end of the fiscal year, so this will be her last earnings call. Jody has been a dynamite CFO. During her tenure, our team has delivered exceptional returns to our shareholders. She was instrumental in helping to complete over $2.7 billion in strategic acquisitions that have transformed our portfolio, and she oversaw close to $1.6 billion in dividends delivered to our shareholders. Jody also led numerous initiatives across the accounting, treasury, information technology, corporate development and investor relations areas that have made our company better. Jody will be missed around the office, and we wish her well in her well-earned retirement with her husband, Wayne.
Hormel Foods is fortunate to have a very strong bench of talent throughout our organization, and the accounting and finance area is no exception. Jim Sheehan will assume the CFO position upon Jody's retirement, with a deep knowledge of all areas of finance and accounting emanating from his experience at Hormel Foods as Controller, Treasurer and in numerous other roles. We have the utmost confidence in Jim's leadership and capabilities in this new role.
Now on to the results. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter results of $0.36 per share, up 33% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, up 5%, while volume was up 1%. 3 of our 5 segments reported sales, volume and earnings growth. Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and International all posted excellent results. Grocery Products enjoyed modest top line growth, though earnings were flat for the quarter. The Specialty Foods segment saw declines in sales and earnings due to the previously announced divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands in May.
I would like to take this opportunity to reconfirm that our long-term goals of 5% sales growth and 10% bottom line growth continue to be appropriate for our company. While we recognize any given year may deviate from these goals, we believe they are achievable over the long run due to our proven ability to build strong brands that resonate with consumers, innovate in categories where we compete, make strategic acquisitions and achieve balanced growth in various market conditions.
For the past 2 years, we have also provided segment margin ranges. These ranges were intended to offer enhanced clarity to our business. Unfortunately, we believe they have added elements of confusion as they have not always been aligned with our primary performance goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line growth, and they were not intended to be quarterly ranges. In light of this, we have decided to curtail the practice of providing segment-labeled ranges going forward. However, we will provide an updated total company margin target during the fourth quarter call that we feel is achievable over the next 3 to 5 years. This long-term total company margin target will be consistent with and supported by our company growth goals.
I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will take you through each segment."

Refrigerated Foods third quarter operating profit increased 24%, with sales up 9% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from the addition of the Applegate business, favorable market conditions and great results from our foodservice business. And in addition, prior year results did include $8.6 million in Applegate transaction costs.
Our foodservice value-added product showed robust growth, led by brands such as HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, OLD SMOKEHOUSE bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats. We also saw sales growth from many of our retail products, including HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE lunchmeat and HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays.
Jennie-O Turkey Store third quarter segment profit increased 59% on a 20% increase in sales. Production volumes returned to normalized levels during the quarter, which enabled the foodservice and deli teams to deliver strong volume sales and margin gains. We also saw nice retail sales growth in Jennie-O Turkey bacon.
Our retail division at Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to gain back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak last year, even as competitive activity has heightened in the broader ground meats category.
International sales and operating profits both increased 5%. Strong exports of fresh pork, SKIPPY peanut butter and SPAM luncheon meats all contributed to the increase in sales and earnings.  Our China business posted strong earnings growth as SKIPPY peanut butter products more than offset declines in processed meats. Higher pork costs continue to pressure the domestic retail China business.
Grocery Products segment profit was flat for the quarter as earnings from value-added products did not offset increased advertising expenses and acquisition transaction costs related to the Justin's deal. Sales were up 3%, aided by the inclusion of JUSTIN'S specialty nut butters and strong sales from SKIPPY peanut butter, SPAM luncheon meat and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE. Our Grocery Products team continues to deliver exciting and innovative new products such as SKIPPY P.B. Bites and HERDEZ guacamole salsa. Both recently introduced products are exceeding our expectations in the marketplace.
Specialty Foods segment profit decreased 13% and sales decreased 25%, primarily due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands and reductions in contract manufacturing sales. Our CytoSport team posted strong growth for MUSCLE MILK protein beverages and powders once again this quarter. We continue to be pleased with the new MUSCLE MILK protein smoothies, which have been well received by consumers.
Now as we look forward into the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to continue growing sales and earnings through increases in value-added products in both the retail and foodservice channels.
Our early view on fiscal 2017 shows a roughly 2% to 3% increase in hog supply. With the majority of new industry capacity coming online starting in the summer of 2017, we expect to see favorable market conditions through most of fiscal 2017.
Jennie-O Turkey Store is positioned to show strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter and continues to be focused on regaining distribution. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the fourth quarter.
As we announced in the second quarter call, we are excited to be back on air in the second half of the year with our various successful Make The Switch campaign. We expect this advertising campaign to help improve distribution and growth of our JENNIE-O ground turkey products. We expect continued growth in our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products to drive fourth quarter results for the International segment. Grocery Products is expected to show strong sales growth, driven by the inclusion of Justin's and positive momentum in SKIPPY peanut butter and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips.
The MUSCLE MILK brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories, and we expect that to continue. We're also very excited about the innovations the CytoSport team will be delivering in the fourth quarter. The Specialty Foods segment will not show year-over-year sales and earnings growth due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business.
And finally, we continue to focus our marketing and advertising efforts on brands such as HORMEL Pepperoni, Applegate, HORMEL BLACK LABEL bacon, HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE, SPAM and JENNIE-O. These marketing and advertising efforts are supplemented by the great work being done by our direct sales forces in both retail and foodservice channels. And we are extremely proud to report that just this week, Hormel Foods was ranked #1 in the 50 Best Companies to Sell For ranking by Selling Power Magazine. This is a huge honor for the company and is further confirmation of the strength of our brands and sales teams.
So as a result of the strong third quarter performance, onetime gains from various discrete tax events and continued confidence in our business, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.56 to $1.60 per share to $1.60 to $1.64 per share. And our early look into fiscal 2017 shows us once again growing sales and earnings. We will have more precise guidance for you on our fourth quarter call.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

Sales for the third quarter totaled $2.30 billion compared to $2.19 billion for the same period last year, a 5% increase. 4 of our 5 segments delivered revenue increases. Specialty Foods sales declined due primarily to the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands. Volume for the third quarter was 1.22 billion pounds, up 1% from the same quarter last year. Tonnage was negatively impacted by the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture. The Jennie-O Turkey Store results for the third quarter included a $9.6 million mark-to-market loss on hedges due to temporary ineffectiveness.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $52.6 million compared to $33.9 million last year as we continued to invest in our brands across all 5 segments.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 28.6% versus 35.6% in fiscal 2015. The rate was favorably impacted by $14 million of onetime discrete tax items associated primarily with an international entity restructuring. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 32% and 32.5%, including the onetime discrete items from the third quarter.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 529.7 million compared to 528.5 million shares last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 542.2 million shares compared to 541.2 million last year. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock, spending $38.6 million in the third quarter. We have 14.3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.
Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66 million compared to $41.8 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.6 million compared to $33.3 million last year. We paid our 352nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter.

We've found that providing the individual segment operating margin ranges seem to sometimes distract from these goals. And honestly, we've not proven to be overly accurate in estimating the margins for each segment. Things come up, the Jennie-O AI issue, the DCB divestiture, et cetera. And you're dealing with variables to both sales and earnings for each business unit when you get into a margin like that. I'd point that our performance at Jennie-O Turkey Store this quarter is a good example of why we believe the segment margin percentage is maybe a less meaningful measure. On an operating percentage basis, you could look at Q3 and say, ""Oh, that was a bad quarter for Jennie-O Turkey Store because it's operating margins fell."" But this would obscure the fact that Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a $20 million improvement in segment profit for the quarter. Honestly, we're seeking to deliver sales and earnings dollars and not specific percentages."

The chunk meats category, which -- it's not a huge part of the portfolio, but that's become competitive, and our team is working on really taking a different approach with the product offerings that we have there. Again, we talked about completes being down, and we're working very strategically to expand the availability of some of the value-tier offerings and really increasing the sales or unit rates. And so for them, it was a mixed bag, but I think we still feel very positive in the outlook for Grocery Products going forward.

Before we get into this quarter's results, I want to express my appreciation for all the contributions Jody Feragen has made to Hormel Foods. As previously announced, Jody will be retiring as CFO at the end of the fiscal year, so t",530,"Good morning, everyone. Before we get into this quarter's results, I want to express my appreciation for all the contributions Jody Feragen has made to Hormel Foods. As previously announced, Jody will be retiring as CFO at the end of the fiscal year, so this will be her last earnings call. Jody has been a dynamite CFO. During her tenure, our team has delivered exceptional returns to our shareholders. She was instrumental in helping to complete over $2.7 billion in strategic acquisitions that have transformed our portfolio, and she oversaw close to $1.6 billion in dividends delivered to our shareholders. Jody also led numerous initiatives across the accounting, treasury, information technology, corporate development and investor relations areas that have made our company better. Jody will be missed around the office, and we wish her well in her well-earned retirement with her husband, Duane.
Hormel Foods is fortunate to have a very strong bench of talent throughout our organization, and the accounting and finance area is no exception. Jim Sheehan will assume the CFO position upon Jody's retirement, with a deep knowledge of all areas of finance and accounting emanating from his experience at Hormel Foods as Controller, Treasurer and in numerous other roles. We have the utmost confidence in Jim's leadership and capabilities in this new role.
Now on to the results. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter results of $0.36 per share, up 33% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, up 5%, while volume was up 1%. 3 of our 5 segments reported sales, volume and earnings growth. Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and International all posted excellent results. Grocery Products enjoyed modest top line growth, though earnings were flat for the quarter. The Specialty Foods segment saw declines in sales and earnings due to the previously announced divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands in May.
I would like to take this opportunity to reconfirm that our long-term goals of 5% sales growth and 10% bottom line growth continue to be appropriate for our company. While we recognize any given year may deviate from these goals, we believe they are achievable over the long run due to our proven ability to build strong brands that resonate with consumers, innovate in categories where we compete, make strategic acquisitions and achieve balanced growth in various market conditions.
For the past 2 years, we have also provided segment margin ranges. These ranges were intended to offer enhanced clarity to our business. Unfortunately, we believe they have added elements of confusion, as they have not always been aligned with our primary performance goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line growth, and they were not intended to be quarterly ranges. In light of this, we have decided to curtail the practice of providing segment-level ranges going forward. However, we will provide an updated total company margin target during the fourth quarter call that we feel is achievable over the next 3 to 5 years. This long-term total company margin target will be consistent with and supported by our company growth goals.
I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will take you through each segment."

Refrigerated Foods third quarter operating profit increased 24%, with sales up 9% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from the addition of the Applegate business, favorable market conditions and great results from our foodservice business. And in addition, prior year results did include $8.6 million in Applegate transaction costs.
Our foodservice value-added products showed robust growth, led by brands such as HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, Old Smokehouse bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats. We also saw sales growth from many of our retail products, including HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE lunchmeat and HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays.
Jennie-O Turkey Store third quarter segment profit increased 59% on a 20% increase in sales. Production volumes returned to normalized levels during the quarter, which enabled the foodservice and deli teams to deliver strong volume sales and margin gains. We also saw nice retail sales growth in Jennie-O turkey bacon.
Our retail division at Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to gain back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak last year, even as competitive activity has heightened in the broader ground meats category.
International sales and operating profits both increased 5%. Strong exports of fresh pork, SKIPPY peanut butter and SPAM luncheon meats all contributed to the increase in sales and earnings.  Our China business posted strong earnings growth as SKIPPY peanut butter products more than offset declines in processed meats. Higher pork costs continue to pressure the domestic retail China business.
Grocery Products segment profit was flat for the quarter as earnings from value-added products did not offset increased advertising expenses and acquisition transaction costs related to the Justin's deal. Sales were up 3%, aided by the inclusion of JUSTIN'S specialty nut butters and strong sales from SKIPPY peanut butter, SPAM luncheon meat and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE. Our Grocery Products team continues to deliver exciting and innovative new products such as SKIPPY P.B. Bites and HERDEZ guacamole salsa. Both recently introduced products are exceeding our expectations in the marketplace.
Specialty Foods segment profit decreased 13% and sales decreased 25%, primarily due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands and reductions in contract manufacturing sales. Our CytoSport team posted strong growth for MUSCLE MILK protein beverages and powders once again this quarter. We continue to be pleased with the new MUSCLE MILK protein smoothies, which have been well received by consumers.
Now as we look forward into the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to continue growing sales and earnings through increases in value-added products in both the retail and foodservice channels.
Our early view on fiscal 2017 shows a roughly 2% to 3% increase in hog supply. With the majority of new industry capacity coming online starting in the summer of 2017, we expect to see favorable market conditions through most of fiscal 2017.
Jennie-O Turkey Store is positioned to show strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter and continues to be focused on regaining distribution. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the fourth quarter.
As we announced in the second quarter call, we are excited to be back on the air in the second half of the year with our very successful Make The Switch campaign. We expect this advertising campaign to help improve distribution and growth of our JENNIE-O ground turkey products. We expect continued growth in our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products to drive fourth quarter results for the International segment. Grocery Products is expected to show strong sales growth, driven by the inclusion of Justin's and positive momentum in SKIPPY peanut butter and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips.
The MUSCLE MILK brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories, and we expect that to continue. We're also very excited about the innovations the CytoSport team will be delivering in the fourth quarter. The Specialty Foods segment will not show year-over-year sales and earnings growth due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business.
And finally, we continue to focus our marketing and advertising efforts on brands such as HORMEL Pepperoni, Applegate, HORMEL BLACK LABEL bacon, HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE, SPAM and JENNIE-O. These marketing and advertising efforts are supplemented by the great work being done by our direct sales forces in both retail and foodservice channels. And we are extremely proud to report that just this week, Hormel Foods was ranked #1 in the 50 Best Companies to Sell For ranking by Selling Power Magazine. This is a huge honor for the company and is further confirmation of the strength of our brands and sales teams.
So as a result of the strong third quarter performance, onetime gains from various discrete tax events and continued confidence in our business, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.56 to $1.60 per share to $1.60 to $1.64 per share. And our early look into fiscal 2017 shows us once again growing sales and earnings. We will have more precise guidance for you on our fourth quarter call.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

Specialty Foods sales declined due primarily to the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands. Volume for the third quarter was 1.22 billion pounds, up 1% from the same quarter last year. Tonnage was negatively impacted by the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture. The Jennie-O Turkey Store results for the third quarter included a $9.6 million mark-to-market loss on hedges due to temporary ineffectiveness.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $52.6 million, compared to $33.9 million last year, as we continue to invest in our brands across all 5 segments.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 28.6% versus 35.6% in fiscal 2015. The rate was favorably impacted by $14 million of onetime discrete tax items associated primarily with an international entity restructuring. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 32% and 32.5%, including the onetime discrete items from the third quarter.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 529.7 million, compared to 528.5 million shares last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 542.2 million shares, compared to 541.2 million last year. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock, spending $38.6 million in the third quarter. We have 14.3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.
Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66 million compared to $41.8 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.6 million compared to $33.3 million last year. We paid our 352nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter.

And you're dealing with variables at both sales and earnings for each business unit when you get into a margin like that. I'd point to our performance at Jennie-O Turkey Store this quarter as a good example of why we believe the segment margin percentage is maybe a less meaningful measure. On an operating percentage basis, you could look at Q3 and say, ""Oh, that was a bad quarter for Jennie-O Turkey Store because it's operating margins fell."" But this would obscure the fact that Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a $20 million improvement in segment profit for the quarter.

And there's no doubt that there is competition in the meat case. But I guess I would just reiterate that it's not unusual.

Before we get into this quarter's results, I want to express my appreciation for all the contributions Jody Feragen has made to Hormel Foods. As previously announced, Jody will be retiring as CFO at the end of the fiscal year, so t",530,"Good morning, everyone. Before we get into this quarter's results, I want to express my appreciation for all the contributions Jody Feragen has made to Hormel Foods. As previously announced, Jody will be retiring as CFO at the end of the fiscal year, so this will be her last earnings call. Jody has been a dynamite CFO. During her tenure, our team has delivered exceptional returns to our shareholders. She was instrumental in helping to complete over $2.7 billion in strategic acquisitions that have transformed our portfolio, and she oversaw close to $1.6 billion in dividends delivered to our shareholders. Jody also led numerous initiatives across the accounting, treasury, information technology, corporate development and investor relations areas that have made our company better. Jody will be missed around the office, and we wish her well in her well-earned retirement with her husband, Duane.
Hormel Foods is fortunate to have a very strong bench of talent throughout our organization, and the accounting and finance area is no exception. Jim Sheehan will assume the CFO position upon Jody's retirement, with a deep knowledge of all areas of finance and accounting emanating from his experience at Hormel Foods as Controller, Treasurer and in numerous other roles. We have the utmost confidence in Jim's leadership and capabilities in this new role.
Now on to the results. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter results of $0.36 per share, up 33% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, up 5%, while volume was up 1%. 3 of our 5 segments reported sales, volume and earnings growth. Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and International all posted excellent results. Grocery Products enjoyed modest top line growth, though earnings were flat for the quarter. The Specialty Foods segment saw declines in sales and earnings due to the previously announced divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands in May.
I would like to take this opportunity to reconfirm that our long-term goals of 5% sales growth and 10% bottom line growth continue to be appropriate for our company. While we recognize any given year may deviate from these goals, we believe they are achievable over the long run due to our proven ability to build strong brands that resonate with consumers, innovate in categories where we compete, make strategic acquisitions and achieve balanced growth in various market conditions.
For the past 2 years, we have also provided segment margin ranges. These ranges were intended to offer enhanced clarity to our business. Unfortunately, we believe they have added elements of confusion as they have not always been aligned with our primary performance goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line growth, and they were not intended to be quarterly ranges. In light of this, we have decided to curtail the practice of providing segment-level ranges going forward. However, we will provide an updated total company margin target during the fourth quarter call that we feel is achievable over the next 3 to 5 years. This long-term total company margin target will be consistent with and supported by our company growth goals.
I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will take you through each segment."

Refrigerated Foods third quarter operating profit increased 24%, with sales up 9% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from the addition of the Applegate business, favorable market conditions and great results from our foodservice business. And in addition, prior year results did include $8.6 million in Applegate transaction costs.
Our foodservice value-added products showed robust growth, led by brands such as HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, Old Smokehouse bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats. We also saw sales growth from many of our retail products, including HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE lunchmeat and HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays.
Jennie-O Turkey Store third quarter segment profit increased 59% on a 20% increase in sales. Production volumes returned to normalized levels during the quarter, which enabled the foodservice and deli teams to deliver strong volume sales and margin gains. We also saw nice retail sales growth in Jennie-O turkey bacon.
Our retail division at Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to gain back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak last year, even as competitive activity has heightened in the broader ground meats category.
International sales and operating profits both increased 5%. Strong exports of fresh pork, SKIPPY peanut butter and SPAM luncheon meats all contributed to the increase in sales and earnings. Our China business posted strong earnings growth as SKIPPY peanut butter products more than offset declines in processed meats. Higher pork costs continue to pressure the domestic retail China business.
Grocery Products segment profit was flat for the quarter as earnings from value-added products did not offset increased advertising expenses and acquisition transaction costs related to the Justin's deal. Sales were up 3%, aided by the inclusion of JUSTIN'S specialty nut butters and strong sales from SKIPPY peanut butter, SPAM luncheon meat and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE. Our Grocery Products team continues to deliver exciting and innovative new products such as SKIPPY P.B. Bites and HERDEZ guacamole salsa. Both recently introduced products are exceeding our expectations in the marketplace.
Specialty Foods segment profit decreased 13% and sales decreased 25%, primarily due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands and reductions in contract manufacturing sales. Our CytoSport team posted strong growth for MUSCLE MILK protein beverages and powders once again this quarter. We continue to be pleased with the new MUSCLE MILK protein smoothies, which have been well received by consumers.
Now as we look forward into the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to continue growing sales and earnings through increases in value-added products in both the retail and foodservice channels.
Our early view on fiscal 2017 shows a roughly 2% to 3% increase in hog supply. With the majority of new industry capacity coming online starting in the summer of 2017, we expect to see favorable market conditions through most of fiscal 2017.
Jennie-O Turkey Store is positioned to show strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter and continues to be focused on regaining distribution. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the fourth quarter.
As we announced in the second quarter call, we are excited to be back on the air in the second half of the year with our very successful Make The Switch campaign. We expect this advertising campaign to help improve distribution and growth of our JENNIE-O ground turkey products. We expect continued growth in our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products to drive fourth quarter results for the International segment. Grocery Products is expected to show strong sales growth, driven by the inclusion of Justin's and positive momentum in SKIPPY peanut butter and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips.
The MUSCLE MILK brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories, and we expect that to continue. We're also very excited about the innovations the CytoSport team will be delivering in the fourth quarter. The Specialty Foods segment will not show year-over-year sales and earnings growth due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business.
And finally, we continue to focus our marketing and advertising efforts on brands such as HORMEL Pepperoni, Applegate, HORMEL BLACK LABEL bacon, HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE, SPAM and JENNIE-O. These marketing and advertising efforts are supplemented by the great work being done by our direct sales forces in both retail and foodservice channels. And we are extremely proud to report that just this week, Hormel Foods was ranked #1 in the 50 Best Companies to Sell For ranking by Selling Power Magazine. This is a huge honor for the company and is further confirmation of the strength of our brands and sales teams.
So as a result of the strong third quarter performance, onetime gains from various discrete tax events and continued confidence in our business, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.56 to $1.60 per share to $1.60 to $1.64 per share. And our early look into fiscal 2017 shows us once again growing sales and earnings. We will have more precise guidance for you on our fourth quarter call.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter."

Sales for the third quarter totaled $2.30 billion compared to $2.19 billion for the same period last year, a 5% increase. 4 of our 5 segments delivered revenue increases. Specialty Foods sales declined due primarily to the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands. Volume for the third quarter was 1.22 billion pounds, up 1% from the same quarter last year. Tonnage was negatively impacted by the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture. The Jennie-O Turkey Store results for the third quarter included a $9.6 million mark-to-market loss on hedges due to temporary ineffectiveness.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $52.6 million compared to $33.9 million last year as we continue to invest in our brands across all 5 segments.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 28.6% versus 35.6% in fiscal 2015. The rate was favorably impacted by $14 million of onetime discrete tax items associated primarily with an international entity restructuring. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 32% and 32.5%, including the onetime discrete items from the third quarter.
The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 529.7 million compared to 528.5 million shares last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 542.2 million shares compared to 541.2 million last year. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock, spending $38.6 million in the third quarter. We have 14.3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.
Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66 million compared to $41.8 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.6 million compared to $33.3 million last year. We paid our 352nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter.

And you're dealing with variables at both sales and earnings for each business unit when you get into a margin like that. I'd point to our performance at Jennie-O Turkey Store this quarter as a good example of why we believe the segment margin percentage is maybe a less meaningful measure. On an operating percentage basis, you could look at Q3 and say, ""Oh, that was a bad quarter for Jennie-O Turkey Store because it's operating margins fell."" But this would obscure the fact that Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a $20 million improvement in segment profit for the quarter.

And we recognize we've had many consecutive quarters of great results. And obviously, there -- a key concern is whether we really can grow in 2017. So I talked in the last question about the sales side of the business and the positive momentum that we're seeing. I mean, another thing that obviously we believe in and it's served us well is our balanced business model. So we've got a favorable outlook on key inputs such as pork, beef, grains that really is going to combine with the sales momentum that will allow us to submit a plan to our Board of Directors that will show growth in earnings in 2017. And clearly, we'll give you a more precise look and range in November on the call."

Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record fourth quarter results of $0.45 per share, up 22% from last year. Sales for the quarter were up 9% on a 9% increase in volume. For the full year, earnings per share were $",1269,"Well, thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record fourth quarter results of $0.45 per share, up 22% from last year. Sales for the quarter were up 9% on a 9% increase in volume. For the full year, earnings per share were $1.64, up 24% versus fiscal 2015. Sales were $9.5 billion, up 3%; and volume was up 2%. 
For the quarter, 3 of our 5 segments recorded volume, sales and earnings growth, demonstrating the strength of our balanced business model. Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store posted excellent earnings, both up double digits. Grocery Products recorded solid gains while Specialty and international earnings were down for the quarter. I am particularly pleased with our top line results, with 4 of our segments generating sales growth.
Refrigerated Foods' fourth quarter operating profit increased 51%, with sales up 8% and volume up 9%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from excellent growth in both retail and foodservice channels and from lower input costs, notably hogs and bellies. In foodservice, items like HORMEL BACON 1 Fully cooked bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED Meats delivered solid growth, while our retail business was led by items such as APPLEGATE deli meats, HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE and HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays.
Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit increased 26%, with sales increasing 29%. Volume was up 32%. As a reminder, last year's results were negatively impacted by avian influenza. Higher bird weights and low grain prices were a benefit for the quarter. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store foodservice business performed well, with growth coming from many areas such as our Jennie-O raw boneless breast and sliced breast meat categories. We also experienced sales growth in our retail and deli businesses. We were back on air with the Jennie-O Make the Switch campaign through October and have seen a positive response once again from our consumers.
We saw strong sales growth in Grocery Products, up 16%, and segment profit was up 5%. Our legacy portfolio performed nicely with organic sales, up 10%, including gains from many brands such as SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL COMPLEATS and salsa. In addition, JUSTIN'S specialty nut butters contributed approximately $25 million in sales to the quarter and is well on track to meet our valuation pro forma and the $100 million fiscal 2017 sales we guided to when we announced the acquisition.
International sales increased 2% while operating profits decreased 16%. While we are encouraged by the results from our SKIPPY business in China, our meat business continues to be pressured by high input costs. Exports of fresh pork improved as U.S. exports became more competitive due to lower hog prices.
Specialty Foods, excluding Diamond Crystal Brands, grew sales 6% and volumes 11%. CytoSport posted excellent sales growth as they continued to introduce new innovative items in both ready-to-drink and powder formats. The CytoSport team also launched new MUSCLE MILK bars featuring 12 different flavors. Acceptance by our retail partners has been favorable. The decline in segment profit is attributed to increased advertising on a year-over-year basis for the MUSCLE MILK brand.
Innovation has been a foundation of our company's success over the last 125 years, which is why we recently announced a new innovation challenge for the year 2020: to have 15% of our total sales come from new products introduced in the previous 5 years. We finished 2016 with approximately 12% of sales from new products launched in the fiscal years 2011 to 2015. This is a stretch goal for our organization, and we expect to make substantial progress next year aided by recently introduced products as well as those in the pipeline.
Looking to fiscal 2017. We have positive momentum in each segment; employees all working towards the same goals; and numerous initiatives in each of our strategic growth pillars of global, multicultural, healthy/holistic and on-the-go.
Grocery Products is expected to show growth in excess of their long-term growth goals of 3% top line and 6% bottom line. Growth is expected to come from the positive momentum we have in SKIPPY peanut butter products, HERDEZ salsas and Wholly Guacamole dips in addition to JUSTIN'S. We will continue to invest in our key brands in 2017.
Yesterday, we announced the divestiture of the Farmer John, Saag’s and PFFJ farms businesses. While the businesses performed well, they no longer met our strategic goals. Additionally, the divestiture allows for the integration of the pork processing facility at Farmer John with the majority of live production operations, which supply the facility and are currently owned by Smithfield. This divestiture is in the best interest of our shareholders, and we continue to seek opportunities to utilize our cash towards investments aligned to our growth goals.
We are expecting decreased sales in Refrigerated Foods, as increased sales of value-added products will be offset by the divestiture of Farmer John, which represents approximately $500 million. We see continued growth coming from brands such as HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE, HORMEL GATHERINGS, HORMEL pepperoni and APPLEGATE. In addition to foodservice sales growth from HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats and Hormel Pizza Toppings. Due to the earnings per share dilution of approximately $0.03, Refrigerated Foods earnings are expected to be flat. Jim Sheehan will provide more color on the hog and pork environment in fiscal 2017.
We expect strong sales and earnings growth for the full year as the Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with retail, deli and foodservice customers and consumers. Results will be weighted to the back half of the year as the first half faces more difficult comparisons. We intend to continue our advertising investments through the Make the Switch campaign to highlight the versatility of turkey in many of our consumer's favorite recipes. 
We expect our international segment to deliver strong profitable growth. In addition to improving results in China, we anticipate stronger exports for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter and CytoSport protein products. Our international team is eager to get our Jiaxing plant up and running in the first half of the year so they can leverage new production capabilities to grow our retail and foodservice businesses.
Specialty Foods results will likely show year-over-year declines in the first half due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, but we expect organic sales and earnings increases in the back half as we anniversary the divestiture. The MUSCLE MILK brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories, and we expect those results to continue. I am also very excited about our new MUSCLE MILK smoothies and many new MUSCLE MILK items in the innovation pipeline.
As we roll up our earnings outlook, we would have expected our guidance range to be $1.71 to $1.77 per share, representing a 4% to 8% increase. We took into consideration the 3 prior years of double-digit earnings growth and the 1 less week in 2017 as compared to 2016. However, factoring in the divestiture of Farmer John business, representing earnings per share of approximately $0.03, we are setting our guidance range to $1.68 to $1.74 per share.
From a sales perspective, excluding the impact of both the Diamond Crystal Brands and Farmer John divestitures and the positive impact of the JUSTIN'S acquisition, we anticipate our business will generate organic sales in line with our long-term target of 5%. We believe our company can continue to grow at 5% top line and 10% bottom line over the long term.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and additional key drivers for 2017."

Volume in the fourth quarter was 1.4 billion pounds, a 9% increase compared to last year. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, a 9% increase also.
Excluding the impact of both the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and the JUSTIN'S acquisition, volume was up 14% and sales were up 11%. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $244 million, up 30% compared to GAAP net earnings last year of $187 million. Net earnings were up 22% compared to non-GAAP earnings of $200 million last year.
Fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year with the extra week falling in Q4. We estimate the impact from this extra week was between 1% to 1.5% for the full year.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $55 million compared to $30 million last year as we continued to invest in our brands. Looking into 2017, we anticipate advertising expenses to be similar to 2016.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $35.4 million compared to $34.4 million last year. Equity and earnings for the quarter was $11 million, up 41% compared to last year. The increase was a result of our strong results in MegaMex, with brands such as HERDEZ salsa and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE performing well in the marketplace. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33% versus 35.2% in 2015. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%
Cash flow from operations was $371 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% over last year. During the quarter, $145 million of short-term debt was repaid. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $90 million compared to $47 million last year. The increase in CapEx was primarily related to our new plant in Jiaxing, China and lean ground turkey expansion at Jennie-O Turkey Store. 
For fiscal 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million compared to $256 million in 2016. Major projects for 2017 include the completion of our plant in China and numerous capacity expansions for value-added product lines. We will continue to invest capital to support our value-added products and improve food and employee safety. 
We paid our 353rd consecutive quarterly dividend, effective November 15, at an annual rate of $0.58 per share. Our Board of Directors approved an annual dividend rate of $0.68 per share, representing a 17% increase. Fiscal 2017 will represent the 51st consecutive year of increase in our dividends. Jim Snee and I intend to continue this long-standing policy.
We repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock, spending $43 million in the fourth quarter. We have 13 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises.
As we discussed at our third quarter conference call, we're providing a total company margin goal. Our goal for 2020 is to have our EBIT margin to be in the top quartile of our peer group. Today, the top quartile range is 15% to 19%. The goal is consistent with our long-term growth goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line.
We experienced favorable input costs for the fourth quarter in many, but not all, of our businesses. Key inputs such as hog and belly prices were down compared to the fourth quarter last year. Current prices were below -- were flat, beef prices were down. Corn and soybean meal prices were lower for the quarter versus 2015. Turkey breast feed prices were below 2015 during avian influenza.
We expect favorable hog and pork markets for 2017. The USDA is calling for a 3% to 4% increase in the hog supply in 2017. The majority of the new industry capacity is anticipated to come online after the summer of 2017. We expect hog harvest levels at our Austin and Fremont plants to be down 1% due to 1 less week in the fiscal year. Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect favorable grain prices for Jennie-O Turkey Store in 2017. We anticipate turkey breast meat prices to be below 2016 levels.
Going forward, we expect lower beef and chicken input costs for our value-added products. We also see comparable prices to 2016 for other key raw materials such as peanuts and tomatoes.
One area we are watching closely is the avocado market. The avocado market increased substantially in 2016. We're maintaining an adequate supply of avocados by leveraging our global supply chain. 
Overall, we are confident the strength of our value-added products, recent acquisitions and favorable market conditions will provide Hormel another record year.
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

We're back in supply with Jennie-O Turkey Store and so really believe that all 5 business units are going to be able to show very positive contributions as we head into 2017."

Part of that, I would say, I mean, I don't know how much of it is related to industry dynamics being favorable, so I'm just trying to understand like the building blocks of the next 4 years considering or coming off or will be coming off of a pretty favorable environment in one of your segments that happens to have driven a vast majority of the increase historically. So that's my first question. And then secondly, again related to Refrigerated Foods, when this capacity does come on, which clearly you're saying in '17 doesn't look like it's going to cost any disruption. When it does come on, there's likely to be some disruption on the processing margins. How do you envision navigating through that environment from an earnings growth perspective?"

Your second question in regards to some of the capacity that's coming online, I guess, post 2017. We have navigated through volatility and delivered earnings growth 28 out of 31 years now. And so as markets change, clearly we know that we have to react. And I think that we've demonstrated that we can react, that our business can react and deliver growth.

For the full year, earnings per share were $",1269,"Well, thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record fourth quarter results of $0.45 per share, up 22% from last year. Sales for the quarter were up 9% on a 9% increase in volume. For the full year, earnings per share were $1.64, up 24% versus fiscal 2015. Sales were $9.5 billion, up 3%; and volume was up 2%. 
For the quarter, 3 of our 5 segments recorded volume, sales and earnings growth, demonstrating the strength of our balanced business model. Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store posted excellent earnings, both up double digits. Grocery Products recorded solid gains while Specialty and international earnings were down for the quarter. I am particularly pleased with our top line results, with 4 of our segments generating sales growth.
Refrigerated Foods' fourth quarter operating profit increased 51%, with sales up 8% and volume up 9%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from excellent growth in both retail and foodservice channels and from lower input costs, notably hogs and bellies. In foodservice, items like HORMEL BACON 1 Fully cooked bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED Meats delivered solid growth, while our retail business was led by items such as APPLEGATE deli meats, HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE and HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays.
Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit increased 26%, with sales increasing 29%. Volume was up 32%. As a reminder, last year's results were negatively impacted by avian influenza. Higher bird weights and low grain prices were a benefit for the quarter. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store foodservice business performed well, with growth coming from many areas such as our Jennie-O raw boneless breast and sliced breast meat categories. We also experienced sales growth in our retail and deli businesses. We were back on air with the Jennie-O Make the Switch campaign through October and have seen a positive response once again from our consumers.
We saw strong sales growth in Grocery Products, up 16%, and segment profit was up 5%. Our legacy portfolio performed nicely with organic sales, up 10%, including gains from many brands such as SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL COMPLEATS and salsa. In addition, JUSTIN'S specialty nut butters contributed approximately $25 million in sales to the quarter and is well on track to meet our valuation pro forma and the $100 million fiscal 2017 sales we guided to when we announced the acquisition.
International sales increased 2% while operating profits decreased 16%. While we are encouraged by the results from our SKIPPY business in China, our meat business continues to be pressured by high input costs. Exports of fresh pork improved as U.S. exports became more competitive due to lower hog prices.
Specialty Foods, excluding Diamond Crystal Brands, grew sales 6% and volumes 11%. CytoSport posted excellent sales growth as they continued to introduce new innovative items in both ready-to-drink and powder formats. The CytoSport team also launched new MUSCLE MILK bars featuring 12 different flavors. Acceptance by our retail partners has been favorable. The decline in segment profit is attributed to increased advertising on a year-over-year basis for the MUSCLE MILK brand.
Innovation has been a foundation of our company's success over the last 125 years, which is why we recently announced a new innovation challenge for the year 2020: to have 15% of our total sales come from new products introduced in the previous 5 years. We finished 2016 with approximately 12% of sales from new products launched in the fiscal years 2011 to 2015. This is a stretch goal for our organization, and we expect to make substantial progress next year aided by recently introduced products as well as those in the pipeline.
Looking to fiscal 2017. We have positive momentum in each segment; employees all working towards the same goals; and numerous initiatives in each of our strategic growth pillars of global, multicultural, healthy/holistic and on-the-go.
Grocery Products is expected to show growth in excess of their long-term growth goals of 3% top line and 6% bottom line. Growth is expected to come from the positive momentum we have in SKIPPY peanut butter products, HERDEZ salsas and Wholly Guacamole dips in addition to JUSTIN'S. We will continue to invest in our key brands in 2017.
Yesterday, we announced the divestiture of the Farmer John, Saag’s and PFFJ farms businesses. While the businesses performed well, they no longer met our strategic goals. Additionally, the divestiture allows for the integration of the pork processing facility at Farmer John with the majority of live production operations, which supply the facility and are currently owned by Smithfield. This divestiture is in the best interest of our shareholders, and we continue to seek opportunities to utilize our cash towards investments aligned to our growth goals.
We are expecting decreased sales in Refrigerated Foods, as increased sales of value-added products will be offset by the divestiture of Farmer John, which represents approximately $500 million. We see continued growth coming from brands such as HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE, HORMEL GATHERINGS, HORMEL pepperoni and APPLEGATE. In addition to foodservice sales growth from HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats and Hormel Pizza Toppings. Due to the earnings per share dilution of approximately $0.03, Refrigerated Foods earnings are expected to be flat. Jim Sheehan will provide more color on the hog and pork environment in fiscal 2017.
We expect strong sales and earnings growth for the full year as the Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with retail, deli and foodservice customers and consumers. Results will be weighted to the back half of the year as the first half faces more difficult comparisons. We intend to continue our advertising investments through the Make the Switch campaign to highlight the versatility of turkey in many of our consumer's favorite recipes. 
We expect our international segment to deliver strong profitable growth. In addition to improving results in China, we anticipate stronger exports for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter and CytoSport protein products. Our international team is eager to get our Jiaxing plant up and running in the first half of the year so they can leverage new production capabilities to grow our retail and foodservice businesses.
Specialty Foods results will likely show year-over-year declines in the first half due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, but we expect organic sales and earnings increases in the back half as we anniversary the divestiture. The MUSCLE MILK brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories, and we expect those results to continue. I am also very excited about our new MUSCLE MILK smoothies and many new MUSCLE MILK items in the innovation pipeline.
As we roll up our earnings outlook, we would have expected our guidance range to be $1.71 to $1.77 per share, representing a 4% to 8% increase. We took into consideration the 3 prior years of double-digit earnings growth and the 1 less week in 2017 as compared to 2016. However, factoring in the divestiture of Farmer John business, representing earnings per share of approximately $0.03, we are setting our guidance range to $1.68 to $1.74 per share.
From a sales perspective, excluding the impact of both the Diamond Crystal Brands and Farmer John divestitures and the positive impact of the JUSTIN'S acquisition, we anticipate our business will generate organic sales in line with our long-term target of 5%. We believe our company can continue to grow at 5% top line and 10% bottom line over the long term.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and additional key drivers for 2017."

Volume in the fourth quarter was 1.4 billion pounds, a 9% increase compared to last year. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, a 9% increase also.
Excluding the impact of both the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and the JUSTIN'S acquisition, volume was up 14% and sales were up 11%. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $244 million, up 30% compared to GAAP net earnings last year of $187 million. Net earnings were up 22% compared to non-GAAP earnings of $200 million last year.
Fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year with the extra week falling in Q4. We estimate the impact from this extra week was between 1% to 1.5% for the full year.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $55 million compared to $30 million last year as we continued to invest in our brands. Looking into 2017, we anticipate advertising expenses to be similar to 2016.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $35.4 million compared to $34.4 million last year. Equity and earnings for the quarter was $11 million, up 41% compared to last year. The increase was a result of our strong results in MegaMex, with brands such as HERDEZ salsa and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE performing well in the marketplace. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33% versus 35.2% in 2015. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%
Cash flow from operations was $371 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% over last year. During the quarter, $145 million of short-term debt was repaid. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $90 million compared to $47 million last year. The increase in CapEx was primarily related to our new plant in Jiaxing, China and lean ground turkey expansion at Jennie-O Turkey Store. 
For fiscal 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million compared to $256 million in 2016. Major projects for 2017 include the completion of our plant in China and numerous capacity expansions for value-added product lines. We will continue to invest capital to support our value-added products and improve food and employee safety. 
We paid our 353rd consecutive quarterly dividend, effective November 15, at an annual rate of $0.58 per share. Our Board of Directors approved an annual dividend rate of $0.68 per share, representing a 17% increase. Fiscal 2017 will represent the 51st consecutive year of increase in our dividends. Jim Snee and I intend to continue this long-standing policy.
We repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock, spending $43 million in the fourth quarter. We have 13 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises.
As we discussed at our third quarter conference call, we're providing a total company margin goal. Our goal for 2020 is to have our EBIT margin to be in the top quartile of our peer group. Today, the top quartile range is 15% to 19%. The goal is consistent with our long-term growth goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line.
We experienced favorable input costs for the fourth quarter in many, but not all, of our businesses. Key inputs such as hog and belly prices were down compared to the fourth quarter last year. Current prices were below -- were flat, beef prices were down. Corn and soybean meal prices were lower for the quarter versus 2015. Turkey breast feed prices were below 2015 during avian influenza.
We expect favorable hog and pork markets for 2017. The USDA is calling for a 3% to 4% increase in the hog supply in 2017. The majority of the new industry capacity is anticipated to come online after the summer of 2017. We expect hog harvest levels at our Austin and Fremont plants to be down 1% due to 1 less week in the fiscal year. Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect favorable grain prices for Jennie-O Turkey Store in 2017. We anticipate turkey breast meat prices to be below 2016 levels.
Going forward, we expect lower beef and chicken input costs for our value-added products. We also see comparable prices to 2016 for other key raw materials such as peanuts and tomatoes.
One area we are watching closely is the avocado market. The avocado market increased substantially in 2016. We're maintaining an adequate supply of avocados by leveraging our global supply chain. 
Overall, we are confident the strength of our value-added products, recent acquisitions and favorable market conditions will provide Hormel another record year.
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

So I'm just trying to understand like the building blocks of the next 4 years considering or coming off or will be coming off of a pretty favorable environment in one of your segments that happened to have driven a vast majority of the increase historically.

Your second question in regards to some of the capacity that's coming online, I guess, post 2017. We have navigated through volatility and delivered earnings growth 28 out of 31 years now. And so as markets change, clearly we know that we have to react. And I think that we've demonstrated that we can react, that our business can react and deliver growth.

Earlier today, we announced record fourth quarter results of $0.45 per share, up 22% from last year. Sales for the quarter were up 9% on a 9% increase in volume. For the full year, earnings per share were $1.64, up 24% versus fiscal 2015. Sales were $9.5 billion, up 3%, and volume was up 2%. 
For the quarter, 3 of our 5 segments recorded volume, sales and earnings growth, demonstrating the strength of our balanced business model. Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store posted excellent earnings, both up double digits. Grocery Products recorded solid gains while specialty and international earnings were down for the quarter. I am particularly pleased with our top line results with 4 of our segments generating sales growth.
Refrigerated Foods' fourth quarter operating profit increased 51% with sales up 8% and volume up 9%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from excellent growth in both retail and foodservice channels and from lower input cost, notably hogs and bellies. In foodservice, items like HORMEL BACON 1 Fully cooked bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED Meats delivered solid growth, while our retail business was led by items such as APPLEGATE deli meats, HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE and HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays.
Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit increased 26% with sales increasing 29%. Volume was up 32%. As a reminder, last year's results were negatively impacted by avian influenza. Higher bird weights and low grain prices were a benefit for the quarter. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store foodservice business performed well with growth coming from many areas, such as our Jennie-O raw boneless breast and sliced breast meat categories. We also experienced sales growth in our retail and deli businesses. We were back on air with the Jennie-O Make the Switch campaign through October and have seen a positive response once again from our consumers.
We saw strong sales growth in Grocery Products, up 16%, and segment profit was up 5%. Our legacy portfolio performed nicely with organic sales up 10%, including gains from many brands, such as SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL COMPLEATS and HERDEZ salsa. In addition, JUSTIN'S specialty nut butters contributed approximately $25 million in sales to the quarter and is well on track to meet our valuation pro forma and the $100 million fiscal 2017 sales we guided to when we announced the acquisition.
International sales increased 2% while operating profits decreased 16%. While we are encouraged by the results from our SKIPPY business in China, our meat business continues to be pressured by high input costs. Exports of fresh pork improved as U.S. exports became more competitive due to lower hog prices.
Specialty Foods, excluding Diamond Crystal Brands, grew sales 6% and volumes 11%. CytoSport posted excellent sales growth as they continued to introduce new innovative items in both ready-to-drink and powder formats. The CytoSport team also launched new MUSCLE MILK bars featuring 12 different flavors. Acceptance by our retail partners has been favorable. The decline in segment profit is attributed to increased advertising on a year-over-year basis for the MUSCLE MILK brand.
Innovation has been a foundation of our company's success over the last 125 years, which is why we recently announced a new innovation challenge for the year 2020: to have 15% of our total sales come from new products introduced in the previous 5 years. We finished 2016 with approximately 12% of sales from new products launched in the fiscal years 2011 to 2015. This is a stretch goal for our organization, and we expect to make substantial progress next year aided by recently introduced products as well as those in the pipeline.
Looking to fiscal 2017. We have positive momentum in each segment; employees all working towards the same goals; and numerous initiatives in each of our strategic growth pillars of global, multicultural, healthy/holistic and on-the-go.
Grocery Products is expected to show growth in excess of their long-term growth goals of 3% top line and 6% bottom line. Growth is expected to come from the positive momentum we have in SKIPPY peanut butter products, HERDEZ salsas and Wholly Guacamole dips in addition to JUSTIN'S. We will continue to invest in our key brands in 2017.
Yesterday, we announced the divestiture of the Farmer John, Saag's and PFFJ farms businesses. While the businesses performed well, they no longer met our strategic goals. Additionally, the divestiture allows for the integration of the pork processing facility at Farmer John with the majority of live production operations, which supply the facility and are currently owned by Smithfield. This divestiture is in the best interests of our shareholders, and we continue to seek opportunities to utilize our cash towards investments aligned to our growth goals.
We're expecting decreased sales in Refrigerated Foods, as increased sales of value-added products will be offset by the divestiture of Farmer John, which represents approximately $500 million. We see continued growth coming from brands such as HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE, HORMEL GATHERINGS, HORMEL pepperoni and APPLEGATE. In addition to foodservice sales growth from HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats and Hormel Pizza Toppings. Due to the earnings per share dilution of approximately $0.03, Refrigerated Foods earnings are expected to be flat. Jim Sheehan will provide more color on the hog and pork environment in fiscal 2017.
We expect strong sales and earnings growth for the full year as the Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with retail, deli and foodservice customers and consumers. Results will be weighted to the back half of the year as the first half faces more difficult comparisons. We intend to continue our advertising investments through the Make the Switch campaign to highlight the versatility of turkey in many of our consumers' favorite recipes. 
We expect our international segment to deliver strong profitable growth. In addition to improving results in China, we anticipate stronger exports for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter and CytoSport protein products. Our international team is eager to get our Jiaxing plant up and running in the first half of the year so they can leverage new production capabilities to grow our retail and foodservice businesses.
Specialty Foods results will likely show year-over-year declines in the first half due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, but we expect organic sales and earnings increases in the back half as we anniversary the divestiture. The MUSCLE MILK brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories, and we expect those results to continue. I'm also very excited about our new MUSCLE MILK smoothies and many new MUSCLE MILK items in the innovation pipeline.
As we roll up our earnings outlook, we would have expected our guidance range to be $1.71 to $1.77 per share, representing a 4% to 8% increase. We took into consideration the 3 prior years of double-digit earnings growth and the 1 less week in 2017 as compared to 2016. However, factoring in the divestiture of the Farmer John business, representing earnings per share of approximately $0.03, we are setting our guidance range to $1.68 to $1.74 per share.
From a sales perspective, excluding the impact of both the Diamond Crystal Brands and Farmer John divestitures and the positive impact of the JUSTIN'S acquisition, we anticipate our business will generate organic sales in line with our long-term target of 5%. We believe our company can continue to grow at 5% top line and 10% bottom line over the long term.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and additional key drivers for 2017."

Volume in the fourth quarter was 1.4 billion pounds, a 9% increase compared to last year. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, a 9% increase also.
Excluding the impact of both the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and the JUSTIN'S acquisition, volume was up 14% and sales were up 11%. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $244 million, up 30% compared to GAAP net earnings last year of $187 million. Net earnings were up 22% compared to non-GAAP earnings of $200 million last year.
Fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year with the extra week falling in Q4. We estimate the impact from this extra week was between 1% to 1.5% for the full year.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $55 million compared to $30 million last year as we continued to invest in our brands. Looking into 2017, we anticipate advertising expenses to be similar to 2016.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $35.4 million compared to $34.4 million last year. Equity and earnings for the quarter was $11 million, up 41% compared to last year. The increase was a result of our strong results in MegaMex with brands such as HERDEZ salsa and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE performing well in the marketplace. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33% versus 35.2% in 2015. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%
Cash flow from operations was $371 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% over last year. During the quarter, $145 million of short-term debt was repaid. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $90 million compared to $47 million last year. The increase in CapEx is primarily related to our new plant in Jiaxing, China, and lean ground turkey expansion at Jennie-O Turkey Store. 
For fiscal 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million compared to $256 million in 2016. Major projects for 2017 include the completion of our plant in China and numerous capacity expansions for value-added product lines. We will continue to invest capital to support our value-added products and improve food and employee safety. 
We paid our 353rd consecutive quarterly dividend, effective November 15 at an annual rate of $0.58 per share. Our Board of Directors approved an annual dividend rate of $0.68 per share, representing a 17% increase. Fiscal 2017 will represent the 51st consecutive year of increasing our dividends. Jim Snee and I intend to continue this longstanding policy.
We repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock, spending $43 million in the fourth quarter. We have 13 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises.
As we discussed at our third quarter conference call, we're providing a total company margin goal. Our goal for 2020 is to have our EBIT margin to be in the top quartile of our peer group. Today, the top quartile range is 15% to 19%. The goal is consistent with our long-term growth goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line.
We experienced favorable input costs for the fourth quarter in many but not all of our businesses. Key inputs such as hog and belly prices were down compared to the fourth quarter last year. Current prices were below -- were flat, beef prices were down. Corn and soybean meal prices were lower for the quarter versus 2015. Turkey breast feed prices were below 2015 during avian influenza.
We expect favorable hog and pork markets for 2017. The USDA is calling for a 3% to 4% increase in the hog supply in 2017. The majority of the new industry capacity is anticipated to come online after the summer of 2017. We expect hog harvest levels at our Austin and Fremont plants to be down 1% due to 1 less week in the fiscal year. Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect favorable grain prices for Jennie-O Turkey Store in 2017. We anticipate turkey breast meat prices to be below 2016 levels.
Going forward, we expect lower beef and chicken input costs for our value-added products. We also see comparable prices to 2016 for other key raw materials, such as peanuts and tomatoes.
One area we are watching closely is the avocado market. The avocado market increased substantially in 2016. We're maintaining an adequate supply of avocados by leveraging our global supply chain. 
Overall, we are confident the strength of our value-added products, recent acquisitions and favorable market conditions will provide Hormel another record year.
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

So I'm just trying to understand like the building blocks of the next 4 years considering or coming off or will be coming off of a pretty favorable environment in one of your segments that happens to have driven a vast majority of the increase historically.

Your second question in regards to some of the capacity that's coming online, I guess, post 2017. We've navigated through volatility and delivered earnings growth 28 out of 31 years now. And so as markets change, clearly we know that we have to react. And I think we've demonstrated that we can react, that our business can react and deliver growth.

If we're able to, deliver that, and we know we will, and we'll do it through a balance of organic growth, you referenced the mix of value-added, which is something we do each and every day; and then also having the right strategic acquisitions, I mean, that's the logical progression for how we get there."

But generally speaking, I think you'd also agree that potentially, that's going to reverse going forward. So when you think about levers that you can pull to offset that, clearly, I think M&A is an area where you can get more aggressive given your balance sheet and your solid track record.

Clearly, you hit it on the head that there are M&A opportunities for us as we head into the future. We've got, as I mentioned earlier, a robust pipeline of opportunities that we're pursuing. And then I think the other thing we have to remember is we've delivered the growth 28 out of 31 years, but we also have a management team that has 26 years of experience with Hormel Foods who are responsible for delivering those results.

Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record fourth quarter results of $0.45 per share, up 22% from last year. Sales for the quarter were up 9% on a 9% increase in volume.

Earlier today, we announced record fourth quarter results of $0.45 per share, up 22% from last year. Sales for the quarter were up 9% on a 9% increase in volume. For the full year, earnings per share were $1.64, up 24% versus fiscal 2015. Sales were $9.5 billion, up 3%, and volume was up 2%. 
For the quarter, 3 of our 5 segments recorded volume, sales and earnings growth, demonstrating the strength of our balanced business model. Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store posted excellent earnings, both up double digits. Grocery Products recorded solid gains while specialty and international earnings were down for the quarter. I am particularly pleased with our top line results with 4 of our segments generating sales growth.
Refrigerated Foods' fourth quarter operating profit increased 51% with sales up 8% and volume up 9%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from excellent growth in both retail and foodservice channels and from lower input cost, notably hogs and bellies. In foodservice, items like HORMEL BACON 1 Fully cooked bacon and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED Meats delivered solid growth, while our retail business was led by items such as APPLEGATE deli meats, HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE and HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays.
Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit increased 26% with sales increasing 29%. Volume was up 32%. As a reminder, last year's results were negatively impacted by avian influenza. Higher bird weights and low grain prices were a benefit for the quarter. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store foodservice business performed well with growth coming from many areas, such as our Jennie-O raw boneless breast and sliced breast meat categories. We also experienced sales growth in our retail and deli businesses. We were back on air with the Jennie-O Make the Switch campaign through October and have seen a positive response once again from our consumers.
We saw strong sales growth in Grocery Products, up 16%, and segment profit was up 5%. Our legacy portfolio performed nicely with organic sales up 10%, including gains from many brands, such as SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL COMPLEATS and HERDEZ salsa. In addition, JUSTIN'S specialty nut butters contributed approximately $25 million in sales to the quarter and is well on track to meet our valuation pro forma and the $100 million fiscal 2017 sales we guided to when we announced the acquisition.
International sales increased 2% while operating profits decreased 16%. While we are encouraged by the results from our SKIPPY business in China, our meat business continues to be pressured by high input costs. Exports of fresh pork improved as U.S. exports became more competitive due to lower hog prices.
Specialty Foods, excluding Diamond Crystal Brands, grew sales 6% and volumes 11%. CytoSport posted excellent sales growth as they continued to introduce new innovative items in both ready-to-drink and powder formats. The CytoSport team also launched new MUSCLE MILK bars featuring 12 different flavors. Acceptance by our retail partners has been favorable. The decline in segment profit is attributed to increased advertising on a year-over-year basis for the MUSCLE MILK brand.
Innovation has been a foundation of our company's success over the last 125 years, which is why we recently announced a new innovation challenge for the year 2020: to have 15% of our total sales come from new products introduced in the previous 5 years. We finished 2016 with approximately 12% of sales from new products launched in the fiscal years 2011 to 2015. This is a stretch goal for our organization, and we expect to make substantial progress next year aided by recently introduced products as well as those in the pipeline.
Looking to fiscal 2017. We have positive momentum in each segment; employees all working towards the same goals; and numerous initiatives in each of our strategic growth pillars of global, multicultural, healthy/holistic and on-the-go.
Grocery Products is expected to show growth in excess of their long-term growth goals of 3% top line and 6% bottom line. Growth is expected to come from the positive momentum we have in SKIPPY peanut butter products, HERDEZ salsas and Wholly Guacamole dips in addition to JUSTIN'S. We will continue to invest in our key brands in 2017.
Yesterday, we announced the divestiture of the Farmer John, Saag's and PFFJ farms businesses. While the businesses performed well, they no longer met our strategic goals. Additionally, the divestiture allows for the integration of the pork processing facility at Farmer John with the majority of live production operations, which supply the facility and are currently owned by Smithfield. This divestiture is in the best interests of our shareholders, and we continue to seek opportunities to utilize our cash towards investments aligned to our growth goals.
We're expecting decreased sales in Refrigerated Foods, as increased sales of value-added products will be offset by the divestiture of Farmer John, which represents approximately $500 million. We see continued growth coming from brands such as HORMEL NATURAL CHOICE, HORMEL GATHERINGS, HORMEL pepperoni and APPLEGATE. In addition to foodservice sales growth from HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats and Hormel Pizza Toppings. Due to the earnings per share dilution of approximately $0.03, Refrigerated Foods earnings are expected to be flat. Jim Sheehan will provide more color on the hog and pork environment in fiscal 2017.
We expect strong sales and earnings growth for the full year as the Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with retail, deli and foodservice customers and consumers. Results will be weighted to the back half of the year as the first half faces more difficult comparisons. We intend to continue our advertising investments through the Make the Switch campaign to highlight the versatility of turkey in many of our consumers' favorite recipes. 
We expect our international segment to deliver strong profitable growth. In addition to improving results in China, we anticipate stronger exports for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter and CytoSport protein products. Our international team is eager to get our Jiaxing plant up and running in the first half of the year so they can leverage new production capabilities to grow our retail and foodservice businesses.
Specialty Foods results will likely show year-over-year declines in the first half due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, but we expect organic sales and earnings increases in the back half as we anniversary the divestiture. The MUSCLE MILK brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories, and we expect those results to continue. I'm also very excited about our new MUSCLE MILK smoothies and many new MUSCLE MILK items in the innovation pipeline.
As we roll up our earnings outlook, we would have expected our guidance range to be $1.71 to $1.77 per share, representing a 4% to 8% increase. We took into consideration the 3 prior years of double-digit earnings growth and the 1 less week in 2017 as compared to 2016. However, factoring in the divestiture of the Farmer John business, representing earnings per share of approximately $0.03, we are setting our guidance range to $1.68 to $1.74 per share.
From a sales perspective, excluding the impact of both the Diamond Crystal Brands and Farmer John divestitures and the positive impact of the JUSTIN'S acquisition, we anticipate our business will generate organic sales in line with our long-term target of 5%. We believe our company can continue to grow at 5% top line and 10% bottom line over the long term.
At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and additional key drivers for 2017."

Volume in the fourth quarter was 1.4 billion pounds, a 9% increase compared to last year. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, a 9% increase also.
Excluding the impact of both the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and the JUSTIN'S acquisition, volume was up 14% and sales were up 11%. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $244 million, up 30% compared to GAAP net earnings last year of $187 million. Net earnings were up 22% compared to non-GAAP earnings of $200 million last year.
Fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year with the extra week falling in Q4. We estimate the impact from this extra week was between 1% to 1.5% for the full year.
Advertising expense for the quarter was $55 million compared to $30 million last year as we continued to invest in our brands. Looking into 2017, we anticipate advertising expenses to be similar to 2016.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $35.4 million compared to $34.4 million last year. Equity and earnings for the quarter was $11 million, up 41% compared to last year. The increase was a result of our strong results in MegaMex with brands such as HERDEZ salsa and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE performing well in the marketplace. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33% versus 35.2% in 2015. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%
Cash flow from operations was $371 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% over last year. During the quarter, $145 million of short-term debt was repaid. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $90 million compared to $47 million last year. The increase in CapEx is primarily related to our new plant in Jiaxing, China, and lean ground turkey expansion at Jennie-O Turkey Store. 
For fiscal 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million compared to $256 million in 2016. Major projects for 2017 include the completion of our plant in China and numerous capacity expansions for value-added product lines. We will continue to invest capital to support our value-added products and improve food and employee safety. 
We paid our 353rd consecutive quarterly dividend, effective November 15 at an annual rate of $0.58 per share. Our Board of Directors approved an annual dividend rate of $0.68 per share, representing a 17% increase. Fiscal 2017 will represent the 51st consecutive year of increasing our dividends. Jim Snee and I intend to continue this longstanding policy.
We repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock, spending $43 million in the fourth quarter. We have 13 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises.
As we discussed at our third quarter conference call, we're providing a total company margin goal. Our goal for 2020 is to have our EBIT margin to be in the top quartile of our peer group. Today, the top quartile range is 15% to 19%. The goal is consistent with our long-term growth goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line.
We experienced favorable input costs for the fourth quarter in many but not all of our businesses. Key inputs such as hog and belly prices were down compared to the fourth quarter last year. Current prices were below -- were flat, beef prices were down. Corn and soybean meal prices were lower for the quarter versus 2015. Turkey breast feed prices were below 2015 during avian influenza.
We expect favorable hog and pork markets for 2017. The USDA is calling for a 3% to 4% increase in the hog supply in 2017. The majority of the new industry capacity is anticipated to come online after the summer of 2017. We expect hog harvest levels at our Austin and Fremont plants to be down 1% due to 1 less week in the fiscal year. Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect favorable grain prices for Jennie-O Turkey Store in 2017. We anticipate turkey breast meat prices to be below 2016 levels.
Going forward, we expect lower beef and chicken input costs for our value-added products. We also see comparable prices to 2016 for other key raw materials, such as peanuts and tomatoes.
One area we are watching closely is the avocado market. The avocado market increased substantially in 2016. We're maintaining an adequate supply of avocados by leveraging our global supply chain. 
Overall, we are confident the strength of our value-added products, recent acquisitions and favorable market conditions will provide Hormel another record year.
At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Part of that, I would say, I mean, I don't know how much of it is related to industry dynamics being favorable. So I'm just trying to understand like the building blocks of the next 4 years considering or coming off or will be coming off of a pretty favorable environment in one of your segments that happens to have driven a vast majority of the increase historically. So that's my first question. And then secondly, again related to Refrigerated Foods, when this capacity does come on, which clearly you're saying in '17 doesn't look like it's going to cause any disruption. When it does come on, there's likely to be some disruption on the processing margins. How do you envision navigating through that environment from an earnings growth perspective?"

We've had some M&A activity in that space that's proved to be accretive. And so those are the things that we'll continue to do across all of our businesses to move into that top quartile. Your second question in regards to some of the capacity that's coming online, I guess, post 2017. We've navigated through volatility and delivered earnings growth 28 out of 31 years now. And so as markets change, clearly we know that we have to react. And I think we've demonstrated that we can react, that our business can react and deliver growth.
