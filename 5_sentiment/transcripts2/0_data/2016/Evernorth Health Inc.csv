This morning, I'm happy to report strong fourth quarter earnings and overall financial performance that delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.56, representing growth of 12% over last year. We adjudicated $341.5 million adjusted claims, generating adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, up 4%, which results in adjusted EBITDA per claim of $5.66. As expected, we generated $2.9 billion of cash flow during the quarter. 
We also delivered solid financial results for the full year 2015, generating $5.53 of adjusted earnings per share, which represents growth of 13%. We adjudicated approximately $1.3 billion of adjusted claims. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $7.05 billion, matching the midpoint of our guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA per claim was at $5.43, which represents 5% growth. Full year cash flow from operations was $4.85 billion. We deployed $8.9 billion of cash during 2015, $5.5 billion to repurchase common stock under the 2015 accelerated share repurchase agreements and $3.4 billion to retire debt. As anticipated, when we provided our 2016 guidance in December, we settled the 2015 accelerated share repurchase agreement in January and received 9.1 million additional shares, resulting in a total of 64.2 million shares received under the agreement. 
Due to our strong outlook for the year, we are raising the lower end of our 2016 guidance from $6.08 to $6.10 and now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.10 to $6.28, representing growth of 10% to 14%. Despite the effects of the Coventry and Catamaran business rolling off, which represent approximately 3% of claims, we expect EBITDA for 2016 to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion or an increase of 3% to 5%. We also expect to generate $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations. As a management team, we are focused on improving health care outcomes for our patients while reducing costs. We are driven to create efficiencies across the organization. For example, working hand-in-hand with Chris Houston, who leads our core operations, we are simplifying operating complexities, eliminating redundancies and reducing our cost to build. We are focused on the common goal to reduce costs within the organization while enhancing the service we provide to our patients and clients. 
From an investment perspective, our priorities remain same: invest in our core business, pursue strategic opportunities and return value to shareholders. Our capital structure strategy for 2016 remains consistent with prior years. We expect to maintain a long-term leverage target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA. Once our strategic investment priorities are met, we expect to return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. 
With respect to the first quarter 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.22, consistent with historical trends, our first quarter earnings are expected to decline sequentially from the fourth quarter that represent year-over-year growth from the first quarter 2015 of 7% to 11%. 
I will now turn the call over to Tim."

As George mentioned and as Eric reinforced, Express Scripts is built to deliver strong results, better care to patients, great soft cost, savings to clients and sustained growth for our shareholders. 2016 is our 30th anniversary as a company",483,"Thanks, Eric. As George mentioned and as Eric reinforced, Express Scripts is built to deliver strong results, better care to patients, great soft cost, savings to clients and sustained growth for our shareholders. 2016 is our 30th anniversary as a company. Since we started in 1986, our goal has been the same, ensure preemptions and clients get the most value for the money they spend. As we look in the future, we see many more ways for us to improve health care. When we deliver on the 2 things our clients need most, controlling costs and achieving better patient outcomes, it is both a growth opportunity for us and a testament to our business model of alignment. We have a strong financial and operational foundation to build upon and we are differentiated with unique solutions that are in high demand and we will always lead even if it means taking actions others cannot or will not. 
While our clients face a challenging environment with rising drug prices and increasingly complex regulations, we stand with them working together to find innovative ways to strengthen the pharmacy benefit while improving care. It is this alignment that resulted in our 97% retention in 2015 and gives us confidence going forward. Our excellent operational performance, highlighted by our outstanding 1/1/16 rollout ensures patients and clients get the most from our unique collection of bold actions, specialized care, data insights and innovative solutions. 1/1/16 was without question the best 1/1 in our history. Our relentless focus ensures every solution we put in place for clients creates maximum value for each member we care for. It opens the door to more forward-looking conversation with clients, which delivers better results for them and future growth for us. 
You've heard us talk about the strength of our specialty, home delivery, core PBM and pharma services assets. And when we put them together, we provide a pharmacy offering that is unique and unmatched. A great example of our holistic strategy is Safeguard Rx, a unique collection of solutions that includes enhancements to our Hepatitis Cure Value Program and Cholesterol Care Value Program and to industry first, an indication-based formulary and inflation protection program. These programs ensure clients' costs are minimized as we expand access to needed therapies and achieve better patient outcomes. They've got Rx launched on 1/1/16 to clients and enrollment update has been immediate and unprecedented across our commercial and health plan clients. Our complex business is rooted in a simple premise, always act in alignment with client needs. Standing with clients, we take the bold actions that drive down their costs, eliminate pharmacy waste and serve patients better. As we have for the past 30 years, and we expect to do well into the future, when we execute our strategy, clients and patients win and we grow. Now I will turn it over to George for some closing thoughts."

I am confident in our business model, which is focused on achieving better health outcomes that, in turn, deliver strong financial performance and solid returns for our shareholders. Our core PBM business, specialty pharmacy, home delivery pharmacy and pharma services business provide numerous levers to drive sustainable value for our patients, clients and shareholders. 
With the record retention year and our best 1/1 performance ever, we have momentum and are confident in our guidance and growth prospects. We are well positioned for the short and long term for 2 important reasons, first the value we provide clients has never been greater; and second, there is a growing appreciation for our unique business model alignment. All that said, we understand the uncertainty that exists related to Anthem's public comments. We also understand the certainty of our business. We are performing at a high level financially and operationally. We have a long-standing policy of keeping all client discussions strictly private. However, we know you have questions about what has changed with Anthem, and here's what I'll say. Our team is delivering great service to Anthem and its members. That has not changed. We are committed to helping Anthem control cost and win business. In fact, a significant amount of value is available to Anthem and its clients if Anthem were to adopt more of the cost saving solutions already implemented by many of our other clients. That has no changed. 
As we said on our 2016's guidance call in December, we remain fully committed to good faith negotiations and hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement within the framework of our 2009 contract. That has not changed. That said, although I will not speak to specifics, Anthem is certainly not entitled to $3 billion and that has not changed. We have an unwavering commitment to improve health care outcomes and lower drug costs with the best cost-saving clinically sound solutions in the industry. We will continue to take bold actions to reshape health care by improving patient outcomes, controlling cost and driving out waste. By doing our job well, we will continue to deliver strong financial performance and strong returns for our shareholders over the long term. I'm extremely proud of what we've been doing for the last 30 years and have never been more excited about our future.

So we have this very well off as it relates to inside of our company and our sales and account management teams are incredibly engaged. You heard me speak about Safeguard Rx, and I can tell you, the uptake in that has been unlike anything I've seen in my 18 years in the business, and it's just a testimony to the fact that our clients are focused on their challenges, they're focused on how we can solve their problems collaborating with them and we've produced the kind of results that enable a really trusted conversation. And that really takes you into the 2016 renewal and '17 selling season, which is early, as George said, but what we see right now is a lot of interest in anything, having to do with helping clients, manage spend while creating access. And obviously, we've taken some very specific positions on some things and then taken the actions behind those positions which have produced results, and those are the conversations that we're having. And right now at least what I would tell you is it's kind of a normal renewal year for us, so there's nothing extraordinary you see in our numbers.

When you look at the quarterly run of earnings, if you look at historically that pattern, we're pretty much in line with pattern of first  quarter being down and replenishing throughout the year, so we're very comfortable with our first quarter guidance, and obviously, our full year guidance we believe is quite achievable and in line. Eric, I don't know if you want to add."

I'll answer your question just a second, but I have no clue where the $3 billion came from. I have no concept. The number doesn't make any sense to me. So if you really want to get into that, you got to talk to Anthem about that. As far as a client situation, if it's an existing client, depending on the size and their willingness or their desire to meet with us and control their cost, we can either meet quarterly or annually with them, some more often than even that. And the idea is to sit down because we process every claim, we see the trends, we know what's happening. Our goal is to sit down and say okay, the growth trends are growing a certain amount, how is that client? Let's say they're in the [indiscernible] business, they're in the [indiscernible] business, making paint or whatever, manufacturing. The idea is to lighten them up against other manufacturers because they're going to have some more demographics in their own employment basis and compare the trends of their drug spend versus the trends of the industry. You don't show them individual other clients but you can show aggregate values and show whether or not they're in the -- below the midpoint, above the midpoint or at the midpoint for controlling cost, and then what are the bigger drivers of our costs. So our clinicians and account management teams spend hours, monthly, quarterly, annually with our clients going through that process so that they constantly stay on top, tweak the benefits as they go. And then especially before they just roll out their enrollment for the upcoming year, they can tweak their benefits and really get them in line to better control costs in the next year as well. If it's a new client opportunity, where we have a -- when it's a -- all RFPs are different but if we have the opportunity, we'd love to get historical claims data, then do the same analysis. So when we walk in and bid the business, we can to speak exactly what our programs are going to say to them and also how much disruption. By disruption, we mean how many people are affected. So sometimes, some of the highest cost trends have very little usage on a per-capita basis so you could've take a big change in the cost trend but only touching a handful of people. And so you can go after different savings opportunities and that's how we win in the marketplace."

And then secondly, you guys have taken some strong position in the past trying to work on behalf of your clients. And currently, if we think about the issue around drug pricing, it's really an adversarial relationship between payers and manufacturers. As we move forward, though, if we're trying to balance sort of cost versus innovation, are there ways you think that your peers can work with manufacturers to be more cooperative? And I guess [indiscernible] do you see some sort of outcomes-based methods of formulary placement coming to greater usage?"

I'll take both questions. First of all, just on a macro level, the way inflation protection works is we're able to go out with a contract with pharma manufacturers, we make commitments around sort of the maximum pricing that they will take, above which they will, through us, create value that we can then build back into the programs for our clients. So in essence, we go out. We don't reinsure because we're not taking [indiscernible] risk insurance sense. What we're doing is we are sort of out there contracting with Pharma and then passing that back through to the program that we've got. So it's a very -- it holds pharma accountable and at the same time, it puts our clients in a great position to the extent that inflation is higher than what we were able to cap it in these contracts. And what I would say as it relates to the adversarial pieces, there's no question that there are opportunities for us and payers generally to work with manufacturers who want to take a responsible view. And in fact, we provide an excellent way for those manufacturers to get to market in a way that is responsible that creates maximum access for their innovative products, that ensures that there isn't wasteful behavior is taking place, and so we have great example of that in our PCSK9 approach. You saw what we did in hep C. That was -- we're not a one-trick pony. To the contrary, we really believe that in the long run we can work very collaboratively with manufacturers to create access a fair price to our payers. And there's a lot of room for negotiation and sort of argument about what fair price is and we work very, very relentlessly on behalf of our clients to drive for that. So yes is the short answer. And as we look at the pipeline, we see -- I was at a conference last week with a large number of pharma manufacturers, and several of them cornered me with specific ideas about outcomes-based or indication-based pricing and wanting to do it, and their challenge is not having the data, which we have. And so we actually think we're in a perfect spot to help bring those things to life."

And in those price checks, they have the right to look at pricing and make sure that we are doing the right things for them, and those are pretty routine. We go through those -- a bunch of those every year. There's a difference in this one, though, and it's contractual and it's all the data that's been disclosed. But here, it's not your traditional price check because of the very large upfront money that was paid out in this deal. I can't really speak to why we haven't reached an agreement yet, but we are focused on reaching an agreement. I do think that there's a lot to be gained by reaching an agreement especially if it's in lockstep with their modernizing their benefit because if they do that, then the economics to their plan is significant. And again, we work together hand in glove to get that economics out of supply chain and better focus thereby, it's better economics for them, it's good for us, and it's really good for their clients and their members and their patients.

And I would say that's gone beyond the National Preferred Formulary. While that's the cornerstone to our leverage, we work with any number of clients who are not on that formulary to help them at a drug level or therapeutic chapter level also go deep and create additional value by virtue of modeling and understanding those dynamics. And so from that standpoint, it's been very powerful. Over the last several years, as we've become more innovative in the contracting, we've been able to do things such as inflation caps and so forth, we've been able to actually expand access to the formulary rather than narrow it at some spots by virtue of actually creating a financial model where it was better. The PCSK9 has been the most recent example but certainly not the only example. I think that the last piece I'd say is as we've been able to get significant value there, clients are more than willing to share that value with us because of the fact it aligns us so well.

So this is a far different situation that exists with Anthem, and I would say that at least from my perspective and I know the CEOs of all these companies, we have a very good relationship. We work very collaboratively together. We look at the markets in which they're operating and design programs that meet their needs, whether it'd be a Medicare, Medicaid or the commercial line of business. We tailor our products to meet the needs of those clients, and I think we have very strong, very good relationships and, quite frankly, we renewed quite a few of those plans when all of this has been going on. So this doesn't really cause an overhang for our clients. Again, internally, this isn't the best thing in the world, doing these calls and talking purely about Anthem instead of all the great stuff that our company is doing in controlling drug costs, driving trends and doing -- trying to take out the cost of inefficient cost of health care is really what we're focused on. And so as a management team, a handful of us deal with the Anthem situation, but 99.9% of our employees are dealing with making the business work and running in the fashion that we're proud of.

This morning, I'm happy to report strong fourth quarter earnings and an overall financial performance that delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.56, representing growth of 12% over last year. We adjudicated $341.5 million adjusted claims generating adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, up 4%, which results in adjusted EBITDA per claim of $5.66. As expected, we generated $2.9 billion of cash flow during the quarter. 
We also delivered solid financial results for the full year 2015, generating $5.53 of adjusted earnings per share, which represents growth of 13%. We adjudicated approximately $1.3 billion of adjusted claims. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $7.05 billion, matching the midpoint of our guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA per claim was at $5.43, which represents 5% growth. Full year cash flow from operations was $4.85 billion. We deployed $8.9 billion of cash during 2015, $5.5 billion to repurchase common stock under the 2015 accelerated share repurchase agreement and $3.4 billion to retire debt. As anticipated, when we provided our 2016 guidance in December, we settled the 2015 accelerated share repurchase agreement in January and received 9.1 million additional shares, resulting in a total of 64.2 million shares received under the agreement. 
Due to our strong outlook for the year, we are raising the lower end of our 2016 guidance from $6.08 to $6.10 (sic) [ $6.28 ] and now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.10 to $6.28, representing growth of 10% to 14%. Despite the effects of the Coventry and Catamaran business rolling off, which represent approximately 3% of claims, we expect EBITDA for 2016 to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion or an increase of 3% to 5%. We also expect to generate $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations. 
As a management team, we are focused on improving health care outcomes for our patients while reducing costs. We are driven to create efficiencies across the organization. For example, working hand in hand with Chris Houston who leads our core operations, we are simplifying operating complexities, eliminating redundancies and reducing our cost to bill. We are focused on a common goal to reduce costs within the organization while enhancing the service we provide to our patients and clients. 
From an investment perspective, our priorities remain the same: invest in our core business, pursue strategic opportunities and return value to shareholders. Our capital structure strategy for 2016 remains consistent with prior years. We expect to maintain a long-term leverage target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA. Once our strategic investment priorities are met, we expect to return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. 
With respect to the first quarter 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.22. Consistent with historical trends, our first quarter earnings are expected to decline sequentially from the fourth quarter but represent year-over-year growth from the first quarter 2015 of 7% to 11%.

As George mentioned and as Eric reinforced, Express Scripts is built to deliver strong results, better care to patients, greater cost savings to clients and sustained growth for our shareholders. 2016 is our 30th anniversary as a company.",481,"Thanks, Eric. As George mentioned and as Eric reinforced, Express Scripts is built to deliver strong results, better care to patients, greater cost savings to clients and sustained growth for our shareholders. 
2016 is our 30th anniversary as a company. Since we started in 1986, our goal has been the same: ensure patients and clients get the most value for the money they spend. As we look to the future, we see many more ways for us to improve health care. When we deliver on the 2 things our clients need most, controlling costs and achieving better patient outcomes, it is both a growth opportunity for us and a testament to our business model of alignment. We have a strong financial and operational foundation to build upon and we are differentiated with unique solutions that are in high demand, and we will always lead even if it means taking actions others cannot or will not. 
While our clients face a challenging environment with rising drug prices and increasingly complex regulations, we stand with them working together to find innovative ways to strengthen the pharmacy benefit while improving care. It is this alignment that resulted in our 97% retention in 2015 and gives us confidence going forward. 
Our excellent operational performance, highlighted by our outstanding 1/1/16 rollout ensures patients and clients get the most from our unique collection of bold actions, specialized care, data insights and innovative solutions. 1/1/16 was without question the best 1/1 in our history. Our relentless focus ensures every solution we put in place for clients creates maximum value for each member we care for. It opens the door to more forward-looking conversation with clients, which delivers better results for them and future growth for us. 
You've heard us talk about the strength of our specialty, home delivery, core PBM and pharma services assets. And when we put them together, we provide a pharmacy offering that is unique and unmatched. A great example of our holistic strategy is Safeguard Rx, a unique collection of solutions that includes enhancements to our Hepatitis Cure Value Program and Cholesterol Care Value Program, and 2 industry firsts, an indication-based formulary and an Inflation Protection Program. These programs ensure clients' costs are minimized as we expand access to needed therapies and achieve better patient outcomes. 
Safeguard Rx launched on 1/1/16 to clients and enrollment uptake has been immediate and unprecedented across our commercial and health plan clients. Our complex business is rooted in a simple premise: always act in alignment with client needs. Standing with clients, we take the bold actions that drive down their costs, eliminate pharmacy waste and serve patients better. As we have for the past 30 years, and we expect to do well into the future, when we execute our strategy, clients and patients win and we grow. 
Now I'll turn it over to George for some closing thoughts."

I am confident in our business model, which is focused on achieving better health outcomes that, in turn, deliver strong financial performance and solid returns for our shareholders. Our core PBM business, specialty pharmacy, home delivery pharmacy and pharma services business provide numerous levers to drive sustainable value for our patients, clients and shareholders. 
With a record retention year and our best 1/1 performance ever, we have momentum and are confident in our guidance and growth prospects. We are well positioned for the short and long term for 2 important reasons: first, the value we provide clients has never been greater; and second, there is a growing appreciation for our unique business model of alignment. All that said, we understand the uncertainty that exists related to Anthem's public comments. We also understand the certainty of our business. We are performing at a high level financially and operationally. We have a long-standing policy of keeping all client discussions strictly private. However, we know you have questions about what has changed with Anthem and here's what I'll say: our team is delivering great service to Anthem and its members. That has not changed. We are committed to helping Anthem control costs and win business. In fact, a significant amount of value is available to Anthem and its clients if Anthem were to adopt more of the cost-saving solutions already implemented by many of our other clients. That has not changed. As we said on our 2016 guidance call in December, we remain fully committed to good faith negotiations and hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement within the framework of our 2009 contract. That has not changed. That said, although I will not speak to specifics, Anthem is certainly not entitled to $3 billion and that has not changed. We have an unwavering commitment to improve health care outcomes and lower drug costs with the best cost-saving, clinically sound solutions in the industry. We will continue to take bold actions to reshape health care by improving patient outcomes, controlling costs and driving out waste. By doing our job well, we will continue to deliver strong financial performance and strong returns for our shareholders over the long term. I'm extremely proud of what we've been doing for the last 30 years and have never been more excited about our future.

So we have this very walled off as it relates to inside of our company and our sales and account management teams are incredibly engaged. You heard me speak about Safeguard Rx and I can tell you the uptake in that has been unlike anything I've seen in my 18 years in the business and it's just a testimony to the fact that our clients are focused on their challenges, they're focused on how we can solve their problems collaborating with them and we've produced the kind of results that enable a really trusted conversation. And that really takes you into the 2016 renewal and '17 selling season, which is early, as George said, but what we see right now is a lot of interest in anything having to do with helping clients, manage spend while creating access. And obviously, we've taken some very specific positions on some things and then taken the actions behind those positions, which have produced results and those are the conversations that we're having. And right now, at least, what I would tell you is it's kind of a normal renewal year for us, so there's nothing extraordinary you see in our numbers.

I'll answer your question just a second, but I have no clue where the $3 billion came from. I have no concept. The number doesn't make any sense to me. So if you really want to get into that, you've got to talk to Anthem about that. As far as a client situation, if it's an existing client, depending on the size and their willingness or their desire to meet with us and control their costs, we could either meet quarterly or annually with them, some more often than even that. And the idea is to sit down because we've processed every claim, we see the trends, we know what's happening. Our goal is to sit down and say, okay, the growth trends are doing a certain amount, how are they -- how is that client? Let's say, they're in the -- pick a business. They're in the paint business, making paint or whatever, manufacturing. The idea is to lighten them up against other manufacturers because they're going to have similar demographics in their employment basis and compare the trends of their drug spend versus the trends of the industry. You don't show them individual other clients, but you can show aggregate values and show whether or not they're in the -- below the midpoint, above the midpoint or at the midpoint for controlling costs and then what are the bigger drivers of our costs. Our clinicians and account management team spend hours, monthly, quarterly, annually with our clients going through that process so that they constantly stay on top, tweak the benefits as they go, and then especially before they just roll out their enrollment for the upcoming year, they can tweak their benefits and really get them in line to better control costs in the next year as well. If it's a new client opportunity where we have a real -- when it's a -- all RFPs are different, but if we have the opportunity, we'd love to get historical claims data, then do the same analysis. So when we walk in and bid a business, we can to speak exactly what our programs are going to save them and also how much disruption. By disruption, we mean how many people are affected. So sometimes, some of the highest cost trends have very little usage on a per-capita basis, so you could have -- take a big change in the cost trend by only touching a handful of people. And so you can go after different savings opportunities and that's how we win in the marketplace."

So that remains a potential tailwind that has not happened at this point. As it relates to generic inflation, what we've seen is what you've probably read about, which is not an issue. Our GPO does a great job, first of all. So we have always, on a net basis, been able to sort of handle that issue even when others were struggling with it. But this year, we continue to see what I would say is fairly low to no inflation there and arguably a little bit less than last year, which again tracks with what others have reported."

What I'd say is obviously -- and I won't break it down into pieces because, of course, the Hepatitis Care Value Program -- or Cure Program, it's opportunity down the road. There are new entrants into the marketplace and the ability to go back and since we've recast yet again the cost of treating those patients. So that continues to be an opportunity for us to dynamically manage and deliver for our clients. I think the big pieces, as you look at inflation, we don't know how the year's going to come out. So we're putting something sort of in place now that we won't be able to ascertain. If we do our job really well there, we will do a little bit better at the back half of the year and you would expect it to be more in the back half of the year as inflation mounts and as we hold our clients harmless to the numbers we give them, and as pharma, then remits to the commitments that they've made to us contractually. And so it really -- from our perspective, the program itself is terrific for clients and for us. I think the bigger story, though, is the relationship we have with pharma and how that increases the conversations and the leverage that we have. I think if you go back to a couple of years ago, the thought was from a pharma standpoint, narrow formularies, how long can -- does that runway last? And I think what we've demonstrated with Safeguard Rx and in dozens of conversations we're continuing to have with pharma, is that it is a lot more than just a narrow formulary that we can create when we bring innovation to working with pharma to create access for patients and the right cost profile for payers."

And then, secondly, you guys have taken some strong position in the past trying to work on behalf of your clients. And currently, if we think about the issue around drug pricing, it's really an adversarial relationship between payers and manufacturers. As we move forward, though, if we're trying to balance sort of cost versus innovation, are there ways you think that your peers can work with manufacturers to be more cooperative? And I guess, an example of that, do you see some sort of outcomes-based methods of formulary placement coming to greater usage?"

I'll take both questions. First of all, just at a macro level, the way Inflation Protection works is that we're able to go out and contract with pharma manufacturers who make commitments around sort of the maximum pricing that they will take, above which they will, through us, create value that we can then build back into the programs for our clients. So in essence, we go out and we don't reinsure because we're not taking true risk in an insurance sense. What we're doing is we're sort of out there contracting with pharma and then passing that back through, through the program that we've got. So it's a very -- it holds pharma accountable and at the same time it puts our clients in a great position to the extent that inflation is higher than what we were able to cap it in these contracts. And what I would say as it relates to the adversarial pieces, there is no question that there are opportunities for us and payers generally to work with manufacturers who want to take a responsible view, and in fact, we provide an excellent way for those manufacturers to get to market in a way that is responsible, that creates maximum access for their innovative products, that ensures that there isn't wasteful behaviors taking place. And so -- and we have great example of that in our PCSK9 approach. You saw what we did in hep C. That was -- we're not a one-trick pony. To the contrary, we really believe that in the long run we can work very collaboratively with manufacturers to create access at a fair price to our payers. And there's a lot of room for negotiation and sort of argument about what fair price is and we work very, very relentlessly on behalf of our clients to drive for that. So yes is the short answer. And as we look at the pipeline, we see -- I was at a conference last week with a large number of pharma manufacturers, and several of them cornered me with specific ideas about outcomes-based or indication-based pricing and wanting to do it and their challenge is not having the data, which we have. And so we actually think we're in a perfect spot to help bring those things to life."

Back in 2012, we did reach a mutually agreed-upon outcome and I think part of it is if you look at our total book of business, a lot of our clients do have what we call price checks. And in those price checks, they have the right to look at pricing and make sure that we are doing the right things for them and those are pretty routine. And we go through those -- a bunch of those every year. There's a difference in this one, though, and it's contractual and it's all of the data that's been disclosed. But here, it's not your traditional price check because of the very large up-front money that was paid out in this deal. So I can't really speak to why we haven't reached an agreement yet, but we are focused on reaching an agreement. I do think that there's a lot to be gained by reaching an agreement especially if it's in lockstep with them modernizing their benefit because if they do that, then the economics to their plan is significant. And again, we work together hand in glove to get that economics out of the supply chain and better focus, thereby it's better economics for them, it's good for us and it's really good for their clients and their members and their patients.

And I would say that's gone beyond the National Preferred Formulary. While that's the cornerstone to our leverage, we work with any number of clients who are not on that formulary to help them at a drug level or therapeutic chapter level also go deep and create additional value by virtue of modeling and understanding those dynamics. And so from that standpoint, it's been very powerful. Over the last several years, as we've become more innovative in our contracting, we've been able to do things such as inflation caps and so forth. We've been able to actually expand access to the formulary rather than narrow it in some spots by virtue of actually creating a financial model where it was better, the PCSK9 as being the most recent example, but certainly not the only example. I think that the last piece I'd say is as we've been able to get significant value there, clients are more than willing to share that value with us because of the fact it aligns us so well to keep taking the bold actions that are in both of our interests."

As it relates to the broader retail context, though, as I said, with over 70,000 retail chains out there and with clients very willing to work with us and take advantage of what we've proven we can do in terms of helping patients find the most efficient, whether it's drug choice or channel choice, we continue to have very interesting conversations with retail.

So first of all, where we have a lot of redundancies through the acquisition is in our operations, which goes to DPC and gross profit. So as we shut down facilities and we consolidate operations to get better efficiencies, that reduces headcount. In addition to that, we also, over the last couple of years, have made some very big investments in our infrastructure in order to make sure that we can continue to drive costs. I echo what Eric said earlier that as we have -- we've always had a big focus on taking out costs. When we bought Medco, if you go back and look year-over-year SG&A and SG&A per script, we had a pretty good spike that drove up the costs because of the redundancies in the businesses. And there's one thing to consolidate the technology platforms, but it's a whole another thing to start consolidating all of the -- or integrating all of the processes and that's where they're in the midst of doing as we speak. We still have an awful lot of inefficiencies in our mail order service that we can still go after and we think there's still significant room to run there, so I do believe that this is going to be an annual exercise for us. It always has been and it will remain an exercise to focus on costs, what's adding value to our patients. And whatever isn't , get rid of it, and that will stay our goal."

So this is a far different situation that exists with Anthem, and I would say that, at least from my perspective and I know the CEOs of all these companies, we have very good relationships. We work very collaboratively together. We look at the markets in which they're operating and design programs that meet their needs whether it'd be at Medicare, Medicaid or the commercial line of business, we tailor our products to meet the needs of those clients. And I think we have very strong, very good relationships, and quite frankly, we have renewed quite a few of those Blues plans when all this has been going on. So this doesn't really cause an overhang for our clients. Again, internally, this isn't the best thing in the world, doing these calls and talking purely about Anthem instead of all the great stuff that our company is doing in controlling drug costs, driving trends and doing what's -- help to try to take out the cost of -- inefficient cost of health care is really what we're focused on. And so as a management team, a handful of us deal with the Anthem situation, but 99.9% of our employees are dealing with making the business work and running in the fashion that we're proud of.

This morning, I'm happy to report strong fourth quarter earnings and an overall financial performance that delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.56, representing growth of 12% over last year. We adjudicated $341.5 million adjusted claims generating adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, up 4%, which results in adjusted EBITDA per claim of $5.66. As expected, we generated $2.9 billion of cash flow during the quarter. 
We also delivered solid financial results for the full year 2015, generating $5.53 of adjusted earnings per share, which represents growth of 13%. We adjudicated approximately $1.3 billion of adjusted claims. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $7.05 billion, matching the midpoint of our guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA per claim was at $5.43, which represents 5% growth. Full year cash flow from operations was $4.85 billion. We deployed $8.9 billion of cash during 2015, $5.5 billion to repurchase common stock under the 2015 accelerated share repurchase agreement and $3.4 billion to retire debt. As anticipated, when we provided our 2016 guidance in December, we settled the 2015 accelerated share repurchase agreement in January and received 9.1 million additional shares, resulting in a total of 64.2 million shares received under the agreement. 
Due to our strong outlook for the year, we are raising the lower end of our 2016 guidance from $6.08 to $6.10 (sic) [ $6.28 ] and now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.10 to $6.28, representing growth of 10% to 14%. Despite the effects of the Coventry and Catamaran business rolling off, which represent approximately 3% of claims, we expect EBITDA for 2016 to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion or an increase of 3% to 5%. We also expect to generate $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations. 
As a management team, we are focused on improving health care outcomes for our patients while reducing costs. We are driven to create efficiencies across the organization. For example, working hand in hand with Chris Houston who leads our core operations, we are simplifying operating complexities, eliminating redundancies and reducing our cost to bill. We are focused on a common goal to reduce costs within the organization while enhancing the service we provide to our patients and clients. 
From an investment perspective, our priorities remain the same: invest in our core business, pursue strategic opportunities and return value to shareholders. Our capital structure strategy for 2016 remains consistent with prior years. We expect to maintain a long-term leverage target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA. Once our strategic investment priorities are met, we expect to return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases. 
With respect to the first quarter 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.22. Consistent with historical trends, our first quarter earnings are expected to decline sequentially from the fourth quarter but represent year-over-year growth from the first quarter 2015 of 7% to 11%.

As George mentioned and as Eric reinforced, Express Scripts is built to deliver strong results, better care to patients, greater cost savings to clients and sustained growth for our shareholders. 
2016 is our 30th anniversary as a company. Since we started in 1986, our goal has been the same: ensure patients and clients get the most value for the money they spend. As we look to the future, we see many more ways for us to improve health care. When we deliver on the 2 things our clients need most, controlling costs and achieving better patient outcomes, it is both a growth opportunity for us and a testament to our business model of alignment. We have a strong financial and operational foundation to build upon and we are differentiated with unique solutions that are in high demand, and we will always lead even if it means taking actions others cannot or will not. 
While our clients face a challenging environment with rising drug prices and increasingly complex regulations, we stand with them working together to find innovative ways to strengthen the pharmacy benefit while improving care. It is this alignment that resulted in our 97% retention in 2015 and gives us confidence going forward. 
Our excellent operational performance, highlighted by our outstanding 1/1/16 rollout ensures patients and clients get the most from our unique collection of bold actions, specialized care, data insights and innovative solutions. 1/1/16 was without question the best 1/1 in our history. Our relentless focus ensures every solution we put in place for clients creates maximum value for each member we care for. It opens the door to more forward-looking conversation with clients, which delivers better results for them and future growth for us. 
You've heard us talk about the strength of our specialty, home delivery, core PBM and pharma services assets. And when we put them together, we provide a pharmacy offering that is unique and unmatched. A great example of our holistic strategy is Safeguard Rx, a unique collection of solutions that includes enhancements to our Hepatitis Cure Value Program and Cholesterol Care Value Program, and 2 industry firsts, an indication-based formulary and an Inflation Protection Program. These programs ensure clients' costs are minimized as we expand access to needed therapies and achieve better patient outcomes. 
Safeguard Rx launched on 1/1/16 to clients and enrollment uptake has been immediate and unprecedented across our commercial and health plan clients. Our complex business is rooted in a simple premise: always act in alignment with client needs. Standing with clients, we take the bold actions that drive down their costs, eliminate pharmacy waste and serve patients better. As we have for the past 30 years, and we expect to do well into the future, when we execute our strategy, clients and patients win and we grow. 
Now I'll turn it over to George for some closing thoughts."

I am confident in our business model, which is focused on achieving better health outcomes that, in turn, deliver strong financial performance and solid returns for our shareholders. Our core PBM business, specialty pharmacy, home delivery pharmacy and pharma services business provide numerous levers to drive sustainable value for our patients, clients and shareholders. 
With a record retention year and our best 1/1 performance ever, we have momentum and are confident in our guidance and growth prospects. We are well positioned for the short and long term for 2 important reasons: first, the value we provide clients has never been greater; and second, there is a growing appreciation for our unique business model of alignment. All that said, we understand the uncertainty that exists related to Anthem's public comments. We also understand the certainty of our business. We are performing at a high level financially and operationally. We have a long-standing policy of keeping all client discussions strictly private. However, we know you have questions about what has changed with Anthem and here's what I'll say: our team is delivering great service to Anthem and its members. That has not changed. We are committed to helping Anthem control costs and win business. In fact, a significant amount of value is available to Anthem and its clients if Anthem were to adopt more of the cost-saving solutions already implemented by many of our other clients. That has not changed. As we said on our 2016 guidance call in December, we remain fully committed to good faith negotiations and hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement within the framework of our 2009 contract. That has not changed. That said, although I will not speak to specifics, Anthem is certainly not entitled to $3 billion and that has not changed. We have an unwavering commitment to improve health care outcomes and lower drug costs with the best cost-saving, clinically sound solutions in the industry. We will continue to take bold actions to reshape health care by improving patient outcomes, controlling costs and driving out waste. By doing our job well, we will continue to deliver strong financial performance and strong returns for our shareholders over the long term. I'm extremely proud of what we've been doing for the last 30 years and have never been more excited about our future. 
Thank you for your time this morning. Now we'll take your questions. Operator?"

And we just don't get into client-specific data. Again, we are in the middle of our -- we're starting to kick off our selling season. We have our retention goals again for this year that we have to go achieve. And if you want to do business with us, the last thing we want to be seen doing is talking about our clients and putting out a bunch of information that they haven't disclosed because it's really not our place to disclose their information, it's their place. And so as -- it would be a heck of a lot easier for all of us if I could sit here and tell you exactly how much we make and how many scripts there are and whatever information you want, but 2 things: one, that door never closes, there'll be more and more information; and second, they haven't given us the permission or the right to disclose that and that's not a precedent we want to start. So I'm sorry to be vague about that, but we take our work very seriously and we take our client confidences personally. So I'm sorry, but that's all I can say."

First, as it relates to the sort of any hangover from an Anthem perspective in the broader selling season or retention season, I would actually tell you 0 in terms of that. I mean, that's back to George's comments. We have been very, very thoughtful about not putting anything out there in terms of public comments and so forth because we respect Anthem and we respect that the book of our business really needs us focused on them. So we have this very walled off as it relates to inside of our company and our sales and account management teams are incredibly engaged. You heard me speak about Safeguard Rx and I can tell you the uptake in that has been unlike anything I've seen in my 18 years in the business and it's just a testimony to the fact that our clients are focused on their challenges, they're focused on how we can solve their problems collaborating with them and we've produced the kind of results that enable a really trusted conversation. And that really takes you into the 2016 renewal and '17 selling season, which is early, as George said, but what we see right now is a lot of interest in anything having to do with helping clients, manage spend while creating access. And obviously, we've taken some very specific positions on some things and then taken the actions behind those positions, which have produced results and those are the conversations that we're having. And right now, at least, what I would tell you is it's kind of a normal renewal year for us, so there's nothing extraordinary you see in our numbers. And because we've had a strong year last year, we're really leaning into the selling season very confidently this year."

If they have -- because there are still some 2-tier systems out there, believe it or not, and so if you're on a 2-tier drug system and you come in, obviously the first big thing you do is put in a 3-tier, then you start building exclusions, you manage the formulary, you control the network, you drive mail.

Somebody that's already sophisticated and already down the path and it's about how do you tweak it to take advantage of the trends that are existing in the current marketplace.

I'll answer your question in just a second, but I have no clue where the $3 billion came from. I have no concept. The number doesn't make any sense to me. So if you really want to get into that, you've got to talk to Anthem about that. As far as a client situation, if it's an existing client, depending on the size and their willingness or their desire to meet with us and control their costs, we could either meet quarterly or annually with them, some more often than even that. And the idea is to sit down because we've processed every claim, we see the trends, we know what's happening. Our goal is to sit down and say, okay, the growth trends are doing a certain amount, how are they -- how is that client? Let's say, they're in the -- pick a business. They're in the paint business, making paint or whatever, manufacturing. The idea is to line them up against other manufacturers because they're going to have similar demographics in their employment basis and compare the trends of their drug spend versus the trends of the industry. You don't show them individual other clients, but you can show aggregate values and show whether or not they're in the -- below the midpoint, above the midpoint or at the midpoint for controlling costs and then what are the bigger drivers of our costs. Our clinicians and account management team spend hours, monthly, quarterly, annually with our clients going through that process so that they constantly stay on top, tweak the benefits as they go, and then especially before they just roll out their enrollment for the upcoming year, they can tweak their benefits and really get them in line to better control costs in the next year as well. If it's a new client opportunity where we have a real -- when it's a -- all RFPs are different, but if we have the opportunity, we'd love to get historical claims data, then do the same analysis. So when we walk in and bid a business, we can to speak exactly what our programs are going to save them and also how much disruption. By disruption, we mean how many people are affected. So sometimes, some of the highest cost trends have very little usage on a per-capita basis, so you could have -- take a big change in the cost trend by only touching a handful of people. And so you can go after different savings opportunities and that's how we win in the marketplace."

So we're putting something sort of in place now that we won't be able to ascertain. If we do our job really well there, we will do a little bit better at the back half of the year and you would expect it to be more in the back half of the year as inflation mounts and as we hold our clients harmless to the numbers we give them, and as pharma, then remits to the commitments that they've made to us contractually. And so it really -- from our perspective, the program itself is terrific for clients and for us. I think the bigger story, though, is the relationship we have with pharma and how that increases the conversations and the leverage that we have. I think if you go back to a couple of years ago, the thought was from a pharma standpoint, narrow formularies, how long can -- does that runway last? And I think what we've demonstrated with Safeguard Rx and in dozens of conversations we're continuing to have with pharma, is that it is a lot more than just a narrow formulary that we can create when we bring innovation to working with pharma to create access for patients and the right cost profile for payers."

And then, secondly, you guys have taken some strong positions in the past trying to work on behalf of your clients. And currently, if we think about the issue around drug pricing, it's really an adversarial relationship between payers and manufacturers. As we move forward, though, if we're trying to balance sort of cost versus innovation, are there ways you think that actually payers can work with manufacturers to be more cooperative? And I guess, an example of that, do you see some sort of outcomes-based methods of formulary placement coming to greater usage?"

I'll take both questions. First of all, just at a macro level, the way Inflation Protection works is that we're able to go out and contract with pharma manufacturers who make commitments around sort of the maximum pricing that they will take, above which they will, through us, create value that we can then build back into the programs for our clients. So in essence, we go out and we don't reinsure because we're not taking true risk in an insurance sense. What we're doing is we're sort of out there contracting with pharma and then passing that back through to the program that we've got. So it's a very -- it holds pharma accountable and at the same time it puts our clients in a great position to the extent that inflation is higher than what we were able to cap it in these contracts. And what I would say as it relates to the adversarial pieces, there is no question that there are opportunities for us and payers generally to work with manufacturers who want to take a responsible view, and in fact, we provide an excellent way for those manufacturers to get to market in a way that is responsible, that creates maximum access for their innovative products, that ensures that there isn't wasteful behaviors taking place. And so -- and we have great example of that in our PCSK9 approach. You saw what we did in hep C. That was -- we're not a one-trick pony. To the contrary, we really believe that in the long run we can work very collaboratively with manufacturers to create access at a fair price to our payers. And there's a lot of room for negotiation and sort of argument about what fair price is and we work very, very relentlessly on behalf of our clients to drive for that. So yes is the short answer. And as we look at the pipeline, we see -- I was at a conference last week with a large number of pharma manufacturers, and several of them cornered me with specific ideas about outcomes-based or indication-based pricing and wanting to do it and their challenge is not having the data, which we have. And so we actually think we're in a perfect spot to help bring those things to life."

But I think on your 2016 guidance call back in December when you voluntarily brought up that 2012 Anthem price review, I think the point you were trying to make is that these reviews are somewhat routine and eventually get resolved and that investors shouldn't get too worked up about this. I'm wondering if, first, you could confirm that it was kind of the message back then? But also I think, just secondarily, is there any color on why you think that review back in 2012 seemed to reach a mutually beneficial conclusion without much fanfare, but this one just seems to be more contentious. I guess, what's changed so much since then, in your view, just generally speaking?"

Well, I'll try to add a little color, but again, I don't want to cross any lines here. Back in 2012, we did reach a mutually agreed-upon outcome and I think part of it is if you look at our total book of business, a lot of our clients do have what we call price checks. And in those price checks, they have the right to look at pricing and make sure that we are doing the right things for them and those are pretty routine. And we go through those -- a bunch of those every year. There's a difference in this one, though, and it's contractual and it's all of the data that's been disclosed. But here, it's not your traditional price check because of the very large up-front money that was paid out in this deal. So I can't really speak to why we haven't reached an agreement yet, but we are focused on reaching an agreement. I do think that there's a lot to be gained by reaching an agreement especially if it's in lockstep with them modernizing their benefit because if they do that, then the economics to their plan is significant. And again, we work together hand in glove to get that economics out of the supply chain and better focus, thereby it's better economics for them, it's good for us and it's really good for their clients and their members and their patients. So we're very hopeful that we can reach an agreement, but I can't give you any assurances or talk to -- nor will I talk to the process or how we're going about it."

And I would say that's gone beyond the National Preferred Formulary. While that's the cornerstone to our leverage, we work with any number of clients who are not on that formulary to help them at a drug level or therapeutic chapter level also go deep and create additional value by virtue of modeling and understanding those dynamics. And so from that standpoint, it's been very powerful. Over the last several years, as we've become more innovative in our contracting, we've been able to do things such as inflation caps and so forth. We've been able to actually expand access to the formulary rather than narrow it in some spots by virtue of actually creating a financial model where it was better, the PCSK9's being the most recent example, but certainly not the only example. I think that the last piece I'd say is as we've been able to get significant value there, clients are more than willing to share that value with us because of the fact it aligns us so well to keep taking the bold actions that are in both of our interests."

So as we shut down facilities and we consolidate operations to get better efficiencies, that reduces headcount. In addition to that, we also, over the last couple of years, have made some very big investments in our infrastructure in order to make sure that we can continue to drive costs. I echo what Eric said earlier that as we have -- we've always had a big focus on taking out costs. When we bought Medco, if you go back and look year-over-year at SG&A and SG&A per script, we had a pretty good spike that drove up the costs because of the redundancies in the businesses. And there's one thing to consolidate the technology platforms, but it's a whole another thing to start consolidating all of the -- or integrating all of the processes and that's where they're in the midst of doing as we speak.

A week ago, we filed a response to Anthem's lawsuit. As I have said before, I strongly prefer that we never reach this point. However, we want to make clear that we are confident -- that we have negotiated in good faith for fulfilling our contractual obligations on providing excellent services to both Anthem and its members. While it's unfortunate we are in the situation, we believe our legal case is strong. We value Anthem as a client and we very much would like to continue working with them for the long term. We believe we're Anthem's best PBM option, delivering great care, keeping drug costs in check and helping to grow their business. We are currently collaborating with them to implement solutions and we are proud of the results we are helping Anthem to achieve. We look forward to spending today focusing on results of our strong financial quarter and sharing our excitement about our future.

This morning, I'm happy to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.22, representing growth of 11% over last year. In line with our expectations, we adjudicated approximately 324 million adjusted claims, up 5% year-over-year. We also generated EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion. The anticipated lower EBITDA and profitability per adjusted claim relative to the first quarter of 2015 was a result of several things including the expected transition of the Catamaran business at the end of 2015 and into 2016, of which the primary services provided were formulary management and manufacture rebate services with no associated claims; the expected rolloff of the Coventry Medicare business on January 1, 2016; the annual impact attributable to our renewals, of which January 1, 2016 was an above average year; and the associated ramp-up cost per benefit design changes and 1/1 implementations; and finally, and in particular, the renewal of our second-largest client in May 2015, which initially results in lower margin per claim. 
In addition this quarter, we issued senior notes consisting of 500 million 3.3% Senior Notes due 2021 and 1.5 billion 4.5% senior notes due 2026. The proceeds were used to repay debt and to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program and for other general corporate purposes. 
During the quarter, we've repurchased approximately 46 million shares or roughly $3.4 billion, which includes the impacts of settling our 2015 ASR program in January of 2016 and the new 2016 ASR program in late February. We expect the settlement of the 2016 ASR program to occur in the third quarter. 
Finally, I want to touch on a change made to amortization of the Anthem intangible assets. In 2009, based on the overall structure and complexity of agreement, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we assumed a 15-year amortization period for the intangible asset. In light of Anthem's lawsuit and following accounting guidance, we change the amortization to and with the current contract in 2019. The effect was to reduce the amortization period by 5 years. The trigger and event for this change took place in March and increased first quarter intangible asset amortization by $10.5 million. Future quarters will increase by approximately $32 million. This change has no impact on EBITDA. Although this was a prudent decision under generally accepted accounting principles requirements, this change does not reflect our commitment to service Anthem's patients or our commitment to renew the contract at the end of the term. We believe we are the best partner to service Anthem's complex business and are well positioned to improve the competitiveness of their offering in the market. 
Looking forward, we are pleased with our 2016 earnings guidance. We continue to expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA. While consistent with previous years, the increased profitability in the back half of 2016 is a result of our model of alignment, focused scale and supply chain strategies expected to drive strong operating and financial results. More specifically, we anticipate mail growth and new generic launches will drive increased volumes as the year progresses. In addition, our digital and productivity initiatives are expected to drive lower field costs and call volumes in the second half of the year. 
We are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share from a range of $6.10 to $6.28 to a new range of $6.31 to $6.43, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2015. This increase is attributed to our focus on generating cash flow from operations and managing our capital structure to maximize shareholder returns. We now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 635 million to 645 million. With respect to the second quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.59, up 8% to 10% year-over-year. Consistent with recent years, we anticipate revenues related to a large client contract will be realized in the second quarter due to the structure of the contract. 
In summary, we delivered overall financial performance in line with our expectation and expect to deliver solid results for the year. 
I will now turn the call over to Tim."

As Eric noted, our financial results are strong and we have a great foundation upon which to build. Eric and I and our teams share a steadfast commitment to return on invested capital, rigorous financial discipline and focused expense management. This financial mindset fuels our business model of alignment and our commitment to client and patient care. We are well positioned to maximize long-term client and shareholder value. 
We continue to invest in creating dynamic solutions to help patients and clients. Leveraging our digital assets and engagement strategies, we comprehensively drive better more cost-effective health outcomes. These solutions include an expanding range of programs which combine our deep specialized approach to patient care with our ability to creatively contract the best cost and care outcomes. As we enhance our core capabilities, we create even more reasons for clients to stay with us and for prospects to choose us. As I look at the evolving health care landscapes, it is clear that our powerful collection of assets protect our clients against tomorrow's health care challenges while we address today's acute client needs. 
In that context, we're very pleased in our performance thus far during the selling of the renewal season. While it is still early, we anticipate another strong year with a 2017 retention rate of 95% to 98% excluding approximately 1% of Coventry scrips that are rolling off due to acquisition. You will recall last year, our retention guidance at this point in 2015 was 94% to 97%. We clearly have positive momentum. That momentum will be on display later this week as we welcome more than 1,000 attendees to our Outcomes Symposium for clients and prospects. They attend because we develop the industry's most effective solutions deliver the best patient clear and drive powerful advocacy to put medicine within reach of those who need it. We will share with our clients and prospects new solutions that build upon the industry-leading clinical programs we have collaborated with them to develop. Simply put, our clients are working with us to create the future of pharmacy. 
Speaking of the future, I'm excited to take on the role of CEO and lead our company forward. Energized by a singular mission to deliver great care for patients and [indiscernible] align with clients, Express Scripts will continue to change health care through relentless innovation and bold actions.

I look forward to staying on as Chairman as we position Express Scripts for continued growth. 
I also want to take a moment and thank all of you for believing in Express Scripts over the years and investing in us so that we can do the important work of controlling health care costs and improving health patient outcomes. When you invest in Express Scripts, you're investing in the health care of 85 million people we service. We have been successful because we focus on doing one thing extremely well: caring for our patients. Our business model alignment achieves better patient health outcomes and helps clients control health care costs. Our mission is to keep our clients with these constantly evolving marketplace trends. We accomplish this by continuously developing new innovative solutions for our clients. 
This is as critical today as it was in 1998 when I joined Express Scripts. In 18 years, we've had dozens of earnings calls, hundreds of investor conferences and thousands of meetings with you. I have always have one clear theme: an independent PBM fully aligned with clients can dramatically improve health outcomes. You can measure our success in many ways, but the most important measure is that we have helped millions of people live better lives.

So when we think about business that was brought on for 1/1 of '16, you talked about some incremental cost, you've talked about mail  and some other programs that will ramp throughout the year. I'm just curious, if you look back, was there anything unusual about 2016 and the business that you brought on from a pricing perspective? And then as we think about 2017, can you maybe talk about, one, the pricing environment? Two, I believe you have a retail relationship that's up for renewal. They recently signed with autumn [ph].

So from that standpoint, I would not read through the -- what has been a sequencing of EBITDA that I've seen for most of my 18 years in this business. Anything different as it relates to that in our first quarter results is competitive. There was a lot of business that we were able to bid on and win, and we feel good about that. As it relates to the products that are out there regarding the use of 90-day scrips, as you know, we do have actually 2 different Retail90 products that we take to market, one of them with Walgreens. And I completely believe that as we drive a more consumer-focused model, and as we drive even stronger member interface, that those programs will continue to -- for certain clients and those clients some of them are ours, some of them aren't ours, could be something that they want, and we see a very strong opportunity to work with partners in retail to ensure that we deliver not only best cost outcomes but look at really what else can you do in managing the total member and what role can retail play in that."

And what you're now seeing based on a better retention year and our focus on improving experience is that, in fact, there are a lot of clients that have always believed in mail, that continue to believe in mail, that are working with us to support mail, and increasingly, we're seeing health plans move that direction. And so we've had several large health plans in the last 6 months with hundreds of thousands of lives in our Select Home Delivery program as, again, we got experience to the planned where consumers are supportive of it, they're supportive of it, they like the cost and clinical outcomes that it has.

It is also the management of individual patient choice as we see these new products come out. And so from that standpoint, again, the real leverage isn't just gross to net on rebates. It's gross to net on patient cost compared to what the ideal would be, and we hold ourselves to a very high standard on both of those. And we see that as a significant differentiator and a significant opportunity for the next 3 to 5 years."

We showed that prospect using their own data. But we've invested quietly but significantly in the ability to manage large amounts of data that -- in very complex ways. And so when you look at fraud ways and abuse and what we've been able to do, not only -- compounds was not one and done. If you take a look that as a daily battle for us to stay ahead of sort of a marketplace that's constantly ""innovating"" as it relates to is to take our client's money without creating value. And so we use great amounts of that data and not only in our own book [indiscernible] fraud ways and abuse but increasingly for our health plan clients to help them power their programs, power their provider networks, power their payment mechanisms by virtue of being able to have a very complete look at prescribing patterns and patient outcomes and so forth. Another example around that is opioids. And so we actually as part of our product suite, is in fact a predictive model as it relates to patients who potentially could become addicted to opioids based on a whole series of factors we're able to take from the data that we would have around those individuals, their prescribers, their conditions and so forth. And again, that's a very significant piece. I've heard Steve Miller say and Glenn Stettin say, that the epidemic that occurred in Indiana, we would have actually picked it up as it relates to the AIDS coming back because of used needles. We would've picked that up much more quickly in our data than actually the actual experience picked up. So you take that. And then if you overlay that with the ability to manage patients and predict their outcomes at the individual level around adherence, again, we become very, very good at predicting and intervening ahead of when a patient becomes not adherent based on factors that we're aware of. And so all of that is just -- it's certain examples of how we're able to use this. I think the last piece, as we look forward, things like prior authorizations and how we can work with physicians to make those more streamlined, make them more intuitive, if we have something in the patient's history, even if they weren't our patient at the time, that we're able to get and understand, those are things that we are able to do as well."

We have to start with the clients benefit-design and the patients, therefore, what they have access to. But where they've been investing and continue to invest is, you may have heard me say this in the past, back a couple of years ago, I guess it was 1.5 years ago, when we began to search for someone to drive our mail franchise forward, we ultimately concluded that it wasn't about driving mail franchise. It was driving member experience in an environment that's increasingly omni-channel. And once you define that as your challenge, and you define the clinical advantages of mail for the patients for whom that's right, and you look at the acute care that you can deliver through a strong retail network, you look at the other things you can do to build Star ratings, the health plan and other things, that informs a strategy that cuts across our entire organization. And so while it manifests itself, yes, in our digital app, which, if you follow it, has evolved several iterations in the last year and is now a 4-plus-star app on the App Store, it was 2 when we started, in terms of how the website presents opportunities for patients, which has doubled our daily retail to mail conversions and continues to for those patients where that's a benefit and where the plan save money. But it also then moves all the way across the platform to our patient care advocates who have better tools, more intuitive information put right in front of them by virtue of those same algorithms that are driving our digital strategy for the member-facing piece. And so end-to-end, when you look at sort of what we do with member engagement, it really fuels the first I think the first inning still of the game, where we believe we can that be transformative in helping members or their caregivers make best decisions."

We have nothing but intention to continue to do a great job for them, to position ourselves well to be a choice that they want to make it at some period of time in the future when we get this behind us. And so what we've done had made it very, very clear to our team sort of kind of how to keep this isolated kind of focus on the things that actually our clients need us to focus on.

When you're dealing with the -- our account teams are dealing with the pharmacy management teams and our clients, this may come up but it's really one of questions in trying to understand it because [indiscernible] there's a lot of written about it and what have you. So there's always going to be conversation. I don't think it's a really distraction, though, because it's what we deliver, it's what we do. But if you go to the other side of that, I've been CEO here for quite some time, CFO before that, I've been in this business for a long time, I was in other businesses before this one, what you don't typically see is public hearing of a situation. And I think that's what really strikes most CEOs. I still have a lot of conversations with CEOs. Tim is taking over those relationships. He's building on. Tim and I have been onto a lot of clients over the last several months. And when you do that, obviously, when you sit with another CEOs that often has disputes with their partners and vendors, it never gets to this level. And so I think there's an inquisitive mind at the other end of the table that says, what's going on. And unfortunately, for us, we scratch our heads with that because we would've liked to have all this done in the back room and figured out how to solve these things and how to go forward and on a mutually agreeable basis. But unfortunately, it didn't come out that way. At the CEO level, those conversations are -- do take place but not from -- hurt the business or puts us at risk or hurts our ability to sell, but instead, it's really just a little bit of head-scratching going on in the conversation."

As you can appreciate given our size and where we sit in the marketplace, we have an awful lot of stuff that we get to take a look at. But let me be clear, anything that we think could help our clients or help our patients can drive better outcomes, can expand or extend our model or otherwise be complementary, we're interested in if it adds shareholder value, if it makes sense from both a financial standpoint and a strategic standpoint. It also has to compete against what can we do without the asset. And so when -- we've looked at any number of things, I'm going to go any specific example, I'm familiar with obviously some of what has traded and some [indiscernible] will and I understand why those who bought it bought it.

We will not be aggressive where it doesn't make sense where we see other ways to achieve a similar result at using our capital more efficiently. So the last thing I'd say is I wouldn't want you to think it's either or.

What I'd say is, our book of business and I look at this over about a 5, 6 years ago, the Express Scripts book of business in particular has a nice middle-market element to it. There's a more natural churn there that broke us and so forth. And so some of that, when you look at the churn, it's  not any one reason. You've got a couple of our market segments. Typically, the other thing that happens is if we drop the ball on service it goes into play and now we really have to chase our tails, and thankfully, we're strong on service right now. We saw 2, 3 years ago where it looks like we're trying to catch up on service. And so what I'd tell you there's no one thing that drives it, 95% to 98% is something we feel good about. We target the high end of that range, as you can appreciate. I've told people I won't be very satisfied the low end of that range, and that suggests to me that there's a pretty minor amount of churn in the grand scheme of things."

I don't know that any one drug is a harbinger of things to come. I think it's a harbinger, though, at a macro level that we have changed the dialogue with pharma over the last 2 to 3 years and we will continue to work very hard to create access for their products at fair prices for the patients who should be on them and the pharma companies that want to work with us on that basis are coming to the table and making great choices, and we hope that continues."

I ask because there is 30% revenue growth there this quarter, obviously very impressive. I'm wondering specifically if that's a couple of key launches going through CuraScript, specialty distribution or if it is another item. And the second part of that question would be as it relates to CuraScript. Obviously, there's new Part D pilot programs out there. I was wondering what Express Scripts' stance is on the potential for those to lower cost and maybe more discreetly what type of impact that might have on the business as we look out later this year and into 2017."

And so I really don't have a lot of great depth of commentary for you there other than to say obviously, for us, we see a lot of opportunity on the medical side generally across a number of ways to get at that spend and manage it as well as supplying some of the folks that are actually delivering care. And so and it's something we're deeply looking at and thinking through, but in the short term, our assets are really, really good."

However, we want to make clear that we are confident -- that we have negotiated in good faith for fulfilling our contractual obligations, on providing excellent services to both Anthem and its members. While it's unfortunate we are in this situation, we believe our legal case is strong. We value Anthem as a client, and we very much would like to continue working with them for the long term. We believe we're Anthem's best PBM option, delivering great care, keeping drug costs in check and helping to grow their business. We are currently collaborating with them to implement solutions, and we are proud of the results we are helping Anthem to achieve. We look forward to, spending today, focusing on the results of our strong financial quarter and sharing our excitement about our future.

This morning, I'm happy to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.22, representing growth of 11% over last year. In line with our expectations, we adjudicated approximately 324 million adjusted claims, up 5% year-over-year. We also generated EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion. The anticipated lower EBITDA and profitability per adjusted claim relative to the first quarter of 2015 was a result of several things, including the expected transition of the Catamaran business at the end of 2015 and into 2016, of which the primary services provided were formulary management and manufacturer rebate services with no associated claims; the expected roll-off of the Coventry Medicare business on January 1, 2016; the annual impact attributable to our renewals, of which January 1, 2016 was an above-average year; and the associated ramp-up cost for benefit design changes and 1/1 implementations; and finally, and in particular, the renewal of our second-largest client in May 2015, which initially results in lower margin per claim.
In addition, this quarter, we issued senior notes consisting of $500 million 3.3% senior notes due 2021 and $1.5 billion 4.5% senior notes due 2026. The proceeds were used to repay debt and to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program and for other general corporate purposes.
During the quarter, we've repurchased approximately 46 million shares or roughly $3.4 billion, which includes the impacts of settling our 2015 ASR program in January of 2016 and the new 2016 ASR program in late February. We expect the settlement of the 2016 ASR program to occur in the third quarter.
Finally, I want to touch on a change made to amortization of the Anthem intangible assets. In 2009, based on the overall structure and complexity of the agreement, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we assumed a 15-year amortization period for the intangible asset. In light of Anthem's lawsuit and following accounting guidance, we changed the amortization to end with the current contract in 2019. The effect was to reduce the amortization period by 5 years. The triggering event for this change took place in March and increased the first quarter intangible asset amortization by $10.5 million. Future quarters will increase by approximately $32 million. This change has no impact on EBITDA. Although this was a prudent decision under generally accepted accounting principle requirements, this change does not reflect our commitment to service Anthem's patients or our commitment to renew the contract at the end of the term. We believe we are the best partner to service Anthem's complex business and are well positioned to improve the competitiveness of their offering in the market.
Looking forward, we are pleased with our 2016 earnings guidance. We continue to expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA. While consistent with previous years, the increased profitability in the back half of 2016 is a result of our model of alignment, focused scale and supply chain strategies expected to drive strong operating and financial results. More specifically, we anticipate mail growth and new generic launches will drive increased volumes as the year progresses. In addition, our digital and productivity initiatives are expected to drive lower field costs and call volumes in the second half of the year.
We are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share from a range of $6.10 to $6.28 to a new range of $6.31 to $6.43, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2015. This increase is attributed to our focus on generating cash flow from operations and managing our capital structure to maximize shareholder returns. We now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 635 million to 645 million. With respect to the second quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.59, up 8% to 10% year-over-year. Consistent with recent years, we anticipate revenues related to a large client contract will be realized in the second quarter due to the structure of the contract.
In summary, we delivered overall financial performance in line with our expectation and expect to deliver solid results for the year.
I will now turn the call over to Tim."

As Eric noted, our financial results are strong, and we have a great foundation upon which to build. Eric and I and our teams share a steadfast commitment to return on invested capital, rigorous financial discipline and focused expense management. This financial mindset fuels our business model of alignment and our commitment to client and patient care. We are well positioned to maximize long-term client and shareholder values.
We continue to invest in creating dynamic solutions to help patients and clients. Leveraging our digital assets and engagement strategies, we comprehensively drive better, more cost-effective health outcomes. These solutions include an expanding range of programs, which combine our deep specialized approach to patient care with our ability to creatively contract the best cost and care outcomes. As we enhance our core capabilities, we create even more reasons for clients to stay with us and for prospects to choose us. As I look at the evolving health care landscape, it is clear that our powerful collection of assets protect our clients against tomorrow's healthcare challenges, while we address today's acute client needs.
In that context, we're very pleased in our performance thus far during the selling and renewal season. While it is still early, we anticipate another strong year with a 2017 retention rate of 95% to 98%, excluding approximately 1% of Coventry scrips that are rolling off due to acquisition. You'll recall last year, our retention guidance at this point in 2015 was 94% to 97%. We clearly have positive momentum. That momentum will be on display later this week as we welcome more than 1,000 attendees to our Outcomes Symposium for clients and prospects. They attend because we develop the industry's most effective solutions, deliver the best patient care and drive powerful advocacy to put medicine within reach of those who need it. We will share with our clients and prospects new solutions that build upon the industry-leading clinical programs we have collaborated with them to develop. Simply put, our clients are working with us to create the future of pharmacy.
Speaking of the future, I'm excited to take on the role of CEO and lead our company forward. Energized by a singular mission to deliver great care for patients and always align with clients, Express Scripts will continue to change health care through relentless innovation and bold actions.

When you invest in Express Scripts, you're investing in the health care of 85 million people we service. We have been successful because we focus on doing one thing extremely well, caring for our patients. Our business model alignment achieves better patient health outcomes and helps clients control health care costs. Our mission is to keep our clients ahead of constantly evolving marketplace trends. We accomplish this by continuously developing new innovative solutions for our clients.
This is as critical today as it was in 1998 when I joined Express Scripts. In 18 years, we've had dozens of earnings calls, hundreds of investor conferences and thousands of meetings with you. I have always had one clear theme: an independent PBM fully aligned with clients can dramatically improve health outcomes. You can measure our success in many ways, but the most important measure is that we have helped millions of people live better lives.

So from that standpoint, I would not read through the -- what has been a sequencing of EBITDA that I've seen for most of my 18 years in this business. Anything different as it relates to that in our first quarter results, it's competitive. There was a lot of business that we were able to bid on and win, and we feel good about that. As it relates to the products that are out there regarding the use of 90-day scripts, as you know, we do have actually 2 different Retail90 products that we take to market, one of them with Walgreens. And I completely believe that as we drive a more consumer-focus model, and as we drive even stronger member interface, that those programs will continue to, for certain clients and those clients are some of them are ours, some of them aren't ours, to be something that they want, and we see a very strong opportunity to work with partners in retail to ensure that we deliver not only the best cost outcomes, but look at really what else can you do in managing the total member and what role can retail play in that."

And so we've had several large health plans in the last 6 months with hundreds of thousands of lives in our Select Home Delivery program as, again, we got experience to the point where consumers are supportive of it, they're supportive of it, they like the cost and clinical outcomes that it has.

Certainly, there are new drug launches coming out -- expected to come out. And as we sit here today and estimate those volumes, if those don't materialize, that's one of the headwinds in the back half of the year. I think everything else for the most part, we have line of sight visibility into. Obviously, utilization has to continue to stay on the same path. No reason to expect that, that won't. But those are the really the bigger drivers of that. And then as I talked about in my script, we also have very significant cost reductions planned around productivity and our digital initiatives. Our digital initiatives are one of the things that's been driving our improvement in our mail volumes. We think that will continue and will continue to enhance those digital initiatives to make for a better patient experience, but those are kind of the things that are the bigger drivers of the year."

It was what I heard JPMorgan with the most frequently asked question is this notion, and the reason I think it is, is because it has gotten wide, and it's very clear. Those who are willing to take bold actions, those who are caring for patients in a way that enable things to be done that drive better outcomes, even though those things may look challenging, witness what we did in hepatitis C, are going to enjoy the better results as it relates to that gross to net spread. They are going to be at the bottom of that cost, which is where we have put our clients and how we've worked with them. And I've got to tell you, it's still early. So I'm not going to prognosticate as it relates to pharma inflation for the full year. I don't expect it to be low, let's put it that way. And I believe that the players that are going to create maximum value for patients and for payers for the -- as far out as we look, and this has been true even without the super high inflation we've seen in the last couple of years. It's been those that can dramatically affect outcomes that are better for patients. I think the other piece I would say is that it's twofold. It's not just the management of formulary, it is also the management of individual patient choice as we see these new products come out. And so from that standpoint, again, the real leverage isn't just gross to net on rebates, it's gross to net on patient cost compared to what the ideal would be, and we hold ourselves to a very high standard on both of those. And we see that as a significant differentiator and a significant opportunity for the next 3 to 5 years."

I gave you one little bit of an example just now when I talked about our prospect deck, and that was one of half a dozen things. We showed that prospect using their own data, but we've invested quietly but significantly in the ability to manage large amounts of data that -- in very complex ways. And so when you look at fraud ways and abuse and what we've been able to do, not only -- compounds was not one and done. If you take a look that as a daily battle for us to stay ahead of sort of a marketplace that's constantly ""innovating"" as it relates to ways to take our client's money without creating value. And so we use great amounts of that data and say not only in our own book run fraud ways and abuse but increasingly for our health plan clients to help them power their programs, power their provider networks, power their payment mechanisms by virtue of being able to have a very complete look at prescribing patterns and patient outcomes and so forth. Another example around that is opioids. And so we actually, as part of our product suite, is in fact a predictive model as it relates to patients who potentially could become addicted to opioids based on a whole series of factors we're able to take from the data that we would have around those individuals, their prescribers, their conditions and so forth. And again, that's a very significant piece. I've heard Steve Miller say and Glenn Stettin say that the epidemic that occurred in Indiana, we would've actually picked it up as it relates to the AIDS coming back because of the used needles. We would've picked that up much more quickly in our data than actually the actual experience picked up. So you take that and then if you overlay that with the ability to manage patients and predict their outcomes at the individual level around adherence, again, we become very, very good at predicting and intervening ahead of when a patient becomes not adherent based on factors that we're aware of. And so all of that is just certain examples of how we're able to use this. I think the last piece is, as we look forward, things like prior authorizations and how we can work with physicians to make those more streamlined, make them more intuitive, if we have something in the patient's history, even if they weren't our patient at the time, that we're able to get and understand, those are things that we are able to do as well."

We have to start with the clients' benefit design and the patients, therefore, what they have access to. But where we've been investing and continue to invest is you may have heard me say this in the past, back a couple of years ago, I guess it was 1.5 years ago, when we began to search for someone to drive our mail franchise forward, we ultimately concluded that it wasn't about driving mail franchise. It was about driving member experience in an environment that's increasingly omni-channel. And once you define that as your challenge, and you define the clinical advantages of mail for the patients for whom that's right and you look at the acute care that you can deliver through a strong retail network, you look at the other things you can do to build the star ratings, the health plans and other things, that then informs a strategy that cuts across our entire organization. And so while it manifests itself, yes, in our digital app, which, if you follow it, has evolved several iterations in the last year and is now a 4-plus-star app on the App Store. It was 2 when we started in terms of how the website presents opportunities for patients, which has doubled our daily retail to mail conversions and continues to for those patients where that's a benefit and where the plans save money. But it also then moves all the way across the platform to our patient care advocates who have better tools, more intuitive information put right in front of them, by virtue of those same algorithms that are driving our digital strategy for the member-facing piece. And so end-to-end, when you look at sort of what we're doing at member engagement, it really fuels the first -- I think the first inning still of the game, where we believe we can be transformative in helping members or their caregivers make the best decisions."

I don't think it's really a distraction, though, because it's what we deliver, it's what we do. But if you go to the other side of that, I've been CEO here for quite some time, CFO before that. I've been in this business for a long time. I was in other businesses before this one. What you don't, typically, see is public hearing of a situation. And I think that's what really strikes most CEOs. I still have a lot of conversations with CEOs. Tim is taking over those relationships. He's building on. Tim and I have been onto a lot of clients over the last several months. And when you do that, obviously, when you're sit with another CEO that often has disputes with their partners and vendors, it never gets to this level. And so I think there is an inquisitive mind at the other end of the table that says, what's going on. And unfortunately, for us, we scratch our heads with that because we would've liked to have all this done in the backroom and figured out how to solve these things and how to go forward and -- on mutually agreeable basis. But unfortunately, it didn't come out that way. So at the CEO level, those conversations are -- do take place but not from -- hurt the business or puts us at risk or hurts our ability to sell, but instead, it's really just a little bit of head-scratching going on in the conversation."

We -- and we said this I know, are very actively and we'll continue to be very active in looking at all of sorts of things. As you can appreciate given our size and where we sit in the marketplace, we have an awful lot of stuff that we get to take a look at. But let me be clear, anything that we think can help our clients or help our patients can drive better outcomes, can expand or extend our model or otherwise be complementary, we're interested in, if it adds shareholder value, if it makes sense from both a financial standpoint and a strategic standpoint. It also has to compete against what can we do without the asset. And so when -- we've looked at any number of things. I'm going to go any specific examples. I'm familiar with, obviously, some of what has traded and some what will, and I understand why those who bought it, bought it. But let me be clear, we will be aggressive where we can draw a line to those 3 things: shareholder value, helping our clients and helping our patients. We will not be aggressive where it doesn't make sense where we see other ways to achieve a similar result using our capital more efficiently. So the last thing I'd say is I wouldn't want you to think it's either or. I would not want you to think that because we're buying the stock back. We, therefore, were not strongly and deeply looking at any number of opportunities that are in the marketplace. We are big enough and hopefully disciplined enough -- I believe disciplined enough, we certainly have had a history of it and I intend to carry that forward to be able to do both of those things really, really well."

What I'd say is, our book of business -- and I looked at this over about a 5, 6 years ago, the Express Scripts book of business, in particular, has a nice middle market element to it. There is a more natural churn there that broke us and so forth. And so some of that -- when you look at the churn, it's not any one reason. You've got a couple of different market segments. Typically, the other thing that happens is if we drop the ball on service, it goes into play. And now we really have to chase our tail, and thankfully, we're strong on service right now. We saw 2, 3 years ago where it looks like when, in fact, we're trying to catch up on service. And so what I'd tell you there's no one thing that drives it, 95% to 98% is something we feel good about. We target the high end of that range, as you can appreciate. I've told people I won't be very satisfied the low end of that range, and that suggests to me that there's a pretty minor amount of churn in the grand scheme of things."

And you've heard several of them say that the missing piece for them has been what we can bring to the table, which is the capture data and the use of data in such a way is to help them be confident that the way that they're pricing the product is actually finding its way into the hands of patients and to support of clients.

I think it's a harbinger, though, at a macro level that we have changed the dialogue with pharma over the last 2 to 3 years.

That's a cycle that we visit every year. And if you look at our trends over the last years, you will see that profitability ramps up in the back half of the year and that's not going to change."

And the second part of that question would be as it relates to CuraScript, obviously, there's new Part B pilot programs out there.

We've had some new client growth. We've had some new products come to market, and so all of those fuel both our -- especially our distribution business as well as our UBC business as it relates to that. I would also call out our Canadian business is really doing a great job and continues to grow clients as well and has moved into new product lines, including specialty. And so when you take a look at that collection of businesses, again, that -- with the exception of Canada that doesn't produce scripts, we like a lot. Sort of that it becomes an area of us a for focus to potentially do M&A as well as just organically right now, the leadership of those businesses are doing a terrific job addressing their clients' challenges. As it relates to Part B, I think it's a little bit early to call. And so I really don't have a lot of great depth of commentary for you there other than to say, obviously, for us, we see a lot of opportunity on the medical side, generally, across a number of ways to get at that spend and manage it as well as supplying some of the folks that are actually delivering care. And so -- and it's something we're deeply looking at and thinking through, but in the short term, our assets are really, really good."

However, we want to make clear that we are confident in our -- that we have negotiated in good faith for fulfilling our contractual obligations, on providing excellent services to both Anthem and its members. While it is unfortunate we are in this situation, we believe our legal case is strong. We value Anthem as a client, and we very much would like to continue working with them for the long term. We believe we're Anthem's best PBM option, delivering great care, keeping drug costs in check and helping to grow their business. We are currently collaborating with them to implement solutions, and we are proud of the results we are helping Anthem to achieve. We look forward to spending today focusing on the results of our strong financial quarter and sharing our excitement about our future.

This morning, I'm happy to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.22, representing growth of 11% over last year. In line with our expectations, we adjudicated approximately 324 million adjusted claims, up 5% year-over-year. We also generated EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion. The anticipated lower EBITDA and profitability per adjusted claim relative to the first quarter of 2015 was a result of several things, including the expected transition of the Catamaran business at the end of 2015 and into 2016, of which the primary services provided were formulary management and manufacturer rebate services with no associated claims; the expected roll-off of the Coventry Medicare business on January 1, 2016; the annual impact attributable to our renewals, of which January 1, 2016 was an above-average year; and the associated ramp-up cost for benefit design changes and 1/1 implementations; and finally, and in particular, the renewal of our second-largest client in May 2015, which initially results in lower margin per claim.
In addition, this quarter, we issued senior notes consisting of $500 million 3.3% senior notes due 2021 and $1.5 billion 4.5% senior notes due 2026. The proceeds were used to repay debt and to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program and for other general corporate purposes.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 46 million shares for roughly $3.4 billion, which includes the impacts of settling our 2015 ASR program in January of 2016 and the new 2016 ASR program in late February. We expect the settlement of the 2016 ASR program to occur in the third quarter.
Finally, I want to touch on a change made to amortization of the Anthem intangible assets. In 2009, based on the overall structure and complexity of the agreement, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we assumed a 15-year amortization period for the intangible asset. In light of Anthem's lawsuit and following accounting guidance, we changed the amortization to end with the current contract in 2019. The effect was to reduce the amortization period by 5 years. The triggering event for this change took place in March and increased the first quarter intangible asset amortization by $10.5 million. Future quarters will increase by approximately $32 million. This change has no impact on EBITDA. Although this was a prudent decision under generally accepted accounting principle requirements, this change does not reflect our commitment to service Anthem's patients or our commitment to renew the contract at the end of the term. We believe we are the best partner to service Anthem's complex business and are well positioned to improve the competitiveness of their offerings in the market.
Looking forward, we are pleased with our 2016 earnings guidance. We continue to expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA. While consistent with previous years, the increased profitability in the back half of 2016 is a result of our model of alignment, focused scale and supply chain strategies expected to drive strong operating and financial results. More specifically, we anticipate mail growth and new generic launches will drive increased volumes as the year progresses. In addition, our digital and productivity initiatives are expected to drive lower field costs and call volumes in the second half of the year.
We are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share from a range of $6.10 to $6.28 to a new range of $6.31 to $6.43, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2015. This increase is attributed to our focus on generating cash flow from operations and managing our capital structure to maximize shareholder returns. We now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 635 million to 645 million. With respect to the second quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.59, up 8% to 10% year-over-year. Consistent with recent years, we anticipate revenues related to a large client contract will be realized in the second quarter due to the structure of the contract.
In summary, we delivered overall financial performance in line with our expectation and expect to deliver solid results for the year.
I will now turn the call over to Tim."

As Eric noted, our financial results are strong, and we have a great foundation upon which to build. Eric and I and our teams share a steadfast commitment to return on invested capital, rigorous financial discipline and focused expense management. This financial mindset fuels our business model of alignment and our commitment to client and patient care. We are well positioned to maximize long-term client and shareholder values.
We continue to invest in creating dynamic solutions to help patients and clients. Leveraging our digital assets and engagement strategies, we comprehensively drive better, more cost-effective health outcomes. These solutions include an expanding range of programs, which combine our deep specialized approach to patient care with our ability to creatively contract for best cost and care outcomes. As we enhance our core capabilities, we create even more reasons for clients to stay with us and for prospects to choose us. As I look at the evolving health-care landscape, it is clear that our powerful collection of assets protects our clients against tomorrow's health-care challenges, while we address today's acute client needs.
In that context, we're very pleased in our performance thus far during the selling and renewal season. While it is still early, we anticipate another strong year, with a 2017 retention rate of 95% to 98%, excluding approximately 1% of Coventry scrips that are rolling off due to acquisition. You'll recall last year, our retention guidance at this point in 2015 was 94% to 97%. We clearly have positive momentum. That momentum will be on display later this week as we welcome more than 1,000 attendees to our Outcomes Symposium for clients and prospects. They attend because we develop the industry's most effective solutions, deliver the best patient care and drive powerful advocacy to put medicine within reach of those who need it. We will share with our clients and prospects new solutions that build upon the industry-leading clinical programs we have collaborated with them to develop. Simply put, our clients are working with us to create the future of pharmacy.
Speaking of the future, I'm excited to take on the role of CEO and lead our company forward. Energized by a singular mission to deliver great care for patients and always aligned with clients, Express Scripts will continue to change health care through relentless innovation and bold actions.

Our mission is to keep our clients ahead of constantly evolving marketplace trends. We accomplish this by continuously developing new, innovative solutions for our clients.

I have always had one clear theme: an independent PBM fully aligned with clients can dramatically improve health outcomes.

There was a lot of business that we were able to bid on and win, and we feel good about that. As it relates to the products that are out there regarding the use of 90-day scripts, as you know, we do have actually 2 different Retail90 products that we take to market, one of them with Walgreens. And I completely believe that as we drive a more consumer-focused model, and as we drive even stronger member interface, that those programs will continue to, for certain clients and those clients are -- some of them are ours, some of them aren't ours, to be something that they want, and we see a very strong opportunity to work with partners in retail to ensure that we deliver not only the best cost outcomes, but look at really what else can you do in managing the total member and what role can retail play in that."

And so we've had several large health plans in the last 6 months with hundreds of thousands of lives in our Select Home Delivery program as, again, we got experience to the point where consumers are supportive of it.

This year I would call a more normal year, maybe a slightly light year, but I would call it a normal year for us both in terms of mix of business as well as the size of the book that's out there. But as it relates to the -- sort of the way it spreads out, I would say it's pretty normal. As it relates to the opportunities that are out there right now, I would say it's a bit better than last year, just a bit. We see a little bit more in a couple of spaces of opportunity than we would've seen last year, but it's early. And as you know, the year plays out pretty much for us over the next 3 to 4 months, and we'll hopefully find ourselves on the good side. We've certainly had some early successes. We're very pleased with that, and we got some business we're already installing for 1/17 of one very significant health plan, but we got a lot of work left to do."

It was what I heard at JPMorgan was the most frequently asked question is this notion, and the reason I think it is, is because it has gotten wide, and it's very clear. Those who are willing to take bold actions, those who are caring for patients in a way that enable things to be done that drive better outcomes, even though those things may look challenging, witness what we did in hepatitis C, are going to enjoy the better results as it relates to that gross to net spread. They are going to be at the bottom of that cost curve, which is where we have put our clients and how we've worked with them. And I've got to tell you, it's still early. So I'm not going to prognosticate as it relates to pharma inflation for the full year. I don't expect it to be low, let's put it that way. And I believe that the players that are going to create maximum value for patients and for payers for the -- as far out as we look, and this has been true even without the super high inflation we've seen in the last couple of years, has been those that can dramatically affect outcomes that are better for patients. I think the other piece I would say is that it's twofold. It's not just the management of formulary, it is also the management of individual patient choice as we see these new products come out. And so from that standpoint, again, the real leverage isn't just gross to net on rebates, it's gross to net on patient cost compared to what the ideal would be, and we hold ourselves to a very high standard on both of those. And we see that as a significant differentiator and a significant opportunity for the next 3 to 5 years."

I gave you one little bit of an example just now when I talked about our prospect deck, and that was one of half a dozen things. We showed that prospect using their own data, but we've invested quietly but significantly in the ability to manage large amounts of data that -- in very complex ways. And so when you look at fraud, waste and abuse and what we've been able to do, not only -- compounds was not one and done. If you take a look that as a daily battle for us to stay ahead of sort of a marketplace that's constantly ""innovating"" as it relates to ways to take our clients' money without creating value. And so we use great amounts of that, that data, and to not only in our own book run fraud, waste and abuse but increasingly for our health plan clients to help them power their programs, power their provider networks, power their payment mechanisms by virtue of being able to have a very complete look at prescribing patterns, at patient outcomes and so forth. Another example around that is opioids. And so we actually, as part of our product suite, is in fact a predictive model as it relates to patients who potentially could become addicted to opioids based on a whole series of factors we're able to take from the data that we would have around those individuals, their prescribers, their conditions and so forth. And again, that's a very significant piece. I've heard Steve Miller say and Glenn Stettin say that the epidemic that occurred in Indiana, we would've actually picked it up as it relates to the AIDS coming back because of the used needles. We would've picked that up much, much more quickly in our data than actually the actual experience picked up. So you take that and then if you overlay that with the ability to manage patients and predict their outcomes at the individual level around adherence, again, we've become very, very good at predicting and intervening ahead of when a patient becomes not adherent based on factors that we're aware of. And so all of that is just certain examples of how we're able to use this. I think the last piece is, as we look forward, things like prior authorizations and how we can work with physicians to make those more streamlined, make them more intuitive, if we have something in the patient's history, even if they weren't our patient at the time, that we're able to get and understand, those are things that we are able to do as well."

We have to start with the clients' benefit design and the patients, therefore, and what they have access to. But where we've been investing and continue to invest is -- you may have heard me say this in the past. Back a couple of years ago, I guess it was 1.5 years ago, when we began to search for someone to drive our mail franchise forward, we ultimately concluded that it wasn't about driving mail franchise, it was about driving member experience in an environment that's increasingly omni-channel. And once you define that as your challenge, and you define the clinical advantages of mail for the patients for whom that's right and you look at the acute care that you can deliver through a strong retail network, you look at the other things you can do to build the star ratings, the health plans and other things, that then informs a strategy that cuts across our entire organization. And so while it manifests itself, yes, in our digital app, which, if you follow it, has evolved several iterations in the last year and is now a 4-plus-star app on the App Store -- it was 2 when we started -- in terms of how the website presents opportunities for patients, which has doubled our daily retail to mail conversions and continues to for those patients where that's a benefit and where the plans save money. But it also then moves all the way across the platform to our patient care advocates who have better tools, more intuitive information put right in front of them, by virtue of those same algorithms that are driving our digital strategy for the member-facing piece. And so end-to-end, when you look at sort of what we're doing at member engagement, it really fuels the first -- I think the first inning still of the game, where we believe we can be transformative in helping members or their caregivers make the best decisions."

I don't think it's really a distraction, though, because it's what we deliver; it's what we do. But if you go to the other side of that, I've been CEO here for quite some time, CFO before that. I've been in this business for a long time. I was in other businesses before this one. What you don't typically see is public airing of a situation. And I think that's what really strikes most CEOs. I still have a lot of conversations with CEOs. Tim has taken over those relationships. He's building on. Tim and I have been out to a lot of clients over the last several months. And when you do that, obviously, when you're sit with another CEO that often has disputes with their partners and vendors, it never gets to this level. And so I think there is an inquisitive mind at the other end of the table that says, what's going on. And unfortunately, for us, we scratch our heads with that because we would've liked to have all this done in the backroom and figured out how to solve these things and how to go forward and -- on a mutually agreeable basis. But unfortunately, it didn't come out that way. So at the CEO level, those conversations are -- do take place but not from a -- hurts the business or puts us at risk or hurts our ability to sell, but instead, it's really just a little bit of head-scratching going on in the conversation."

We -- and we said this, I know, are very actively and we'll continue to be very active in looking at all of sorts of things. As you can appreciate given our size and where we sit in the marketplace, we have an awful lot of stuff that we get to take a look at. But let me be clear, anything that we think can help our clients or help our patients can drive better outcomes, can expand or extend our model or otherwise be complementary, we're interested in, if it adds shareholder value, if it makes sense from both a financial standpoint and a strategic standpoint. It also has to compete against what can we do without the asset. And so when -- we've looked at any number of things. I'm going to go any specific examples. I'm familiar with, obviously, some of what has traded and some what will, and I understand why those who bought it, bought it. But let me be clear, we will be aggressive where we can draw a line to those 3 things: shareholder value, helping our clients and helping our patients. We will not be aggressive where it doesn't make sense, where we see other ways to achieve a similar result using our capital more efficiently. So the last thing I'd say is I wouldn't want you to think it's either-or. I would not want you to think that because we're buying the stock back. We, therefore, were not strongly and deeply looking at any number of opportunities that are in the marketplace.

What I'd say is, our book of business -- and I looked at this over about a 5, 6 years ago, the Express Scripts book of business, in particular, has a nice middle market element to it. There is a more natural churn there with brokers and so forth and so some of that -- when you look at the churn, it's not any one reason. You've got a couple of different market segments. Typically, the other thing that happens is if we drop the ball on service, it goes into play. And now we really have to chase our tail, and thankfully, we're strong on service right now. We saw 2, 3 years ago where it looks like when, in fact, we're trying to catch up on service. And so what I'd tell you is there's no one thing that drives it. 95% to 98% is something we feel good about. We target the high end of that range, as you can appreciate.

At Express Scripts, we are not distracted. Indeed, our focus has never been sharper. And that focus is being rewarded. Demand for our services continues to be high our unique model is resonating, and we are competing well. This is leading to a strong client retention year for 2017. 
On the call today, we'll briefly discuss why we are positioned for growth; how we will deliver value to clients, patients and shareholders; important differentiator differentiators of our approach to specialty, our client's number one pain point; and our unique attributes that fuel our momentum. Then I will turn it over to Eric, who will discuss our solid financial performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.
Having a singular focus in a steadfast alignment with clients differentiates us. Plans sponsors today face a harsh environment filled with threats but also with promise. We have an unprecedented level of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. There are more drugs in the pipeline now than ever before and a majority for specialty products treating chronic and complex conditions. Without our leadership, in collaboration with our clients, this rich pipeline of high-cost therapies has a potential to profoundly impact health care costs. There had never been so many drugs coming out of the pipeline that are high-priced. Prices once only seen for orphan conditions are now seen conditions that affects millions of people, in diseases such as cancer, high cholesterol and hepatitis C. We are relentlessly focused on the patient on delivering the right drug at the right cost and creating a more rational net pricing environment. Central to this in the long-term will be competition from biosimilars, however, legal and regulatory challenges are impeding progress. We are working everyday with regulators and biotech manufacturers to help them realize there is a market for these products. We have the assets that will ensure patients get the appropriate therapy and remain adherent. 
In addition to costs and complex regulation, payers are facing a population that is growing older, demanding more health care and say in how that care is delivered. We are uniquely tackle these challenges, and increasingly plan sponsors are turning to us. We control client costs, improve patient care and health plan sponsors maintain their pharmacy benefit, and do this through our innovative solutions, a single digital platform that integrates medical and pharmacy data and specialized care delivered by compassionate people with deep expertise.
Now let me turn to how we deliver value through our independent focus model and our ability to practice pharmacy Being independent is being fully aligned with our clients' best interest. Alignment has never been more important than it is now. Our independent PBM model puts our patients and clients first, and we tirelessly focus on lowering health care costs while delivering healthier outcome. We are not encumbered by any specific drug delivery channel. We are not beholden to any specific pharmaceutical partner. We are not part of a bigger business. At Express Scripts, our focus is simply on our pharmacy benefit management. That allows us to align fully and flexibly with the client. Do what's best for patients as we redefine the member experience and work across the supply chain to drive out ways and create real value. 
Next week, we will unveil our 2017 National Preferred Formulary. By aligning with our clients, we have been able to change the dynamic in pharma-payer relations, costs while sustaining access to drugs. Our approach to save clients billions of dollars while delivering superior clinical outcomes. When you look at our 2015 drug trend report, I would point out that clients who tightly manage the benefit at a trend of 3.3%. In fact, that represents nearly 57% of those client. Plan sponsors are increasingly using a broad range of cost-effective innovative solutions to manage plan, and there is plenty of room to run across their book of business. We advocate for what matters most to our clients. As I referenced earlier, in the past few weeks, 2 biosimilars were approved by the FDA, yet today, they are not available to patients. We continue to champion for biosimilars and for increased generic utilization. It will create the headroom payers need to afford breakthrough innovation. Capitalizing on biosimilars will take the same kind of bold action we took when high-priced hepatitis C drug threatens to decimate payer budget. We stood with our clients and work with pharma to lower the cost of care and expand access. We drove the treatment costs down by nearly 66% and delivered adherence and cure rates on par with both the clinical trials and the competing product in the marketplace.
Now the key to achieving this outcome in hepatitis C as well as outcomes across therapeutic classes is our Accredo specialty pharmacy. As most of you know, I have very familiar with our specialty business having previously served for 3 years as the CEO of Accredo. I recognize them what is still true today. Specifically, the difference that specialized care to our therapeutic resource centers in patients and how our company will be rewarded for giving this area right to our clients. Specialty spend is expected to soon comprise of 50% of total drug spend by 2018. We continue to enhance the high-tech service model we offer to Accredo while leveraging on the scale and expertise to control costs. No one is better positioned than we are to provide specialized care for patients with complex and chronic diseases. As I mentioned earlier, our specialty model is poised to take biosimilars to market and further accelerate our ability to manage specialty spend and trend. Our success in specialty is based on focused clinical management. Our continued growth is the result of our differentiated innovative offerings in the specialty space, which not only increases PBM client adoption but helps us win direct business from payers, positions and patients. Our safeguard suite of products is designed to better manage specialty spend, establishing a higher standard for patient outcomes. Payers greatly improve the specialty utilization trend and overall spending by taking advantage of our cost management and patient care programs, seeing as much as a 50% reduction in trend compared to those who do not apply our solution. 
In fact, I would point out the 3.3% drug trend for tightly managed clients I mentioned a moment ago is inclusive of specialty trend for those clients. When you put it all together, Express Scripts is driving better retention, delivering strong sales performance and building up on a diverse client portfolio by addressing payer challenges like no one else can. Therefore, we expect another excellent retention year. Because of our singular focus, consistent operational excellence, flexibility and our innovative practice of pharmacy, we expect 2017 retention rate of 96% to 98%, up 1% at the midpoint of the range when compared to the same time last year. Additionally, I am pleased with our selling season. With our new suite of products, including safeguard RX and our ability to beat the complex health care environments, we are well-positioned to drive new sales. We had changed conversations for the better. Our bold actions, specialized care, data insights and innovative solutions have created a deep connection with clients, and our success provides more proof of the value of our independent PBM model, putting patients and clients first truly works. I will now turn the call over to Eric to discuss our solid second quarter financial performance and the full year 2016 guidance."

For the second quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.57, representing growth of 9% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with recent year",544,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.57, representing growth of 9% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with recent years, this quarter includes approximately $107 million of incremental revenue related to a client contract payment. Other key metric highlights for the quarter include: Adjudication of 315.3 million adjusted claims; decreased adjusted SG&A of 1% versus the prior year; EBITDA generated of approximately $1.8 billion; and finally, excluding the impact from the previously mentioned client contract payment, EBITDA per adjusted Rx would be $5.36, up 4% over last year.
Throughout my first year with Express Scripts, we've been focused on expense management and efficient use of capital. This includes our capital structure initiatives and our intentions to maintain an approximate 2x debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio, and an investment grade rating. As discussed in our press release, we executed a bond offering and concurrent tender offer to minimize our near-term debt repayment obligations, linked in our portfolio duration and to lock in attractive longer-term interest rates. Overall, we are very pleased with the outcome of this transaction. 
Let's now turn to our 2016 updated guidance. Let me first touch on the adjusted claims guidance. For the full year, we are maintaining the midpoint of our current claims guidance at approximately 1.275 billion adjusted claims, but narrowing the range. For adjusted SG&A, we are maintaining our guidance range. Cost efficiency is a priority for our leadership team. We continue our efforts to streamline our processes and make changes toward more automation. With our focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty, we expect to see operational cost improvements, a reduction in SG&A year-over-year and an increase in patient satisfaction.
We are maintaining our EBITDA guidance range at a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, which represents growth of 3% to 5% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA. 
As we stated in the first quarter, while the growth expected in the back half of 2016 is similar to previous years, we are expecting a slightly higher ramp up in EBITDA throughout the third and fourth quarters as a result of several factors: First, the Q1 roll-off of business due to acquisitions was a headwind we had to overcome; and second, the growth over prior year and the second half of the year is largely driven by higher utilization of our cost savings program along with generic launches, supply chain initiatives and higher Medicare Part D revenue, driven by the benefit design in reinsurance payments from the government.
We are also narrowing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $6.33 to $6.43, increasing the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.02. This range raises the previously guided midpoint and represents growth of 14% to 16% year-over-year.
With respect to the third quarter 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.72 to $1.76, up 19% to 21% year-over-year. We are pleased with our financial performance year-to-date and continue to do execute on our strategy to lower cost and improve health outcomes while generating shareholder value.
Thank you, and I will be happy to take your questions."

In fact, our goal is even to offset the lost of Coventry next year, which again, as you saw on the release, it's still a little bit of that. But it's too early to declare that. We're having a strong selling year. Things that don't happen to be to want to see out being announced, but we're very pleased with the way that we're selling. And a big piece of the reason that we're winning as well as obviously retaining our existing clients is exactly the point that you make, which is we've got a number of things that we're out in the market with that are giving clients hope in terms of both some cost certainty, holding down their trends, keeping their patients on the products that are the most co- ex products given the value that they crave. And so what I'll do is actually heads up our sales and account management. I'll let Dave speak specifically as it relates to the marketplace and kind of what you see in terms of uptick in the products."

So that's got a lot of good headwinds for us and a lot of help for us, I should say, going forward. The other piece I would say is that management specialty has been critical and use of the TRCs we see a very positive reaction in the marketplace as it relates to our management of the care and also giving patients the right drug that the right time. The last piece I talked about is the programs. We are focused on that. We've seen health plans having a larger uptake recently in night programs.

We've already announced for next year, diabetes and we're the final stages of refining that program and our clients and with some supply chain participants as well as the inflammatory conditions. So we see this as still probably in the third inning of a game that could go into extra innings quite frankly because we don't see the dynamics changing dramatically that create the opportunity for us to uniquely work with the supply chain leveraging our book of business to create those outcomes. So I think there's a lot of whitespace in condition management and bring a number of our tools together differently. So when we talk about male for example, in the old days, in this business because of the generic waves largely, you drove the value of male because Miller so much more effective in converting generics. Today, the question is how do we work not only with male but with retail channel with 90-day channels to drive the overall outcome in this condition management programs that we're launching."

So you have incremental incentive in their and we talk about that at year-end. As a look at this year, particularly this quarter. And if you look at the guidance for the year, the second half, a couple of things. One, we're still very focused on cost management. This company historically has always been, and that is not going to change under Tim and my watch. So very, very focused. The front half of this year, we continue to make investments around some of the things we talked about. Automation and so the other things I'd point out in the second quarter as we had a few onetime items that won't repeat in the third and fourth quarter this year, particularly around a couple of onetime incentive programs. And then also increase legal fees around Anthem litigation. So that will certainly bring down a run rate.

The lagging results of those investments as members experience it and work with us, particularly as we put out our omnichannel 90-day program with clients that are both mail and retail, because we have been able to contract with the supply chain retailers in such a way to estimate that something that works for us in our clients and our patient is that over time, we're going to see it grow.

Would what I'd say Ismail still has an important role play. By the way, there's still some pretty generics coming forward as you know in mail. Obviously, retail it is than a much better job in the last few years than they did back in the day in terms of converting those patients. But mail begins to sort of add to its allure. The fact that people just like getting things by mail. And so with that got a great critical benefit there. We think our therapeutic research centers continued be important differentiators. We continue to see mail achieving outcomes that are differentiated even from a 90-day retail channels. So we are still committed to that. But I think it's one thing in terms of what you're seeing in the market and another in terms of how big is the problem that it's solving in contrast to the overall problem. And it simply put, specialty is an increasing opportunity for us for the work that we need to do, and therefore, relative to mail has become more important."

In terms of pick taken a picture of a script, which you can do going to Dona Rita with us are going to present the paper scrape year but we have to have that physical script are the electronically prescribed script before we mail it.

And by the way, part of the goal as well is patients are happier when they know where the script is than when they don't. So what if that open up the black hole that if you'd order from us 4 years ago, you know that we've got your order, and that's all you need to know until you receive it.

But they find a marketplace for themselves. There are buyers who will choose based on different criteria.  What I can say is the buyers that are choosing criteria around aggressive management, around taking care of their members and try to continue to provide a benefit to help their members through would consumers expense as a relates of the plan design and navigating sort of the changes that are being brought onto those consumers as relate to the plant design. Those buyers which are significant number in the marketplace like our model a lot. Because we really are aligned to them.

And so this notion of condition management program with an umbrella of inflation protection over it is extraordinarily innovative. We don't see anybody else the negative scale than we are. We're thickened of challenges. We started it by launching it in front of 600 clients and Dr. Miller standing up and essentially signing them up to empower us to go out and do something that hadn't  been done before around sort of an indication-based pricing model in oncology. And we built off of that, and it's transformational as it relates to the conversations we've had with pharma, with manufacturers and with our clients. That being said, and so we think we have the assets to get it done in terms of continuing to create that value. But as we look out, we see areas of ways and so forth in areas like compensation. We see that continues to be more we can do in specialty to broadened our footprint. We see health care technology for particularly for payers and assessing risk management risks and potentially for providers is areas that would naturally leverage our DNA.

The way we report to clients, they have a front-row seat for the job that we do in specialty. And I would just point out that the vast majority of patients that are on specialty scripts, need to be on those scripts. The valid a quick question is no there are the lowest cost most appropriate script and that's why we've been very able to move far in the specialty as aggressively as we have, which was not something done industry as recently as 3 years ago. And so it's really not at scale. And so number one, making those formulary decisions and contracting with manufacturers to create and bring for clients real value around that, contracting in such a ways to allow the price to be rational and allow us to do our job. So let me give you an example, pCSK9s. When you take a look at PCSK9s, to your point, is just a retail pharmacy or fulfillment pharmacy, were intended to fill every script we get with PCSK9. That's not the way it works. From that shown our clients and where we sit today is on the first year, all those products have been out. We have basically taken majority of the scripts that came to us. We use that number. And wind up actually speaking with a decision and moving the patient out of the PCSK9 class in terms of their therapy, because of the fact that we manage it label. We manage indication. We got them as fairly sophisticated in terms of the kind of the data that we needed to get, and we manage the. in which owner applies that people put in a program called the Cardiovascular Care Value program, and we basically guaranteed the PMPM cost that they were going to experience for PCSK9s, and then we hit them. We didn't just do it recklessly because patients that should be on those drugs, those are fabulous drugs, are drugs that we want to get and keep those patients on. But again, in the early days, the docs were not writing it in such a way as to target those patients highly effectively. And we've helped train those physicians through those conversations while making sure that the patients that needed them got them. That's probably the best and most recent example I could give you. But I can tell you across the piece that we contract with these companies to create value for our clients, and then we deliver it."

I agree with you though that even in the article, which was really a stew of interesting sort of different -- sort of mostly purposely written things that were being brought together to form a theory that frankly doesn't exist, was very much around this notion that these plans are focused on maintaining to get coverage, using data to get smarter, understanding how to dollars low. As are all things that we do really well. And I can tell you, we've been willing for years to write deals and many, many of our contract for example have rebates of 100% flow-through, completely auditable. The article implies that, that doesn't exist. So again, as the Healthcare Transformation Alliance focuses on their pharmacy pillars, which they have 4 pillars to my understanding.

And if it's together something that was what we wanted. That's our job in the case of HTA and with every other client is to bundle together what they need us to do. Doesn't mean they have to buy everything. It means that we believe that we can configure our model in a way that's good for us and helps the client meet their needs. And if they wanted for example, internalize some small piece of what we do because they like to do it, then we have clients today that do that in the health plan space, for example. What I would say though is a key clients are employers, they've got a lot of things to do. They've got businesses they're trying to grow and focus on. And from our perspective, typically what employers have found is even when they have asked us to respond to bids that had discrete lines of business, almost inevitably, they come back and this article actually spoke to that. They've come back and move back into a more integrated model. But then they understood sort of what the individual cost basis were and got comfortable with the bundle. And I fully believe that you are going to continue to see the market, particularly the employer market continue largely down that path for the foreseeable future. Okay.

At Express Scripts, we are not distracted. Indeed, our focus has never been sharper. And that focus is being rewarded. Demand for our services continues to be high, our unique model is resonating, and we are competing well. This is leading to a strong client retention year for 2017.
On the call today, I'll briefly discuss why we are positioned for growth; how we will deliver value to clients, patients and shareholders; important differentiators of our approach to specialty, our client's #1 pain point; and our unique attributes that fuel our momentum. Then, I will turn it over to Eric, who will discuss our solid financial performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.
Having a singular focus in a steadfast alignment with clients differentiates us. Plans sponsors today face a harsh environment filled with threats but also with promise. We have an unprecedented level of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. There are more drugs in the pipeline now than ever before, and the majority are for specialty products treating chronic and complex condition. Without our leadership, in collaboration with our clients, this rich pipeline of high-cost therapies has a potential to profoundly impact health care costs. There have never been so many drugs coming out of the pipeline that are high priced. Prices once only seen an orphan conditions are now seen for conditions that affects millions of people, in diseases such as cancer, high cholesterol and hepatitis C. We are relentlessly focused on the patient, delivering the right drug at the right cost and creating a more rational net-pricing environment. Central to this in the long-term, we'll be competition from biosimilars. However, legal and regulatory challenges are impeding progress. We are working every day with regulators and biotech manufacturers to help them realize there is a market for these products. We have the assets that will ensure patients get on the appropriate therapy and remain adherent.
In addition to costs and complex regulations, payers are facing a population that is growing older, demanding more health care and wanting a greater say in how that care is delivered. We uniquely tackle these challenges, and increasingly plan sponsors who are turning to us. The controlled client costs, improved patient care and health plan sponsors maintain their pharmacy benefit, and do this through our innovative solutions, a single digital platform that integrates medical and pharmacy data and specialized care, delivered by compassionate people with deep expertise.
Now let me turn to how we deliver value through our independent focus model and our ability to practice pharmacy smarter. Being independent is being fully aligned with our clients' best interest. Alignment has never been more important than it is now. Our independent PBM model puts our patients and clients first. And we tirelessly focus on lowering health care costs, while delivering healthier outcome. We are not encumbered by any specific drug delivery channel. We are not beholden to any specific pharmaceutical partner. We are not part of a bigger business. At Express Scripts, our focus is simply on pharmacy benefit management. That allows us to align fully and flexibly with the clients. Do what's best for patients as we redefine the member experience, and work across the supply chain to drive out ways and create real value.
Next week, we will unveil our 2017 National Preferred Formulary. By aligning with our clients, we have been able to change the dynamic in pharma-payer relations, reining in costs, while sustaining access to drugs. Our approach is to save client's billions of dollars, while delivering superior clinical outcomes. When you look at our 2015 drug trend report, I would point out that clients who tightly manage the benefit at a trend of 3.3%, in fact, that represents nearly 57% of those client. Plan sponsors are increasingly using a broad range of cost-effective innovative solutions to manage plans, and there is plenty of room to run across their book of business. We advocate for what matters most to our clients. As I referenced earlier, in the past few weeks, 2 biosimilars were approved by the FDA, yet today, they are not available to patients. We continue to champion for biosimilars and for increased generic utilization. It will create the headroom payers need to afford breakthrough innovation. Capitalizing on biosimilars will take the same kind of bold action we took when high-priced hepatitis C drugs threatened to decimate payer budget. We stood with our clients and worked with pharma to lower the cost of care and expand access. We drove the treatment costs down by nearly 66% and delivered adherence and cure rates on par with both the clinical trials and the competing product in the marketplace.
Now the key to achieving this outcome in hepatitis C as well as outcomes across therapeutic classes is our Accredo specialty pharmacy. As most of you know, I'm very familiar with our specialty business having previously served for 3 years as the CEO of Accredo. I recognize them what is still true today. Specifically, the difference that specialized care to our therapeutic resource centers can make for patients and how our company will be rewarded for giving this area right for our clients. As specialty spend is expected to soon comprise 50% of total drug spend by 2018, we continue to enhance the high-touch service model we offer to Accredo, while leveraging our scale and expertise to control costs. No one is better positioned than we are to provide specialized care for patients with complex and chronic diseases. As I mentioned earlier, our specialty model is poised to get biosimilars to market and further accelerate our ability to manage specialty spend and trend. Our success in specialty is based on focused clinical management. Our continued growth is the result of our differentiated innovative offerings in the specialty space, which not only increases PBM client adoption but helps us win direct business from payers, positions and patients. Our Safeguard Rx suite of products is designed to better manage specialty spend, establishing a higher standard for patient outcomes. Payers greatly improve their specialty utilization trend and overall spending by taking advantage of our cost management and patient care programs, seeing as much as a 50% reduction in trend compared to those who do not apply our solution.
In fact, I would point out the 3.3% drug trend for tightly managed clients, I mentioned a moment ago, is inclusive of specialty trend for those clients. When you put it all together, Express Scripts is driving better retention, delivering strong sales performance and building up on a diverse client portfolio by addressing payer challenges like no one else can. Therefore, we expect another excellent retention year. Because of our singular focus, consistent operational excellence, flexibility and our innovative practice of pharmacy, we expect 2017 retention rate of 96% to 98%, up 1% at the midpoint of the range when compared to the same time last year. Additionally, I am pleased with our selling season. With our new suite of products, including Safeguard RX, and our ability to meet the demand of today's complex health care environment, we are well positioned to drive new sales. We have changed conversations for the better. Our bold actions, specialized care, data insights and innovative solutions have created a deep connection with clients, and our success provides more proof of the value of our independent PBM model. Putting patients and clients first truly works. I will now turn the call over to Eric to discuss our solid second quarter financial performance and the full year 2016 guidance."

For the second quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.57, representing growth of 9% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with recent year",544,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.57, representing growth of 9% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with recent years, this quarter includes approximately $107 million of incremental revenue related to a client contract payment. Other key metric highlights for the quarter include: adjudication of 315.3 million adjusted claims; decreased adjusted SG&A of 1% versus the prior year; EBITDA generated of approximately $1.8 billion; and finally, excluding the impact from the previously mentioned client contract payment, EBITDA per adjusted Rx would be $5.36, up 4% over last year.
Throughout my first year with Express Scripts, we've been focused on expense management and efficient use of capital. This includes our capital structure initiatives and our intentions to maintain an approximate 2x debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio and an investment grade rating. As discussed in our press release, we executed a bond offering and concurrent tender offer to minimize our near-term debt repayment obligations, linked in our portfolio's duration and to lock in attractive longer-term interest rates. Overall, we are very pleased with the outcome of this transaction.
Let's now turn to our 2016 updated guidance. Let me first touch on the adjusted claims guidance. For the full year, we are maintaining the midpoint of our current claims guidance at approximately 1.275 billion adjusted claims, but narrowing the range. For adjusted SG&A, we are maintaining our guidance range. Cost efficiency is a priority for our leadership team. We continue our efforts to streamline our processes and make changes toward more automation. With our focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty, we expect to see operational cost improvements, a reduction in SG&A year-over-year and an increase in patient satisfaction.
We are maintaining our EBITDA guidance range at a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, which represents growth of 3% to 5% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA.
As we stated in the first quarter, while the growth expected in the back half of 2016 is similar to previous years, we are expecting a slightly higher ramp up in EBITDA throughout the third and fourth quarters as a result of several factors: first, the Q1 roll-off of business due to acquisitions was a headwind we had to overcome; and second, the growth over prior year and the second half of the year is largely driven by higher utilization of our cost savings programs along with generic launches, supply chain initiatives and higher Medicare Part D revenue, driven by the benefit design in reinsurance payments from the government.
We are also narrowing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $6.33 to $6.43, increasing the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.02. This range raises the previously guided midpoint and represents growth of 14% to 16% year-over-year.
With respect to the third quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.72 to $1.76, up 19% to 21% year-over-year. We are pleased with our financial performance year-to-date and continue to execute on our strategy to lower cost and improve health outcomes while generating shareholder value.
Thank you, and now we'll be happy to take your questions."

But you just need to know we're having a strong selling year. Things that were winning don't happen to be the ones that you see out being announced, but we are very pleased with the way that we're selling. And a big piece of the reason that we're winning as well as obviously retaining our existing clients is exactly the point that you make, which is that we've got a number of things that we're out in the market with, that are giving clients hope in terms of both some cost certainty, holding down their trends, keeping their patients on the products that are the most co-ex [ph] products, given the value they create.

So that's got a lot of good headwinds for us and a lot of help for us, I should say, going forward. The other piece I would say is that management in specialty has been critical and use of the TRCs we see a very positive reaction in the marketplace, as it relates to our management of the care and also giving patients the right drug at the right time. The last piece I talk about is the 90-day programs. We are focused on that. We've seen health plans have a larger uptake recently in 90-day programs. Whether that be at the retail, or more importantly, the home delivery. And so we've been really pleased with that, too. And..."

We've already announced for next year diabetes, and we're in the final stages of refining that exact program with our clients and with some supply chain participants as well as the inflammatory conditions. So we see this as still probably in the third inning of a game that could go into extra innings quite frankly because we don't see the dynamics changing dramatically that create the opportunity for us to uniquely work with the supply chain leveraging our book of business to create those outcomes. So I think there's a lot of whitespace in condition management that bring a number of our tools together differently. So when you talk about mail, for example, in the old days, in this business because of the generic wave largely, you drove the value of mail because mail was so much more effective at converting generics. Today, the question is how do we work not only with mail but with the retail channel with 90-day channel to drive the overall outcome in these condition management programs that we're launching."

One of the things that -- just to comment on last year, just as a reminder, in the second half of the year, a large part of that third quarter and fourth quarter was driven by incentive programs and [indiscernible] our targets around performance of the business. So you have incremental incentive in there, and we talked about that at year-end. As you look at this year, particularly this quarter and if you look at the guidance for the year, the second half, a couple of things: one, we're still very focused on cost management. This company historically has always been, and that is not going to change under Tim and my watch, so very, very focused. The front half of this year, we've continued to make investments around some of the things we talked about, automation. And so the other thing I'd point out in the second quarter is we had a few onetime items that won't repeat in the third and fourth quarter of this year, particularly around a couple of onetime incentive programs, and then also increase legal fees around Anthem litigation. So that will certainly bring down the run rate. And then we're going to continue to manage across the board, our programs into the third and fourth quarter doing the things that we previously talked about."

That is the sort of leading result of those investments. The lagging results of those investments as members experience it and work with us, particularly as we put out our omnichannel 90-day programs with clients that are both mail and retail, because we've been able to contract with the supply chain retailers in such a way as to make that something that works for us and our clients and our patient is that, over time, we're going to see it grow. In the quarter, what you would have seen -- or frankly, this year, what you would see is the roll-off Coventry was largely the commercial book of business which did have mail penetration, and that's largely the driver that was actually creating what you saw in the numbers that you put out there. So we're very confident in the long term. We're not -- it's not -- I remember the old days when we used to say that a generic in mail was 3x as profitable as anything else, at least in the company I was working for at that time. I can tell you now that dynamic has leveled out to a far greater deal. We have a much more balanced approach to how we actually are paid in alignment with our clients to do our job.

As you know, more and more prescriptions comes with prior authorizations today because that's how both the Medicare plans are managing and the commercial plans are also managing on top of more narrow formulary management. And so it depends is the answer, where we're able to get the script electronically, do an e-prior authorization and so forth. The patient can expect that script in probably 3 to 4 days. And by the way, part of the goal as well is patients are happier when they know where the script is than when they don't. And so one of the things we have done is opened up the black hole, that if you'd order from us 4 years ago, you know that we've got your order, and that's all you know until you receive it. And now we become much more communicative with our members in whatever channel they want us to communicate to actually keep them informed of that.

Yet, if I'm honest with you because all our energy has been spent on servicing Anthem's members and positioning ourselves to be their best choice when they reach the point of meeting to make a choice in pharmacy. Obviously, the question was would they or wouldn't they be integrating another pharmacy into their own, or into us, or into something else, and that's still all to be played out. So the short answer is, I wouldn't bet a large amount of the pie on that.

I've read several reports that also spoke to the fact that the market is looking for a competitive PBM offering that delivers value. In this business, one of the constants, over my 18 years, has been that the independent model has been very successful. I mean, obviously, I was part of one that wasn't. And when we became independent, it unleashed us to be able to do our job really, really well. And I think it just makes our conversation very, very straightforward and more importantly, all the assets to the company that come to the table in the form of our account rep or a sales rep are aligned around this one thing, and it really just drives a very, very deep singular conversation. Our clients see sort of when we're in Washington, D.C. or the state level advocating things, we're only advocating things that are in their interest in pharmacy. We're not advocating anything else. We aren't talking about anything else. And so that -- but all we have to make sure is feel good. Our job is to make it come to the table, in terms of retention and new business wins. Now the other thing I'd say is there's always been folks that like certain models. There are certain PBMs that are small, that you're looking, I think, on a pure-scale basis, they shouldn't win a single case, but they find a marketplace for themselves. There are buyers who will choose based on different criteria. What I can say is the buyers that are choosing on criteria around aggressive management, around taking care of their members and trying to continue to provide the benefit to help their members through a consumer sort of experience as it relates to the plan design and navigating sort of the choices that are being thrust onto those ""consumers"" as it relate to the plan design. Those sort of buyers, which are significant number in the marketplace, like our model a lot. Because we really are aligned to them. There's no question that we are creating competition in parts of the supply chain, including the retail and pharma. And so from our perspective, it's just -- it's a great unencumbered model."

We have a very good dialogue with the HTAs directly, as well as importantly, our clients that are in there. They've been out there for a while as you know. I mean, again, it's one of those things where if you go back to 2005, there was the transparency coalition that got started, that we adapted our model to that, and it's been extraordinarily successful for us and for that coalition and those clients that wanted that sort of a model. That's, again, from our perspective, the ability to be flexible, the ability to create value for clients. I think as I told a client around that. If all of the clients we have in HTA are willing to do certain things together, that only gives us more ability to create value for them whether that's around indication or outcomes-based pricing, whether that's around a different rebate model or anything else. This business is always adapted. And we see things like the HTA to the extent that it gains 2 traction in working with those clients. And of course, they have a number of things they are going after. But we love the fact they want to be data-driven. We love the fact that they want to really drive outcomes that are good for their clients and keep their clients in business. I think the big story that didn't sort of come out of that is those clients want to stay in the business providing benefits. That's right down our strike zone."

First of all, I think one of the things that we started even before George left, but on my watch, with the teams that is so terrific at my table, is this notion of really rethinking how we engage with the supply chain to create value and leverage our clinical focus. And so this notion of condition management programs, with an umbrella of inflation protection over it, is extraordinarily innovative. We don't see anybody else doing it at a scale the way we are taking on those challenges. We started it by launching it in front of 600 clients and Dr. Miller standing up and essentially signing them up to empower us to go out and do something that hadn't been done before around sort of an indication-based pricing model in oncology. And we built off of that, and it's transformational as it relates to the conversations we've have with pharma, with manufacturers and with our clients. That being said -- and so we like and think we have the assets to get it done in terms of continuing to create that value. But as we look out, we see areas of ways and so forth in areas like workers' compensation. We see that there continues to be more we can do in specialty to broadened our footprint. We see health care information technology particularly for payers in assessing risk and managing risk and potentially for providers is areas that would naturally leverage our DNA.

The way we report to clients, they have a front-row seat for the job that we do in specialty. And I would just point out that the vast majority of patients, in fact, that are on specialty scripts, need to be on those scripts. So there's value that is created. The question is though they are on the lowest cost for most appropriate script and that's why we've been able to move formulary in the specialty as aggressively as we have, which was not something that was being done largely in the industry as recently as 3 years ago. And so it's certainly not at scale. And so number one, making those formulary decisions and contracting with manufacturers to create and bring to our clients real value around that, contracting in such a ways to allow the price to be rational and allow us to do our job. So let me give you an example, PCSK9s. When you take a look at PCSK9s, to your point, as just a retail pharmacy or a fulfillment pharmacy, we're incentive to fill every script we get in PCSK9. That's not the way it works. And what we've shown our clients and where we sit today is the first year, while those products have been out, we have basically taken the majority of the scripts that came to us, let me use that number. And while we ended up actually speaking with the physician and moving the patient out of the PCSK9 class in terms of their therapy, because of the fact that we managed it to the label, we managed to the indication, we got the tests that were fairly sophisticated, in terms of the kind of data that we needed to get, and we managed it. And we shown our clients that. We put it in a program called the Cardiovascular Care Value Program, and we basically guaranteed the PMPM cost that they were going to experience for PCSK9s, and then we hit them. We didn't just do it recklessly because patients that should be on those drugs, those are fabulous drugs, are drugs that we want to get and keep those patients on. But again, in the early days, the docs really were not writing it in such a way as to target those patients highly effectively. And we've helped train those physicians through those conversations while making sure that the patients that needed them got them. That's probably the best and most recent example I can give you. But I can tell you across the piece that we contract with these companies to create value for our clients, and then we deliver it."

I agree with you though that even in the article, which was really a stew of interesting sort of different -- sort of mostly purposely written things that were being brought together to form a theory that frankly doesn't exist, was very much around this notion that these plans are focused on maintaining to get coverage, using data to get smarter, understanding how the dollars flow. Those are all things that we do really well. I mean, I can tell you, we've been willing for years to write deals in many, many of ours contract, for example, have rebates of 100% flow-through, completely auditable. The article implies that, that doesn't exist. So again, as the Healthcare Transformation Alliance focuses on their pharmacy pillars, which they have 4 pillars based on my understanding, we look forward to working with them because it would appear what they want to do is work with the marketplace to drive additional innovation and that's our DNA. And so I actually think we can find some very interesting ways to help them achieve their goals."

I just bought [indiscernible] like a car. They bundle the bunch of stuff together and it was a lot cheaper than me going through the pick-list. And it put together something that was what we wanted. That's our job in the case of HTA and with every other client is to bundle together what they need us to do. Doesn't mean they have to buy everything. It means that we believe that we can configure our model in a way that's good for us and helps the client meet their needs. And if they wanted, for example, internalize some small piece of what we do because they like to do it, then we have clients today that do that in the health plan space, for example. What I would say though is most of the -- while the HTA's clients are employers, they've got a lot of things to do. They've got businesses they're trying to grow and focus on. And from our perspective, typically, what employers have found is even when they have asked us to respond to bids that had discrete lines of business, almost inevitably, they've come back, and this article actually spoke to that. They've come back and moved back into a more integrated model. But then they understood sort of what the individual cost pieces were and got comfortable with the bundle. And I fully believe that you are going to continue to see the market, particularly the employer market continue largely down that path for the foreseeable future.
Okay. I think with that last question, I want to thank everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate you calling in. Look forward to talking to you next quarter, as we share our results in the marketplace and in running our business. Thank you."

At Express Scripts, we are not distracted. Indeed, our focus has never been sharper. And that focus is being rewarded. Demand for our services continues to be high, our unique model is resonating, and we are competing well. This is leading to a strong client retention year for 2017.
On the call today, I will briefly discuss why we are positioned for growth; how we will deliver value to clients, patients and shareholders; important differentiators of our approach to specialty, our client's #1 pain point; and our unique attributes that fuel our momentum. Then, I will turn it over to Eric, who will discuss our solid financial performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.
Having a singular focus in a steadfast alignment with clients differentiates us. Plan sponsors today face a harsh environment filled with threats but also with promise. We have an unprecedented level of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. There are more drugs in the pipeline now than ever before, and the majority are for specialty products treating chronic and complex conditions. Without our leadership, in collaboration with our clients, this rich pipeline of high-cost therapies has a potential to profoundly impact health care costs. There have never been so many drugs coming out of the pipeline that are high priced. Prices once only seen in orphan conditions are now seen for conditions that affect millions of people, in diseases such as cancer, high cholesterol and hepatitis C. We are relentlessly focused on the patient, delivering the right drug at the right cost and creating a more rational net-pricing environment. Central to this in the long-term, will be competition from biosimilars. However, legal and regulatory challenges are impeding progress. We are working every day with regulators and biotech manufacturers to help them realize there is a market for these products. We have the assets that will ensure patients get on the appropriate therapy and remain adherent.
In addition to costs and complex regulations, payers are facing a population that is growing older, demanding more health care and wanting a greater say in how that care is delivered. We uniquely tackle these challenges, and increasingly plan sponsors are turning to us. The controlled client costs, improved patient care and health plan sponsors maintain their pharmacy benefit, and do this through our innovative solutions, a single digital platform that integrates medical and pharmacy data and specialized care delivered by compassionate people with deep expertise.
Now let me turn to how we deliver value through our independent focus model and our ability to practice pharmacy smarter. Being independent means being fully aligned with our clients' best interests. Alignment has never been more important than it is now. Our independent PBM model puts our patients and clients first. And we tirelessly focus on lowering health care costs, while delivering healthier outcomes. We are not encumbered by any specific drug delivery channel. We are not beholden to any specific pharmaceutical partner. We are not part of a bigger business. At Express Scripts, our focus is simply on pharmacy benefit management. That allows us to align fully and flexibly with the clients. Do what's best for patients as we redefine the member experience, and work across the supply chain to drive out waste and create real value.
Next week, we will unveil our 2017 National Preferred Formulary. By aligning with our clients, we have been able to change the dynamic in pharma-payer relations, reining in costs, while sustaining access to drugs. Our approaches save clients billions of dollars, while delivering superior clinical outcomes. When you look at our 2015 drug trend report, I would point out that clients who tightly manage the benefit at a trend of 3.3%, in fact, that represents nearly 57% of those clients. Plan sponsors are increasingly using a broad range of cost-effective, innovative solutions to manage plans, and there is plenty of room to run across our book of business. We advocate for what matters most to our clients. As I referenced earlier, in the past few weeks, 2 biosimilars were approved by the FDA, yet today they are not available to patients. We continue to champion for biosimilars and for increased generic utilization. It will create the headroom payers need to afford breakthrough innovation. Capitalizing on biosimilars will take the same kind of bold action we took when high-priced hepatitis C drugs threatened to decimate payer budgets. We stood with our clients and worked with pharma to lower the cost of care and expand access. We drove the treatment costs down by nearly 66% and delivered adherence and cure rates on par with both the clinical trials and the competing product in the marketplace.
Now the key to achieving this outcome in hepatitis C as well as outcomes across therapeutic classes is our Accredo specialty pharmacy. As most of you know, I'm very familiar with our specialty business having previously served for 3 years as the CEO of Accredo. I recognize then what is still true today. Specifically, the difference that specialized care through our therapeutic resource centers can make for patients and how our company will be rewarded for getting this area right for our clients. As specialty spend is expected to soon comprise 50% of total drug spend by 2018, we continue to enhance the high-touch service model we offer through Accredo, while leveraging our scale and expertise to control costs. No one is better positioned than we are to provide specialized care for patients with complex and chronic diseases. As I mentioned earlier, our specialty model is poised to get biosimilars to market and further accelerate our ability to manage specialty spend and trend. Our success in specialty is based on focused clinical management. Our continued growth is the result of our differentiated innovative offerings in the specialty space, which not only increases PBM client adoption but helps us win direct business from payers, physicians and patients. Our Safeguard Rx suite of products is designed to better manage specialty spend, establishing a higher standard for patient outcomes. Payers greatly improve their specialty utilization trend and overall spending by taking advantage of our cost management and patient care programs, seeing as much as a 50% reduction in trend compared to those who do not apply our solution.
In fact, I would point out the 3.3% drug trend for tightly managed clients, I mentioned a moment ago, is inclusive of specialty trend for those clients. When you put it all together, Express Scripts is driving better retention, delivering strong sales performance and building upon a diverse client portfolio by addressing payer challenges like no one else can. Therefore, we expect another excellent retention year. Because of our singular focus, consistent operational excellence, flexibility and our innovative practice of pharmacy, we expect 2017 retention rate of 96% to 98%, up 1% at the midpoint of the range when compared to the same time last year. Additionally, I am pleased with our selling season. With our new suite of products, including Safeguard RX, and our ability to meet the demands of today's complex health care environment, we are well positioned to drive new sales. We have changed conversations for the better. Our bold actions, specialized care, data insights and innovative solutions have created a deep connection with clients, and our success provides more proof of the value of our independent PBM model. Putting patients and clients first truly works. I will now turn the call over to Eric to discuss our solid second quarter financial performance and the full year 2016 guidance."
317975,373819575,1012575,"Express Scripts Holding Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Evernorth Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.57, representing growth of 9% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with recent year",543,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.57, representing growth of 9% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with recent years, this quarter includes approximately $107 million of incremental revenue related to a client contract payment. Other key metric highlights for the quarter include: adjudication of 315.3 million adjusted claims; decreased adjusted SG&A of 1% versus the prior year; EBITDA generated of approximately $1.8 billion; and finally, excluding the impact from the previously mentioned client contract payment, EBITDA per adjusted Rx would be $5.36, up 4% over last year.
Throughout my first year with Express Scripts, we've been focused on expense management and efficient use of capital. This includes our capital structure initiatives and our intentions to maintain an approximate 2x debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio and an investment grade rating. As discussed in our press release, we executed a bond offering and concurrent tender offer to minimize our near-term debt repayment obligations, lengthen our portfolio's duration and to lock in attractive longer-term interest rates. Overall, we are very pleased with the outcome of this transaction.
Let's now turn to our 2016 updated guidance. Let me first touch on the adjusted claims guidance. For the full year, we are maintaining the midpoint of our current claims guidance at approximately 1.275 billion adjusted claims, but narrowing the range. For adjusted SG&A, we are maintaining our guidance range. Cost efficiency is a priority for our leadership team. We continue our efforts to streamline our processes and make changes toward more automation. With our focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty, we expect to see operational cost improvements, a reduction in SG&A year-over-year and an increase in patient satisfaction.
We are maintaining our EBITDA guidance range at a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, which represents growth of 3% to 5% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA.
As we stated in the first quarter, while the growth expected in the back half of 2016 is similar to previous years, we are expecting a slightly higher ramp up in EBITDA throughout the third and fourth quarters as a result of several factors: first, the Q1 roll-off of business due to acquisitions was a headwind we had to overcome; and second, the growth over prior year in the second half of the year is largely driven by higher utilization of our cost savings programs along with generic launches, supply chain initiatives and higher Medicare Part D revenue, driven by the benefit design in reinsurance payments from the government.
We are also narrowing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $6.33 to $6.43, increasing the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.02. This range raises the previously guided midpoint and represents growth of 14% to 16% year-over-year.
With respect to the third quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.72 to $1.76, up 19% to 21% year-over-year. We are pleased with our financial performance year-to-date and continue to execute on our strategy to lower cost and improve health outcomes while generating shareholder value.
Thank you, and now we'll be happy to take your questions."

But you just need to know we're having a strong selling year. Things that were winning don't happen to be the ones that you see out being announced, but we're very pleased with the way that we're selling. And a big piece of the reason that we're winning as well as obviously retaining our existing clients is exactly the point that you make, which is that we've got a number of things that we're out in the market with, that are giving clients hope in terms of both some cost certainty, holding down their trends, keeping their patients on the products that are the most co-ex [ph] products, given the value they create.

So that's got a lot of good headwinds for us or a lot of help for us, I should say, going forward. The other piece I would say is that management in specialty has been critical and use of the TRCs, we see a very positive reaction in the marketplace as it relates to our management of the care and also giving patients the right drug at the right time. The last piece I talk about is the 90-day programs. We are focused on that. We've seen health plans have a larger uptake recently in 90-day programs. Whether that be at the retail, or more importantly, the home delivery. And so we've been really pleased with that, too. And..."

We've already announced for next year, diabetes, and we're in the final stages of refining that exact program with our clients and with some supply chain participants, as well as the inflammatory conditions. So we see this as still probably in the third inning of a game that could go into extra innings quite frankly because we don't see the dynamics changing dramatically that create the opportunity for us to uniquely work with the supply chain leveraging our book of business to create those outcomes. So I think there's a lot of whitespace in condition management that bring a number of our tools together differently. So when you talk about mail, for example, in the old days, in this business because of the generic wave largely, you drove the value of mail because mail was so much more effective at converting generics. Today, the question is how do we work not only with mail but with the retail channel with 90-day channels to drive the overall outcome in these condition management programs that we're launching."

One of the things that -- just to comment on last year, just as a reminder, in the second half of the year, a large part of that third quarter and fourth quarter was driven by incentive programs and in seeding our targets around performance of the business. So you have incremental incentive in there, and we talked about that at year-end. As you look at this year, particularly this quarter and if you look at the guidance for the year, the second half, a couple of things: one, we're still very focused on cost management. This company historically has always been, and that is not going to change under Tim and my watch, so very, very focused. The front half of this year, we've continued to make investments around some of the things we've talked about, automation. And so the other thing I'd point out in the second quarter is we had a few onetime items that won't repeat in the third and fourth quarter of this year, particularly around a couple of onetime incentive programs, and then also increase legal fees around Anthem litigation. So that will certainly bring down the run rate. And then we're going to continue to manage across the board, our programs into the third and fourth quarter doing the things that we previously talked about."

And so when we go and we have these conversations, we recognize the timing may not be until 2018 or '19 or even beyond, but I'm reminded of when I joined this business in 1998, that we're looking at the front end of the generic wave, and we were at 40-some percent generic dispensing rates, and we're at 90% now.

It's how we drive down costs. And what you would see if you're inside the company is a couple of things: one, you'd see significantly increasing net promoter scores on the part of members who work with us; two, you would see that, that's the big piece of how we're driving down costs and waste from taking out phone calls that members frankly don't want to make to us, because they want to self-serve, and we're seeing that. That is the sort of leading result of those investments. The lagging results of those investments as members experience it and work with us, particularly as we put out our omnichannel 90-day programs with clients that are both mail and retail, because we've been able to contract with the supply chain as retailers in such a way as to make that something that works for us and our clients and our patients, is that over time we're going to see it grow. In the quarter, what you would have seen -- or frankly, this year, what you would see is the role of Coventry was largely their commercial book of business which did have mail penetration, and that's largely the driver that was actually creating what you saw in the numbers that you put out there. So we're very confident in the long term. We're not -- it's not -- I remember the old days when we used to say that a generic at mail was 3x as profitable as anything else, at least in the company I was working for at that time. I can tell you now that dynamic has leveled out to a far greater deal. We have a much more balanced approach to how we actually are paid in alignment with our clients to do our job.

But what I'd say is mail still has an important role to play. By the way, there's still some pretty terrific generics coming forward, as you know, in mail. Obviously, retail has done a much better job in the last few years than they did back in the day, in terms of converting those patients. But mail begins to sort of add to its allure, the fact that people just like getting things by mail. And so we've got a great clinical benefit there. We think our therapeutic research center has continued be important differentiators. We continue to see mail achieving outcomes that are differentiated even from 90-day retail channels, and so we are still committed to that.

We look at a net promoter score and break down what are the key drivers in net promoter score. And so that's a piece where we've lopped off over half a day, and we continue to lop off time for that first script coming from mail. We're also absolutely trying to make it easier to do. Obviously, we're in a highly regulated business, both at the state level and the federal level. So there are certain things that you might be able to do in other businesses that we have to figure out that are not as easy. In terms of -- for example, taking a picture of a script, which you can do certainly if you're then going to go into retail because you're going to present the paper script. But we have to have the physical script or the electronically prescribed script before we mail it. So e-prescribing, very important part of our strategy, we continue to see that grow. Digitally, we are using -- we're starting to use now digital welcome kits, which means at the time that a member enrolls with us, and we already have their data, we can actually present opportunities to them through that enrollment process and our welcome kit that used to be a paper thing that everyone threw out. And so while it's early days, and we're going to wind up reversioning that, doing what you would expect us to do in terms of sort of digital A-B testing and seeing the things that work best to help members navigate to mail, we see in the long run that, that's sort of a channel strategy with members on -- at least present the opportunity to them in an easy-to-use way so that those that want to use it will access it."

As you know, more and more prescriptions comes with prior authorizations today because that's how both the Medicare plans are managing and the commercial plans are also managing on top of more narrow formulary management.

And by the way, part of the goal as well is patients are happier when they know where the script is than when they don't. And so one of the things we've done is opened up the black hole, that if you'd ordered from us 4 years ago, you know that we've got your order, and that's all you'd know until you receive it.

I mean, it's showing up in our retention, obviously. It's showing up for us in our sales. I've read several reports that also spoke to the fact that the market is looking for a competitive PBM offering that delivers value. In this business, one of the constants, over my 18 years, has been that the independent model has been very successful. I mean, obviously, I was part of one that wasn't. And when we became independent, it unleashed us to be able to do our job really, really well. And I think it just makes our conversation very, very straightforward and more importantly, all the assets in the company that come to the table in the form of our account rep or a sales rep are aligned around this one thing, and it really just drives a very, very deep singular conversation. Our clients see sort of when we're in Washington, D.C. or at the state level advocating things, we're only advocating things that are in their interest in pharmacy. We aren't advocating anything else. We aren't talking about anything else. And so that -- but all that makes us feel good. Our job is to make it come to the table, in terms of retention and new business wins. Now the other thing I'd say is there's always been folks that like certain models. There are certain PBMs that are small, that you're looking and think, on a pure-scale basis, they shouldn't win a single case, but they find a marketplace for themselves. There are buyers who will choose based on different criteria. What I can say is the buyers that are choosing on criteria around aggressive management, around taking care of their members and trying to continue to provide the benefit to help their members through a consumer sort of experience as it relates to the plan design and navigating sort of the choices that are being thrust onto those ""consumers"" as it relate to the plan design. Those sort of buyers, which are significant number in the marketplace, like our model a lot. Because we really are aligned to them. There's no question that we are creating competition in parts of the supply chain, including the retail and pharma. And so from our perspective, it's just -- it's a great unencumbered model."

We have a very good dialogue with the HTAs directly, as well as importantly, our clients that are in there. They've been out there for a while as you know. I mean, again, it's one of those things where if you go back to 2005, there was the transparency coalition that got started. We adapted our model to that, and it's been extraordinarily successful for us and for that coalition and those clients that wanted that sort of a model. That's, again, from our perspective, the ability to be flexible, the ability to create value for clients. I think as I told a client around that, if all of the clients we have in HTA are willing to do certain things together, that only gives us more ability to create value for them whether that's around indication or outcomes-based pricing, whether that's around a different rebate model or anything else. This business has always adapted. And we see things like the HTA to the extent that it gains through traction in working with those clients. And of course, they have a number of things they are going after. But we love the fact they want to be data-driven. We love the fact that they want to really drive outcomes that are good for their clients and keep their clients in business. I think the big story that didn't sort of come out of that is those clients want to stay in the business providing benefits. That's right down our strike zone."

First of all, I think one of the things that we started even before George left, but on my watch, with the teams that is so terrific at my table, is this notion of really rethinking how we engage with the supply chain to create value and leverage our clinical focus. And so this notion of condition management programs, with an umbrella of inflation protection over it, is extraordinarily innovative. We don't see anybody else doing it at a scale the way we are on taking on those challenges. We started it by launching it in front of 600 clients and Dr. Miller standing up and essentially signing them up to empower us to go out and do something that hadn't been done before around sort of an indication-based pricing model in oncology. And we've built off that, and it is transformational as it relates to the conversations we have with pharma, with manufacturers and with our clients. That being said -- and so we like and think we have the assets to get it done in terms of continuing to create that value. But as we look out, we see areas of waste and so forth in areas like workers' compensation. We see that there continues to be more we can do in specialty to broaden our footprint. We see health care information technology particularly for payers in assessing risk and managing risk and potentially for providers is areas that would naturally leverage our DNA. And so those are areas that we are now looking at. And what I would tell you is we are much more engaged than we were while we were integrating, as it relates to looking at opportunities outside of our 4 walls to bring additional solutions to our clients in those areas."

The way we report to clients, they have a front-row seat for the job that we do in specialty. And I would just point out that the vast majority of patients, in fact, that are on specialty scripts, need to be on those scripts. There's value that is created. The question is, though, they're on the lowest cost for a most appropriate script and that's why we've been able to move formulary in the specialty as aggressively as we have, which was not something that was being done largely in the industry as recently as 3 years ago. And so it's certainly not at scale. And so number one, making those formulary decisions and contracting with manufacturers to create and bring to our clients real value around that, contracting in such a way as to allow the price to be rational and allow us to do our job. So let me give you an example, PCSK9s. When you take a look at PCSK9s, to your point, as just a retail pharmacy or a fulfillment pharmacy, we're incented to fill every script we get in PCSK9s. That's not the way it works. And what we've shown our clients and where we sit today is in the first year, while those products have been out, we have basically taken the majority of the scripts that came to us, let me use that number. And wound up actually speaking with the physician and moving the patient out of the PCSK9 class in terms of their therapy, because of the fact that we managed it to the label, we managed to the indication, we got the tests that were fairly sophisticated, in terms of the kind of data that we needed to get, and we managed it. And we shown our clients that. We put it in a program called the Cardiovascular Care Value Program, and we basically guaranteed the PMPM cost that they were going to experience for PCSK9s, and then we hit them. We didn't just do that recklessly because patients that should be on those drugs, those are fabulous drugs, are drugs that we want to get and keep those patients on. But again, in the early days, the docs really were not writing it in such a way as to target those patients highly effectively. And we've helped train those physicians through those conversations while making sure that the patients that needed them got them. That's probably the best and most recent example I can give you. But I can tell you across the piece that we contract with these companies to create value for our clients, and then we deliver it."

How this one plays out, we'll follow their lead. We'll show them sort of some ideas that we can do. I agree with you though that even in the article, which was really a stew of interesting sort of different -- sort of mostly previously written things that were being brought together to form a theory that frankly doesn't exist, was very much around this notion that these plans are focused on maintaining coverage, using data to get smarter, understanding how the dollars flow. Those are all things that we do really well. I mean, I can tell you, we've been willing for years to write deals in many, many of our contracts, for example, have rebates that 100% flow through, completely auditable. The article implies that, that doesn't exist.

I mean, I think that, that -- what you found in the marketplace generally is true both in our channel as well as health plans as well as other businesses, right? I just bought my wife a car. They bundled a bunch of stuff together and it was a lot cheaper than me going through the pick-list. And it put together something that was what we wanted. That's our job in the case of HTA and with every other client is to bundle together what they need us to do. Doesn't mean they have to buy everything. It means that we believe that we can configure our model in a way that's good for us and helps the client meet their needs. And if they wanted, for example, internalize some small piece of what we do because they like to do it, then we have clients today that do that in the health plan space, for example. What I would say though is most of the -- while the HTA's clients are employers, they've got a lot of things to do. They've got businesses they're trying to grow and focus on. And from our perspective, typically, what employers have found is even when they have asked us to respond to bids that had discrete lines of business, almost inevitably, they've come back, and this article actually spoke to that. They've come back and moved back into a more integrated model. But then they understood sort of what the individual cost pieces were and got comfortable with the bundle. And I fully believe that you are going to continue to see the market, particularly the employer market continue largely down that path for the foreseeable future.

And that focus is being rewarde",1276,"Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen this past week, the health care environment remains unpredictable and volatile. At Express Scripts, we are not distracted. Indeed, our focus has never been sharper. And that focus is being rewarded. Demand for our services continues to be high, our unique model is resonating, and we are competing well. This is leading to a strong client retention year for 2017.
On the call today, I will briefly discuss why we are positioned for growth; how we will deliver value to clients, patients and shareholders; important differentiators of our approach to specialty, our client's #1 pain point; and our unique attributes that fuel our momentum. Then, I will turn it over to Eric, who will discuss our solid financial performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.
Having a singular focus in a steadfast alignment with clients differentiates us. Plan sponsors today face a harsh environment filled with threats but also with promise. We have an unprecedented level of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. There are more drugs in the pipeline now than ever before, and the majority are for specialty products treating chronic and complex conditions. Without our leadership, in collaboration with our clients, this rich pipeline of high-cost therapies has a potential to profoundly impact health care costs. There have never been so many drugs coming out of the pipeline that are high priced. Prices once only seen in orphan conditions are now seen for conditions that affect millions of people, in diseases such as cancer, high cholesterol and hepatitis C. We are relentlessly focused on the patient, delivering the right drug at the right cost and creating a more rational net-pricing environment. Central to this in the long-term, will be competition from biosimilars. However, legal and regulatory challenges are impeding progress. We are working every day with regulators and biotech manufacturers to help them realize there is a market for these products. We have the assets that will ensure patients get on the appropriate therapy and remain adherent.
In addition to costs and complex regulations, payers are facing a population that is growing older, demanding more health care and wanting a greater say in how that care is delivered. We uniquely tackle these challenges, and increasingly plan sponsors are turning to us. The controlled client costs, improved patient care and health plan sponsors maintain their pharmacy benefit, and do this through our innovative solutions, a single digital platform that integrates medical and pharmacy data and specialized care delivered by compassionate people with deep expertise.
Now let me turn to how we deliver value through our independent focus model and our ability to practice pharmacy smarter. Being independent means being fully aligned with our clients' best interests. Alignment has never been more important than it is now. Our independent PBM model puts our patients and clients first. And we tirelessly focus on lowering health care costs, while delivering healthier outcomes. We are not encumbered by any specific drug delivery channel. We are not beholden to any specific pharmaceutical partner. We are not part of a bigger business. At Express Scripts, our focus is simply on pharmacy benefit management. That allows us to align fully and flexibly with the clients. Do what's best for patients as we redefine the member experience, and work across the supply chain to drive out waste and create real value.
Next week, we will unveil our 2017 National Preferred Formulary. By aligning with our clients, we have been able to change the dynamic in pharma-payer relations, reining in costs, while sustaining access to drugs. Our approaches save clients billions of dollars, while delivering superior clinical outcomes. When you look at our 2015 drug trend report, I would point out that clients who tightly manage the benefit at a trend of 3.3%, in fact, that represents nearly 57% of those clients. Plan sponsors are increasingly using a broad range of cost-effective, innovative solutions to manage plans, and there is plenty of room to run across our book of business. We advocate for what matters most to our clients. As I referenced earlier, in the past few weeks, 2 biosimilars were approved by the FDA, yet today they are not available to patients. We continue to champion for biosimilars and for increased generic utilization. It will create the headroom payers need to afford breakthrough innovation. Capitalizing on biosimilars will take the same kind of bold action we took when high-priced hepatitis C drugs threatened to decimate payer budgets. We stood with our clients and worked with pharma to lower the cost of care and expand access. We drove the treatment costs down by nearly 66% and delivered adherence and cure rates on par with both the clinical trials and the competing product in the marketplace.
Now the key to achieving this outcome in hepatitis C as well as outcomes across therapeutic classes is our Accredo specialty pharmacy. As most of you know, I'm very familiar with our specialty business having previously served for 3 years as the CEO of Accredo. I recognize then what is still true today. Specifically, the difference that specialized care through our therapeutic resource centers can make for patients and how our company will be rewarded for getting this area right for our clients. As specialty spend is expected to soon comprise 50% of total drug spend by 2018, we continue to enhance the high-touch service model we offer through Accredo, while leveraging our scale and expertise to control costs. No one is better positioned than we are to provide specialized care for patients with complex and chronic diseases. As I mentioned earlier, our specialty model is poised to get biosimilars to market and further accelerate our ability to manage specialty spend and trend. Our success in specialty is based on focused clinical management. Our continued growth is the result of our differentiated innovative offerings in the specialty space, which not only increases PBM client adoption but helps us win direct business from payers, physicians and patients. Our Safeguard Rx suite of products is designed to better manage specialty spend, establishing a higher standard for patient outcomes. Payers greatly improve their specialty utilization trend and overall spending by taking advantage of our cost management and patient care programs, seeing as much as a 50% reduction in trend compared to those who do not apply our solution.
In fact, I would point out the 3.3% drug trend for tightly managed clients, I mentioned a moment ago, is inclusive of specialty trend for those clients. When you put it all together, Express Scripts is driving better retention, delivering strong sales performance and building upon a diverse client portfolio by addressing payer challenges like no one else can. Therefore, we expect another excellent retention year. Because of our singular focus, consistent operational excellence, flexibility and our innovative practice of pharmacy, we expect 2017 retention rate of 96% to 98%, up 1% at the midpoint of the range when compared to the same time last year. Additionally, I am pleased with our selling season. With our new suite of products, including Safeguard RX, and our ability to meet the demands of today's complex health care environment, we are well positioned to drive new sales. We have changed conversations for the better. Our bold actions, specialized care, data insights and innovative solutions have created a deep connection with clients, and our success provides more proof of the value of our independent PBM model. Putting patients and clients first truly works. I will now turn the call over to Eric to discuss our solid second quarter financial performance and the full year 2016 guidance."
317975,373819575,1014002,"Express Scripts Holding Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Evernorth Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.57, representing growth of 9% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with recent year",543,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.57, representing growth of 9% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with recent years, this quarter includes approximately $107 million of incremental revenue related to a client contract payment. Other key metric highlights for the quarter include: adjudication of 315.3 million adjusted claims; decreased adjusted SG&A of 1% versus the prior year; EBITDA generated of approximately $1.8 billion; and finally, excluding the impact from the previously mentioned client contract payment, EBITDA per adjusted Rx would be $5.36, up 4% over last year.
Throughout my first year with Express Scripts, we've been focused on expense management and efficient use of capital. This includes our capital structure initiatives and our intentions to maintain an approximate 2x debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio and an investment grade rating. As discussed in our press release, we executed a bond offering and concurrent tender offer to minimize our near-term debt repayment obligations, lengthen our portfolio's duration and to lock in attractive longer-term interest rates. Overall, we are very pleased with the outcome of this transaction.
Let's now turn to our 2016 updated guidance. Let me first touch on the adjusted claims guidance. For the full year, we are maintaining the midpoint of our current claims guidance at approximately 1.275 billion adjusted claims, but narrowing the range. For adjusted SG&A, we are maintaining our guidance range. Cost efficiency is a priority for our leadership team. We continue our efforts to streamline our processes and make changes toward more automation. With our focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty, we expect to see operational cost improvements, a reduction in SG&A year-over-year and an increase in patient satisfaction.
We are maintaining our EBITDA guidance range at a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, which represents growth of 3% to 5% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA.
As we stated in the first quarter, while the growth expected in the back half of 2016 is similar to previous years, we are expecting a slightly higher ramp up in EBITDA throughout the third and fourth quarters as a result of several factors: first, the Q1 roll-off of business due to acquisitions was a headwind we had to overcome; and second, the growth over prior year in the second half of the year is largely driven by higher utilization of our cost savings programs along with generic launches, supply chain initiatives and higher Medicare Part D revenue, driven by the benefit design in reinsurance payments from the government.
We are also narrowing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $6.33 to $6.43, increasing the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.02. This range raises the previously guided midpoint and represents growth of 14% to 16% year-over-year.
With respect to the third quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.72 to $1.76, up 19% to 21% year-over-year. We are pleased with our financial performance year-to-date and continue to execute on our strategy to lower cost and improve health outcomes while generating shareholder value.
Thank you, and now we'll be happy to take your questions."

In fact, our goal is to offset even the loss of Coventry next year, which again, as you saw on the release, there's still a little bit of that. But it's too early to declare that. But you just need to know we're having a strong selling year. Things that were winning don't happen to be the ones that you see out being announced, but we're very pleased with the way that we're selling. And a big piece of the reason that we're winning as well as obviously retaining our existing clients is exactly the point that you make, which is that we've got a number of things that we're out in the market with, that are giving clients hope in terms of both some cost certainty, holding down their trends, keeping their patients on the products that are the most co-ex [ph] products, given the value they create.

So that's got a lot of good headwinds for us or a lot of help for us, I should say, going forward. The other piece I would say is that management in specialty has been critical and use of the TRCs, we see a very positive reaction in the marketplace as it relates to our management of the care and also giving patients the right drug at the right time. The last piece I talk about is the 90-day programs. We are focused on that. We've seen health plans have a larger uptake recently in 90-day programs. Whether that be at the retail, or more importantly, the home delivery. And so we've been really pleased with that, too. And..."

We've already announced for next year, diabetes, and we're in the final stages of refining that exact program with our clients and with some supply chain participants, as well as the inflammatory conditions. So we see this as still probably in the third inning of a game that could go into extra innings quite frankly because we don't see the dynamics changing dramatically that create the opportunity for us to uniquely work with the supply chain leveraging our book of business to create those outcomes. So I think there's a lot of whitespace in condition management that bring a number of our tools together differently. So when you talk about mail, for example, in the old days, in this business because of the generic wave largely, you drove the value of mail because mail was so much more effective at converting generics. Today, the question is how do we work not only with mail but with the retail channel with 90-day channels to drive the overall outcome in these condition management programs that we're launching."

So let's talk about a couple of things. One of the things that -- just to comment on last year, just as a reminder, in the second half of the year, a large part of that third quarter and fourth quarter was driven by incentive programs and in seeding our targets around performance of the business. So you have incremental incentive in there, and we talked about that at year-end. As you look at this year, particularly this quarter and if you look at the guidance for the year, the second half, a couple of things: one, we're still very focused on cost management. This company historically has always been, and that is not going to change under Tim and my watch, so very, very focused. The front half of this year, we've continued to make investments around some of the things we've talked about, automation. And so the other thing I'd point out in the second quarter is we had a few onetime items that won't repeat in the third and fourth quarter of this year, particularly around a couple of onetime incentive programs, and then also increase legal fees around Anthem litigation. So that will certainly bring down the run rate. And then we're going to continue to manage across the board, our programs into the third and fourth quarter doing the things that we previously talked about."

And so when we go and we have these conversations, we recognize the timing may not be until 2018 or '19 or even beyond, but I'm reminded of when I joined this business in 1998, that we're looking at the front end of the generic wave, and we were at 40-some percent generic dispensing rates, and we're at 90% now.

It's how we drive down costs. And what you would see if you're inside the company is a couple of things: one, you'd see significantly increasing net promoter scores on the part of members who work with us; two, you would see that, that's the big piece of how we're driving down costs and waste from taking out phone calls that members frankly don't want to make to us, because they want to self-serve, and we're seeing that. That is the sort of leading result of those investments. The lagging results of those investments as members experience it and work with us, particularly as we put out our omnichannel 90-day programs with clients that are both mail and retail, because we've been able to contract with the supply chain as retailers in such a way as to make that something that works for us and our clients and our patients, is that over time we're going to see it grow. In the quarter, what you would have seen -- or frankly, this year, what you would see is the role of Coventry was largely their commercial book of business which did have mail penetration, and that's largely the driver that was actually creating what you saw in the numbers that you put out there. So we're very confident in the long term. We're not -- it's not -- I remember the old days when we used to say that a generic at mail was 3x as profitable as anything else, at least in the company I was working for at that time. I can tell you now that dynamic has leveled out to a far greater deal. We have a much more balanced approach to how we actually are paid in alignment with our clients to do our job. And so we are committed to mail. We believe it's a channel that members want to use. But it's not a channel that we are solely dependent upon for the kind of growth that you would expect from us."

But what I'd say is mail still has an important role to play. By the way, there's still some pretty terrific generics coming forward, as you know, in mail. Obviously, retail has done a much better job in the last few years than they did back in the day, in terms of converting those patients. But mail begins to sort of add to its allure, the fact that people just like getting things by mail. And so we've got a great clinical benefit there. We think our therapeutic research center has continued be important differentiators. We continue to see mail achieving outcomes that are differentiated even from 90-day retail channels, and so we are still committed to that. But I think it's one thing in terms of what you're taking in the market and another in terms of how big is the problem that it's solving in contrast to the overall problem.

We look at a net promoter score and break down what are the key drivers in net promoter score. And so that's a piece where we've lopped off over half a day, and we continue to lop off time for that first script coming from mail. We're also absolutely trying to make it easier to do. Obviously, we're in a highly regulated business, both at the state level and the federal level. So there are certain things that you might be able to do in other businesses that we have to figure out that are not as easy. In terms of -- for example, taking a picture of a script, which you can do certainly if you're then going to go into retail because you're going to present the paper script. But we have to have the physical script or the electronically prescribed script before we mail it. So e-prescribing, very important part of our strategy, we continue to see that grow. Digitally, we are using -- we're starting to use now digital welcome kits, which means at the time that a member enrolls with us, and we already have their data, we can actually present opportunities to them through that enrollment process and our welcome kit that used to be a paper thing that everyone threw out. And so while it's early days, and we're going to wind up reversioning that, doing what you would expect us to do in terms of sort of digital A-B testing and seeing the things that work best to help members navigate to mail, we see in the long run that, that's sort of a channel strategy with members on -- at least present the opportunity to them in an easy-to-use way so that those that want to use it will access it."

As you know, more and more prescriptions comes with prior authorizations today because that's how both the Medicare plans are managing and the commercial plans are also managing on top of more narrow formulary management. And so it depends, is the answer. Where we're able to get the script electronically, do an e-prior authorization and so forth. The patient can expect that script in probably 3 to 4 days. And by the way, part of the goal as well is patients are happier when they know where the script is than when they don't. And so one of the things we've done is opened up the black hole, that if you'd ordered from us 4 years ago, you know that we've got your order, and that's all you'd know until you receive it.

We aren't advocating anything else. We aren't talking about anything else. And so that -- but all that makes us feel good. Our job is to make it come to the table, in terms of retention and new business wins. Now the other thing I'd say is there's always been folks that like certain models. There are certain PBMs that are small, that you're looking and think, on a pure-scale basis, they shouldn't win a single case, but they find a marketplace for themselves. There are buyers who will choose based on different criteria. What I can say is the buyers that are choosing on criteria around aggressive management, around taking care of their members and trying to continue to provide the benefit to help their members through a consumer sort of experience as it relates to the plan design and navigating sort of the choices that are being thrust onto those ""consumers"" as it relate to the plan design. Those sort of buyers, which are significant number in the marketplace, like our model a lot. Because we really are aligned to them.

In fact, many of those clients know what we can do and have brought that to the table. We actually are engaged with them. We have a very good dialogue with the HTAs directly, as well as importantly, our clients that are in there. They've been out there for a while as you know. I mean, again, it's one of those things where if you go back to 2005, there was the transparency coalition that got started. We adapted our model to that, and it's been extraordinarily successful for us and for that coalition and those clients that wanted that sort of a model. That's, again, from our perspective, the ability to be flexible, the ability to create value for clients. I think as I told a client around that, if all of the clients we have in HTA are willing to do certain things together, that only gives us more ability to create value for them whether that's around indication or outcomes-based pricing, whether that's around a different rebate model or anything else. This business has always adapted. And we see things like the HTA to the extent that it gains through traction in working with those clients. And of course, they have a number of things they are going after. But we love the fact they want to be data-driven. We love the fact that they want to really drive outcomes that are good for their clients and keep their clients in business. I think the big story that didn't sort of come out of that is those clients want to stay in the business providing benefits. That's right down our strike zone."

First of all, I think one of the things that we started even before George left, but on my watch, with the teams that is so terrific at my table, is this notion of really rethinking how we engage with the supply chain to create value and leverage our clinical focus. And so this notion of condition management programs, with an umbrella of inflation protection over it, is extraordinarily innovative. We don't see anybody else doing it at a scale the way we are on taking on those challenges. We started it by launching it in front of 600 clients and Dr. Miller standing up and essentially signing them up to empower us to go out and do something that hadn't been done before around sort of an indication-based pricing model in oncology. And we've built off that, and it is transformational as it relates to the conversations we have with pharma, with manufacturers and with our clients. That being said -- and so we like and think we have the assets to get it done in terms of continuing to create that value. But as we look out, we see areas of waste and so forth in areas like workers' compensation. We see that there continues to be more we can do in specialty to broaden our footprint. We see health care information technology particularly for payers in assessing risk and managing risk and potentially for providers is areas that would naturally leverage our DNA. And so those are areas that we are now looking at. And what I would tell you is we are much more engaged than we were while we were integrating, as it relates to looking at opportunities outside of our 4 walls to bring additional solutions to our clients in those areas."

The way we report to clients, they have a front-row seat for the job that we do in specialty. And I would just point out that the vast majority of patients, in fact, that are on specialty scripts, need to be on those scripts. There's value that is created. The question is, though, they're on the lowest cost for a most appropriate script and that's why we've been able to move formulary in the specialty as aggressively as we have, which was not something that was being done largely in the industry as recently as 3 years ago. And so it's certainly not at scale. And so number one, making those formulary decisions and contracting with manufacturers to create and bring to our clients real value around that, contracting in such a way as to allow the price to be rational and allow us to do our job. So let me give you an example, PCSK9s. When you take a look at PCSK9s, to your point, as just a retail pharmacy or a fulfillment pharmacy, we're incented to fill every script we get in PCSK9s. That's not the way it works. And what we've shown our clients and where we sit today is in the first year, while those products have been out, we have basically taken the majority of the scripts that came to us, let me use that number. And wound up actually speaking with the physician and moving the patient out of the PCSK9 class in terms of their therapy, because of the fact that we managed it to the label, we managed to the indication, we got the tests that were fairly sophisticated, in terms of the kind of data that we needed to get, and we managed it. And we shown our clients that. We put it in a program called the Cardiovascular Care Value Program, and we basically guaranteed the PMPM cost that they were going to experience for PCSK9s, and then we hit them. We didn't just do that recklessly because patients that should be on those drugs, those are fabulous drugs, are drugs that we want to get and keep those patients on. But again, in the early days, the docs really were not writing it in such a way as to target those patients highly effectively. And we've helped train those physicians through those conversations while making sure that the patients that needed them got them. That's probably the best and most recent example I can give you. But I can tell you across the piece that we contract with these companies to create value for our clients, and then we deliver it."

How this one plays out, we'll follow their lead. We'll show them sort of some ideas that we can do. I agree with you though that even in the article, which was really a stew of interesting sort of different -- sort of mostly previously written things that were being brought together to form a theory that frankly doesn't exist, was very much around this notion that these plans are focused on maintaining coverage, using data to get smarter, understanding how the dollars flow. Those are all things that we do really well. I mean, I can tell you, we've been willing for years to write deals in many, many of our contracts, for example, have rebates that 100% flow through, completely auditable. The article implies that, that doesn't exist. So again, as the Healthcare Transformation Alliance focuses on their pharmacy pillars, which they have 4 pillars based on my understanding, we look forward to working with them because it would appear what they want to do is work with the marketplace to drive additional innovation and that's our DNA.

I mean, I think that, that -- what you found in the marketplace generally is true both in our channel as well as health plans as well as other businesses, right? I just bought my wife a car. They bundled a bunch of stuff together and it was a lot cheaper than me going through the pick-list. And it put together something that was what we wanted. That's our job in the case of HTA and with every other client is to bundle together what they need us to do. Doesn't mean they have to buy everything. It means that we believe that we can configure our model in a way that's good for us and helps the client meet their needs. And if they wanted, for example, internalize some small piece of what we do because they like to do it, then we have clients today that do that in the health plan space, for example. What I would say though is most of the -- while the HTA's clients are employers, they've got a lot of things to do. They've got businesses they're trying to grow and focus on. And from our perspective, typically, what employers have found is even when they have asked us to respond to bids that had discrete lines of business, almost inevitably, they've come back, and this article actually spoke to that. They've come back and moved back into a more integrated model. But then they understood sort of what the individual cost pieces were and got comfortable with the bundle. And I fully believe that you are going to continue to see the market, particularly the employer market continue largely down that path for the foreseeable future.

Today, we're going to focus on the results of the strong [ph] financial quarter end share our excitement about the future of our business and our industry. Our business model of alignment, standing strong with our clients, is translating to another strong retention year, sales year as well as a great year overall. 
But first, I want to discuss the top issue in our country, escalating drug prices. There is no doubt that drugs represent the first line of defense and hope for taking on the vast majority of medical conditions. However, our nation's attention has increasingly turned to affordability of drugs, particularly in cases where new and existing products lack competition. Gross prices for many existing therapies have increased at rates higher than other areas of health care. This has not only captured the attention of payers and patients but also politicians in this election year. A few pharma companies have chosen to blame our industry for these rising drug prices. This is ironic as the facts, accumulated over many years with real results, could not be more supportive of our role in creating affordable access to drugs. 
Just this week, a new report noted that although drug pricing will remain in the headline, solving the challenge involves use of PBM tools, tools which include value-based purchasing, PBM negotiating leverage, increased competition through more FDA approvals and protecting the Medicare Part D program, which has been immensely popular and is coming under budget [ph] every year because of the use of our tools. 
Additionally, 2 recent reports further validate the systematic need for what we do and, importantly, what we have done. First, IMS released a detailed study concluding that the current price in the United States for a hepatitis C cure is below that of nearly every Western European country. We were proud to lead the way. Second, the New England Journal of Medicine released a study on the effect of co-pay coupons on cost and generic utilization. Unsurprisingly, they concluded that these coupons are, and I quote, ""undermining insurer copayment systems"", and that they result in significant increase in cost due to unnecessary use of branded drugs over equivalent generics.  When we saw these coupons proliferating, we changed our formulary strategy, we drove cost down, and we protected our clients. 
These studies add to a robust dossier of research from academic and government agencies that collectively validate the power of PBM solutions. The bottom line is that drug companies set drug prices. Our job is to get the lowest net cost and to put medicine within reach of patients. And let me be clear, we do our job very well, and our job has never been more important. 
The proof of what we do, the results we achieve for our clients, chime through the headlines and the rhetoric. Last quarter, we highlighted our 2015 drug trend, which you see on the left side of the slide. Given all the discussions in 2016 about drug pricing, we wanted to present a year-to-date drug trend figure. Through the first 9 months, our commercial clients' average drug trend is 3.9%, 3.9%. This is against 5.2% for our average client in 2015 and, importantly, is inclusive of specialty spend and the positive effect of our adherence programs. 
By driving greater generic utilization, more competition between clinically equivalent medicines, use of low-cost channels while achieving higher patient adherence and better medical outcomes, we leverage our unique collection of strengths in ways no one else can. And we believe there's even more we can do to expand the potential of our model, applying our unique supply chain expertise and focused clinical approach to generate client savings and drive growth for our business. 
In fact, look no further than SafeguardRx. In the past several weeks, we've bolstered this offering with novel solutions for inflammatory conditions and diabetes. In addition, for one, we want [ph] to introduce a Market Events Program that will provide proactive protection to clients from the challenging drug price environment. Our business model provides a differentiated opportunity to manufacturers that want to bring innovative drugs to market in the safest and most cost-effective way. The discussions we have with manufacturers are focused on ensuring broad access, the best possible overall outcomes and cost management while limiting the disruption and delivering greater savings to clients year-over-year. 
It's exactly where we want to be as a company: actively engaged, bringing our innovative solutions to the marketplace to add more value to the pharmacy benefit as we better serve patients and clients. The common thread through all of these programs is our unique focused ability to leverage deep specialized expertise in clinical care, supply chain management and client alignment. That's what SafeguardRX and our other solutions are delivering: innovation that drives down health care costs and improves outcomes. The proof of our model is in our financial performance. 
And now I'll turn it over to Eric to share our third quarter results."
317975,403751286,1061249,"Express Scripts Holding Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Evernorth Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.74, representing growth of 20% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis, we reporte",850,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.74, representing growth of 20% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $722.9 million, representing growth of 9% over last year, and earnings per diluted share of $1.15, representing growth of 19% over last year. 
Other third quarter highlights include: adjusted claims of approximately $312 million were slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. The largest driver of the volume impact is due to Coventry lives rolling off at a rate faster than expected, which impacted both retail and mail claims. Other factors include an increase in retail 90-day claims as these are currently only counted as a single claim using our current adjustment methodology. And finally, utilization management programs are curbing the use of controlled substances. Obviously, while utilization programs have an expected negative impact on our adjusted claims volume, we are proud of the fact that, working with physicians and plan sponsors, we are helping to curb this public health epidemic. 
Adjusted SG&A decreased by 15% year-over-year. As discussed throughout this year, we remain firmly committed to expense management. As mentioned in prior quarters, we had onetime charges realized in the first half of 2016 that did not repeat, helping to reduce third quarter selling, general and administrative expenses. We are also seeing lower depreciation and amortization as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated in July. Finally, with lower volumes, incentive compensation was lower during the quarter. 
In the third quarter, we also generated $1.9 billion of EBITDA resulting in EBITDA per adjusted Rx of $6.24, representing growth of 13% year-over-year despite the headwind of both the Coventry and Catamaran business rolling off our books on 1/1/16, which we'll discuss further on our next slide. 
In addition, we delivered strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion during the quarter and settled the 2016 accelerated share repurchase program, receiving 6.2 million additional shares. 
Now to our 2016 guidance. With 1 quarter remaining, we are narrowing our guidance to an adjusted earnings per diluted share range of $6.36 to $6.42. This range raises the midpoint to $6.39 and represents growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year. 
There are a few other guidance revisions I also want to discuss. We are decreasing the midpoint of our adjusted SG&A range by $10 million, which represents a decrease of approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. As a leadership team, we are very pleased with the work our teams have done in the past year with regard to expense management, driving towards being a cost leader in our industry. The 2016 guidance does imply that adjusted SG&A will increase in the fourth quarter. This upward trend is to prepare for a strong 1/1 [ph] implementation and to invest in innovative offerings to our clients, such as continuing to build on our SafeguardRX programs. 
We are also decreasing the midpoint of our EBITDA range by $50 million, which represents growth of approximately 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. Going into 2016, we were faced with 2 large headwinds due to acquisitions, with both the Coventry and Catamaran businesses rolling off our books. The Catamaran drug formulary management business is coming in below forecast due to an accelerated rolloff. Also, as I indicated earlier, our volume is being impacted by a greater- and faster-than-expected rolloff of the Coventry lives, and the volume impact now represents a 4% loss of adjusted claims. 
Despite these challenges, we were successful at retaining our clients and taking on new business in 2016 to overcome the headwinds and grow EBITDA by 3%. The growth came from leveraging [ph] our key growth drivers: supply chain management, specialty in mail, all fueled by the adoption of our cost savings tools by our clients. Specific to supply chain management, we are realizing growth due to cost savings from generics, including both branded drugs coming off patent, as well as the lower cost to generics procured through our GPO for our home delivery pharmacy business. 
We are also seeing an increase driven by greater adoption of our clinical tools. As shown in the table, our total adjusted claims midpoint remained [ph] relatively consistent with the prior guidance despite the increase in Coventry claims rolling off. Bottom line is that our core business is performing despite the headwinds we have faced throughout the year. 
Finally, due to our deployment of cash, we expect share repurchases in the fourth quarter of between 750 million to 1 billion. [ph] The impact of our share repurchase program more than offsets the forecasted reduction in our EBITDA range, resulting in a $0.01 increase at the midpoint of our EPS range. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.84 to $1.90. 
Finally, in regards to the 2017 outlook, we plan to release our 2017 guidance before the market opens on December 14. 
I will now turn it back over to Tim for some closing comments."

A year ago, I said there was never a better time to be in our business given market needs. That is more true today than ever. In the 18 years I've been in this business, value creation has expanded from mail service and rebates to generics to specialty and now indication- and outcomes-based pricing. The point is we have always created and delivered value to payers and patients. It's why we exist. 
To deliver meaningful long-term value in today's marketplace, it takes specialized care and unique, sometimes challenging, relationships with manufacturers and retailers, along with the willingness to take bold actions to drive greater efficiencies. In short, it takes Express Scripts. We have transformed the supply chain. Pharma comes to us to partner on value-based approaches, proactively tying reimbursement to performance. 
As I mentioned earlier, just this past month, we announced 2 clinically based solutions in inflammatory conditions and diabetes and also a retail pharmacy chain [ph] with one of our largest clients, moving market share to deliver major savings with minimal disruption. We are an aligned, focused market force that improves health care while driving down costs. We're respected and rewarded for our bold actions by those who follow our industry and by those who need the value we offer, our clients.  This year, we expect retention to be between 97% and 98%, near an [ph] all-time high. 
In addition to our high client retention, we are pleased with this year's new sales results, with new name [ph] sales exceeding our client retention losses excluding Coventry. That's validation of our business model of alignment, appreciation of our innovative solutions and recognition from our clients that with Express Scripts as their PBM, they are more likely to achieve their goals and we are more likely to achieve our goals today and into the future. 
Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Thank you."

But I do -- I like very much the fact that even in some places, it's difficult to manage this [ph] oncology, we now have 3 different classes where we're working with manufacturers to get our clients more precision in terms of either how the drugs are reimbursed or getting their money back if patients drop off of therapy and those sorts of things.

I'll just point out also that there were 2 -- a couple of items in the first 2 quarters that were onetime items that drove higher numbers. So you're seeing a little more drop as a result of that. And also, as I commented in my script, volumes were off a little bit. We have internal and stretched [ph] incentive programs that some of those weren't met in the quarter. So incentive compensation is lower. Fully expect folks to hit those in the fourth quarter, so I expect that to be up. But more so, the fourth quarter driver is we have a lot of 1/1 [ph] new installs that we've got to invest in, in the fourth quarter. So you will see a ramp-up. And I think if you do the math from our guidance range, you'll see that. But I expect, absent the onetimes, our SG&A trend to be sustainable. And we'll continue -- and we'll talk more about this in December. We're going to continue to be focused on SG&A reductions."

In the range, it's still a headwind. It's directly attributable to 2 things, let me be clear. One is more of our clients have put in a utilization management programs, and so we're doing our job to help ensure that patients that shouldn't be getting products are getting products. They're finding other ways to resolve their issues. But also quite frankly, again, some of our clients based on the premiums that they set or potentially dropping out saw less lives.

Our MPS score has gone up a double-digit number of points, but it's still early in the game as it relates to converting those patients to what you'd see as mail growth. I know you see sequential growth -- a mild sequential growth in the quarter, but I think the other tailwind for the longer term, maybe not even next year because, again, I think that this is a multi-year investment horizon that we have is, in fact, when you take a look at where people are buying almost everything else today and when you look at health care and the position we think we can be in it in terms of the digital and the human experience that our members enjoy, I think over the longer term that there is a tailwind still in terms of minimally our omnichannel drive to 90-day and inside of that our drive to mail. It's longer term. The good news is those investments pay off in the short term based on cost and experience improvements. And over the longer term, they will pay off, I believe, in terms of, again, being able to help move members to the channels that are best for them, for the payer, and ultimately aligned with our interests."

The way the contract is written, it is -- so the benefit is we are demonstrating our value. While makers in D.C. pay a lot of attention to what goes on with those beneficiaries and I can tell you in my conversations with lawmakers, they are deeply interested in beneficiary experience and in the cost of running the program and we're demonstrating the ability to continue to drive both of those things not have them mutually exclusive. So from that standpoint, that's how that flows. You shouldn't model in some gigantic upside for us as a result.

At this point, as you might imagine, what I'd just say is this. I think they're quite busy right now working on another matter. And what we're doing in the meantime is making sure they don't have to spend any more time than they need to on pharmacy by giving them great service, helping implement the programs that they're putting into their marketplaces and positioning ourselves to be the obvious choice for them when they get to the point of taking a look at the marketplace. What I would say also is it would not surprise me. We believe and I think it's probably known that Anthem is likely to put an RFP out early next year, and so you should all expect that would be a market event that would happen. They would put an RFP out for their 2020 and beyond business. It wouldn't even shock me if we didn't get a copy of it initially, but we would expect that they would be out in the marketplace with a consultant on RFP sometime early next year. But I would tell you, again, we're working every day to give them no reason whatsoever to do anything other than to continue to allow us to serve their members."

And the advent of biosimilars will give us another tool and other lever to do that. How it plays out is still, I think, going to be a class-by-class product-by-product manufacturer-by-manufacturer set of conversation and decisions. There are certainly -- we saw early on, for example, one of the biosimilar that came out, tried to price itself in a way that made it unattractive compared to what we were able to do working with the brand manufacturer. We are agnostic as to who makes it as long it's a high quality manufacture and it drives down our patients costs and it creates competition. I also think that to talk about a point in time versus what happens over the longer term would be wrong because I think you're going to see evolution both in terms of the pricing. That's what we saw in hepatitis C just with 2 competing brand products, for example. It wasn't just a one-time decreased it was sort of an ongoing set of kind of market finding a different level and I expect that you're going to see the same sort of thing in the biosimilar. So we demonstrated in the small molecule space that we can work with brand manufacturers to create house generics that are good for patients and good for payers. We've equally demonstrated we can move share away very aggressively. Interchangeability is going to be another dynamic and then a lot of that will depend again on the product and the area. What I am confident again is our specialized care model and our supply chain expertise, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, position us very, very well in a case-by-case basis, to optimize for our clients, their spend in these areas."

First of all, in our customer base, I would say, first of all, there are a lot of our customers, particularly the commercial ones, that have all has been enthusiastic and supportive of mail. We do see, and as we look sort of at this year benefits of sales for next year, we have continued to see health plans adopting the mail programs in an increasing number for certain lines of business. And so it's not completely surprising that you would continue to see or you may see some change in that. I would also say from a 90-day standpoint, one of the important dynamics is 90-day programs that typically our omnichannel offer both retailer mail wind up growing both Retail90 and mail to the expense of 30-day scripts. And so to the extent that both we and, frankly, competitors have been moving into these 90-day programs offering both channels, it's not surprising that mail is getting fair share. And I think in our case, we are very, very well positioned to capture patients into our program. I do though, want to conclude by saying that the program that we currently have I think is exactly what our clients who have high 30-day penetration and had not been able, for various reasons, to put it more targeted mail programs, is exactly the program that they need. And as you may know, we have 2 different offerings, one of which does include Walgreens, and we're seeing a lot of interest again in those plans, in particular, who've historically not been able to, for a variety of reasons, necessarily strongly incent mail but they want mail to be available, they want the 90-day program to be available and they want to gain those savings and the clinical benefits of the program. So actually I'd like very much where we sit in terms of the current program and don't see dramatic things en masse. I do think what you saw in diabetes, though, shows what we can do in targeting a class, and we have a number of other classes as we look out over the next 18 months in the chamber to take potentially more targeted more clinically intensive approaches beyond simply just the general approach to driving adherence, and you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters. 
So with that, I want to thank everyone for dialing in today, and we will look forward to speaking to you in December when we give you our 2017 guidance."

Today, we're going to focus on the results of the strong financial quarter end share our excitement about the future of our business and our industry. Our business model of alignment, standing strong with our clients, is translating to another strong retention year, sales year as well as a great year overall. 
But first, I want to discuss the top issue in our country, escalating drug prices. There is no doubt that drugs represent the first line of defense and hope for taking on the vast majority of medical conditions. However, our nation's attention has increasingly turned to affordability of drugs, particularly in cases where new and existing products lack competition. Gross prices for many existing therapies have increased at rates higher than other areas of health care. This has not only captured the attention of payers and patients but also politicians in this election year. A few pharma companies have chosen to blame our industry for these rising drug prices. This is ironic as the facts, accumulated over many years with real results, could not be more supportive of our role in creating affordable access to drugs. 
Just this week, a new report noted that although drug pricing will remain in the headline, solving the challenge involves use of PBM tools, tools which include value-based purchasing, PBM negotiating leverage, increased competition through more FDA approvals and protecting the Medicare Part D program, which has been immensely popular and is coming under budget every year because of the use of our tools. 
Additionally, 2 recent reports further validate the systematic need for what we do and, importantly, what we have done. First, IMS released a detailed study concluding that the current price in the United States for a hepatitis C cure is below that of nearly every Western European country. We were proud to lead the way. Second, the New England Journal of Medicine released a study on the effect of co-pay coupons on cost and generic utilization. Unsurprisingly, they concluded that these coupons are, and I quote, ""undermining insurer copayment systems"", and that they result in significant increase in cost due to unnecessary use of branded drugs over equivalent generics. When we saw these coupons proliferating, we changed our formulary strategy, we drove cost down, and we protected our clients. 
These studies add to a robust dossier of research from academic and government agencies that collectively validate the power of PBM solutions. The bottom line is that drug companies set drug prices. Our job is to get the lowest net cost and to put medicine within reach of patients. And let me be clear, we do our job very well, and our job has never been more important. 
The proof of what we do, the results we achieve for our clients, chime through the headlines and the rhetoric. Last quarter, we highlighted our 2015 drug trend, which you see on the left side of the slide. Given all the discussions in 2016 about drug pricing, we wanted to present a year-to-date drug trend figure. Through the first 9 months, our commercial clients' average drug trend is 3.9%, 3.9%. This is against 5.2% for our average client in 2015 and, importantly, is inclusive of specialty spend and the positive effect of our adherence programs. 
By driving greater generic utilization, more competition between clinically equivalent medicines, use of low-cost channels while achieving higher patient adherence and better medical outcomes, we leverage our unique collection of strengths in ways no one else can. And we believe there's even more we can do to expand the potential of our model, applying our unique supply chain expertise and focused clinical approach to generate client savings and drive growth for our business. 
In fact, look no further than SafeguardRx. In the past several weeks, we've bolstered this offering with novel solutions for inflammatory conditions and diabetes. In addition, for 1/1, we want to introduce a Market Events Program that will provide proactive protection to clients from the challenging drug price environment. Our business model provides a differentiated opportunity to manufacturers that want to bring innovative drugs to market in the safest and most cost-effective way. The discussions we have with manufacturers are focused on ensuring broad access, the best possible overall outcomes and cost management while limiting the disruption and delivering greater savings to clients year-over-year. 
It's exactly where we want to be as a company: actively engaged, bringing our innovative solutions to the marketplace to add more value to the pharmacy benefit as we better serve patients and clients. The common thread through all of these programs is our unique focused ability to leverage deep specialized expertise in clinical care, supply chain management and client alignment. That's what SafeguardRX and our other solutions are delivering: innovation that drives down health care costs and improves outcomes. The proof of our model is in our financial performance. 
And now I'll turn it over to Eric to share our third quarter results."
317975,403751286,1061413,"Express Scripts Holding Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Evernorth Health, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.74, representing growth of 20% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis, we reporte",846,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.74, representing growth of 20% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $722.9 million, representing growth of 9% over last year, and earnings per diluted share of $1.15, representing growth of 19% over last year. 
Other third quarter highlights include: adjusted claims of approximately $312 million were slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. The largest driver of the volume impact is due to Coventry lives rolling off at a rate faster than expected, which impacted both retail and mail claims. Other factors include an increase in retail 90-day claims as these are currently only counted as a single claim using our current adjustment methodology. And finally, utilization management programs are curbing the use of controlled substances. Obviously, while utilization programs have an expected negative impact on our adjusted claims volume, we are proud of the fact that, working with physicians and plan sponsors, we are helping to curb this public health epidemic. 
Adjusted SG&A decreased by 15% year-over-year. As discussed throughout this year, we remain firmly committed to expense management. As mentioned in prior quarters, we had onetime charges realized in the first half of 2016 that did not repeat, helping to reduce third quarter selling, general and administrative expenses. We are also seeing lower depreciation and amortization as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated in July. Finally, with lower volumes, incentive compensation was lower during the quarter. 
In the third quarter, we also generated $1.9 billion of EBITDA resulting in EBITDA per adjusted Rx of $6.24, representing growth of 13% year-over-year despite the headwind of both the Coventry and Catamaran business rolling off our books on 1/1/16, which we'll discuss further on our next slide. 
In addition, we delivered strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion during the quarter and settled the 2016 accelerated share repurchase program, receiving 6.2 million additional shares. 
Now to our 2016 guidance. With 1 quarter remaining, we are narrowing our guidance to an adjusted earnings per diluted share range of $6.36 to $6.42. This range raises the midpoint to $6.39 and represents growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year. 
There are a few other guidance revisions I also want to discuss. We are decreasing the midpoint of our adjusted SG&A range by $10 million, which represents a decrease of approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. As a leadership team, we are very pleased with the work our teams have done in the past year with regard to expense management, driving towards being a cost leader in our industry. The 2016 guidance does imply that adjusted SG&A will increase in the fourth quarter. This upward trend is to prepare for a strong 1/1 implementation and to invest in innovative offerings to our clients, such as continuing to build on our SafeguardRX programs. 
We are also decreasing the midpoint of our EBITDA range by $50 million, which represents growth of approximately 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. Going into 2016, we were faced with 2 large headwinds due to acquisitions, with both the Coventry and Catamaran businesses rolling off our books. The Catamaran drug formulary management business is coming in below forecast due to an accelerated rolloff. Also, as I indicated earlier, our volume is being impacted by a greater- and faster-than-expected rolloff of the Coventry lives, and the volume impact now represents a 4% loss of adjusted claims. 
Despite these challenges, we were successful at retaining our clients and taking on new business in 2016 to overcome the headwinds and grow EBITDA by 3%. The growth came from leveraging our key growth drivers: supply chain management, specialty in mail, all fueled by the adoption of our cost savings tools by our clients. Specific to supply chain management, we are realizing growth due to cost savings from generics, including both branded drugs coming off patent, as well as the lower cost to generics procured through our GPO for our home delivery pharmacy business. 
We are also seeing an increase driven by greater adoption of our clinical tools. As shown in the table, our total adjusted claims midpoint remain relatively consistent with the prior guidance despite the increase in Coventry claims rolling off. Bottom line is that our core business is performing despite the headwinds we have faced throughout the year. 
Finally, due to our deployment of cash, we expect share repurchases in the fourth quarter of between 750 million to 1 billion. The impact of our share repurchase program more than offsets the forecasted reduction in our EBITDA range, resulting in a $0.01 increase at the midpoint of our EPS range. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.84 to $1.90. 
Finally, in regards to the 2017 outlook, we plan to release our 2017 guidance before the market opens on December 14. 
I will now turn it back over to Tim for some closing comments."

A year ago, I said there was never a better time to be in our business given market needs. That is more true today than ever. In the 18 years I've been in this business, value creation has expanded from mail service and rebates to generics to specialty and now indication- and outcomes-based pricing. The point is we have always created and delivered value to payers and patients. It's why we exist. 
To deliver meaningful long-term value in today's marketplace, it takes specialized care and unique, sometimes challenging, relationships with manufacturers and retailers, along with the willingness to take bold actions to drive greater efficiencies. In short, it takes Express Scripts. We have transformed the supply chain. Pharma comes to us to partner on value-based approaches, proactively tying reimbursement to performance. 
As I mentioned earlier, just this past month, we announced 2 clinically based solutions in inflammatory conditions and diabetes and also a retail pharmacy change with one of our largest clients, moving market share to deliver major savings with minimal disruption. We are an aligned, focused market force that improves health care while driving down costs. We're respected and rewarded for our bold actions by those who follow our industry and by those who need the value we offer, our clients. This year, we expect retention to be between 97% and 98%, near an all-time high. 
In addition to our high client retention, we are pleased with this year's new sales results, with new named sales exceeding our client retention losses excluding Coventry. That's validation of our business model of alignment, appreciation of our innovative solutions and recognition from our clients that with Express Scripts as their PBM, they are more likely to achieve their goals and we are more likely to achieve our goals today and into the future. 
Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Thank you."

And so -- but I don't expect to see change overnight. I think you're going to continue to see brands competing with each other for access to formularies, and the way that they're going to do that is to continue to retrospectively discount or retroactively discount through rebates. But I do -- I like very much the fact that even in some places, it's difficult to manage this oncology, we now have 3 different classes where we're working with manufacturers to get our clients more precision in terms of either how the drugs are reimbursed or getting their money back if patients drop off of therapy and those sorts of things.

And again, from our standpoint -- again, in my 18 years, I've seen us as an industry do really well with 0 inflation. I've seen us do really well with 10%, 12% inflation. In either case, we have to demonstrate to our clients that we're bringing value to the table. And I believe we're in a position to continue to do that. I think you're going to see moderations of -- some moderation of inflation but probably not enough, frankly, to the payers' taste on a gross basis, which is why we will still have a job to do to drive their net trends into the direction we've been able to achieve."

So that's been the big driver. But also, just from an overall SG&A perspective, department by department, we've gone through and have been very, very focused on being efficient, productive and taking out non-value-add work across our business. So you're seeing a lot of benefit of that coming to fruition as we expected in the second half of the year. I'll just point out also that there were 2 -- a couple of items in the first 2 quarters that were onetime items that drove higher numbers. So you're seeing a little more drop as a result of that. And also, as I commented in my script, volumes were off a little bit. We have internal and stretch incentive programs that some of those weren't met in the quarter. So incentive compensation is lower. Fully expect folks to hit those in the fourth quarter, so I expect that to be up. But more so, the fourth quarter driver is we have a lot of 1/1 new installs that we've got to invest in, in the fourth quarter. So you will see a ramp-up. And I think if you do the math from our guidance range, you'll see that. But I expect, absent the onetimes, our SG&A trend to be sustainable. And we'll continue -- and we'll talk more about this in December. We're going to continue to be focused on SG&A reductions."

And then given the fact that it sounds like Coventry rolled off a little faster maybe than you had expected, are you comfortable saying that you could actually just see absolute claims growth in '17 over '16?"

The middle market tends to like those sorts of things where you just enroll them in our programs and they perform for them.

We are agnostic as it relates to how we do generic purchasing as long as we're protected in the longer term, as long as we're in control of sort of some of the key dynamics. And there are a lot of ways to achieve that besides having our own GPO. I'm not going to declare any one potential future partner because there are a number that we will continually look at, we will put in clean rooms and we will challenge ourselves to create additional value with.

So I don't want you to be modeling out gigantic numbers, but what I would tell you is part of the reason we have a range on claims in a business that you would otherwise think is fairly easy to predict is, for example, this year, we saw the exchange claims volume drop somewhere between 7 million and 8 million claims compared to our, coming into the year, sort of best guess. And that's why we're reevaluating kind of how we model it now. Again, in the range, it's a headwind. It's directly attributable to 2 things, let me be clear. One is more of our clients have put in our utilization management programs, and so we're doing our job to help ensure that patients that shouldn't be getting products aren't getting products, that they're finding other ways to resolve their issues. But also, quite frankly, again, some of our clients based on either the premiums that they set or potentially even dropping out saw less lives. And so this year, it was a very mild headwind, but it was a headwind. Next year, we're going to try to give you a range where we bake that headwind in, and that's what we're working through now."

Our digital initiatives have driven amazing amounts of cost out of our system while improving our patient experience. Our NPS score has gone up a double-digit number of points. But it's still early in the game as it relates to converting those patients to what you'd see as mail growth. I know you'd see sequential growth in the -- a mild sequential growth in the quarter. But I think the other tailwind for the longer term, maybe not even next year because, again, I think that this is a multiyear investment horizon that we have is, in fact, when you take a look at where people are buying almost everything else today and when you look at health care and the position we think we can be in it in terms of the digital and the human experience that our members enjoy, I think over the longer term that there is a tailwind still in terms of minimally our omnichannel drive to 90-day and, inside of that, our drive to mail. It's longer term. The good news is those investments pay off in the short term based on cost and experience improvements. And over the longer term, they will pay off, I believe, in terms of, again, being able to help move members to the channels that are best for them, for the payer and ultimately aligned with our interests."

The way the contract is written, it is -- and so the benefit is that we're demonstrating our value. Lawmakers in D.C. pay a lot of attention to what goes on with those beneficiaries. And I can tell you, in my conversations with lawmakers, they are deeply interested in beneficiary experience and in the cost of running the program. And we're demonstrating the ability to continue to drive both of those things, not have them be mutually exclusive. And so from that standpoint, that's how that flows. You shouldn't model in some gigantic upside for us as a result. The upside is we renewed them some time ago, and we're going to continue to position ourselves to grow the program and help them stay solvent. As it relates to Anthem, I don't have an update for you at this point, as you might imagine. What I'd just say is this: I think they're quite busy right now working on another matter. And what we're doing in the meantime is making sure they don't have to spend any more time than they need to on pharmacy by giving them great service, helping implement the programs that they are putting into their marketplaces and positioning ourselves to be the obvious choice for them when they get to the point of taking a look at the marketplace. What I would say also is it would not surprise me. We believe and I think it's probably known that Anthem is likely to put an RFP out early next year. And so you should all expect that, that would be a market event that would happen. They would put an RFP out for their 2020 and beyond business. It wouldn't even shock me if we didn't get a copy of it initially, but we would expect that they would be out in the marketplace with a consultant and an RFP sometime early next year.

And the advent of biosimilars will give us another tool and another lever to do that. How it plays out is still, I think, going to be a class-by-class, product-by-product, manufacturer-by-manufacturer set of conversations and decisions. There are certainly -- we saw early on, for example, one of the biosimilars that came out tried to price itself in a way that made it unattractive compared to what we were able to do working with the brand manufacturer. We are agnostic as to who makes it as long as it's a high-quality manufacture and it drives down our patients' costs, and it creates some competition. I also think that to create -- to talk about a point in time versus what happens over the longer term would be wrong because I think you're going to see evolution both in terms of the pricing, as what we saw in hepatitis C just with 2 competing brand products, for example. It wasn't just a onetime decrease. It was sort of an ongoing set of kind of the market finding a different level. And I expect that you're going to see the same sort of thing in the biosimilars. So we are -- we've demonstrated in the small molecule space that we can work with brand manufacturers to create house generics that are good for patients and good for payers. We've equally demonstrated that we can move share away very aggressively. Interchangeability is going to be another dynamic, and then a lot of that will depend again on the product and the area. What I am confident in is our specialized care model and our supply chain expertise, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, position us very, very well in a case-by-case basis to optimize for our clients their spend in these areas."

So just curious, are you sensing any renewed enthusiasm for mail order within your customer base? Or is 90-day retail still rising in popularity? You touched on this a little bit.

First of all, in our customer base, I would say, first of all, there are a lot of our customers, particularly the commercial ones, that have always been enthusiastic and supportive of mail. We do see and as we look sort of at this year's benefits upsells for next year, we have continued to see health plans adopting the mail programs in an increasing number for certain lines of business. And so it's not completely surprising that you would continue to see or you may see some change in that. I would also say, from a 90-day standpoint, one of the important dynamics is 90-day programs that typically are omnichannel or offer both retail or mail wind up growing both Retail90 and mail to the expense of 30-day scripts. And so to the extent that both we and, frankly, competitors have been moving into these 90-day programs offering both channels, it's not surprising that mail is getting fair share. And I think in our case, we're very, very well positioned to capture patients into our program. I do, though, want to conclude by saying that the program that we currently have, I think, is exactly what our clients who have high 30-day penetration and have not been able, for various reasons, to put in more targeted mail programs, is exactly the program that they need. And we -- as you may know, we have 2 different offerings, one of which does include Walgreens. And we're seeing a lot of interest again in those plans, in particular, who have historically not been able to, for a variety of reasons, necessarily strongly incent mail, but they want mail to be available, they want the 90-day program to be available, and they want to gain those savings and the clinical benefits of the program. So actually, I like very much where we sit in terms of the current program and don't see dramatic things en masse. I do think what you saw in diabetes, though, shows what we can do in targeting a class, and we have a number of other classes, as we look out over the next 18 months in the chamber, to take potentially more targeted, more clinically intensive approaches beyond simply just the channel approach to driving adherence. And you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters. 
So with that, I want to thank everyone for dialing in today, and we will look forward to speaking to you in December when we give you our 2017 guidance."

Today, we're going to focus on the results of a strong financial quarter and share our excitement about the future of our business and our industry. Our business model's alignment, standing strong with our clients, is translating to another strong retention year, sales year as well as a great year overall. 
But first, I want to discuss the top issue in our country, escalating drug prices. There is no doubt that drugs represent the first line of defense and hope for taking on the vast majority of medical conditions. However, our nation's attention has increasingly turned to affordability of drugs, particularly in cases where new and existing products lack competition. Gross prices for many existing therapies have increased at rates higher than other areas of health care. This has not only captured the attention of payers and patients but also politicians in this election year. A few pharma companies have chosen to blame our industry for these rising drug prices. This is ironic as the facts, accumulated over many years with real results, could not be more supportive of our role in creating affordable access to drugs. 
Just this week, a new report noted that although drug pricing will remain in the headlines, solving the challenge involves use of PBM tools, tools which include value-based purchasing, PBM negotiating leverage, increased competition through more FDA approvals and protecting the Medicare Part D program, which has been immensely popular and is coming under budget every year because of the use of our tools. 
Additionally, 2 recent reports further validate the systematic need for what we do and, importantly, what we have done. First, IMS released a detailed study concluding that the current price in the United States for a hepatitis C cure is below that of nearly every Western European country. We were proud to lead the way. Second, the New England Journal of Medicine released a study on the effect of co-pay coupons on cost and generic utilization. Unsurprisingly, they concluded that these coupons are, and I quote, ""undermining insurer copayment systems"", and that they result in significant increase in cost due to unnecessary use of branded drugs over equivalent generics. When we saw these coupons proliferating, we changed our formulary strategy, we drove cost down, and we protected our clients. 
These studies add to a robust dossier of research from academic and government agencies that collectively validate the power of PBM solutions. The bottom line is that drug companies set drug prices. Our job is to get the lowest net cost and to put medicine within reach of patients. And let me be clear, we do our job very well, and our job has never been more important. 
The proof of what we do, the results we achieve for our clients, shine through the headlines and the rhetoric. Last quarter, we highlighted our 2015 drug trend, which you see on the left side of the slide. Given all the discussions in 2016 about drug pricing, we wanted to present a year-to-date drug trend figure. Through the first 9 months, our commercial clients' average drug trend is 3.9%, 3.9%. This is against 5.2% for our average client in 2015 and, importantly, is inclusive of specialty spend and the positive effect of our adherence programs. 
By driving greater generic utilization, more competition between clinically equivalent medicines, use of low-cost channels while achieving higher patient adherence and better medical outcomes, we leverage our unique collection of strengths in ways no one else can. And we believe there's even more we can do to expand the potential of our model, applying our unique supply chain expertise and focused clinical approach to generate client savings and drive growth for our business. 
In fact, look no further than SafeguardRx. In the past several weeks, we've bolstered this offering with novel solutions for inflammatory conditions and diabetes. In addition, for 1/1, we want to introduce a Market Events Program that will provide proactive protection to clients from the challenging drug price environment. Our business model provides a differentiated opportunity to manufacturers that want to bring innovative drugs to market in the safest and most cost-effective way. The discussions we have with manufacturers are focused on ensuring broad access, the best possible overall outcomes and cost management while limiting the disruption and delivering greater savings to clients year-over-year. 
It's exactly where we want to be as a company: actively engaged, bringing our innovative solutions to the marketplace to add more value to the pharmacy benefit as we better serve patients and clients. The common thread through all of these programs is our unique focused ability to leverage deep specialized expertise in clinical care, supply chain management and client alignment. That's what SafeguardRX and our other solutions are delivering: innovation that drives down health care costs and improves outcomes. The proof of our model is in our financial performance. 
And now I'll turn it over to Eric to share our third quarter results."

On a GAAP basis, we reporte",846,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.74, representing growth of 20% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $722.9 million, representing growth of 9% over last year, and earnings per diluted share of $1.15, representing growth of 19% over last year. 
Other third quarter highlights include: adjusted claims of approximately $312 million were slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. The largest driver of the volume impact is due to Coventry lives rolling off at a rate faster than expected, which impacted both retail and mail claims. Other factors include an increase in retail 90-day claims as these are currently only counted as a single claim using our current adjustment methodology. And finally, utilization management programs are curbing the use of controlled substances. Obviously, while utilization programs have an expected negative impact on our adjusted claims volume, we are proud of the fact that working with physicians and plan sponsors, we are helping to curb this public health epidemic. 
Adjusted SG&A decreased by 15% year-over-year. As discussed throughout this year, we remain firmly committed to expense management. As mentioned in prior quarters, we had onetime charges realized in the first half of 2016 that did not repeat, helping to reduce third quarter selling, general and administrative expenses. We are also seeing lower depreciation and amortization as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated in July. Finally, with lower volumes, incentive compensation was lower during the quarter. 
In the third quarter, we also generated $1.9 billion of EBITDA resulting in EBITDA per adjusted Rx of $6.24, representing growth of 13% year-over-year despite the headwind of both the Coventry and Catamaran business rolling off our books on 1/1/16, which we'll discuss further on our next slide. 
In addition, we delivered strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion during the quarter and settled the 2016 accelerated share repurchase program, receiving 6.2 million additional shares. 
Now to our 2016 guidance. With 1 quarter remaining, we are narrowing our guidance to an adjusted earnings per diluted share range of $6.36 to $6.42. This range raises the midpoint to $6.39 and represents growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year. 
There are a few other guidance revisions I also want to discuss. We are decreasing the midpoint of our adjusted SG&A range by $10 million, which represents a decrease of approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. As a leadership team, we are very pleased with the work our teams have done in the past year with regard to expense management, driving towards being a cost leader in our industry. The 2016 guidance does imply that adjusted SG&A will increase in the fourth quarter. This upward trend is to prepare for a strong 1/1 implementation and to invest in innovative offerings to our clients, such as continuing to build on our SafeguardRX programs. 
We are also decreasing the midpoint of our EBITDA range by $50 million, which represents growth of approximately 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. Going into 2016, we were faced with 2 large headwinds due to acquisitions, with both the Coventry and Catamaran businesses rolling off our books. The Catamaran drug formulary management business is coming in below forecast due to an accelerated roll-off. Also, as I indicated earlier, our volume is being impacted by a greater- and faster-than-expected roll-off of the Coventry lives, and the volume impact now represents a 4% loss of adjusted claims. 
Despite these challenges, we were successful at retaining our clients and taking on new business in 2016 to overcome the headwinds and grow EBITDA by 3%. The growth came from leveraging our key growth drivers: supply chain management, specialty in mail, all fueled by the adoption of our cost savings tools by our clients. Specific to supply chain management, we are realizing growth due to cost savings from generics, including both branded drugs coming off patent, as well as the lower cost to generics procured through our GPO for our home delivery pharmacy business. 
We are also seeing an increase driven by greater adoption of our clinical tools. As shown in the table, our total adjusted claims midpoint remained relatively consistent with the prior guidance despite the increase in Coventry claims rolling off. Bottom line is that our core business is performing despite the headwinds we have faced throughout the year. 
Finally, due to our deployment of cash, we expect share repurchases in the fourth quarter of between 750 million to 1 billion. The impact of our share repurchase program more than offsets the forecasted reduction in our EBITDA range, resulting in a $0.01 increase at the midpoint of our EPS range. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.84 to $1.90. 
Finally, in regards to the 2017 outlook, we plan to release our 2017 guidance before the market opens on December 14. 
I will now turn it back over to Tim for some closing comments."

A year ago, I said there was never a better time to be in our business given market needs. That is more true today than ever. In the 18 years I've been in this business, value creation has expanded from mail service, from rebates to generics to specialty and now indication- and outcomes-based pricing. The point is we have always created and delivered value to payers and patients. It's why we exist. 
To deliver meaningful long-term value in today's marketplace, it takes specialized care and unique, sometimes challenging, relationships with manufacturers and retailers, along with a willingness to take bold actions to drive greater efficiencies. In short, it takes Express Scripts. We have transformed the supply chain. Pharma comes to us to partner on value-based approaches, proactively tying reimbursement to performance. 
As I mentioned earlier, just this past month, we announced 2 clinically-based solutions in inflammatory conditions and diabetes and also a retail pharmacy change with one of our largest clients, moving market share to deliver major savings with minimal disruption. We are an aligned, focused market force that improves health care while driving down costs. We're respected and rewarded for our bold actions by those who follow our industry and by those who need the value we offer, our clients. This year, we expect retention to be between 97% and 98%, near an all-time high. 
In addition to our high client retention, we are pleased with this year's new sales results, with new named sales exceeding our client retention losses excluding Coventry. That validation of our business model's alignment, appreciation of our innovative solutions and recognition from our clients that with Express Scripts as their PBM, they are more likely to achieve their goals and we are more likely to achieve our goals today and into the future. 
Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Thank you."

And so -- but I don't expect to see change overnight. I think you're going to continue to see brands competing with each other for access to formularies, and the way that they're going to do that is to continue to retrospectively discount or retroactively discount through rebates. But I do -- I like very much the fact that even in some place as difficult to manage as oncology, we now have 3 different classes where we're working with manufacturers to get our clients more precision in terms of either how the drugs are reimbursed or getting their money back if patients drop off of therapy and those sorts of things.

And again, from our standpoint -- again, in my 18 years, I've seen us as an industry do really well with 0 inflation. I've seen us do really well with 10%, 12% inflation. In either case, we have to demonstrate to our clients that we're bringing value to the table. And I believe we're in a position to continue to do that. I think you're going to see moderations of -- some moderation of inflation but probably not enough, frankly, to the payers' taste on a gross basis, which is why we will still have a job to do to drive their net trends in the direction we've been able to achieve."

So that's been the big driver. But also, just from an overall SG&A perspective, department by department, we've gone through and have been very, very focused on being efficient, productive and taking out non-value-add work across our business. So you're seeing a lot of benefit of that coming to fruition as we expected in the second half of the year. I'll just point out also that there were 2 -- a couple of items in the first 2 quarters that were onetime items that drove higher numbers. So you're seeing a little more drop as a result of that. And also, as I commented in my script, volumes were off a little bit. We have internal and stretch incentive programs that -- some of those weren't met in the quarter. So incentive compensation is lower. Fully expect folks to hit those in the fourth quarter, so I expect that to be up. But more so, the fourth quarter driver is we have a lot of 1/1 new installs that we've got to invest in, in the fourth quarter. So you will see a ramp-up. And I think if you do the math from our guidance range, you'll see that. But I expect, absent the onetimes, our SG&A trend to be sustainable. And we'll continue -- and we'll talk more about this in December. We're going to continue to be focused on SG&A reductions."

The middle market tends to like those sorts of things where you just enroll them in our programs and they perform for them.

So I don't want you to be modeling out gigantic numbers, but what I would tell you is part of the reason we have a range on claims in a business that you would otherwise think is fairly easy to predict is, for example, this year, we saw the exchange claims volume drop somewhere between 7 million and 8 million claims compared to our, coming into the year, sort of best guess. And that's why we're reevaluating kind of how we model it now. Again, in the range, it's a headwind. It's directly attributable to 2 things, let me be clear. One is more of our clients have put in our utilization management programs, and so we're doing our job to help ensure that patients that shouldn't be getting product aren't getting product, that they're finding other ways to resolve their issues. But also, quite frankly, again, some of our clients based on either the premiums that they set or potentially even dropping out, saw less lives. And so this year, it was a very mild headwind, but it was a headwind. Next year, we're going to try to give you a range where we bake that headwind in, and that's what we're working through now."

Our digital initiatives have driven amazing amounts of cost out of our system while improving our patient experience. Our NPS score has gone up a double-digit number of points. But it's still early in the game as it relates to converting those patients to what you'd see as mail growth. I know you'd see sequential growth in the -- a mild sequential growth in the quarter. But I think the other tailwind for the longer term, maybe not even next year because, again, I think that this is a multiyear investment horizon that we have is, in fact, when you take a look at where people are buying almost everything else today and when you look at health care and the position we think we can be in it in terms of the digital and the human experience that our members enjoy, I think over the longer term that there is a tailwind still in terms of minimally our omnichannel drive to 90-day and, inside of that, our drive to mail. It's longer term. The good news is those investments pay off in the short term based on cost and experience improvements. And over the longer term, they will pay off, I believe, in terms of, again, being able to help move members to the channels that are best for them, for the payer, and ultimately aligned with our interests."

As it relates to Anthem, I don't have an update for you at this point, as you might imagine. What I'd just say is this: I think they're quite busy right now working on another matter. And what we're doing in the meantime is making sure they don't have to spend any more time than they need to on pharmacy by giving them great service, helping implement the programs that they are putting into their marketplaces and positioning ourselves to be the obvious choice for them when they get to the point of taking a look at the marketplace. What I would say also is it would not surprise me -- we believe and think it's probably known that Anthem is likely to put an RFP out early next year. And so you should all expect that, that would be a market event that would happen. They would put an RFP out for their 2020 and beyond business. It wouldn't even shock me if we didn't get a copy of it initially, but we would expect that they would be out in the marketplace with a consultant and an RFP sometime early next year.

And the advent of biosimilars will give us another tool and another lever to do that. How it plays out is still, I think, going to be a class-by-class, product-by-product, manufacturer-by-manufacturer set of conversations and decisions. There are certainly -- we saw early on, for example, one of the biosimilars that came out tried to price itself in a way that made it unattractive compared to what we were able to do working with the brand manufacturer. We are agnostic as to who makes it as long as it's a high-quality manufacturer and it drives down our patients' costs, and it creates some competition. I also think that to create -- to talk about a point in time versus what happens over the longer term would be wrong because I think you're going to see evolution both in terms of the pricing, as what we saw in hepatitis C just with 2 competing brand products, for example. It wasn't just a onetime decrease. It was sort of an ongoing set of kind of the market finding a different level. And I expect that you're going to see the same sort of thing in the biosimilars. So we are -- we've demonstrated in the small molecule space that we can work with brand manufacturers to create house generics that are good for patients and good for payers. We've equally demonstrated that we can move share away very aggressively. Interchangeability is going to be another dynamic, and then a lot of that will depend again on the product and the area. What I am confident in is our specialized care model and our supply chain expertise, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, position us very, very well in a case-by-case basis to optimize for our clients their spend in these areas."

First of all, in our customer base, I would say, first of all, there are a lot of our customers, particularly the commercial ones, that have always been enthusiastic and supportive of mail. We do see and as we look sort of at this year's benefits upsells for next year, we have continued to see health plans adopting the mail programs in an increasing number for certain lines of business. And so it's not completely surprising that you would continue to see or you may see some change in that. I would also say, from a 90-day standpoint, one of the important dynamics is 90-day programs that typically are omnichannel or offer both retail or mail, wind up growing both Retail90 and mail to the expense of 30-day scripts. And so to the extent that both we and frankly, competitors, have been moving into these 90-day programs offering both channels, it's not surprising that mail is getting fair share. And I think in our case, we're very, very well positioned to capture patients into our program. I do, though, want to conclude by saying that the program that we currently have, I think, is exactly what our clients who have high 30-day penetration and have not been able, for various reasons, to put in more targeted mail programs, is exactly the program that they need. And we -- as you may know, we have 2 different offerings, one of which does include Walgreens. And we're seeing a lot of interest again in those plans, in particular, who have historically not been able to, for a variety of reasons, necessarily strongly incent mail, but they want mail to be available, they want the 90-day program to be available, and they want to gain those savings and the clinical benefits of the program. So actually, I like very much where we sit in terms of the current program and don't see dramatic things en masse. I do think what you saw in diabetes, though, shows what we can do in targeting a class, and we have a number of other classes, as we look out over the next 18 months in the chamber, to take potentially more targeted, more clinically-intensive approaches beyond simply just the channel approach to driving adherence. And you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters. 
So with that, I want to thank everyone for dialing in today, and we will look forward to speaking to you in December when we give you our 2017 guidance."

Today, we're going to focus on the results of a strong financial quarter and share our excitement about the future of our business and our industry. Our business model's alignment, standing strong with our clients, is translating to another strong retention year, sales year as well as a great year overall. 
But first, I want to discuss the top issue in our country, escalating drug prices. There is no doubt that drugs represent the first line of defense and hope for taking on the vast majority of medical conditions. However, our nation's attention has increasingly turned to affordability of drugs, particularly in cases where new and existing products lack competition. Gross prices for many existing therapies have increased at rates higher than other areas of health care. This has not only captured the attention of payers and patients but also politicians in this election year. A few pharma companies have chosen to blame our industry for these rising drug prices. This is ironic as the facts, accumulated over many years with real results, could not be more supportive of our role in creating affordable access to drugs. 
Just this week, a new report noted that although drug pricing will remain in the headlines, solving the challenge involves use of PBM tools, tools which include value-based purchasing, PBM negotiating leverage, increased competition through more FDA approvals and protecting the Medicare Part D program, which has been immensely popular and is coming under budget every year because of the use of our tools. 
Additionally, 2 recent reports further validate the systematic need for what we do and, importantly, what we have done. First, IMS released a detailed study concluding that the current price in the United States for a hepatitis C cure is below that of nearly every Western European country. We were proud to lead the way. Second, the New England Journal of Medicine released a study on the effect of co-pay coupons on cost and generic utilization. Unsurprisingly, they concluded that these coupons are, and I quote, ""undermining insurer copayment systems"", and that they result in significant increase in cost due to unnecessary use of branded drugs over equivalent generics. When we saw these coupons proliferating, we changed our formulary strategy, we drove cost down, and we protected our clients. 
These studies add to a robust dossier of research from academic and government agencies that collectively validate the power of PBM solutions. The bottom line is that drug companies set drug prices. Our job is to get the lowest net cost and to put medicine within reach of patients. And let me be clear, we do our job very well, and our job has never been more important. 
The proof of what we do, the results we achieve for our clients, shine through the headlines and the rhetoric. Last quarter, we highlighted our 2015 drug trend, which you see on the left side of the slide. Given all the discussions in 2016 about drug pricing, we wanted to present a year-to-date drug trend figure. Through the first 9 months, our commercial clients' average drug trend is 3.9%, 3.9%. This is against 5.2% for our average client in 2015 and, importantly, is inclusive of specialty spend and the positive effect of our adherence programs. 
By driving greater generic utilization, more competition between clinically equivalent medicines, use of low-cost channels while achieving higher patient adherence and better medical outcomes, we leverage our unique collection of strengths in ways no one else can. And we believe there's even more we can do to expand the potential of our model, applying our unique supply chain expertise and focused clinical approach to generate client savings and drive growth for our business. 
In fact, look no further than SafeguardRx. In the past several weeks, we've bolstered this offering with novel solutions for inflammatory conditions and diabetes. In addition, for 1/1, we want to introduce a Market Events Program that will provide proactive protection to clients from the challenging drug price environment. Our business model provides a differentiated opportunity to manufacturers that want to bring innovative drugs to market in the safest and most cost-effective way. The discussions we have with manufacturers are focused on ensuring broad access, the best possible overall outcomes and cost management while limiting the disruption and delivering greater savings to clients year-over-year. 
It's exactly where we want to be as a company: actively engaged, bringing our innovative solutions to the marketplace to add more value to the pharmacy benefit as we better serve patients and clients. The common thread through all of these programs is our unique focused ability to leverage deep specialized expertise in clinical care, supply chain management and client alignment. That's what SafeguardRX and our other solutions are delivering: innovation that drives down health care costs and improves outcomes. The proof of our model is in our financial performance. 
And now I'll turn it over to Eric to share our third quarter results."

For the third quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.74, representing growth of 20% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $722.9 million, representing growth of 9% over last year, and earnings per diluted share of $1.15, representing growth of 19% over last year. 
Other third quarter highlights include: adjusted claims of approximately $312 million were slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. The largest driver of the volume impact is due to Coventry lives rolling off at a rate faster than expected, which impacted both retail and mail claims. Other factors include an increase in retail 90-day claims as these are currently only counted as a single claim using our current adjustment methodology. And finally, utilization management programs are curbing the use of controlled substances. Obviously, while utilization programs have an expected negative impact on our adjusted claims volume, we are proud of the fact that working with physicians and plan sponsors, we are helping to curb this public health epidemic. 
Adjusted SG&A decreased by 15% year-over-year. As discussed throughout this year, we remain firmly committed to expense management. As mentioned in prior quarters, we had onetime charges realized in the first half of 2016 that did not repeat, helping to reduce third quarter selling, general and administrative expenses. We are also seeing lower depreciation and amortization as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated in July. Finally, with lower volumes, incentive compensation was lower during the quarter. 
In the third quarter, we also generated $1.9 billion of EBITDA resulting in EBITDA per adjusted Rx of $6.24, representing growth of 13% year-over-year despite the headwind of both the Coventry and Catamaran business rolling off our books on 1/1/16, which we'll discuss further on our next slide. 
In addition, we delivered strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion during the quarter and settled the 2016 accelerated share repurchase program, receiving 6.2 million additional shares. 
Now to our 2016 guidance. With 1 quarter remaining, we are narrowing our guidance to an adjusted earnings per diluted share range of $6.36 to $6.42. This range raises the midpoint to $6.39 and represents growth of 15% to 16% year-over-year. 
There are a few other guidance revisions I also want to discuss. We are decreasing the midpoint of our adjusted SG&A range by $10 million, which represents a decrease of approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. As a leadership team, we are very pleased with the work our teams have done in the past year with regard to expense management, driving towards being a cost leader in our industry. The 2016 guidance does imply that adjusted SG&A will increase in the fourth quarter. This upward trend is to prepare for a strong 1/1 implementation and to invest in innovative offerings to our clients, such as continuing to build on our SafeguardRX programs. 
We are also decreasing the midpoint of our EBITDA range by $50 million, which represents growth of approximately 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. Going into 2016, we were faced with 2 large headwinds due to acquisitions, with both the Coventry and Catamaran businesses rolling off our books. The Catamaran drug formulary management business is coming in below forecast due to an accelerated roll-off. Also, as I indicated earlier, our volume is being impacted by a greater- and faster-than-expected roll-off of the Coventry lives, and the volume impact now represents a 4% loss of adjusted claims. 
Despite these challenges, we were successful at retaining our clients and taking on new business in 2016 to overcome the headwinds and grow EBITDA by 3%. The growth came from leveraging our key growth drivers: supply chain management, specialty in mail, all fueled by the adoption of our cost savings tools by our clients. Specific to supply chain management, we are realizing growth due to cost savings from generics, including both branded drugs coming off patent, as well as the lower cost to generics procured through our GPO for our home delivery pharmacy business. 
We are also seeing an increase driven by greater adoption of our clinical tools. As shown in the table, our total adjusted claims midpoint remained relatively consistent with the prior guidance despite the increase in Coventry claims rolling off. Bottom line is that our core business is performing despite the headwinds we have faced throughout the year. 
Finally, due to our deployment of cash, we expect share repurchases in the fourth quarter of between 750 million to 1 billion. The impact of our share repurchase program more than offsets the forecasted reduction in our EBITDA range, resulting in a $0.01 increase at the midpoint of our EPS range. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.84 to $1.90. 
Finally, in regards to the 2017 outlook, we plan to release our 2017 guidance before the market opens on December 14. 
I will now turn it back over to Tim for some closing comments."

A year ago, I said there was never a better time to be in our business given market needs. That is more true today than ever. In the 18 years I've been in this business, value creation has expanded from mail service, from rebates to generics to specialty and now indication- and outcomes-based pricing. The point is we have always created and delivered value to payers and patients. It's why we exist. 
To deliver meaningful long-term value in today's marketplace, it takes specialized care and unique, sometimes challenging, relationships with manufacturers and retailers, along with a willingness to take bold actions to drive greater efficiencies. In short, it takes Express Scripts. We have transformed the supply chain. Pharma comes to us to partner on value-based approaches, proactively tying reimbursement to performance. 
As I mentioned earlier, just this past month, we announced 2 clinically-based solutions in inflammatory conditions and diabetes and also a retail pharmacy change with one of our largest clients, moving market share to deliver major savings with minimal disruption. We are an aligned, focused market force that improves health care while driving down costs. We're respected and rewarded for our bold actions by those who follow our industry and by those who need the value we offer, our clients. This year, we expect retention to be between 97% and 98%, near an all-time high. 
In addition to our high client retention, we are pleased with this year's new sales results, with new named sales exceeding our client retention losses excluding Coventry. That validation of our business model's alignment, appreciation of our innovative solutions and recognition from our clients that with Express Scripts as their PBM, they are more likely to achieve their goals and we are more likely to achieve our goals today and into the future. 
Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Thank you."

And so -- but I don't expect to see change overnight. I think you're going to continue to see brands competing with each other for access to formularies, and the way that they're going to do that is to continue to retrospectively discount or retroactively discount through rebates. But I do -- I like very much the fact that even in some place as difficult to manage as oncology, we now have 3 different classes where we're working with manufacturers to get our clients more precision in terms of either how the drugs are reimbursed or getting their money back if patients drop off of therapy and those sorts of things.

In either case, we have to demonstrate to our clients that we're bringing value to the table. And I believe we're in a position to continue to do that.

So that's been the big driver. But also, just from an overall SG&A perspective, department by department, we've gone through and have been very, very focused on being efficient, productive and taking out non-value-add work across our business. So you're seeing a lot of benefit of that coming to fruition as we expected in the second half of the year. I'll just point out also that there were 2 -- a couple of items in the first 2 quarters that were onetime items that drove higher numbers. So you're seeing a little more drop as a result of that. And also, as I commented in my script, volumes were off a little bit. We have internal and stretch incentive programs that -- some of those weren't met in the quarter. So incentive compensation is lower. Fully expect folks to hit those in the fourth quarter, so I expect that to be up. But more so, the fourth quarter driver is we have a lot of 1/1 new installs that we've got to invest in, in the fourth quarter. So you will see a ramp-up. And I think if you do the math from our guidance range, you'll see that. But I expect, absent the onetimes, our SG&A trend to be sustainable.

If you look at the Market Events Program, that's sort of a preemptive enrollment. The middle market tends to like those sorts of things where you just enroll them in our programs and they perform for them.

So I don't want you to be modeling out gigantic numbers, but what I would tell you is part of the reason we have a range on claims in a business that you would otherwise think is fairly easy to predict is, for example, this year, we saw the exchange claims volume drop somewhere between 7 million and 8 million claims compared to our, coming into the year, sort of best guess. And that's why we're reevaluating kind of how we model it now. Again, in the range, it's a headwind. It's directly attributable to 2 things, let me be clear. One is more of our clients have put in our utilization management programs, and so we're doing our job to help ensure that patients that shouldn't be getting product aren't getting product, that they're finding other ways to resolve their issues. But also, quite frankly, again, some of our clients based on either the premiums that they set or potentially even dropping out, saw less lives. And so this year, it was a very mild headwind, but it was a headwind. Next year, we're going to try to give you a range where we bake that headwind in, and that's what we're working through now."

A little over a year ago, we were taking over 400 calls per 1,000 mail service scripts. Today, we're taking less than 250. Our digital initiatives have driven amazing amounts of cost out of our system while improving our patient experience. Our NPS score has gone up a double-digit number of points. But it's still early in the game as it relates to converting those patients to what you'd see as mail growth. I know you'd see sequential growth in the -- a mild sequential growth in the quarter. But I think the other tailwind for the longer term, maybe not even next year because, again, I think that this is a multiyear investment horizon that we have is, in fact, when you take a look at where people are buying almost everything else today and when you look at health care and the position we think we can be in it in terms of the digital and the human experience that our members enjoy, I think over the longer term that there is a tailwind still in terms of minimally our omnichannel drive to 90-day and, inside of that, our drive to mail. It's longer term. The good news is those investments pay off in the short term based on cost and experience improvements. And over the longer term, they will pay off, I believe, in terms of, again, being able to help move members to the channels that are best for them, for the payer, and ultimately aligned with our interests."

First of all, as it relates to TRICARE, the benefit is accruing to our federal government. This is us doing our job. The way the contract is written, it is -- and so the benefit is that we're demonstrating our value. Lawmakers in D.C. pay a lot of attention to what goes on with those beneficiaries. And I can tell you, in my conversations with lawmakers, they are deeply interested in beneficiary experience and in the cost of running the program. And we're demonstrating the ability to continue to drive both of those things, not have them be mutually exclusive. And so from that standpoint, that's how that flows. You shouldn't model in some gigantic upside for us as a result. The upside is we renewed them some time ago, and we're going to continue to position ourselves to grow the program and help them stay solvent. As it relates to Anthem, I don't have an update for you at this point, as you might imagine. What I'd just say is this: I think they're quite busy right now working on another matter. And what we're doing in the meantime is making sure they don't have to spend any more time than they need to on pharmacy by giving them great service, helping implement the programs that they are putting into their marketplaces and positioning ourselves to be the obvious choice for them when they get to the point of taking a look at the marketplace. What I would say also is it would not surprise me -- we believe and think it's probably known that Anthem is likely to put an RFP out early next year. And so you should all expect that, that would be a market event that would happen. They would put an RFP out for their 2020 and beyond business. It wouldn't even shock me if we didn't get a copy of it initially, but we would expect that they would be out in the marketplace with a consultant and an RFP sometime early next year. But I would tell you, again, we're working every day to give them no reason whatsoever to do anything other than to continue to allow us to serve their members."

And the advent of biosimilars will give us another tool and another lever to do that. How it plays out is still, I think, going to be a class-by-class, product-by-product, manufacturer-by-manufacturer set of conversations and decisions. There are certainly -- we saw early on, for example, one of the biosimilars that came out tried to price itself in a way that made it unattractive compared to what we were able to do working with the brand manufacturer. We are agnostic as to who makes it as long as it's a high-quality manufacturer and it drives down our patients' costs, and it creates some competition. I also think that to create -- to talk about a point in time versus what happens over the longer term would be wrong because I think you're going to see evolution both in terms of the pricing, as what we saw in hepatitis C just with 2 competing brand products, for example. It wasn't just a onetime decrease. It was sort of an ongoing set of kind of the market finding a different level. And I expect that you're going to see the same sort of thing in the biosimilars. So we are -- we've demonstrated in the small molecule space that we can work with brand manufacturers to create house generics that are good for patients and good for payers. We've equally demonstrated that we can move share away very aggressively. Interchangeability is going to be another dynamic, and then a lot of that will depend again on the product and the area. What I am confident in is our specialized care model and our supply chain expertise, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, position us very, very well in a case-by-case basis to optimize for our clients their spend in these areas."

So just curious, are you sensing any renewed enthusiasm for mail order within your customer base? Or is 90-day retail still rising in popularity? You touched on this a little bit. But also, the follow-up question would be, do you feel that your current 90-day retail offerings within your network, do you feel that those are adequate? Or do you feel you still need to kind of enhance what you have right now maybe over and above the Smart90 deal that you have with Walgreens?"

First of all, in our customer base, I would say, first of all, there are a lot of our customers, particularly the commercial ones, that have always been enthusiastic and supportive of mail. We do see and as we look sort of at this year's benefits upsells for next year, we have continued to see health plans adopting the mail programs in an increasing number for certain lines of business. And so it's not completely surprising that you would continue to see or you may see some change in that. I would also say, from a 90-day standpoint, one of the important dynamics is 90-day programs that typically are omnichannel or offer both retail or mail, wind up growing both Retail90 and mail to the expense of 30-day scripts. And so to the extent that both we and frankly, competitors, have been moving into these 90-day programs offering both channels, it's not surprising that mail is getting fair share. And I think in our case, we're very, very well positioned to capture patients into our program. I do, though, want to conclude by saying that the program that we currently have, I think, is exactly what our clients who have high 30-day penetration and have not been able, for various reasons, to put in more targeted mail programs, is exactly the program that they need. And we -- as you may know, we have 2 different offerings, one of which does include Walgreens. And we're seeing a lot of interest again in those plans, in particular, who have historically not been able to, for a variety of reasons, necessarily strongly incent mail, but they want mail to be available, they want the 90-day program to be available, and they want to gain those savings and the clinical benefits of the program. So actually, I like very much where we sit in terms of the current program and don't see dramatic things en masse. I do think what you saw in diabetes, though, shows what we can do in targeting a class, and we have a number of other classes, as we look out over the next 18 months in the chamber, to take potentially more targeted, more clinically-intensive approaches beyond simply just the channel approach to driving adherence. And you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters. 
So with that, I want to thank everyone for dialing in today, and we will look forward to speaking to you in December when we give you our 2017 guidance."
