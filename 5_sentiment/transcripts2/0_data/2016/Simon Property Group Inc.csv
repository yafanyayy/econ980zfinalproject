We had strong results to wrap up a great year. We opened, started and completed several new development and redevelopment projects.

We opened, started and completed several new development and redevelopment projects. We successfully executed several Capital Market transaction, extending our average term and reducing our weighted interest costs. We continued to achieve strong operating and financial results.
Our full year 2015 FFO per share was $9.86, which beat our initial guidance range of $9.60 to $9.70 a share, even with a net $0.11 loss reported during the year, which was derived from $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt partially offset by $0.22 gain upon the sale of marketable securities that occurred in the year as well as a $0.12 of negative impact from foreign currency devaluations.
On a comparable basis, excluding the impact from WPG's spinoff in the prior year and the net loss mentioned above, full year FFO increased 11.4% to $9.97 per diluted share. We posted record FFO results once again and have achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 14% over the last 5 years.
For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.40 per share included a $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt and exceeded the consensus estimate by $0.02. On a comparable basis, excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the quarter, FFO per diluted share increased 10.5% year-over-year.
Now let me turn to operating metrics and cash flow. Our malls and Premium Outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.1%. This was 100%, 100 basis points lower than year-end 2014 due to the timing of a lease up of more than 2 million square feet of the new space we brought online this year from expansions and new developments as well as replacing the 1.3 million square feet of space lost due to tenant bankruptcies during the year.
Importantly, we are more than 90% leased on the new space we bought online this year. The timing of the lease up on the remaining space to be leased impacted our year end occupancy by approximately 50 basis points.
By the end of the year, we replaced more than 70% of the space loss for tenant bankruptcies and the remaining space to be leased impacted occupancy by 50 basis points as well. Put the 2 together and that's 100 basis points differential. Leasing activity remains healthy as evidenced by the malls and Premium Outlets recorded leasing spread of $10.63 per foot, an increase of 18% and the basement memorandum was $48.96, which was up more than 4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations.
As I mentioned, retailer demand for space remained strong. Retailers who want to grow their business or adding brand extensions and creating new brands and pure player e-tailers went physical locations to increase their revenues. E-tailers who opened bricks and mortar stores experienced increased consumer awareness and subsequently greater organic site traffic and lower customer acquisition costs. We have repeatedly heard from retailers that online sales is directly influenced by the presence of a physical store in that market. When the retailer opens a physical store in the markets, they see their online sales increase and likewise, if they close the store, they see their online sales in that market decline. Successful omni-channel retailers are increasing their buy online and pick up in-store. This functionality not only increases convenience for shoppers but also facilitates incremental purchases and up-sell opportunities when the shopper enters our retail environment.
For 2015, sales per square foot for our mall and Premium Outlets were $620 a foot compared to $619. Comparable sales per square foot for the malls increased 5.7%. We were up a greater amount at the mills and we were down slightly at our tourist-oriented Premium Outlets and up slightly at our non-tourist outlet centers. We have great centers in key tourist locations that generate incredible sales volume and at the envy of the industry. The strong dollar, however, impacted tenant sales at these unique centers, which negatively affected our average rent for the quarter 
I know you all heard about mall traffic decreases. Now let me give some facts based on our internal data across the largest retailer portfolio in the U.S. and not just estimates derived from arbitrary algorithms. Traffic at our malls was flat for the year, including the holiday season. Traffic of our Premium Outlets increased 1.5% for the year and more than 2% for the holidays and traffic at the Mills increased slightly for the year as well.
Up NOI increased 3.7% for the full year 2015 and increased 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter, overage rent declined $13 million year-over-year due to the lower sales volumes that I mentioned earlier at our tourist-oriented centers. The lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI for the quarter of approximately 100 basis points. I will strongly remind you, we do not include lease settlement income, new acquisitions or the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers in our comp NOI -- comp NOI numbers.
Total NOI from our consolidated and unconsolidated properties increased more than 7% to $5.8 billion in 2015. That was on top of 6.7% growth in 2014 and this includes any NOI contribution from Kl√©pierre. 
Now, let me quickly talk as we could spend hours on our redevelopment and expansion at the end of the fourth quarter, but I'll give you some highlights. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across 3 of our platforms, with a total committed spent of $1.5 billion.
During the quarter, we opened 2 significant expansions and completed a number of others strategically developments, including the new faster wing at the llama, which includes the new Nordstrom's and more than 100 exceptional brands, the expansion of the sawgrass, where we added 20 small shops, very high and small shops and 2 restaurants and the redevelopment of fifth Woodfield Mall in Monroe Park.
We also started construction on several new projects during the quarter, including the shops at Riverside and Copley Place. Construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, Stanford, King of Prussia, Woodberry Commons, Gallery in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in '16 and Houston Galleria will go into 17 as well.
Now, not to be ignored, we continued to be active on new development. We opened 2 new outlets during the quarter, in Tucson and Tampa both off a very strong sales start. Construction continues on 2 new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg. Both scheduled open later this year as well as the designer outlet in Vermont, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017.
We also started the construction in upscale outlet center in so Southwest so Seoul Korea, schedule to open in the spring of 2017. This will be our fourth year and we also recently announced a new partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge to develop a premium outlet collection at Edmonton International Airport, which will be our 4th outlet in Canada. This is expected to open in the fall of 2017.
2 new full price developments are ongoing. As you know, what in Miami, opening this fall and Fort Worth at the shops at clear for scheduled to open in early 2017. Leasing demand at both are great. Brickle will be an Air Force will be open air and anchored by Neiman Marcus.
Portfolio changes we sold the shops at Sunset Place and we recently completed the sale of Columbia George outlet and we also recently acquired with our partner, McArthurGlen, the majority interest in a leading outlet center in our trip Germany, Northwest Germany. This successful center is well positioned within the market and had significant value added expansion opportunities.
Let me run through the balance sheet, 2 senior note offerings, and totaling $1.9 billion was down last day with an average weighted coupon of 2.34% term of 7.5. We redeemed 4 series Senior Notes, totaling 1.7, with an weighted average coupon of 6. We closed 23 new mortgages, with an average interest rate of 3.2% and 8.5 years. Our liquidity was $5.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Our fixed charge coverage is up to 4.5% -- I'm sorry 4.5x. And recently, we completed a very successful Senior Notes offering earlier this month raising $1.35 billion at an average interest rate and term of 2.9% and 8.2 years in a very volatile capital market scenario.
Dividends. We paid a record dividend in 2015 of $6.05 per share. This has achieved the compound annual growth rate of more than 18% over the last 5 years. We announced our dividend today to be paid this quarter of $1.60, which is an increase of 14% year-over-year. 
Okay. That's pretty busy. Now, let me talk about our guidance for '16. It's $10.70 to $10.80. This range represents 9% to 10% growth compared to FFO per share of $9.86 for 2015 and again, will be industry-leading.
Our range is based on the following assumptions, comp NOI for our portfolio of malls, outlets and Mills of at least 3.5% and total NOI growth of more than 6% for the portfolio. No additional planned acquisitions or retail disposition activity than what we recently completed.
Continued unfavorable impacts related to foreign currency devaluations which should affect us by approximately $0.05 compared to 2015. And importantly, we are not assuming any additional share count decrease, so on average diluted share count of 362 million. We are now looking forward to your questions. Operator are you with us?"

One of the questions I get recently from investors is the concept of occupancy cost being measured as a percentage of sales just at that mall store. When you are talking to retailers now about the rent they should be paying, how is the conversation going such that you can capture some of those Internet sales in the rents that you're charging them as the physical Mall? Because to me that seems like an important shift in the business going on."

So we're getting the benefit of that.
And so I still think occupancy costs are still going to be very important to the overall negotiation of what the rent they're able to proceed. However, it is important to note that stores for these retailers are part of their your distribution network. And when they look at whether or not they're going to keep a store open, they're also going to evaluate, affect decrease in overall Internet sales might be in that market, and that is a benefit to us not that we have a lot of stores that are risk foreclosures other than through bankruptcies.
And at 12.3% given our productivity, and given we're rents are and what you've seen from history, I mean we still have a very good runaway to continue to increase our rents."

And I will tell you that trend though with mobile technology is in that the consumer today clearly is going to the physical environment, more educated, and doing less browsing and they're going to last store. We think that the store data that you get is in fact, may be it's a little bit not that far off but it doesn't represent mall traffic and I just think the consumer is going to do a few less stores because they are doing less of browsing because they are more informed to their visit. 
But overall, the mall traffic is what we say it is. Our comps sales are what they are. It's so operator driven. You could be in a category where 1 retailer is excelling and the other 1 is not. It's not tied. It's lifting all boots but it's really retail and operator driven.

I think we have to put in perspective how much our growth is ahead of GDP growth. We are in a -- I mean if you look at our results this year and what we did above and beyond our expectations, take out the extraordinary gain and loss that I mentioned, but if you just look at our numbers and the fact we overcame relatively softer retail environment. A lot of things going into that moved toward durable goods an increase in health care costs and taxes and general economic malaise. We overcame our foreign currency translation from outside of the U.S. here. And then, obviously, the strong dollar if you look at our outlet missing I mean traffic was up, outlet business and I mean traffic was up across the portfolio yet sales were down there because the international tourist spend less. It's pretty good execution with some of the headwinds that we've done. The 12.3% the way I look at it is an insurance policy against a slow growth U.S. economy that we continued to will outperform GDP growth. And if it were up 15%, 16%, maybe that's when we would raise the alarm. But at 12.3%, we've got great insurance to continue to grow the cash flow. And if you look at our comp NOI, which is our real number of at least 3.5%. What's the Goldman, Tell me what today's Goldman get their conservative economist to Goldman not the bullish ones get the 1 that you got in the closet was your GDP growth what are they saying to .2 percent, 1.5 I would say 1.5% and we're 200 basis points above that, and part of that is because we do have reasons that are under market and we will be able to continue to push that at the same time, our business is all about repeat business. We got to find a win-win with our retailers. We try to do the best we can meeting the expectations of our growth for us, for our investors at the same time, we went our retailers as strong as possible. That's a very -- it's challenging to find that equilibrium. We do a pretty good job of it and I'm confident we can continue to do it not completely sometimes we screw up on the various ends there but at the end of the day, we trying to find that equilibrium that will satisfy our retailer partner, satisfy our own internal expectations, satisfy our investors, that's why I've been able to -- we've been able to grow our earnings 14% per annum increase the dividend 18% per annum over a longer and of time, industry-leading and try to find that equilibrium.

I think our retailers are pretty sophisticated, adapting very aggressive and I think part of the responsibility of driving traffic to more stores, is the owners is on us, meaning we've got to create an environment, which does and is able to communicate to the consumer what's going on to the mall so that they can visit kind of more stores than they have that they leased it in '15 and take advantage of them when they're in our store. I think clearly as our retailers sync up their information, drive traffic to the stores, fulfill out of the stores, return out of the stores, I mean all that is going to be incremental as their systems get more sophisticated I think hopefully will extend stays and allow people to visit more stores. So it's all a work in progress. We've got to do some of that ourselves. And as you know, we're doing a lot of that.

We also have great experience -- I can't think of a problem we had, Rick. In our mixed-use developments. As we gain more confidence in that business, I think we can continue to do it. But and as you know that so driven by supply and demand and it's so specific to the real estate but we like it, we have good success in it, though continue with it assuming we can continue to produce the results that we produce in that area."

In that only game in town market has too much retail it's going to be hurt but that could be in the market too. I don't think we don't had any unpleasant surprises the not exciting markets that we still own. The only thing that was a little out of the ordinary from our results this year was the tourist spend that we mentioned. And obviously that happened at some of our most unique landmark properties. I mean they can't hide from that fact, not a long-term issue. I hope but the tourists reigned it a little bit. They reigned in New York City, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, down in Miami, north and south of the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso. We have Mexican nationals that shop at some of our premiere properties and you get the Canadian snowbirds. I mean that happens. That's the only trend that I would say it's a little bit different than what we've experienced, not only game in town, which is we are in some of those markets but they continued to perform very well."

So the good news skis as these leases expire. We're going to be able to get them at market rent. I mean that's why we had a little exposure in the fourth quarter because we're not at market rent. We're not at market rent. So even with today's decrease in tourism spend, the important point though also is that the traffic was up, and so that's an important point. I mean the traffic was up. It was really just the spend was down. I think that's just going to be an adjustment until we get where the currencies are little more stable and anniversary themselves.

On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of -- from WPG spinoff in the prior year and the net loss mentioned above, full year FFO increased 11.4% to $9.97 per diluted share.

For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.40 per share included a $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt and exceeded the consensus estimate by $0.02. On a comparable basis, excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the quarter, FFO per diluted share increased 10.5% year-over-year.
Now let me turn to operating metrics and cash flow. Our Malls and Premium Outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.1%. This was 100% -- 100 basis points lower than year-end 2014 due to the timing of a lease-up of more than 2 million square feet of new space we brought online this year from expansions and new developments as well as replacing the 1.3 million square feet of space lost due to tenant bankruptcies during the year.
Importantly, we are more than 90% leased on the new space we brought online this year. The timing of the lease-up on the remaining space to be leased impacted our year-end occupancy by approximately 50 basis points.
By the end of the year, we replaced more than 70% of the space lost to tenant bankruptcies, and the remaining space to be leased impacted occupancy by 50 basis points as well. Put the 2 together and that's a 100 basis point differential. 
Leasing activity remains healthy as evidenced by the Mall and Premium Outlets' recorded leasing spreads of $10.63 per foot, an increase of 18%, and the base minimum rent was $48.96, which was up more than 4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations.
As I mentioned, retailer demand for space remained strong. Retailers who want to grow their business are adding brand extensions and creating new brands and pureplay e-tailers who want physical locations to increase their revenues. E-tailers who opened bricks and mortar stores experienced increased consumer awareness and subsequently greater organic site traffic and lower customer acquisition costs. We have repeatedly heard from retailers that online sales is directly influenced by the presence of a physical store in that market. When a retailer opens a physical store in a market, they see their online sales increase and, likewise, if they close the store, they see their online sales in that market decline. Successful omni-channel retailers are increasing their buy online and pick up in store. This functionality not only increases convenience for shoppers but also facilitates incremental purchases and up-sell opportunities when the shopper enters our retail environment.
For 2015, sales per square foot for our Mall and Premium Outlets were $620 a foot compared to $619. Comparable sales per square foot for the Malls increased 5.7%. We were up a greater amount at The Mills, and we were down slightly at our tourist-oriented Premium Outlets and up slightly at our non-tourist outlet centers. We have great centers in key tourist locations that generate incredible sales volume and at the envy of the industry. The strong dollar, however, impacted tenant sales at these unique centers, which negatively affected our overage rent for the quarter.
And I know you've all heard about mall traffic decreases. Now let me give you some facts based on our internal data across the largest retail portfolio in the U.S. and not just estimates derived from arbitrary algorithms. Traffic at our Malls was flat for the year, including the holiday season. Traffic at our Premium Outlets increased 1.5% for the year and more than 2% for the holidays. And traffic at The Mills increased slightly for the year as well.
Comp NOI increased 3.7% for the full year 2015 and increased 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter, overage rent declined $13 million year-over-year due to the lower sales volumes that I mentioned already at our tourist-oriented centers. The lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI for the quarter of approximately 100 basis points. I will strongly remind you, we do not include lease settlement income, new acquisitions or the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers in our comp NOIs -- in our comp NOI number.
Total NOI from our consolidated and unconsolidated properties increased more than 7% to $5.8 billion in 2015. That was on top of 6.7% growth in 2014, and this includes any NOI contribution for -- from Kl√©pierre. 
Now let me quickly talk because we could spend hours on our redevelopment and expansion. At the end of the fourth quarter -- but I'll give you some highlights. At the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across all 3 of our platforms, with a total committed spend of $1.5 billion.
During the quarter, we opened 2 significant expansions and completed a number of other strategic redevelopments, including the new Fashion Wing at Del Amo, which includes a new Nordstrom and more than 100 exceptional brands; the expansion of The Colonnade and Sawgrass, where we added 20 small shops, very high-end small shops, and 2 restaurants and the redevelopment at Phipps, Woodfield Mall and Menlo Park.
We also started construction on several new projects during the quarter, including the shops at Riverside and Copley Place. Construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties, including Roosevelt Field, Stanford, King of Prussia, Woodbury Commons, The Galleria in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in '16, and Houston Galleria will go into '17 as well.
Now on the -- not to be ignored, we continue to be active on new development. We opened 2 new outlets during the quarter in Tucson and Tampa, both off a very strong sales start. Construction continues on 2 new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg. Both scheduled to open later this year as well as a designer outlet in Provence, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017.
We also started construction in upscale outlet center in Seoul -- Southwest Seoul, Korea, scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. This will be our fourth year. And we also recently announced a new partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge to develop a premium outlet collection at Edmonton International Airport, which will be our 4th outlet in Canada. This is expected to open in the fall of 2017.
2 new full price developments are ongoing. As you know, one in Miami at Brickell Centre opening this fall and Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork scheduled to open in early 2017. Leasing demand at both are great. Brickell will be anchored by Saks. Clearfork will be open-air and anchored by Neiman Marcus.
Portfolio changes. We sold The Shops at Sunset Place, and we recently completed the sale of Columbia Gorge Outlet. And we also recently acquired with our partner, McArthurGlen, the majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany, Northwest Germany. This successful center is well-positioned within the market and has significant value-added expansion opportunities.
Let me run through the balance sheet. 2 senior note offerings and -- totaling $1.9 billion was down last day, with an average weighted coupon of 2.34%, term of 7.5. We redeemed 4 series of senior notes totaling 1.7, with an weighted average coupon of 6%. We closed 23 new mortgages, with an average interest rate of 3.2% and 8.5 years. Our liquidity was $5.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Our fixed charge coverage is up to 4.5% -- or, I'm sorry, 4.5x. And recently, we completed a very successful senior notes offering earlier this month, raising $1.35 billion at an average interest rate and term of 2.9% at 8.2 years in a very volatile capital market scenario.
Dividends. We paid a record dividend in 2015 of $6.05 per share. This has achieved the compound annual growth rate of more than 18% over the last 5 years. We announced our dividend today to be paid this quarter of $1.60, which is an increase of 14% year-over-year. 
Okay. That's pretty busy. Now let me talk about our guidance for '16. It's $10.70 to $10.80. This range represents 9% to 10% growth compared to the FFO per share of $9.86 for 2015 and, again, will be industry-leading.
Our range is based on the following assumptions: comp NOI for our portfolio of Malls, Outlets and Mills of at least 3.5% and total NOI growth of more than 6% for the portfolio. No additional planned acquisition or retail disposition activity than what we recently completed. Continued unfavorable impacts related to foreign currency devaluations, which should affect us by approximately $0.05 compared to 2015. And importantly, we are not assuming any additional share count decrease, so on average, diluted share count of 362 million.

And I think we have to put in perspective how much our growth is ahead of GDP growth. I mean, we are in a -- I mean, if you look at our results this year and what we did above and beyond our expectations, but take out the extraordinary gain and loss that I mentioned, but if you just look at our numbers and the fact we overcame relatively softer retail environment, a lot of things going into that moved toward durable goods and increase in health care costs and taxes and general economic malaise. We overcame our foreign currency translation from outside of the U.S. here. And then, obviously, the strong dollar, if you look at our Outlet business, I mean, traffic was up across the portfolio, yet sales were down there because the international tourists spent less. It's not -- it's pretty good execution with some of the headwinds that we've done. The 12.3%, the way I look at it is an insurance policy against a slow growth U.S. economy that we continued to well outperform GDP growth. And if it were up 15%, 16%, maybe that's when we would raise the alarm. But at 12.3%, we've got great insurance to continue to grow the cash flow. And if you look at our comp NOI, which is a real number, okay, which is a real number of at least 3.5%, and what's the Goldman -- tell me what the Goldman -- today's Goldman, get the conservative economist to Goldman, not the bullish one, get the one that you've got in the closet. What their GDP growth? What are they saying, 2%, 1.5%? Tell me, what are they saying, Caitlin? I want to say 1.5%. I mean, we're 2.5 -- we're 200 basis points above that. And part of that is because we do have leases that are under market, and we'll be able to continue to push that. At the same time, our business is all about repeat business. We've got to find a win-win with our retailers. We try to do the best we can, meeting the expectations of our growth for us, for our investors. At the same time, we want our retailers as strong as possible. It's a very -- it's challenging to find that equilibrium. We do a pretty good job of it. And I'm confident we can continue to do it, not completely, sometimes we screw up on -- at all the various ends there. But at the end of the day, we try to find that equilibrium that will satisfy our retailer partner, satisfy our own internal expectations, satisfy our investors. That's why I've been able to -- we've been able to grow our earnings 14% per annum, increased the dividend 18% per annum over a long period of time, industry-leading. We try to find that equilibrium. We have an insurance policy."

And I think, clearly, as our retailers speak up their information, drive traffic to the stores, fulfill out of the stores, return out of the stores, I mean, all of that's going to be incremental as their systems get more sophisticated that I think hopefully will extend stays and allow people to visit more stores. So it's all a work in progress. We've got to do some of that ourselves. And as you know, we're doing a lot of that.

But as you know, that's so driven by supply and demand. And it's so specific to the real estate, but we like it. We've had good success in it. We'll continue with it, assuming we can continue to produce the results that we've produced in that area."

If that's the only game in town market has too much retail, it's going to be hurt, but that could be in a nay market, too. I don't think we had any real unpleasant surprises and -- the not exciting markets that we still own. The only thing that was a little out of the ordinary from our results this year was the tourist spend that we've mentioned. And obviously that happened at some of our most unique landmark properties. I mean, we can't hide from that fact. It's not a long-term issue, I hope. But the tourists rained in a little bit. They rained in, in New York City, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, down in Miami, north and south of the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso. And we had Mexican nationals that shop at our -- some of our premiere properties. We've got the Canadian snowbirds. I mean, that happens. That's the only trend that I would say is a little bit different than what we've experienced, not the only game in town, which is we are in some of those markets, but they continued to perform very well."

And the reason we have a little more volatility is because the lease hasn't expired. So the good news is as these leases expire, we're going to be able to get them at market rent. I mean, that's why we had a little exposure in the fourth quarter because we're not at market rent. We're not at market rent so even with today's decrease in tourism spend. The important point though also is that the traffic was up, and so that's an important point. I mean, the traffic was up. It was really just the spend was down. And I think that's just going to be an adjustment until we get where the currencies are a little more stable and anniversary themselves.

We opened, started and completed several new development and redevelopment projects. We successfully executed several capital market transaction, extending our average term and reducing our weighted interest costs. We continued to achieve strong operating and financial results.
Our full year 2015 FFO per share was $9.86, which beat our initial guidance range of $9.60 to $9.70 a share, even with a net $0.11 loss recorded during the year, which was derived from $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by $0.22 gain upon the sale of marketable securities that occurred in the year as well as a $0.12 of negative impact from foreign currency devaluations.
On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of -- from WPG spinoff in the prior year and the net loss mentioned above, full year FFO increased 11.4% to $9.97 per diluted share. We posted record FFO results once again and have achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 14% over the last 5 years.
For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.40 per share included a $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt and exceeded the consensus estimate by $0.02. On a comparable basis, excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the quarter, FFO per diluted share increased 10.5% year-over-year.
Now let me turn to operating metrics and cash flow. Our Malls and Premium Outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.1%. This was 100% -- 100 basis points lower than year-end 2014 due to the timing of a lease-up of more than 2 million square feet of new space we brought online this year from expansions and new developments as well as replacing the 1.3 million square feet of space lost due to tenant bankruptcies during the year.
Importantly, we are more than 90% leased on the new space we brought online this year. The timing of the lease-up on the remaining space to be leased impacted our year-end occupancy by approximately 50 basis points.
By the end of the year, we replaced more than 70% of the space lost to tenant bankruptcies, and the remaining space to be leased impacted occupancy by 50 basis points as well. Put the 2 together and that's the 100 basis point differential. 
Leasing activity remains healthy as evidenced by the Mall and Premium Outlets' recorded leasing spreads of $10.62 per foot, an increase of 18%, and the base minimum rent was $48.96, which was up more than 4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations.
As I mentioned, retailer demand for space remained strong. Retailers who want to grow their business are adding brand extensions and creating new brands and pureplay e-tailers want physical locations to increase their revenues. E-tailers who opened bricks and mortar stores experienced increased consumer awareness and subsequently greater organic site traffic and lower customer acquisition costs. We have repeatedly heard from retailers that online sales is directly influenced by the presence of a physical store in that market. When a retailer opens a physical store in a market, they see their online sales increase and, likewise, if they close the store, they see their online sales in that market decline. Successful omni-channel retailers are increasing their buy online and pick up in store. This functionality not only increases convenience for shoppers but also facilitates incremental purchases and up-sell opportunities when the shopper enters our retail environment.
For 2015, sales per square foot for our Mall and Premium Outlets were $620 a foot compared to $619. Comparable sales per square foot for the Malls increased 5.7%. We were up a greater amount at The Mills, and we were down slightly at our tourist-oriented Premium Outlets and up slightly at our non-tourist outlet centers. We have great centers in key tourist locations that generate incredible sales volume and is the envy of the industry. The strong dollar, however, impacted tenant sales at these unique centers, which negatively affected our overage rent for the quarter.
And I know you've all heard about mall traffic decreases. Now let me give you some facts based on our internal data across the largest retail portfolio in the U.S. and not just estimates derived from arbitrary algorithms. Traffic at our Malls was flat for the year, including the holiday season. Traffic at our Premium Outlets increased 1.5% for the year and more than 2% for the holidays. And traffic at The Mills increased slightly for the year as well.
Comp NOI increased 3.7% for the full year 2015 and increased 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter, overage rent declined $13 million year-over-year due to the lower sales volumes that I mentioned already at our tourist-oriented centers. The lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI for the quarter of approximately 100 basis points. I will strongly remind you, we do not include lease settlement income, new acquisitions or the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers in our comp NOIs -- in our comp NOI number.
Total NOI from our consolidated and unconsolidated properties increased more than 7% to $5.8 billion in 2015. That was on top of 6.7% growth in 2014, and this includes any NOI contribution for -- from Kl√©pierre. 
Now let me quickly talk because we could spend hours on our redevelopment and expansion. At the end of the fourth quarter -- but I'll give you some highlights. At the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across all 3 of our platforms, with a total committed spend of $1.5 billion.
During the quarter, we opened 2 significant expansions and completed a number of other strategic redevelopments, including the new Fashion Wing at Del Amo, which includes a new Nordstrom and more than 100 exceptional brands; the expansion of The Colonnade at Sawgrass, where we added 20 small shops, very high-end small shops, and 2 restaurants and the redevelopment at Phipps, Woodfield Mall and Menlo Park.
We also started construction on several new projects during the quarter, including the shops at Riverside and Copley Place. Construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties, including Roosevelt Field, Stanford, King of Prussia, Woodbury Commons, The Galleria in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in '16, and Houston Galleria will go into '17 as well.
Now on the -- not to be ignored, we continue to be active on new development. We opened 2 new outlets during the quarter in Tucson and Tampa, both off to a very strong sales start. Construction continues on 2 new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg. Both scheduled to open later this year as well as a designer outlet in Provence, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017.
We also started construction in upscale outlet center in Seoul -- Southwest Seoul, Korea, scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. This will be our fourth there. And we also recently announced a new partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge to develop a premium outlet collection at Edmonton International Airport, which will be our 4th outlet in Canada. This is expected to open in the fall of 2017.
Two new full price developments are ongoing. As you know, one in Miami at Brickell Centre opening this fall and Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork scheduled to open in early 2017. Leasing demand at both are great. Brickell will be anchored by Saks. Clearfork will be open-air and anchored by Neiman Marcus.
Portfolio changes. We sold The Shops at Sunset Place, and we recently completed the sale of Columbia Gorge Outlet. And we also recently acquired with our partner, McArthurGlen, the majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany, Northwest Germany. This successful center is well-positioned within the market and has significant value-added expansion opportunities.
Let me run through the balance sheet. Two senior note offerings and -- totaling $1.9 billion was done last year, with an average weighted coupon of 2.34%, term of 7.5. We redeemed 4 series of senior notes totaling 1.7, with an weighted average coupon of 6%. We closed 23 new mortgages, with an average interest rate of 3.2% and 8.5 years. Our liquidity was $5.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Our fixed charge coverage is up to 4.5% -- or, I'm sorry, 4.5x. And recently, we completed a very successful senior notes offering earlier this month, raising $1.35 billion at an average interest rate and term of 2.9% at 8.2 years in a very volatile capital market scenario.
Dividends. We paid a record dividend in 2015 of $6.05 per share. This has achieved the compound annual growth rate of more than 18% over the last 5 years. We announced our dividend today to be paid this quarter of $1.60, which is an increase of 14% year-over-year. 
Okay. That's pretty busy. Now let me talk about our guidance for '16. It's $10.70 to $10.80. This range represents 9% to 10% growth compared to the FFO per share of $9.86 for 2015 and, again, will be industry-leading.
Our range is based on the following assumptions: comp NOI for our portfolio of Malls, Outlets and Mills of at least 3.5% and total NOI growth of more than 6% for the portfolio. No additional planned acquisition or retail disposition activity than what we recently completed. Continued unfavorable impacts related to foreign currency devaluations, which should affect us by approximately $0.05 compared to 2015. And importantly, we are not assuming any additional share count decrease, so on average, diluted share count of 362 million. 
We are now looking forward to your questions. Operator, are you with us?"

One of the questions I get recently from investors is the concept of occupancy costs being measured as a percentage of sales just at that mall store. When you're talking to retailers now about the rent they should be paying, how is the conversation going such that you can capture some of those Internet sales in the rents that you're charging them at the physical mall? Because to me, that seems like an important shift in the business going on."

But we're -- we are including anything -- any sale that comes from their store, and it could be driven by the Internet, is in our sales that come from that store. So we're getting the benefit of that. And so I still think occupancy costs are still going to be very important to the overall negotiation of what the rent they're able to proceed. However, it is important to note that stores for these retailers are part of their distribution network. And when they look at whether or not they're going to keep a store open, they're also going to affect -- evaluate what their decrease in overall Internet sales might be in that market. And that is a benefit to us, not that we have a lot of stores that are at risk for closures, other than through bankruptcies. So -- and at 12.3%, given our productivity and given where our rents are and what you've seen from the history, I mean, we've got -- we still have a very good runway to continue to increase our rents."

And I will tell you, the trend though with mobile technology is that the consumer today clearly is going to the physical environment more educated, they're doing less browsing and they're going to less stores. So we think that the store data that you get is, in fact, maybe it's a little bit not that far off, but it doesn't represent mall traffic. And I just think the consumer is going to a few less stores because they are doing less browsing because they're more informed prior to their visit. But overall, the mall traffic is what we say it is. Our comp sales are what they are. And it's so operator-driven. You could be in a category where 1 retailer is excelling and another one's not. And it is -- it's not a tide that's lifting all boats, but it's really retail and operator-driven.

So again, it's specific and it's all about creating the right environment and experience. And, in some cases, having department store as part of that is vital, i.e., take Del Amo with Nordstrom. They built a fantastic store. It is so complementary to what we've done. We couldn't be prouder of that redevelopment and that Nordstrom store and the environment it's helping us create. In other cases, the vendor, we had a Saks store at Riverside. They don't do well in New Jersey all -- at all.

And I think we have to put in perspective how much our growth is ahead of GDP growth. I mean, we are in a -- I mean, if you look at our results this year and what we did above and beyond our expectations, but take out the extraordinary gain and loss that I mentioned, but if you just look at our numbers and the fact we overcame relatively softer retail environment, a lot of things going into that moved toward durable goods and increase in health care costs and taxes and general economic malaise. We overcame our foreign currency translation from outside of the U.S. here. And then, obviously, the strong dollar, if you look at our Outlet business, I mean, traffic was up across the portfolio, yet sales were down there because the international tourists spent less. It's not -- it's pretty good execution with some of the headwinds that we've done. The 12.3%, the way I look at it is an insurance policy against a slow growth U.S. economy that we continued to well outperform GDP growth. And if it were up 15%, 16%, maybe that's when we would raise the alarm. But at 12.3%, we've got great insurance to continue to grow the cash flow. And if you look at our comp NOI, which is a real number, okay, which is a real number of at least 3.5%, and what's the Goldman -- tell me what the Goldman -- today's Goldman, get the conservative economist to Goldman, not the bullish one, get the one that you've got in the closet. What's their GDP growth? What are they saying, 2%, 1.5%? Tell me, what are they saying, Caitlin? I want to say 1.5%. I mean, we're 2.5 -- we're 200 basis points above that. And part of that is because we do have leases that are under market, and we'll be able to continue to push that. At the same time, our business is all about repeat business. We've got to find a win-win with our retailers. We try to do the best we can, meeting the expectations of our growth for us, for our investors. At the same time, we want our retailers as strong as possible. It's a very -- it's challenging to find that equilibrium. We do a pretty good job of it. And I'm confident we can continue to do it, not completely, sometimes we screw up on -- at all the various ends there. But at the end of the day, we try to find that equilibrium that will satisfy our retailer partner, satisfy our own internal expectations, satisfy our investors. That's why I've been able to -- we've been able to grow our earnings 14% per annum, increased the dividend 18% per annum over a long period of time, industry-leading. We try to find that equilibrium.

I think our retailers are pretty sophisticated, adapting very aggressive. And I think part of the responsibility of driving traffic to more stores is on -- the onus is on us, meaning we've got to create an environment which does and is able to communicate to the consumer what's going on in the mall so that they can visit kind of more stores than they have and that they leased in '15 and take advantage of them when they're in our store. And I think, clearly, as our retailers sync up their information, drive traffic to the stores, fulfill out of the stores, return out of the stores, I mean, all of that's going to be incremental as their systems get more sophisticated that I think hopefully will extend stays and allow people to visit more stores. So it's all a work in progress. We've got to do some of that ourselves. And as you know, we're doing a lot of that.

But if you look at Kl√©pierre, McArthurGlen, our own development in Japan, Korea, Canada, home run. We've also had great experience, and I can't think of a problem we've had, Rick, in our mixed-use developments. So as we gain more confidence in that business, I think we'll continue to do it.

If that's the only game in town market has too much retail, it's going to be hurt, but that could be in a nay market, too. I don't think we had any real unpleasant surprises and -- the not exciting markets that we still own. The only thing that was a little out of the ordinary from our results this year was the tourist spend that we've mentioned. And obviously that happened at some of our most unique landmark properties. I mean, we can't hide from that fact. It's not a long-term issue, I hope. But the tourists reign in a little bit. They reigned in, in New York City, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, down in Miami, north and south of the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso. And we had Mexican nationals that shop at our -- some of our premier properties. We've got the Canadian snowbirds. I mean, that happens. That's the only trend that I would say is a little bit different than what we've experienced, not the only game in town, which is we are in some of those markets, but they continue to perform very well."

The important point though also is that the traffic was up, and so that's an important point. I mean, the traffic was up. It was really just the spend was down.

We opened, started and completed several new development and redevelopment projects. We successfully executed several capital market transaction, extending our average term and reducing our weighted interest costs. We continued to achieve strong operating and financial results.
Our full year 2015 FFO per share was $9.86, which beat our initial guidance range of $9.60 to $9.70 a share, even with a net $0.11 loss recorded during the year, which was derived from $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by $0.22 gain upon the sale of marketable securities that occurred in the year as well as a $0.12 of negative impact from foreign currency devaluations.
On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of -- from WPG spinoff in the prior year and the net loss mentioned above, full year FFO increased 11.4% to $9.97 per diluted share. We posted record FFO results once again and have achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 14% over the last 5 years.
For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.40 per share included a $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt and exceeded the consensus estimate by $0.02. On a comparable basis, excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the quarter, FFO per diluted share increased 10.5% year-over-year.
Now let me turn to operating metrics and cash flow. Our Malls and Premium Outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.1%. This was 100% -- 100 basis points lower than year-end 2014 due to the timing of a lease-up of more than 2 million square feet of new space we brought online this year from expansions and new developments as well as replacing the 1.3 million square feet of space lost due to tenant bankruptcies during the year.
Importantly, we are more than 90% leased on the new space we brought online this year. The timing of the lease-up on the remaining space to be leased impacted our year-end occupancy by approximately 50 basis points.
By the end of the year, we replaced more than 70% of the space lost to tenant bankruptcies, and the remaining space to be leased impacted occupancy by 50 basis points as well. Put the 2 together and that's the 100 basis point differential. 
Leasing activity remains healthy as evidenced by the Mall and Premium Outlets' recorded leasing spreads of $10.62 per foot, an increase of 18%, and the base minimum rent was $48.96, which was up more than 4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations.
As I mentioned, retailer demand for space remained strong. Retailers who want to grow their business are adding brand extensions and creating new brands and pureplay e-tailers want physical locations to increase their revenues. E-tailers who opened bricks and mortar stores experienced increased consumer awareness and subsequently greater organic site traffic and lower customer acquisition costs. We have repeatedly heard from retailers that online sales is directly influenced by the presence of a physical store in that market. When a retailer opens a physical store in a market, they see their online sales increase and, likewise, if they close the store, they see their online sales in that market decline. Successful omni-channel retailers are increasing their buy online and pick up in store. This functionality not only increases convenience for shoppers but also facilitates incremental purchases and up-sell opportunities when the shopper enters our retail environment.
For 2015, sales per square foot for our Mall and Premium Outlets were $620 a foot compared to $619. Comparable sales per square foot for the Malls increased 5.7%. We were up a greater amount at The Mills, and we were down slightly at our tourist-oriented Premium Outlets and up slightly at our non-tourist outlet centers. We have great centers in key tourist locations that generate incredible sales volume and is the envy of the industry. The strong dollar, however, impacted tenant sales at these unique centers, which negatively affected our overage rent for the quarter.
And I know you've all heard about mall traffic decreases. Now let me give you some facts based on our internal data across the largest retail portfolio in the U.S. and not just estimates derived from arbitrary algorithms. Traffic at our Malls was flat for the year, including the holiday season. Traffic at our Premium Outlets increased 1.5% for the year and more than 2% for the holidays. And traffic at The Mills increased slightly for the year as well.
Comp NOI increased 3.7% for the full year 2015 and increased 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter, overage rent declined $13 million year-over-year due to the lower sales volumes that I mentioned already at our tourist-oriented centers. The lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI for the quarter of approximately 100 basis points. I will strongly remind you, we do not include lease settlement income, new acquisitions or the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers in our comp NOIs -- in our comp NOI number.
Total NOI from our consolidated and unconsolidated properties increased more than 7% to $5.8 billion in 2015. That was on top of 6.7% growth in 2014, and this includes any NOI contribution for -- from Kl√©pierre. 
Now let me quickly talk because we could spend hours on our redevelopment and expansion. At the end of the fourth quarter -- but I'll give you some highlights. At the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across all 3 of our platforms, with a total committed spend of $1.5 billion.
During the quarter, we opened 2 significant expansions and completed a number of other strategic redevelopments, including the new Fashion Wing at Del Amo, which includes a new Nordstrom and more than 100 exceptional brands; the expansion of The Colonnade at Sawgrass, where we added 20 small shops, very high-end small shops, and 2 restaurants and the redevelopment at Phipps, Woodfield Mall and Menlo Park.
We also started construction on several new projects during the quarter, including the shops at Riverside and Copley Place. Construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties, including Roosevelt Field, Stanford, King of Prussia, Woodbury Commons, The Galleria in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in '16, and Houston Galleria will go into '17 as well.
Now on the -- not to be ignored, we continue to be active on new development. We opened 2 new outlets during the quarter in Tucson and Tampa, both off to a very strong sales start. Construction continues on 2 new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg. Both scheduled to open later this year as well as a designer outlet in Provence, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017.
We also started construction in upscale outlet center in Seoul -- Southwest Seoul, Korea, scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. This will be our fourth there. And we also recently announced a new partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge to develop a premium outlet collection at Edmonton International Airport, which will be our 4th outlet in Canada. This is expected to open in the fall of 2017.
Two new full price developments are ongoing. As you know, one in Miami at Brickell Centre opening this fall and Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork scheduled to open in early 2017. Leasing demand at both are great. Brickell will be anchored by Saks. Clearfork will be open-air and anchored by Neiman Marcus.
Portfolio changes. We sold The Shops at Sunset Place, and we recently completed the sale of Columbia Gorge Outlet. And we also recently acquired with our partner, McArthurGlen, the majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany, Northwest Germany. This successful center is well-positioned within the market and has significant value-added expansion opportunities.
Let me run through the balance sheet. Two senior note offerings and -- totaling $1.9 billion was done last year, with an average weighted coupon of 2.34%, term of 7.5. We redeemed 4 series of senior notes totaling 1.7, with an weighted average coupon of 6%. We closed 23 new mortgages, with an average interest rate of 3.2% and 8.5 years. Our liquidity was $5.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Our fixed charge coverage is up to 4.5% -- or, I'm sorry, 4.5x. And recently, we completed a very successful senior notes offering earlier this month, raising $1.35 billion at an average interest rate and term of 2.9% at 8.2 years in a very volatile capital market scenario.
Dividends. We paid a record dividend in 2015 of $6.05 per share. This has achieved the compound annual growth rate of more than 18% over the last 5 years. We announced our dividend today to be paid this quarter of $1.60, which is an increase of 14% year-over-year. 
Okay. That's pretty busy. Now let me talk about our guidance for '16. It's $10.70 to $10.80. This range represents 9% to 10% growth compared to the FFO per share of $9.86 for 2015 and, again, will be industry-leading.
Our range is based on the following assumptions: comp NOI for our portfolio of Malls, Outlets and Mills of at least 3.5% and total NOI growth of more than 6% for the portfolio. No additional planned acquisition or retail disposition activity than what we recently completed. Continued unfavorable impacts related to foreign currency devaluations, which should affect us by approximately $0.05 compared to 2015. And importantly, we are not assuming any additional share count decrease, so on average, diluted share count of 362 million. 
We are now looking forward to your questions. Operator, are you with us?"

One of the questions I get recently from investors is the concept of occupancy costs being measured as a percentage of sales just at that mall store. When you're talking to retailers now about the rent they should be paying, how is the conversation going such that you can capture some of those Internet sales in the rents that you're charging them at the physical mall?

But we're -- we are including anything -- any sale that comes from their store, and it could be driven by the Internet, is in our sales that come from that store. So we're getting the benefit of that. And so I still think occupancy costs are still going to be very important to the overall negotiation of what the rent they're able to proceed. However, it is important to note that stores for these retailers are part of their distribution network. And when they look at whether or not they're going to keep a store open, they're also going to affect -- evaluate what their decrease in overall Internet sales might be in that market. And that is a benefit to us, not that we have a lot of stores that are at risk for closures, other than through bankruptcies. So -- and at 12.3%, given our productivity and given where our rents are and what you've seen from the history, I mean, we've got -- we still have a very good runway to continue to increase our rents."

And I just think the consumer is going to a few less stores because they are doing less browsing because they're more informed prior to their visit.

So again, it's specific and it's all about creating the right environment and experience. And, in some cases, having department store as part of that is vital, i.e., take Del Amo with Nordstrom. They built a fantastic store. It is so complementary to what we've done. We couldn't be prouder of that redevelopment and that Nordstrom store and the environment it's helping us create. In other cases, the vendor, we had a Saks store at Riverside. They don't do well in New Jersey all -- at all.

And I think we have to put in perspective how much our growth is ahead of GDP growth. I mean, we are in a -- I mean, if you look at our results this year and what we did above and beyond our expectations, but take out the extraordinary gain and loss that I mentioned, but if you just look at our numbers and the fact we overcame relatively softer retail environment, a lot of things going into that moved toward durable goods and increase in health care costs and taxes and general economic malaise. We overcame our foreign currency translation from outside of the U.S. here. And then, obviously, the strong dollar, if you look at our Outlet business, I mean, traffic was up across the portfolio, yet sales were down there because the international tourists spent less. It's not -- it's pretty good execution with some of the headwinds that we've done. The 12.3%, the way I look at it is an insurance policy against a slow growth U.S. economy that we continued to well outperform GDP growth. And if it were up 15%, 16%, maybe that's when we would raise the alarm. But at 12.3%, we've got great insurance to continue to grow the cash flow. And if you look at our comp NOI, which is a real number, okay, which is a real number of at least 3.5%, and what's the Goldman -- tell me what the Goldman -- today's Goldman, get the conservative economist to Goldman, not the bullish one, get the one that you've got in the closet. What's their GDP growth? What are they saying, 2%, 1.5%? Tell me, what are they saying, Caitlin? I want to say 1.5%. I mean, we're 2.5 -- we're 200 basis points above that. And part of that is because we do have leases that are under market, and we'll be able to continue to push that. At the same time, our business is all about repeat business. We've got to find a win-win with our retailers. We try to do the best we can, meeting the expectations of our growth for us, for our investors. At the same time, we want our retailers as strong as possible. It's a very -- it's challenging to find that equilibrium. We do a pretty good job of it. And I'm confident we can continue to do it, not completely, sometimes we screw up on -- at all the various ends there. But at the end of the day, we try to find that equilibrium that will satisfy our retailer partner, satisfy our own internal expectations, satisfy our investors. That's why I've been able to -- we've been able to grow our earnings 14% per annum, increased the dividend 18% per annum over a long period of time, industry-leading. We try to find that equilibrium.

We'll probably assess that at the -- near the end of each year now as we had in the past, but that's subject to change, obviously, with the input of our taxable income calculation as well as obviously our board's input.

I think our retailers are pretty sophisticated, adapting very aggressive. And I think part of the responsibility of driving traffic to more stores is on -- the onus is on us, meaning we've got to create an environment which does and is able to communicate to the consumer what's going on in the mall so that they can visit kind of more stores than they have and that they leased in '15 and take advantage of them when they're in our store. And I think, clearly, as our retailers sync up their information, drive traffic to the stores, fulfill out of the stores, return out of the stores, I mean, all of that's going to be incremental as their systems get more sophisticated that I think hopefully will extend stays and allow people to visit more stores. So it's all a work in progress. We've got to do some of that ourselves. And as you know, we're doing a lot of that.

So I would tell you that all of those, we had a setback in Copley because we're ripping Copley to shreds, moving tenants around, making room for the potential of the apartments/condo towers, so that's clearly affecting us. But you know at the end of the day, I mean, that's just -- we're just not going to -- we're not going to use that as a basis to say here's a little bit of a slippage. But yes, it clearly is affecting -- it clearly affected '15, both from a NOI point of view and a sales point of view, because a lot of these are -- we're moving traffic around. We're closing entrances, and there is absolutely dislocation going on."

I don't think we had any real unpleasant surprises and -- the not exciting markets that we still own. The only thing that was a little out of the ordinary from our results this year was the tourist spend that we've mentioned. And obviously that happened at some of our most unique landmark properties. I mean, we can't hide from that fact. It's not a long-term issue, I hope. But the tourists reign in a little bit. They reigned in, in New York City, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, down in Miami, north and south of the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso. And we had Mexican nationals that shop at our -- some of our premier properties. We've got the Canadian snowbirds. I mean, that happens.

We completed several significant redevelopment projects, started construction on others, announced more that we'll further enhance the value of our real estate. We completed the acquisition of the shops at Crystal, extending our presence in Las Vegas marketplace and we continue to achieve strong operating financial results which were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which is an increase of 15.4% compared to prior year. 
Our -- we had strong key operating metrics, from all and Premium Outlet occupancy was 95.6. Leasing activity remains healthy, which we -- the mall and outlet business had releasing spreads of $10.24 per square foot, which is an increase of 17.5% and our base minimum rent was $49.70, more than 4% compared to last year. Total sales per square foot for mall and outlet business was $6.13 compared to $6.21 in the prior year period. 
We measure our success through growth of operating income and cash flow. We have a unique ability to drive growth through not only increases in comparable property NOI, but also through disciplined capital allocation for new development, redevelopment, acquisitions and investments. And our press release and supplement this quarter, we have provided additional new metrics summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. These new metrics provide further detail, profitability generated by our portfolio and we have broken them out into 4 categories, comparable property NOI, NOI from new development and redevelopment expansions and acquisitions that are not [indiscernible] in comp NOI, NOI from our international properties, which is our Premium Outlets and designer outlets. And then our share of NOI from investments, which includes [indiscernible] HSB global properties and then below the property NOI line, you have the corporate sources of NOI and importantly, for the first quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.8%, of which comp NOI increase was 5.1%. [indiscernible] supplement at the end of the first quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing in 33 properties across all 3 of our platforms, our share approximately $2 billion. We finished the 2-year transformation of [indiscernible] Field, including comprehensive enhancements throughout the mall, the addition of 2-level fashion specialty store expansion with -- being anchored by Long Island's first Neiman Marcus store. We also are nearing completion with Stanford center, including the new Bloomingdale's as well as reclaiming that space for specialty stores. Transformation, is like, these are examples of us adding to our overall profitability. We started construction on several new projects, including the important expansion of the outlets of orange. And construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties and some of the best properties in the country. The fashion Center Pentagon City, King of Prussia, Woodbury Common, the Gallery in Houston, most of these projects will be completed in the next 12 months. Construction continues on 2 new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg, both are scheduled to open later this year as well as our designer outlet in [indiscernible], which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. 
We also started construction during the quarter with our partner, Ivanhoe, Cambridge on our fourth outlet in Canada in Edmonton, Alberta, which is scheduled to open in fall of 2017. Construction continues on 2 full new price developments, one on Miami at [indiscernible] City Center and the other in Forth Worth at the shops in Clearfork, which is scheduled to open 2017. Brick will open in the fall of this year. 
We also completed the acquisition of the shops in Crystal, purchase price was $1.1 billion. We plan to place a $550 million mortgage on that property in the next 2 months, and we're 50-50 partner with Invesco. And we look forward to building upon a high-quality asset with a successful foundation. 
We acquired a majority interest in a leading outlet center in Germany with our partner, [indiscernible]. And during the first quarter, we sold interest in 2 residential properties and one noncore retail property. As you know, gains and losses on our nonretail assets, including investments are included in our FFO per share, which we believe is consistent with the [indiscernible]. This resulted in a quarter-over-quarter benefit of approximately $0.06.
Capital markets. We completed a notes offering of $1 billion, 3.5, weighted average interest rate of 2.97  and 8.2 years of duration. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion. We announced our dividend at $1.60, which is a year-over-year increase of 6.7%. We increased our guidance to $10.72 to $10.82, reflecting very good performance.

So I think our simplistic view is it's not as bad as people want to write about. And I think the biggest issue out there, frankly, is that we have a U.S. economy. We don't -- we'll never use excuses, but I think we have to look at our performance in conjunction with what's going on in the U.S. economy. And the fact of the matter is the U.S. economy is flatline. And yet, we're holding our own and gaining market share with a lot of our properties. And obviously, we've got great tourist-oriented centers that have had a tough year [indiscernible] after this first quarter, we'll probably anniversary the stronger dollar here coming up, but we've seen the tourism sales decrease unnecessarily to traffic. But the media, about the depth of this, the depth that out, we don't see it. Demand is fine. Properties are getting better. We've got supply and demand in our favor, no one's building Class A outlets or malls to any degreeable issue. Certainly, there'll be retail space that's repurposed, which will help us, obviously, supply and demand deflations. And I just -- I don't view it beyond that. The Internet is not [indiscernible] see it. A lot of the CapEx have been spent there, not showing the returns for retailers.

So the good news is that we are able to create -- we've had a few mistakes. So we're not perfect. We are able to generate additional income in this company through all of our activities and I mean, that's been proven. In Q2 of last year, as you know, we had a big sizable gain in the sale of marketable securities. So please remember that when we report Q2. So we are able to do that. And we do look at investments in whether it's hotels, residential. We do look at these investments and we do tend to look at those as ones that we're not going to own for 30, 40, 50 years like we do the vast majority of our retail holdings. And that will flow through the P&L as rightly so. That's GAAP accounting, by the way, which happy to explain to anybody that GAAP accounting. And I do think, with the list of all the activity, you're going to see that episodically, but certainly consistent with how we're go to drive our cash flow growth. Now specifically, we sold fire wheel residential and we also sold South Park, which, additionally, which goes to show you how things can change. We actually did South Park as a condo development. The market crashed. We actually wrote off our investment in that. And that went through FFO. And then -- now our investment in that was not big, so I think it was [indiscernible] of equity, but -- and then we just turned into a residential, not a condo [indiscernible] project that we just sold. The two of them, as I said to you. Now I mean, we thought that cap rates were very aggressive. Our partners wanted to sell. We view that like a set of investments [indiscernible]. And the results flow through this quarter. And I do think we'll have a pipeline of other investments that we don't consider core outside of retail, always flow through in our P&L hopefully, as I said, we embedded 1,000 but hopefully, will be a lot more income and gain. Just like our Simon Venture Group. I mean, we -- anything that is profitable will flow through FFO. Anything that's a loss will wash out. And in fact, we had -- don't get panicky, but we've actually [indiscernible] off a couple of investments that have -- that just -- we don't see the value, plugging along when we took a conservative approach [indiscernible] FFO. So that's how we do it but I'm hopeful that we'll continue to create value in all sorts of different ways, including building and selling residential. [indiscernible]. And part of that project will be condos. I mean, those will flow through in the P&L, as you would expect that those would happen, and they will flow through FFO.

You have to weigh that against what they charge at the store, in terms of corporate allocation and overhead and all that and all that.

And we are not as obsessed with metrics as maybe the analytic community. That could be good or that could be bad, but that's just the way we look at things. We also take a longer term view of the real estate that we do on a quarter-by-quarter and even a year-by-year view. So I don't think that, that is going to do any good, frankly. It's not something we're like obsessed with, what's the occupancy cost going to be in this particular deal, this particular tenant, it's not how we run the business. We're looking at retail mix with a primary purpose that the retailer does well and the consumer likes it. And then if that works together, then it -- then hopefully, it will create the environment that we're trying to do, which, by the way, you're not -- we're decent at, good at, we're not great at, we can always do better. So another metric is just -- we just -- it's just not where we want you to think about us. I want you to think about our cash flow growth, our investment in our assets over the long term and so on. But all I can tell you is the outlet business comp NOI growth is doing very well and we don't see a change in that even with the tourism slowdown that we're currently experiencing. Now we are -- our portfolio NOI grew 7.8%, tough tourism spend and a slow growth economy. That's pretty good work. I can't guarantee we're going to do it every quarter, but I think that's pretty good work. That's what I'd like you to focus on."

We completed several significant redevelopment projects, started construction on others, announced more that we'll further enhance the value of our real estate. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystal, extending our presence in the Las Vegas marketplace, and we continue to achieve strong operating financial results, which were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which is an increase of 15.4% compared to prior year. Our -- we had strong key operating metrics. Mall and Premium Outlet occupancy was 95.6%. Leasing activity remains healthy, which we -- the Mall and Outlet business had releasing spreads of $10.24 per square foot, which is an increase of 17.5%, and our base minimum rent was $49.70, up more than $0.04 -- 4% compared to last year. Total sales per square foot for our Mall and Outlet business was $6.13 compared to $6.21 in the prior year period. 
We measure our success through growth of operating income and cash flow. We have a unique ability to drive growth through not only increases in comparable property NOI, but also through disciplined capital allocation for new development, redevelopment, acquisitions and investments. In our press release and supplement this quarter, we have provided additional new metrics summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. These new metrics provide further detail, in the profitability generated by our portfolio, and we have broken them out into 4 categories: comparable property NOI; NOI from new development, redevelopment, expansions and acquisitions that are not included in comp NOI; NOI from our international properties, which is our Premium Outlets and designer outlets; and then our share of NOI from investments, which includes Kl√©pierre and HBS global properties. And then below the property NOI line, you have the corporate sources of NOI. And importantly, for the first quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.8%, of which comp NOI increase was 5.1%. Please see the supplement. 
At the end of the first quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across all 3 of our platforms. Our share, approximately $2 billion. We finished the 2-year transformation of Roosevelt Field, including comprehensive enhancements throughout the mall, the addition of 2-level fashion specialty store expansion with -- being anchored by Long Island's first Neiman Marcus store. We also are nearing completion with Stanford Center, including the new Bloomingdale's as well as reclaiming that space for specialty stores. Transformations like these are examples of us adding to our overall profitability. We started construction on several new projects, including the important expansion at The Outlets at Orange, and construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties and some of the best properties in the country: The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, King of Prussia, Woodbury Common, The Galleria in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in the next 12 months. Construction continues on 2 new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg, both are scheduled to open later this year, as well as our designer outlet in Provence, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. We also started construction during the quarter with our partner, Ivanhoe Cambridge on our fourth outlet in Canada, in Edmonton, Alberta, which is scheduled to open fall of 2017. Construction continues on 2 full new price developments, one on Miami at Brickell City Centre and the other in Forth Worth at The Shops at Clearfork, which is scheduled to open 2017. Brickell will open in the fall of this year. 
We also completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystal. Purchase price was $1.1 billion. We plan to place a $550 million mortgage on the property in the next 2 months, and we're 50-50 partner with Invesco. And we look forward to building upon a high-quality asset with a successful foundation. We acquired a majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany with our partner, McArthurGlen. And during the first quarter, we sold interest in 2 residential properties and one noncore retail property. As you know, gains and losses on our non-retail assets, including investments, are included in our FFO per share, which we believe is consistent with the white paper. This resulted in a quarter-over-quarter benefit of approximately $0.06.
Capital markets. We completed a notes offering of $1 billion 3.5 (sic) [ $1.35 billion ], weighted average interest rate of 2.97% and 8.2 years of duration. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion. We announced our dividend at $1.60, which is a year-over-year increase of 6.7%. We increased our guidance to $10.72 to $10.82, reflecting very good performance, and we're very please, frankly, with our overall performance, given an overall lackluster U.S. economy. 
And we welcome your questions."

And I think the biggest issue out there, frankly, is that we have a U.S. economy -- we don't -- we'll never use excuses. But I think you have to look at our performance in conjunction with what's going on in the U.S. economy. And the fact of the matter is the U.S. economy is flatlining, and yet, we're holding our own and gaining market share with a lot of our properties. And obviously, we've got great tourist-oriented centers that have had a tough year. I think we -- after this first quarter, we'll probably anniversary the stronger dollar here coming up. But we've seen the tourism sales decrease, not necessarily to traffic. But the media about the death of this and the death of that, we don't see it. Demand is fine. Properties are getting better. We've got supply and demand in our favor. No one's building Class A outlets or malls to the -- any degree-able issue. Certainly, there'll be retail space that gets repurposed, which will help us, obviously, in supply and demand equations. And I just -- I don't view it beyond that. The Internet is not the panacea.

We look at these things more as investments than we do operating properties. That's been our point of view. Just like in Q1 of '15, we had a gain from a development site we decided to flip in Europe as opposed to stay involved in. So the good news is that we are able to create -- no, we've had a few mistakes. So we're not perfect. But we are able to generate additional income in this company through all of our activity, and -- I mean, that's been proven. In Q2 of last year, as you know, we had a big sizable gain in the sale of marketable securities. So please remember that when we report Q2. So we are able to do that, and we do look at investments in -- whether it's hotels, residential, we do look at them as investments, and we do tend to look at those as ones that we're not going to own for 30, 40, 50 years like we do the vast majority of our retail holdings. And that will flow through the P&L, as rightly so. That's GAAP accounting, by the way, which happy to explain to anybody that it's GAAP accounting. And I do think with the list of all the activity, you're going to see that episodically, but certainly consistent with how we're go to drive our cash flow growth. Now specifically, we sold Firewheel residential and we also sold SouthPark, which -- additionally, which goes to show you how things can change. We actually did SouthPark as a condo development. The market crashed. We actually wrote off our investment in that, and that went through FFO. And then -- now our investment in that was not big, so I think it was like $3 million or $4 million of equity, but -- and then we just turned into a residential, not a condo, but just a multi-family project, and we just sold it. The 2 of them, as I said to you -- I mean, we thought that cap rates were very aggressive. Our partners wanted to sell. We view those, like I said, as investments so we decided to sell them, and the results flow through this quarter. And I do think we'll have a pipeline of other investments that we don't consider core outside of retail always flow through our P&L, and hopefully -- as I said, we [indiscernible] at 1,000, but hopefully, there'll be a lot more income and gain. Just like our Simon Venture Group. I mean, we've -- anything that is profitable will flow through FFO. Anything that's a loss will wash out. And in fact, we had -- don't get panicky, but we've actually written off a couple of investments that have -- that just -- we don't see the value. Now they're still maybe plugging along, but we took a conservative approach to go ahead and flush those through, and those are through FFO. So that's how we do it. But I'm hopeful that we'll continue to create value in all sorts of different ways, including building and selling residential. When we do Copley and we -- part of that project will be condos. I mean, those will flow through the P&L, as you would expect that those would happen, and they will flow through FFO because that's how we view the definition of the FFO white paper, which, as you know, we adhere to stringently."

So I will admit defeat, okay? I will admit defeat publicly. We've lost the argument on the correlation or lack thereof between retail sales and our ability to drive rents, which happens, I believe, to tie more toward supply and demand and -- than retail sales. Because as you know, if a retailer's not producing results and their lease happens to come up, we have the ability, certainly, to replace them with a retailer that's going to be more productive. Now as I also said, in the Mall business, our comp sales are actually up. It's in the Outlet business where we're seeing the reduction in comp sales, and that is absolutely, unequivocally tied to what's going on with the tourism picture. And as I said, hopefully, that'll anniversary, and then that base will move. Now the comp NOI growth was outstanding in -- for the whole portfolio, but it was particularly good in the Outlet business. So that -- it is a very profitable category for our retailers, and we have the ability to drive rents and drive NOI. So at this point, we can argue ad nauseam about the correlation. I'd rather not. We'll do the best we can. And like I said, we're going to grow our comp NOI better. Maybe one day, we'll revert to the main, and I'm not guaranteeing that we won't.

And I actually think it's more tied to what's going to go on in tourism and what's going to go on in the general economy than it is one particular retailer sales. And that does not necessarily mean anything about the property. But I've lost the argument. I admit defeat. We'll do the best we can."

So I don't -- look, if the store is losing money, they're going to close the store. That's for sure. The issue is, if the store -- the sales metrics that we all -- except us, but many -- let me restate it, many focus on does not necessarily tie to profitability because a lot of these stores could have very low rent, could be fully depreciated, could be in markets that aren't great citing markets that are growing, but they're -- but they produce a lot of operating cash flow. They need that operating cash flow to make investments and whatever they want to make investments in, whether that's omni-channel or technology or new stores or whatever. So the statement, they're less productive, therefore, they're going to close stores, is not how I think they look at it. I think they look at whether the store has a four-wall profit and whether or not if they close it, what does it really do for the organization? So what is this all going to mean? I think at the end of the day, the -- all retailers have to be profitable. All e-commerce players have to be profitable, unless Wall Street and other investors are going to fund those investments. And I don't have a crystal ball as to how it's all going to shake out. Could it put pressure on bricks and mortar? Certainly, it could, but I think you've got to keep in mind, a lot of these are cash cows that they're using. Maybe they're not investing in them like the way they should or we, as owners of real estate, would like to see them do it. But that -- I don't think that equates to store closures necessarily. Now if they become unprofitable, they're going to close the store, as simple as that. You have to weigh that against what they charge the store in terms of corporate allocations and overhead and all that and all that. And I think, certainly, investments in technology is putting pressure on the retail -- the retailer, and we have to be sensitive to that. But I think they're going to look at carefully what services they're going to need to provide to the consumer, because at the end of the day, they chase that and they can't create profitability out of it.

But the good news is, when we describe to them what we're trying to achieve and how they can play a role in, they're all very receptive. But they all -- they're also all very busy as well. So it's -- for us, it's prioritizing the biggest bang for their buck, making it easy as possible in terms of plug-and-play almost to use a technology terminology. We can deliver that to the retailer. That's a lot easier. I mean, it gets a little gruesome with the details, which I'll spare you and me and everybody else on the call to go into that level. But I think they're being excellent, they're being very cooperative. And we all want to drive traffic to the physical world, and we all see the benefit of that. And we'll continue to experiment and plug along here."

We completed several significant redevelopment projects, started construction on others, announced more that will further enhance the value of our real estate. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystals, extending our presence in the Las Vegas marketplace, and we continue to achieve strong operating financial results, which were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which is an increase of 15.4% compared to prior year. Our -- we had strong key operating metrics. Mall and Premium Outlet occupancy was 95.6%. Leasing activity remains healthy, which we -- the Mall and Outlet business had releasing spreads of $10.24 per square foot, which is an increase of 17.5%, and our base minimum rent was $49.70, up more than $0.04 -- 4% compared to last year. Total sales per square foot for our Mall and Outlet business was $613 compared to $621 in the prior year period. 
We measure our success through growth of operating income and cash flow. We have a unique ability to drive growth through not only increases in comparable property NOI, but also through disciplined capital allocation for new development, redevelopment, acquisitions and investments. In our press release and supplement this quarter, we have provided additional new metrics summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. These new metrics provide further detail, in the profitability generated by our portfolio, and we have broken them out into 4 categories: comparable property NOI; NOI from new development, redevelopment, expansions and acquisitions that are not included in comp NOI; NOI from our international properties, which is our Premium Outlets and designer outlets; and then our share of NOI from investments, which includes Kl√©pierre and HBS Global Properties. And then below the property NOI line, you have the corporate sources of NOI. And importantly, for the first quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.8%, of which comp NOI increase was 5.1%. Please see the supplement. 
At the end of the first quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across all 3 of our platforms. Our share, approximately $2 billion. We finished the 2-year transformation of Roosevelt Field, including comprehensive enhancements throughout the mall, the addition of 2-level fashion specialty store expansion with -- being anchored by Long Island's first Neiman Marcus store. We also are nearing completion with Stanford Center, including the new Bloomingdale's as well as reclaiming that space for specialty stores. Transformations like these are examples of us adding to our overall profitability. We started construction on several new projects, including the important expansion at The Outlets at Orange, and construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties and some of the best properties in the country: The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, King of Prussia, Woodbury Common, The Galleria in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in the next 12 months. Construction continues on 2 new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg, both are scheduled to open later this year, as well as our designer outlet in Provence, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. We also started construction during the quarter with our partner, Ivanhoe Cambridge on our fourth outlet in Canada, in Edmonton, Alberta, which is scheduled to open fall of 2017. Construction continues on 2 full new price developments, one on Miami at Brickell City Centre and the other in Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork, which is scheduled to open 2017. Brickell will open in the fall of this year. 
We also completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystals. Purchase price was $1.1 billion. We plan to place a $550 million mortgage on the property in the next 2 months, and we're 50-50 partner with Invesco. And we look forward to building upon a high-quality asset with a successful foundation. We acquired a majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany with our partner, McArthurGlen. And during the first quarter, we sold interest in 2 residential properties and one noncore retail property. As you know, gains and losses on our non-retail assets, including investments, are included in our FFO per share, which we believe is consistent with the white paper. This resulted in a quarter-over-quarter benefit of approximately $0.06.
Capital markets. We completed a notes offering of $1 billion 3.5 (sic) [ $1.35 billion ], weighted average interest rate of 2.97% and 8.2 years of duration. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion. We announced our dividend at $1.60, which is a year-over-year increase of 6.7%. We increased our guidance to $10.72 to $10.82, reflecting very good performance, and we're very pleased, frankly, with our overall performance, given an overall lackluster U.S. economy. 
And we welcome your questions."

And I think the biggest issue out there, frankly, is that we have a U.S. economy -- we don't -- we'll never use excuses. But I think you have to look at our performance in conjunction with what's going on in the U.S. economy. And the fact of the matter is the U.S. economy is flatlining, and yet, we're holding our own and gaining market share with a lot of our properties. And obviously, we've got great tourist-oriented centers that have had a tough year. I think we -- after this first quarter, we'll probably anniversary the stronger dollar here coming up. But we've seen the tourism sales decrease, not necessarily to traffic. But the media about the death of this and the death of that, we don't see it. Demand is fine. Properties are getting better. We've got supply and demand in our favor. No one's building Class A outlets or malls to the -- any degree-able issue. Certainly, there'll be retail space that gets repurposed, which will help us, obviously, in supply and demand equations. And I just -- I don't view it beyond that. The Internet is not the panacea.

We look at these things more as investments than we do operating properties. That's been our point of view. Just like in Q1 of '15, we had a gain from a development site we decided to flip in Europe as opposed to stay involved in. So the good news is that we are able to create -- no, we've had a few mistakes. So we're not perfect. But we are able to generate additional income in this company through all of our activity, and -- I mean, that's been proven. In Q2 of last year, as you know, we had a big sizable gain in the sale of marketable securities. So please remember that when we report Q2. So we are able to do that, and we do look at investments in -- whether it's hotels, residential, we do look at them as investments, and we do tend to look at those as ones that we're not going to own for 30, 40, 50 years like we do the vast majority of our retail holdings. And that will flow through the P&L, as rightly so. That's GAAP accounting, by the way, which happy to explain to anybody that forgets GAAP accounting. And I do think with the list of all the activity, you're going to see that episodically, but certainly consistent with how we're going to drive our cash flow growth. Now specifically, we sold Firewheel residential and we also sold SouthPark, which -- additionally, which goes to show you how things can change. We actually did SouthPark as a condo development. The market crashed. We actually wrote off our investment in that, and that went through FFO. And then -- now our investment in that was not big, so I think it was like $3 million or $4 million of equity, but -- and then we just turned into a residential, not a condo, but just a multi-family project, and we just sold it. The 2 of them, as I said to you -- I mean, we thought that cap rates were very aggressive. Our partners wanted to sell. We view those, like I said, as investments so we decided to sell them, and the results flow through this quarter. And I do think we'll have a pipeline of other investments that we don't consider core outside of retail always flow through our P&L, and hopefully -- as I said, we haven't batted 1,000, but hopefully, there'll be a lot more income and gain. Just like our Simon Venture Group. I mean, we've -- anything that is profitable will flow through FFO. Anything that's a loss will wash out. And in fact, we had -- don't get panicky, but we've actually written off a couple of investments that have -- that just -- we don't see the value. Now they're still maybe plugging along, but we took a conservative approach to go ahead and flush those through, and those are through FFO. So that's how we do it. But I'm hopeful that we'll continue to create value in all sorts of different ways, including building and selling residential. When we do Copley and we -- part of that project will be condos. I mean, those will flow through the P&L, as you would expect that those would happen, and they will flow through FFO because that's how we view the definition of the FFO white paper, which, as you know, we adhere to stringently."

So I will admit defeat, okay? I will admit defeat publicly. We've lost the argument on the correlation or lack thereof between retail sales and our ability to drive rents, which happens, I believe, to tie more toward supply and demand and -- than retail sales. Because as you know, if a retailer's not producing results and their lease happens to come up, we have the ability, certainly, to replace them with a retailer that's going to be more productive. Now as I also said, in the Mall business, our comp sales are actually up. It's in the Outlet business where we're seeing the reduction in comp sales, and that is absolutely, unequivocally tied to what's going on with the tourism picture. And as I said, hopefully, that'll anniversary, and then that base will move. Now the comp NOI growth was outstanding in -- for the whole portfolio, but it was particularly good in the Outlet business. So that -- it is a very profitable category for our retailers, and we have the ability to drive rents and drive NOI. So at this point, we can argue ad nauseam about the correlation. I'd rather not. We'll do the best we can. And like I said, we're going to grow our comp NOI better. Maybe one day, we'll revert to the mean, and I'm not guaranteeing that we won't. But we have grown a couple of hundred basis points comp NOI, above and beyond the GDP growth because of what -- that I think is our portfolio skews toward the better customer, and I'm hopeful that, that trend will continue.

I guess, maybe, David, somewhat related to that, how do you think about the pursuit of omni-channel ultimately plays out for retailers down the road? Because while bricks and mortar, as you said, is the biggest and best channel today for retailers, consumers do like to buy online, irrespective of whether or not it's weighing on retailer margins. So, I guess, I'm curious. I mean, if you just think forward a few years, do you think lower margins are just a new normal for omni-channel retailers and that's all she wrote? Or do you think retailers ultimately have to effectively price in the convenience aspect of buying online or take it to the extreme? Do you think there's going to be a time when retailers need to restructure and that gives them an opportunity to sort of reset their cost basis in their online business and shed the weaker stores?"

So I don't -- look, if the store is losing money, they're going to close the store. That's for sure. The issue is, if the store -- the sales metrics that we all -- except us, but many -- let me restate it, many focus on does not necessarily tie to profitability because a lot of these stores could have very low rent, could be fully depreciated, could be in markets that aren't great exciting markets that are growing, but they're -- but they produce a lot of operating cash flow. They need that operating cash flow to make investments in whatever they want to make investments in, whether that's omni-channel or technology or new stores or whatever. So the statement, they're less productive, therefore, they're going to close stores, is not how I think they look at it. I think they look at whether the store has a four-wall profit and whether or not if they close it, what does it really do for the organization? So what is this all going to mean? I think at the end of the day, the -- all retailers have to be profitable. All e-commerce players have to be profitable, unless Wall Street and other investors are going to fund those investments. And I don't have a crystal ball as to how it's all going to shake out. Could it put pressure on bricks and mortar? Certainly, it could, but I think you've got to keep in mind, a lot of these are cash cows that they're using. Maybe they're not investing in them like the way they should or we, as owners of real estate, would like to see them do it. But that -- I don't think that equates to store closures necessarily. Now if they become unprofitable, they're going to close the store, as simple as that. You have to weigh that against what they charge the store in terms of corporate allocations and overhead and all that and all that. And I think, certainly, investments in technology is putting pressure on the retail -- the retailer, and we have to be sensitive to that. But I think they're going to look at carefully what services they're going to need to provide to the consumer, because at the end of the day, they chase that and they can't create profitability out of it. That's not doing anybody any good."

We completed several significant redevelopment projects, started construction on others, announced more that will further enhance the value of our real estate. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystal (sic)",798,"Okay. We had a strong start to 2016. We completed several significant redevelopment projects, started construction on others, announced more that will further enhance the value of our real estate. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystal (sic) [The Shops at Crystals], extending our presence in the Las Vegas marketplace, and we continue to achieve strong operating financial results, which were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which is an increase of 15.4% compared to prior year. Our -- we had strong key operating metrics. Mall and Premium Outlet occupancy was 95.6%. Leasing activity remains healthy, which we -- the Mall and Outlet business had releasing spreads of $10.24 per square foot, which is an increase of 17.5%, and our base minimum rent was $49.70, up more than $0.04 -- 4% compared to last year. Total sales per square foot for our Mall and Outlet business was $613 compared to $621 in the prior year period. 
We measure our success through growth of operating income and cash flow. We have a unique ability to drive growth through not only increases in comparable property NOI, but also through disciplined capital allocation for new development, redevelopment, acquisitions and investments. In our press release and supplement this quarter, we have provided additional new metrics summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. These new metrics provide further detail, in the profitability generated by our portfolio, and we have broken them out into 4 categories: comparable property NOI; NOI from new development, redevelopment, expansions and acquisitions that are not included in comp NOI; NOI from our international properties, which is our Premium Outlets and designer outlets; and then our share of NOI from investments, which includes Kl√©pierre and HBS Global Properties. And then below the property NOI line, you have the corporate sources of NOI. And importantly, for the first quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.8%, of which comp NOI increase was 5.1%. Please see the supplement. 
At the end of the first quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across all 3 of our platforms. Our share, approximately $2 billion. We finished the 2-year transformation of Roosevelt Field, including comprehensive enhancements throughout the mall, the addition of 2-level fashion specialty store expansion with -- being anchored by Long Island's first Neiman Marcus store. We also are nearing completion with Stanford Center, including the new Bloomingdale's as well as reclaiming that space for specialty stores. Transformations like these are examples of us adding to our overall profitability. We started construction on several new projects, including the important expansion at The Outlets at Orange, and construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties and some of the best properties in the country: The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, King of Prussia, Woodbury Common, The Galleria in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in the next 12 months. Construction continues on 2 new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg, both are scheduled to open later this year, as well as our designer outlet in Provence, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. We also started construction during the quarter with our partner, Ivanhoe Cambridge on our fourth outlet in Canada, in Edmonton, Alberta, which is scheduled to open fall of 2017. Construction continues on 2 full new price developments, one on Miami at Brickell City Centre and the other in Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork, which is scheduled to open 2017. Brickell will open in the fall of this year. 
We also completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystals. Purchase price was $1.1 billion. We plan to place a $550 million mortgage on the property in the next 2 months, and we're 50-50 partner with Invesco. And we look forward to building upon a high-quality asset with a successful foundation. We acquired a majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany with our partner, McArthurGlen. And during the first quarter, we sold interest in 2 residential properties and one noncore retail property. As you know, gains and losses on our non-retail assets, including investments, are included in our FFO per share, which we believe is consistent with the white paper. This resulted in a quarter-over-quarter benefit of approximately $0.06.
Capital markets. We completed a notes offering of $1 billion 3.5 (sic) [ $1.35 billion ], weighted average interest rate of 2.97% and 8.2 years of duration. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion. We announced our dividend at $1.60, which is a year-over-year increase of 6.7%. We increased our guidance to $10.72 to $10.82, reflecting very good performance, and we're very pleased, frankly, with our overall performance, given an overall lackluster U.S. economy. 
And we welcome your questions."

We've had comp NOI increase of 5.1%. Our earnings grew 15.4% per year. We're projecting to have $10.72 to $10.82. So I think our simplistic view is it's not as bad as people want to write about. And I think the biggest issue out there, frankly, is that we have a U.S. economy -- we don't -- we'll never use excuses. But I think you have to look at our performance in conjunction with what's going on in the U.S. economy. And the fact of the matter is the U.S. economy is flatlining, and yet, we're holding our own and gaining market share with a lot of our properties. And obviously, we've got great tourist-oriented centers that have had a tough year. I think we -- after this first quarter, we'll probably anniversary the stronger dollar here coming up. But we've seen the tourism sales decrease, not necessarily to traffic. But the media about the death of this and the death of that, we don't see it. Demand is fine. Properties are getting better. We've got supply and demand in our favor. No one's building Class A outlets or malls to the -- any degree-able issue. Certainly, there'll be retail space that gets repurposed, which will help us, obviously, in supply and demand equations. And I just -- I don't view it beyond that. The Internet is not the panacea. A lot of the CapEx have been spent there is not showing the returns for retailers. So I think they're going to -- their biggest and best opportunity continues to be bricks and mortar.

We look at these things more as investments than we do operating properties. That's been our point of view. Just like in Q1 of '15, we had a gain from a development site we decided to flip in Europe as opposed to stay involved in. So the good news is that we are able to create -- no, we've had a few mistakes. So we're not perfect. But we are able to generate additional income in this company through all of our activity, and -- I mean, that's been proven. In Q2 of last year, as you know, we had a big sizable gain in the sale of marketable securities. So please remember that when we report Q2. So we are able to do that, and we do look at investments in -- whether it's hotels, residential, we do look at them as investments, and we do tend to look at those as ones that we're not going to own for 30, 40, 50 years like we do the vast majority of our retail holdings. And that will flow through the P&L, as rightly so. That's GAAP accounting, by the way, which happy to explain to anybody that forgets GAAP accounting. And I do think with the list of all the activity, you're going to see that episodically, but certainly consistent with how we're going to drive our cash flow growth. Now specifically, we sold Firewheel residential and we also sold SouthPark, which -- additionally, which goes to show you how things can change. We actually did SouthPark as a condo development. The market crashed. We actually wrote off our investment in that, and that went through FFO. And then -- now our investment in that was not big, so I think it was like $3 million or $4 million of equity, but -- and then we just turned into a residential, not a condo, but just a multi-family project, and we just sold it. The 2 of them, as I said to you -- I mean, we thought that cap rates were very aggressive. Our partners wanted to sell. We view those, like I said, as investments so we decided to sell them, and the results flow through this quarter. And I do think we'll have a pipeline of other investments that we don't consider core outside of retail always flow through our P&L, and hopefully -- as I said, we haven't batted 1,000, but hopefully, there'll be a lot more income and gain. Just like our Simon Venture Group. I mean, we've -- anything that is profitable will flow through FFO. Anything that's a loss will wash out. And in fact, we had -- don't get panicky, but we've actually written off a couple of investments that have -- that just -- we don't see the value. Now they're still maybe plugging along, but we took a conservative approach to go ahead and flush those through, and those are through FFO. So that's how we do it. But I'm hopeful that we'll continue to create value in all sorts of different ways, including building and selling residential. When we do Copley and we -- part of that project will be condos. I mean, those will flow through the P&L, as you would expect that those would happen, and they will flow through FFO because that's how we view the definition of the FFO white paper, which, as you know, we adhere to stringently."

So I will admit defeat, okay? I will admit defeat publicly. We've lost the argument on the correlation or lack thereof between retail sales and our ability to drive rents, which happens, I believe, to tie more toward supply and demand and -- than retail sales. Because as you know, if a retailer's not producing results and their lease happens to come up, we have the ability, certainly, to replace them with a retailer that's going to be more productive. Now as I also said, in the Mall business, our comp sales are actually up. It's in the Outlet business where we're seeing the reduction in comp sales, and that is absolutely, unequivocally tied to what's going on with the tourism picture. And as I said, hopefully, that'll anniversary, and then that base will move. Now the comp NOI growth was outstanding in -- for the whole portfolio, but it was particularly good in the Outlet business. So that -- it is a very profitable category for our retailers, and we have the ability to drive rents and drive NOI. So at this point, we can argue ad nauseam about the correlation. I'd rather not. We'll do the best we can. And like I said, we're going to grow our comp NOI better. Maybe one day, we'll revert to the mean, and I'm not guaranteeing that we won't. But we have grown a couple of hundred basis points comp NOI, above and beyond the GDP growth because of what -- that I think is our portfolio skews toward the better customer, and I'm hopeful that, that trend will continue. And I actually think it's more tied to what's going to go on in tourism and what's going to go on in the general economy than it is one particular retailer's sales.

The issue is, if the store -- the sales metrics that we all -- except us, but many -- let me restate it, many focus on does not necessarily tie to profitability because a lot of these stores could have very low rent, could be fully depreciated, could be in markets that aren't great exciting markets that are growing, but they're -- but they produce a lot of operating cash flow. They need that operating cash flow to make investments in whatever they want to make investments in, whether that's omni-channel or technology or new stores or whatever. So the statement, they're less productive, therefore, they're going to close stores, is not how I think they look at it.

I think at the end of the day, the -- all retailers have to be profitable. All e-commerce players have to be profitable, unless Wall Street and other investors are going to fund those investments. And I don't have a crystal ball as to how it's all going to shake out. Could it put pressure on bricks and mortar? Certainly, it could, but I think you've got to keep in mind, a lot of these are cash cows that they're using. Maybe they're not investing in them like the way they should or we, as owners of real estate, would like to see them do it. But that -- I don't think that equates to store closures necessarily. Now if they become unprofitable, they're going to close the store, as simple as that. You have to weigh that against what they charge the store in terms of corporate allocations and overhead and all that and all that. And I think, certainly, investments in technology is putting pressure on the retail -- the retailer, and we have to be sensitive to that.

We also take a longer-term view of the real estate than we do on a quarter-by-quarter and even a year-by-year view. So I don't think that, that is going to do you any good, frankly. It's not something we're like obsessed with, ""Oh, what's the occupancy cost going to be in this particular deal, with this particular tenant?"" It's not how we run the business. We're looking at retail mix with a primary purpose that the retailer does well and the consumer likes it. And then if that works together, then it -- then hopefully, it will create the environment that we're trying to do, which, by the way, you're not -- we're decent at, good at, we're not great at, we can always do better.

Now we're -- we are -- our portfolio NOI grew 7.8%, with tough tourism spend and a slow growth economy. That's pretty good work.

We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment, and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed the acquisition of the shops at Crystals and we continue to achieve strong operating and financial results and raised our dividend yet again. 
Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, on a comparable basis, excluding a gain on the sale of marketable securities in the prior-year period, FFO per diluted share increased 9.1% or $0.22, year-over-year for the quarter and for the first 6 months our comparable FFO per diluted share is at 12.1% compared to the prior period. 
Our operating metrics were strong as well as our cash flow, Our mall and premium outlet occupancy was 95.9% with 20 basis point decrease in occupancy from the prior year period is a direct result of due to the new developments in expansions we opened recently. Leasing activity remains healthy. The malls and premium outlets recorded in the releasing spreads of $8.88 per square foot, an increase of 14.8% and a base minimum rent was $50.43, which was up 4.9% compared to last year reflecting the strong retail demand for location and as a reminder, we provided additional new metrics, summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI, please see this in the supplemental and the release and for the second quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.4% and has increased 7.6% year-to-date. 
Our comp NOI increased 3.2% for the quarter and is up 4.1% year-to-date. Total reported retail sales per square foot at our mall and outlets were $6.07 compared to $6.20 in the prior period. 
Let me put a couple of things in perspective, reported retail sales continued to be negatively impacted by the strong dollar, some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets reported sales per square foot for the malls was down slightly compared to the prior year period primarily due to retailer and the state sales tax implementing sales restrictions, we mentioned this previously, but it is important to reiterate and excluding the anomaly this anomaly, our mall sales per square foot increased for the period, lower tourism spending continues to impact various retail sales at some of our premium outlets, excluding the negative impact of these high-performing tourist oriented centers, retail reporter sales per square foot for the pay outlets was flat, in fact, our traffic in our outlet business thus far is up 2.65% for the year and finally, the second quarter, I would like to point out the retail sales trends improved progressively with June recording the strongest monthly sales performance with total sales volume at comparable properties increasing across all of the property types. 
At the end of the quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across the platforms, shares $1.4 billion, we continue to expand, transform, enhance our properties. We completed Stanford Shopping Center and over the next several weeks, we completed a number of transformative and redevelopments including the completion of the connector King of Prussia that will link the court and plaza creating 15 new speciality stores, the comprehensive redevelopment expansion for the fashion center at Pentagon City, the edification of Plaza with a compilation of AC Hotel by Marriott and multifamily residential units were also underway with the transformation of Plaza in McAllen, Texas, where we demolished the box under construction on expansion wing that will accommodate up to 50 specialty stores, 4 junior anchors and exciting new dining Plaza, all of these are to creative returns. We will continue to flow and fuel our profitability and construction includes among others, but not an exhaustive list Woodberry commence, Sawgrass Mills, The Galleria at Houston and on.
Our new development is focused on important markets, where demand is there. During the quarter, we opened a new outlet in Columbus. It's off to a great start. It's been a great partnership with Steve. Our construction continues on our new outlet in Clarksburg, Maryland, which will open in the fourth quarter this year, we also recently broke ground on any outlet Northern Virginia, which will open in mid-2017 we got exciting projects in outside the U.S. We have an outlet under construction in France, South Korea and Canada, all will open in 2017. Also fueling our growth. We also recently started construction in, Malaysia with who is our partner in Malaysia and construction is nearing completion at center in Miami, the centers almost entirely leased with 80 retailers and restaurants coming projects and we're also continuing construction of our high-end retail projects in Fort Worth in the shops. Acquisitions beyond Crystals, we also brought our partner at in Naples and Venice outlets, we now effectively owned 90% of these 2 great assets. We completed turning to capital markets. We completed a successful offerings, EUR 500 million at 125 -- at 1.25% for 9 years. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion and have an industry-leading balance sheet as we hope. We increased the dividend 6.5% year-over-over, 3% from the second quarter and we will pay at least 6 -- 6.50%, which will be 7% over last year. We've also increased the guidance from $10 and $0.77 to $10 and $0.85, this reflects solid performance in the first half in our current view reminder of their, we're very pleased with our performance."

I think we have so much outperformed on our spread that number of 15% is pretty damn good $8.88 over ending rent for new rent is pretty damn good, but put that aside, if you are looking to grasp on anything, I would say it's somewhat affected by the fact that we had amendments due to some of the retailer situations that we have been dealing with over last 12 months. I'm very pleased with the spread, 9 bucks is a good number in a flat economy. I also -- you look at our comp NOI, which is where focused and cash flow growth.

So it's always good that being that's spot obviously, and is year we worked really hard to be in that spot, it allows us to grow our dividend, allows us to put capital back into the business that feeds on itself so I think pretty much nothing's changed, Michael business is usually, on the intention of really doing anything with that, other than continuing to relate and I don't think of that cycle.

I think the one thing that your talk about physical retail, we talk about physical real estate and I don't care what whether it's in office or hotel or mall or a center. You don't have a good-looking product, you're not -- your customers that will show up. If you've got a apartment building, the you got a office building, you got a mall, you got a center, you got a physical retail store, if it doesn't look good then it does not have the right services in it, doesn't have the right mix, or clientele, you are going somewhere down the road that is a competitive society that we live in and I think our capital allows to try and we don't, we don't execute this the way I think we can continue to be better much better than this but our balance sheet allows us to have a really, really  good-looking physical product under got a lot of work to continue to make it even better, better and better. And I would encourage anyone that is physical real estate missed his physical real estate another example. That's a good job. You got a have -- in just like you're Boeing and you manufactured airplanes, you go to their manufacturing facility, I guarantee you its state-of-the-art beautiful and that is what they do with their cap."

We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed",935,"Okay, thank you. We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystals, and we continue to achieve strong operating and financial results and raised our dividend yet again. 
Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share on a comparable basis, excluding a gain on the sale of marketable securities. In the prior year period, FFO per diluted share increased 9.1% or $0.22, year-over-year for the quarter. And for the first 6 months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up 12.1% compared to the prior year period. 
Our operating metrics were strong as well as our cash flow. Our Mall and Premium Outlets occupancy was 95.9%. The 20 basis point decrease in occupancy from the prior year period is a direct result due to the new developments and expansions we opened recently. Leasing activity remains healthy. The Malls and Premium Outlets recorded releasing spreads of $8.88 per square foot, an increase of 14.8%. And our base minimum rent was $50.43, which was up 4.9% compared to last year, reflecting the strong retail demand for our location. 
And as a reminder, we provided additional new metrics, summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. Please see this in the supplemental and the release. And for the second quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.4% and has increased 7.6% year-to-date.  Our comp NOI increased 3.2% for the quarter and is up 4.1% year-to-date. 
Total reported retail sales per square foot at our mall and outlets were $6.07 compared to $6.20 in the prior year period. 
Let me put a couple of things in perspective, reported retailer sales continued to be negatively impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets. Reported sales per square foot for the malls was down slightly compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a retailer and a state with no sales tax, implementing sales restrictions. We mentioned this previously. It's important to reiterate, and excluding this anomaly, our mall sales per square foot increased for the period. Lower tourism spending continues to impact retail sales at some of our Premium Outlets. Excluding the negative impact of these high-performing tourist-oriented centers, retail reported sales per square foot for the Premium Outlets was flat. And in fact, our traffic in our outlet business, thus far, is up 2.65% for the year. And finally, the second quarter, I'd like to point out that retail sales trends improved progressively with June, recording the strongest monthly sales performance with total sales volume at comparable properties increasing across all of our property types. 
At the end of the quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across the platforms. Our share is $1.4 billion. We continue to expand, transform, enhance our properties. We completed Stanford Shopping Center. And over the next several weeks, we'll complete a number of other transformative and redevelopments, including the completion of the connector of King of Prussia that will link the Court and the Plaza, creating 50 new speciality stores; the comprehensive redevelopment expansion to The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City; edification of Phipps Plaza with the completion of AC Hotel by Marriott. And multifamily residential units were also underway with the transformation of Plaza in McAllen, Texas, where we demolished a former Sears box, are under construction on an expansion wing that will accommodate up to 50 specialty stores, junior -- 4 junior anchors and exciting new dining plaza. All of these are accretive returns. We'll continue to flow and fuel our profitability. And construction includes, among others, but not an exhaustive list, Woodbury Common, Sawgrass Mills, The Galleria at Houston and on.
Our new development is focused on important markets where demand is there. During the quarter, we opened a new Tanger outlet in Columbus. It's off to a great start. It's been a great partnership with Steve. Our construction continues on our new outlet in Clarksburg, Maryland, which will open in the fourth quarter this year. We also recently broke ground on a new outlet north of Virginia, which will open in mid-2017. 
We've got exciting projects in -- outside the U.S. We have an outlet under construction in Provence, France; South Korea and Canada. All will open in 2017 also fueling our growth. We also recently started construction in, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia with Genting, who is our partner in our other Malaysia asset. And construction is nearing completion at Brickell Centre in Miami. The center is almost entirely leased with 80 retailers and restaurants coming to projects, and we're also continuing construction at our high-end retail projects in Fort Worth, anchored by [indiscernible] and The Shops at Clearfork. 
Acquisitions beyond Crystals, we also brought our partner out in our Naples and Venice outlets. So we now effectively own 90% of these 2 great assets. 
We completed turning to capital markets. We completed a successful Euro senior offering, EUR 500 million at 1.25% for 9 years. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion, and we have an industry-leading balance sheet. As we hope you know, we increased our dividend 6.5% year-over-over, 3% from the second quarter. And we'll pay at least 6.50% which will be 7% over last year. We've also increased our guidance from $10.77 to $10.85. This reflects solid performance in the first half. In our current view, the reminder of the year, we are very pleased with our performance.

That amendment goes into that spread. And if there is anything -- again, I'm pleased with the spread. I think we have so much outperformed on our spread that, that number of 15% is pretty damn good. $8.88 over ending rent for new rent is pretty damn good. But put that aside, if you are looking to grasp on anything, I would say it's somewhat affected by the fact that we have amendments due to some of the retailer situations that we've been dealing with over the last 12 months. I'm very pleased with the spread. $9 is a good number in a flat economy. I also -- if you look at our comp NOI, which is where -- I'm  focused on cash flow growth. If you look at our comp NOI, we haven't just had a couple of years of good numbers. We've had a decade of outperformance versus our peer group.

So again, market rents, if not, I don't mark the portfolio up or down every day like I do a hotel business. That's why we have stability to cash flow. That's why we can withstand cycles.

We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed",938,"Okay, thank you. We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystals, and we continue to achieve strong operating and financial results and raised our dividend yet again. 
Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share on a comparable basis, excluding a gain on the sale of marketable securities. In the prior year period, FFO per diluted share increased 9.1% or $0.22, year-over-year for the quarter. And for the first 6 months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up 12.1% compared to the prior year period. 
Our operating metrics were strong as well as our cash flow. Our Mall and Premium Outlets occupancy was 95.9%. The 20 basis point decrease in occupancy from the prior year period is a direct result due to the new developments and expansions we opened recently. Leasing activity remains healthy. The Malls and Premium Outlets recorded releasing spreads of $8.88 per square foot, an increase of 14.8%. And our base minimum rent was $50.43, which was up 4.9% compared to last year, reflecting the strong retail demand for our location. 
And as a reminder, we provided additional new metrics, summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. Please see this in the supplemental and the release. And for the second quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.4% and has increased 7.6% year-to-date.  Our comp NOI increased 3.2% for the quarter and is up 4.1% year-to-date. 
Total reported retail sales per square foot at our mall and outlets were $6.07 compared to $6.20 in the prior year period. 
Let me put a couple of things in perspective, reported retailer sales continued to be negatively impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets. Reported sales per square foot for the malls was down slightly compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a retailer and a state with no sales tax, implementing sales restrictions. We mentioned this previously. It's important to reiterate, and excluding this anomaly, our mall sales per square foot increased for the period. Lower tourism spending continues to impact retail sales at some of our Premium Outlets. Excluding the negative impact of these high-performing tourist-oriented centers, retail reported sales per square foot for the Premium Outlets was flat. And in fact, our traffic in our outlet business, thus far, is up 2.65% for the year. And finally, the second quarter, I'd like to point out that retail sales trends improved progressively with June, recording the strongest monthly sales performance with total sales volume at comparable properties increasing across all of our property types. 
At the end of the quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across the platforms. Our share is $1.4 billion. We continue to expand, transform, enhance our properties. We completed Stanford Shopping Center. And over the next several weeks, we'll complete a number of other transformative and redevelopments, including the completion of the connector at King of Prussia that will link the Court and the Plaza, creating 50 new specialty stores; a comprehensive redevelopment expansion to The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City; a densification of Phipps Plaza with the completion of AC Hotel by Marriott and multifamily residential units. We're also underway with the transformation of Plaza in McAllen, Texas, where we demolished a former Sears box, are under construction on an expansion wing that will accommodate up to 50 specialty stores, junior -- 4 junior anchors and exciting new dining plaza. All of these are accretive returns. We'll continue to flow and fuel our profitability. And construction includes, among others, but not an exhaustive list, Woodbury Common, Sawgrass Mills, The Galleria at Houston and on.
Our new development is focused on important markets where demand is there. During the quarter, we opened a new Tanger outlet in Columbus. It's off to a great start. It's been a great partnership with Steve. Our construction continues on our new outlet in Clarksburg, Maryland, which will open in the fourth quarter this year. We also recently broke ground on a new outlet north of Virginia, which will open in mid-2017. 
We've got exciting projects in -- outside the U.S. We have an outlet under construction in Provence, France; South Korea and Canada. All will open in 2017 also fueling our growth. We also recently started construction in, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia with Genting, who is our partner in our other Malaysia asset. And construction is nearing completion at Brickell Centre in Miami. The center is almost entirely leased with 80 retailers and restaurants coming to projects, and we're also continuing construction at our high-end retail projects in Fort Worth, anchored by Neiman and The Shops at Clearfork.

We completed -- turning to capital markets, we completed a successful Euro senior offering, EUR 500 million at 1.25% for 9 years. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion, and we have an industry-leading balance sheet. As we hope you know, we increased our dividend 6.5% year-over-over, 3% from the second quarter. And we'll pay at least 6.50% [ph] which will be 7% over last year. We've also increased our guidance from $10.77 to $10.85. This reflects solid performance in the first half. In our current view, the remainder of the year, we are very pleased with our performance.

First, you guys obviously disclosed your rent spreads and those sort of stats and say -- but can you give a little bit more color on sort of same-center ancillary income growth. As you guys have rolled out that program, is it still growing? Is the growth really coming from rolling out more and more ancillary at each mall? Or is it more of -- or that maybe you've maxed-out individual malls, so that more of the growth is coming as you roll out different programs to new malls and outlets, too?"

I would say it's actually in the -- when you ancillary a lot of -- put kind of our SPV effort to aside, we've actually reduced it pretty significantly in our high-end portfolio.

But at the end of the day, we think it's the right thing to do. So if you look at kind of our high-end portfolio, we've cleaned a lot of stuff out, and we're very sensitive to creating the environment where those retailers can do the most business. So if anything, we suffered delusion. And you know how I love cash flow, but I've got to do -- I've got to balance that. So we've actually reduced that, and that's hurt us over the last few quarters. In the Outlet business, it's probably picked up a little bit. So there again, there is an answer for everything, but I think we've done a -- we put in some what I'd call veteran mall people to kind of run that business over the last couple of years, and they've actually done a pretty nice job increasing those ancillary. So up in outlet, down in the high-end malls pretty significantly, and I think the rest of it's kind of commiserate with the marketplace."

34378,367707831,1014671,"Simon Property Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Simon Property Group, Inc.","Executives","Okay, thank you. We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed",938,"Okay, thank you. We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystals, and we continue to achieve strong operating and financial results and raised our dividend yet again. 
Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share on a comparable basis, excluding a gain on the sale of marketable securities. In the prior year period, FFO per diluted share increased 9.1% or $0.22, year-over-year for the quarter. And for the first 6 months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up 12.1% compared to the prior year period. 
Our operating metrics were strong as well as our cash flow. Our Mall and Premium Outlets occupancy was 95.9%. The 20 basis point decrease in occupancy from the prior year period is a direct result due to the new developments and expansions we opened recently. Leasing activity remains healthy. The Malls and Premium Outlets recorded releasing spreads of $8.88 per square foot, an increase of 14.8%. And our base minimum rent was $50.43, which was up 4.9% compared to last year, reflecting the strong retail demand for our location. 
And as a reminder, we provided additional new metrics, summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. Please see this in the supplemental and the release. And for the second quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.4% and has increased 7.6% year-to-date.  Our comp NOI increased 3.2% for the quarter and is up 4.1% year-to-date. 
Total reported retail sales per square foot at our mall and outlets were $6.07 compared to $6.20 in the prior year period. 
Let me put a couple of things in perspective, reported retailer sales continued to be negatively impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets. Reported sales per square foot for the malls was down slightly compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a retailer and a state with no sales tax, implementing sales restrictions. We mentioned this previously. It's important to reiterate, and excluding this anomaly, our mall sales per square foot increased for the period. Lower tourism spending continues to impact retail sales at some of our Premium Outlets. Excluding the negative impact of these high-performing tourist-oriented centers, retail reported sales per square foot for the Premium Outlets was flat. And in fact, our traffic in our outlet business, thus far, is up 2.65% for the year. And finally, the second quarter, I'd like to point out that retail sales trends improved progressively with June, recording the strongest monthly sales performance with total sales volume at comparable properties increasing across all of our property types. 
At the end of the quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across the platforms. Our share is $1.4 billion. We continue to expand, transform, enhance our properties. We completed Stanford Shopping Center. And over the next several weeks, we'll complete a number of other transformative and redevelopments, including the completion of the connector at King of Prussia that will link the Court and the Plaza, creating 50 new specialty stores; a comprehensive redevelopment expansion to The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City; a densification of Phipps Plaza with the completion of AC Hotel by Marriott and multifamily residential units. We're also underway with the transformation of Plaza in McAllen, Texas, where we demolished a former Sears box, are under construction on an expansion wing that will accommodate up to 50 specialty stores, junior -- 4 junior anchors and exciting new dining plaza. All of these are accretive returns. We'll continue to flow and fuel our profitability. And construction includes, among others, but not an exhaustive list, Woodbury Common, Sawgrass Mills, The Galleria at Houston and on.
Our new development is focused on important markets where demand is there. During the quarter, we opened a new Tanger outlet in Columbus. It's off to a great start. It's been a great partnership with Steve. Our construction continues on our new outlet in Clarksburg, Maryland, which will open in the fourth quarter this year. We also recently broke ground on a new outlet north of Virginia, which will open in mid-2017. 
We've got exciting projects in -- outside the U.S. We have an outlet under construction in Provence, France; South Korea and Canada. All will open in 2017 also fueling our growth. We also recently started construction in, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia with Genting, who is our partner in our other Malaysia asset. And construction is nearing completion at Brickell Centre in Miami. The center is almost entirely leased with 80 retailers and restaurants coming to projects, and we're also continuing construction at our high-end retail projects in Fort Worth, anchored by Neiman and The Shops at Clearfork. 
Acquisitions beyond Crystals, we also bought our partner out in our Naples and Venice outlets. So we now effectively own 90% of these 2 great assets. 
We completed -- turning to capital markets, we completed a successful Euro senior offering, EUR 500 million at 1.25% for 9 years. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion, and we have an industry-leading balance sheet. As we hope you know, we increased our dividend 6.5% year-over-over, 3% from the second quarter. And we'll pay at least 6.50% [ph] which will be 7% over last year. We've also increased our guidance from $10.77 to $10.85. This reflects solid performance in the first half. In our current view, the remainder of the year, we are very pleased with our performance.

That amendment goes into that spread. And if there is anything -- again, I'm pleased with the spread. I think we have so much outperformed on our spread that, that number of 15% is pretty damn good. $8.88 over ending rent for new rent is pretty damn good. But put that aside, if you are looking to grasp on anything, I would say it's somewhat affected by the fact that we have amendments due to some of the retailer situations that we've been dealing with over the last 12 months. I'm very pleased with the spread. $9 is a good number in a flat economy. I also -- you look at our comp NOI, which is where -- I'm  focused on cash flow growth. You look at our comp NOI, we haven't just had a couple of years of good numbers. We've had a decade of outperformance versus our peer group. And as you know, when you comp over a comp over a comp over a comp, that's pretty damn good. So we're very pleased with the number. If you want to point out something, which I know it's your job to do, I would say it's more the amendments, which we view is something that we're doing in a very slow economic growth environment in the U.S. And we're dealing with that effectively, and yet, we're still producing very healthy spreads."

So I don't think we're backing off at all our redevelopment and expansion portfolio. The good news is we have such a good number of high-quality assets that we'll continue to find opportunities to expand them. And like I said, I mean, Jersey Gardens and Sawgrass are just 2 simple examples that pop to mind, but that's going to be $500 million, $600 million spread and will be -- hopefully delivered in '19-ish, maybe 2020-ish, and we'll continue to enhance their marketplace position.

Maybe there's a couple of vacancies. So that was not impacted at all. We've got Clarksburg, where I think it's going to be a great development, opens up in Q4. We've got -- in that case, we are bringing in a very -- what I'd call a high-end mix because we really kind of want that to be ultimately kind of the Woodbury. This an overexaggeration, so don't hold me to it. But we want it to kind of be the fashion -- high-end fashion outlet for the Mid-Atlantic more or less. And so there's -- those retailers sometimes getting them to commit to a new outlet is a little longer process because in a lot of cases, they don't manufacture for it, and it's a function of their full-price strategy. I won't bore you with all the ins and outs of that, but that's going to deliver -- we're going to deliver a great mix. And I think the demand has been excellent, and we're going to hold a couple of spaces just to fill out the kind of the unique mix there. And I'd say that the -- I'd say the outlet demand for new product is good. It's not -- it really hasn't changed. The only thing that I would say for new projects is the luxury-oriented folks are taking a little bit of a more -- little bit of a breather. A lot of that because of what's going on with tourism. So that's a little bit what I'd call softer than it might have been a year plus ago but not material as evidenced by the mix that we're producing at Brickell, which is going to be a great project that the 3 partners have worked very hard to produce."

So if you look at kind of our high-end portfolio, we've cleaned a lot of stuff out, and we're very sensitive to creating the environment where those retailers can do the most business. So if anything, we suffered delusion. And you know how I love cash flow, but I've got to do -- I've got to balance that. So we've actually reduced that, and that's hurt us over the last few quarters. In the Outlet business, it's probably picked up a little bit.

And it's all going to be -- the mall business and the retail business, you can have these big overriding themes, but the reality is how it gets executed, really focuses on trade area by trade area, layout by layout, physical configuration by physical configuration. And so therefore, there's no overall answer that other than simplistically I think that the mix will be more diverse. There will be more entertainment, more food services, more other services, and there'll be technology and it's -- enhance the shopping experiences. There'll be more services. But how that all gets computed into one particular scenario will depend differently on the north side of Indianapolis versus the south side of Indianapolis. So that's just the nature of our projects. And the good news is we've got a organization that can figure out, I hope, the north side of Indianapolis versus the south side of Indianapolis and what's right for that trade area. That's the simple answer."

We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed, opened, several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio, and we continued to achieve strong financial results.",1310,"Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed, opened, several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio, and we continued to achieve strong financial results. 
Before I get to some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to quickly highlight our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our performance year-to-date, our current view of the quarter, we are once again increasing our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $10.85 to $10.87, which was higher than our original guidance of $10.70 to $10.80.
Our increased range also reflects a potential charge of $0.08 per share, with respect to our likely decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower due to the rapidly rising construction cost and our beginning concerns around supply and demand in the Boston residential market.
Work will continue on redeveloping and modernizing the existing retail space at the center as well as the development of the Southwest corridor, which will create a new entrance to Copley. We expect this work will enhance the shopping experience for our guests and retailers and further strengthen our position in the heart of Boston, and will be completed by summer of '17. Assuming we make the decision to postpone, it does not foreclose the opportunity to build the tower in the future as market conditions warrant. 
Now let me turn to the quarter, FFO per share was $2.70, an increase of 6.3% compared to the prior year. For the first 9 months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up, 10.1% compared to the prior year period. 
We continued to see strong demand for space across our portfolio, combined occupancy for our malls and Premium Outlets, ended the quarter at 96.3%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Leasing activity remains solid. The Mall and Premium Outlets recorded re-leasing spreads of $6.71 per share -- per foot, an increase of 10.9%, given our high occupancy level of above 96%, the remaining space we are leasing, while not as well located, continues to produce healthy re-leasing spreads. 
And as a reminder, we include lease amendments for the restructuring of leases where we choose to work with retailers in certain situations, pre-or post bankruptcy, such as PacSun. 
Base minimum rent was $50.76, up 4.5% compared to last year, reflecting growth in our rents, our occupancy cost of 13% as well.
Now just as everyone knows, my focus is on cash flow growth, and I believe this is the most important metric for the investment community to focus on. 
Our total portfolio NOI increased 7.3% year-to-date and 6.6% for the quarter -- third quarter. To put our growth rate in perspective, the 7.3% year-to-date growth is more than $300 million. Our result to date keep us on track for our full year guidance of total NOI growth of more than 6% for our portfolio.
On the NOI overview schedule included in our supplemental filed this morning, you can see the various platforms of growth that contribute to our portfolio NOI. 
The diversity of sources fueling our NOI growth is unique to Simon. Comp NOI increased 3.5% year-to-date and 2.2% for the quarter. Our comp NOI results are affected by declines in overage rent due solely to the impact of the strong dollar on our tourists, spending at our centers are active and re -- extensive redevelopment pipeline across all our property platforms as we relocate, reconfigure a significant number of tenants in order to enhance the future of retail and dining experiences at our properties and our decision to strategically moderate the marketing and specialty income in the common areas of our highly -- of our very high-end portfolio.
Total retail sales per square foot at our malls and Premium Outlets were $604 compared to $616 in the prior year period. Reported retailers centers continue to be impacted by this strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and Premium Outlets. Reported retailer sales at our centers outside of our tourist-oriented centers are stable. 
Reported sales also include initial dilution from newly-opened space. And importantly, we're beginning to anniversary some of this decline. As you can see, our recent sequential quarters Q2 to Q3 of our sales productivity is basically flat.
The end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 32 properties across all of our platforms. Our share approximately 1.1. We opened as you know, King of Prussia, which connected the Plaza and the Court. We finished Fashion Center at Pentagon city. We started the expansion of Allen Premium Outlets of 120,000 square feet in North Texas and in the next several weeks, we opened 60,000 square-foot expansion at the outlets at Orange. And we, also, are opening our expansion in Venice, Italy, with our partner McArthurGlen of 67,000 square feet. So we continue to add value across the portfolio. 
Now on new developments, just so happens, tomorrow, we're opening Clarksburg Premium Outlets, the center will offer great retail line up. We expect it to cater to the whole Washington, D.C. metro area. We currently have 5, that's right, 5 outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia, 4 in the international markets, including France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada. All of these will open in '17. 
And even though we're opening a new outlet next week, the week after, we're actually opening Brickell City Centre in Miami. It's anchored by Sachs. It's got a great retail line up with great partners in Swire and the Whitman Family and is part of a landmark mixed-use development, we look forward to managing the retail and as a reminder, we're only investing in the retail and construction continues on the full price development of Fort Worth, The Shops at Clearfork anchored by Neiman Marcus opening in the fall of '17. And these 8 new projects represent around $765 million of spend our share. 
Now let me turn to A√©ropostale. We are pleased to have partnered with GGP, Authentic Brands Group, Hilco, and Gordon Brothers to acquire A√©ropostale. In addition to the existing management team, the ABG group will add significant operating experience to A√©ro. We have a long track record of making smart capital allocation decisions. And after reviewing this opportunity with our partners, we believe this investment proved to be yet another opportunity for our company. 
It's also important to keep this investment in perspective. You've all seen the gross number of $243 million. I want you to understand that $188 million of that is inventory being purchased by Hilco and Gordon Brothers, and not by our buying group. Our initial investment is approximately $55 million by the group, of which our share is $33 million, including working capital. And the only reason we decided to make this investment is because we believe we can make money. 
If our model is right, we think we're buying this company at 1x to 2x EBITDA, with future growth opportunities ahead of it. And we continue to believe that this will be an astute investment, and for some of you who don't know ABG, it is backed by Leonard Green, which has been a significant important investor in retail throughout years, Whole Foods, Neiman Marcus, J.Crew, just to name a handful. 
Also during the quarter, we acquired our partner's interest with McArthurGlen in our 2 outlets in Maples and Venice. We continue to focus on our industry-leading balance sheet. We completed a number of secured financings during the quarter. We continue to lower our borrowing cost, increase our debt maturity, term our current liquidity at $6.5 billion. 
And finally, on our dividend, in 2016, we will have paid $6.50. That's an increase of 7.4% compared to $6.05 that we paid last year. That's a lot. I'm ready for your questions."

Amazon makes vertical investments. The cable industry makes vertical investments. And again, I would encourage -- we decided to make vertical investments when we decided to franchise Starbucks locations 2, 3 years ago. That's the nature of our company, is that we're going to be nimble, we're going to -- we have the right judgment when to make a deal with the retailer, when not; when to make vertical investments, when not; when to go to Europe.

So yes, we could -- we can slice and dice this anyway, but if we can spend more time talking about how does a company grow its portfolio NOI 3 -- there are many REITs that don't have $300 million of NOI, yet we grew that in 9 months. So I would rather talk about that is more material than the fluctuations that have -- that are occurring with operating metrics. We could talk about sales.

Now it's no surprise that retail generally, has come under pressure. Lots of different reasons, which we could go into, but let's -- on this you want to, it's not -- but the fact is -- and we are impacted, as I said, to you before, by our general GDP growth.

That's -- it's -- we're going to act as an investor. We're going to give strategic direction as a board member. Authentic Brands, I encourage you to look at the brands in the history of that company. They've done a great job of -- they are brand builders. They are entrepreneurs. So we are not going to be running the business. We're going to help strategically like we did. It will be -- but -- so I've got my IT guys helping with their IT systems. We've got our lawyers helping with their license agreements. So it -- we have a lot we can bring to the table. And that's what makes us unique. And -- but it's not going to overwhelm anybody's particular time. They've got a good management team, and with our strategic help, I think, we'll continue to make that profitable. And look, based on the numbers I think, it's going to be a compelling investment. But it's not without risk. I mean, it is -- there are -- there is risk out there, whenever you make a pension or a life investment but I can't think of a better team between Gordon Brothers, Hilco [ph] , ABG [indiscernible] to all put our collective judgment to bear to make this a profitable investment. I don't think, going back to your first question, I don't think this is going to be the wave of the future. I mean, AT&T -- I mentioned vertical because I just tried to put certain things outside of real estate in perspective, okay? So AT&T was buying, going vertical. They're spending $100 billion. I go vertical, I spend $33 billion -- million not billion, $33 million. And again, I'm not comparing -- I'm just trying to put these things in perspective, I'm not comparing our business to AT&T or anybody else. Amazon, what's made Amazon great? Is that they've had the latitude to grow critical. They've gone vertical. They've gone content, do gun this tradition, they've gone retail. And that maybe the future of corporate America is that you're not going to pigeonhole -- if we want to just talk about leasing a Sears box that we get back, that's okay, for some companies but that's not what we are about. So again, there's no -- we have no bucket -- it's not going to take away from what we're doing. My #1 priority is to make our product better anyway that we can, technology digital investments look and feel better retailers, different mix and our redevelopment, whatever. However, that transpires and making a vertical investments you're there like an overwhelm us. But I won the latitude to and I think, the investment community should want us to. And at the end of today, if our underwriting numbers are right and there is risk, we are buying a business that ought to be valued at 6x EBITDA, and we're buying at 1x to 2x. And I think, that's a pretty good trade. But we've got to -- we're not there yet, and that's the goal, but that's what we're trying to accomplish."

Sourcing -- look, there are 5 or 6 things that really make a retailer click. Sourcing obviously, expense, store expense, the merchandise, the quality of the, the packaging, all of the stub that I think, at the end of today are going to make a better real estate owners. But that remains to be seen. Arrow, I'm probably getting get in trouble for this, but since I like you, I'm going to tell you. Right now, we're looking at around 500 stores in the U.S. It's kind of the model. And based upon -- we expect everyone of those stores to be profitable. So it's a much bigger business than we initially when in an investment -- we were thinking we could justify our investment at the much lower store base, the fact of the matter is we found out there's a lot more store profitability of their than we thought. So it's going to be around 500, give or take. But I think, store closings, it is -- the pressure for retailers to invest in the Internet to close stores from their investment community is great. I would question whether that's the right strategy, because some of these stores are very profitable, yet they feel like the headline closing stores is the answer and then all of these investment into the Internet is going to pay all these dividends. Fact of the matter is, there is a really healthy physical store environment and mall environment. And I think, all of us can't lose sight of that and that's where we should be investing. So I do think there will be more pressure on store closings. Unfortunately, over our history, we are pros to that I don't need to remind you that the top 10 tenants that we went public with in '93, no longer exist in 2016 and we will be able to deal with it. It's much easier to deal with it when you have a quality portfolio that we do across all of the retail platform that we have. But it's the -- it's the soup of the day. And so I don't think it needs to be 300 or 400 or 500. I think there are a lot of profitable stores that retailers are feeling the pressure. They have got to do something and I would like to invest in their stores, that's something like I would like them to do. But I don't always win that argument. So were equipped to handle that. That's what we do. And -- but I expect that trend probably to continue. Now what we did say when we started this year, our occupancy is up. So put that, Christy. It is up -- so put that in perspective. We also set our bankruptcy store closings would be down in '16. It is down. We had much greater in '15, and we basically more or less leased all of the bankruptcies that we got back in '15 in a flat to tough retail environment. And I think, everybody needs to put that in perspective, okay? So but that doesn't mean were doing cartwheels here. It is we're grinding, were as good as it gets when it comes to grading and that's the environment that has presented to us and we'll have to deal with it."

And I'm thinking, sales are okay, stabilizing, maybe the world gets over all of these stuff that's going out there. Maybe we stabilize, a lot of people feel like we're headed for growth. So maybe we take more space back. But we've kept the buildings full, as evidenced by the occupancy, there is a trade-off. We're on our target for comp NOI increase. So it's not all that bad.

We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed, opened, several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio, and we continued to achieve strong financial results.",1310,"Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed, opened, several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio, and we continued to achieve strong financial results. 
Before I get to some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to quickly highlight our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our performance year-to-date, our current view of the quarter, we are once again increasing our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $10.85 to $10.87, which was higher than our original guidance of $10.70 to $10.80.
Our increased range also reflects a potential charge of $0.08 per share, with respect to our likely decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower due to the rapidly rising construction cost and our beginning concerns around supply and demand in the Boston residential market.
Work will continue on redeveloping and modernizing the existing retail space at the center as well as the development of the Southwest corridor, which will create a new entrance to Copley. We expect this work will enhance the shopping experience for our guests and retailers and further strengthen our position in the heart of Boston, and will be completed by summer of '17. Assuming we make the decision to postpone, it does not foreclose the opportunity to build the tower in the future as market conditions warrant. 
Now let me turn to the quarter, FFO per share was $2.70, an increase of 6.3% compared to the prior year. For the first 9 months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up, 10.1% compared to the prior year period. 
We continued to see strong demand for space across our portfolio, combined occupancy for our malls and Premium Outlets, ended the quarter at 96.3%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Leasing activity remains solid. The Mall and Premium Outlets recorded re-leasing spreads of $6.71 per share -- per foot, an increase of 10.9%, given our high occupancy level of above 96%, the remaining space we are leasing, while not as well located, continues to produce healthy re-leasing spreads. 
And as a reminder, we include lease amendments for the restructuring of leases where we choose to work with retailers in certain situations, pre-or post bankruptcy, such as PacSun. 
Base minimum rent was $50.76, up 4.5% compared to last year, reflecting growth in our rents, our occupancy cost of 13% as well.
Now just as everyone knows, my focus is on cash flow growth, and I believe this is the most important metric for the investment community to focus on. 
Our total portfolio NOI increased 7.3% year-to-date and 6.6% for the quarter -- third quarter. To put our growth rate in perspective, the 7.3% year-to-date growth is more than $300 million. Our result to date keep us on track for our full year guidance of total NOI growth of more than 6% for our portfolio.
On the NOI overview schedule included in our supplemental filed this morning, you can see the various platforms of growth that contribute to our portfolio NOI. 
The diversity of sources fueling our NOI growth is unique to Simon. Comp NOI increased 3.5% year-to-date and 2.2% for the quarter. Our comp NOI results are affected by declines in overage rent due solely to the impact of the strong dollar on our tourists, spending at our centers are active and re -- extensive redevelopment pipeline across all our property platforms as we relocate, reconfigure a significant number of tenants in order to enhance the future of retail and dining experiences at our properties and our decision to strategically moderate the marketing and specialty income in the common areas of our highly -- of our very high-end portfolio.
Total retail sales per square foot at our malls and Premium Outlets were $604 compared to $616 in the prior year period. Reported retailers centers continue to be impacted by this strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and Premium Outlets. Reported retailer sales at our centers outside of our tourist-oriented centers are stable. 
Reported sales also include initial dilution from newly-opened space. And importantly, we're beginning to anniversary some of this decline. As you can see, our recent sequential quarters Q2 to Q3 of our sales productivity is basically flat.
The end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 32 properties across all of our platforms. Our share approximately 1.1. We opened as you know, King of Prussia, which connected the Plaza and the Court. We finished Fashion Center at Pentagon city. We started the expansion of Allen Premium Outlets of 120,000 square feet in North Texas and in the next several weeks, we opened 60,000 square-foot expansion at the outlets at Orange. And we, also, are opening our expansion in Venice, Italy, with our partner McArthurGlen of 67,000 square feet. So we continue to add value across the portfolio. 
Now on new developments, just so happens, tomorrow, we're opening Clarksburg Premium Outlets, the center will offer great retail line up. We expect it to cater to the whole Washington, D.C. metro area. We currently have 5, that's right, 5 outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia, 4 in the international markets, including France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada. All of these will open in '17. 
And even though we're opening a new outlet next week, the week after, we're actually opening Brickell City Centre in Miami. It's anchored by Saks. It's got a great retail line up with great partners in Swire and the Whitman Family and is part of a landmark mixed-use development, we look forward to managing the retail and as a reminder, we're only investing in the retail and construction continues on the full price development of Fort Worth, The Shops at Clearfork anchored by Neiman Marcus opening in the fall of '17. And these 8 new projects represent around $765 million of spend our share. 
Now let me turn to A√©ropostale. We are pleased to have partnered with GGP, Authentic Brands Group, Hilco, and Gordon Brothers to acquire A√©ropostale. In addition to the existing management team, the ABG group will add significant operating experience to A√©ro. We have a long track record of making smart capital allocation decisions. And after reviewing this opportunity with our partners, we believe this investment proved to be yet another opportunity for our company. 
It's also important to keep this investment in perspective. You've all seen the gross number of $243 million. I want you to understand that $188 million of that is inventory being purchased by Hilco and Gordon Brothers, and not by our buying group. Our initial investment is approximately $55 million by the group, of which our share is $33 million, including working capital. And the only reason we decided to make this investment is because we believe we can make money. 
If our model is right, we think we're buying this company at 1x to 2x EBITDA, with future growth opportunities ahead of it. And we continue to believe that this will be an astute investment, and for some of you who don't know ABG, it is backed by Leonard Green, which has been a significant important investor in retail throughout years, Whole Foods, Neiman Marcus, J.Crew, just to name a handful. 
Also during the quarter, we acquired our partner's interest with McArthurGlen in our 2 outlets in Maples and Venice. We continue to focus on our industry-leading balance sheet. We completed a number of secured financings during the quarter. We continue to lower our borrowing cost, increase our debt maturity, term our current liquidity at $6.5 billion. 
And finally, on our dividend, in 2016, we will have paid $6.50. That's an increase of 7.4% compared to $6.05 that we paid last year. That's a lot. I'm ready for your questions."

Now our investors know that over a long period of time, we've always felt like the $5 to $6 spread was kind of always in our -- always part of our model. In fact, as we've done a tremendous job of outperforming that, but the long-term we've always kind of felt that, that $5 or $6 spread is kind of where we think the market is. We had a couple of years of significant outperformance, but we are not backing off our inherent value that we have in our leases as they roll over. And we're just getting back to kind of more of a normal environment. But for us, I don't know about our peers, but for us, we include these amendments and the bottom line is, that is having some impact on the leasing spread. But that $6 to $7 is maintaining itself, and that's kind of what we've told investors, year after year after year and we feel very good about that."

Well, sometimes it will work, sometimes we'll get the space back and certainly in the A√©ro case, we thought the opportunity was even more exciting to just buy the retailer and make a vertical investment that the entire S&P community is doing. Amazon makes vertical investments. The cable industry makes vertical investments. And again, I would encourage -- we decided to make vertical investments when we decided to franchise Starbucks locations 2, 3 years ago. That's the nature of our company, is that we're going to be nimble, we're going to -- we have the right judgment when to make a deal with the retailer, when not; when to make vertical investments, when not; when to go to Europe, when not; when to pull the plug on Copley and when not, and that's why we're in the position we are in today.

That, to me, is more material than any one operating statistic, quarter-by-quarter. So yes, we could -- we can slice and dice this any way, but if we can spend more time talking about how does a company grow its portfolio NOI -- there are many REITs that don't have $300 million of NOI, yet we grew that in 9 months. So I would rather talk about that that's more material than the fluctuations that have -- that are occurring with operating metrics. We could talk about sales. Sales are impacted by the fact that we have great properties in tourist markets and the strong dollar. That doesn't mean that that's going to last forever. And -- but again, there's this high desire to make that the be-all, end-all of these metrics. And again, our numbers are clean. The results are the results.

And I don't think people are dismissing your ability to deploy capital whether it's through developments or expansions, but put clearly, there's been more pressure on the mall business. I just think anything that you can do to assuage the fears about the internal growth prospects going forward and perhaps it's just that a $6 to $7 spread on a roughly $60 or $61 expiring rents means that normalized leasing spread should be 10% and maybe that's what we're going to head to.

We've gotten better at what we've done. All sorts of reasons that we don't have to bore you. And you're right, we may be going back to kind of what we have promised our investor base for a long period of time. And the outperformance, I don't think, from our standpoint, we ever guarantee outperformance from how we looked at re-leasing spreads. We always said, ""Look, it's $5 or $6. One year it might be $8. One year it might be $4, but that's kind of what we see the long-term trend."" And I still feel comfortable that that's the basis. Now it's no surprise that retail, generally, has come under pressure. Lots of different reasons, which we could go into, but let's -- unless you want to, let's not. But the fact is -- and we are impacted, as I said, to you before, by our general GDP growth. And our -- today, our retail generally is -- there's no inflation, and our nominal GDP growth is 1.5%, yet we're growing our comp -- so I mean, and if nominal GDP, there is some inflation. So maybe real GDP growth is, I don't know, 50 basis points. We're still growing our business with no inflation in our particular business at 3.5% comp NOI. That's not bad. It's not 4% plus that we did last year or the year before, but it's still in the scheme of being able to grow our business. That's not bad. And we're -- I'm not defensive about it. I mean, that's kind of what, I think, we should expect when we have, essentially, real GDP growth of 1%. Maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more.

I'm not comparing our business to AT&T or anybody else. Amazon, what's made Amazon great? Is they've had the latitude to grow critical. They've gone vertical. They've gone content. They've gone distribution. They've gone retail. And that maybe the future of corporate America is that you're not going to pigeonhole these -- if we want to just talk about leasing a Sears box that we get back, I mean that's okay, for some companies, but that's not what we're about. So again, there's no -- we have no bucket -- it's not going to take away from what we're doing. My #1 priority is to make our product better anyway that we can, technology digital investments look and feel better retailers, different mix, redevelopment, whatever -- however that transpires and making a vertical investment here or there that can overwhelm us. But I want the latitude too, and I think the investment community should want us to. And at the end of today, if our underwriting numbers are right and there is risk, we're buying a business that ought to be valued at 6x EBITDA, and we're buying at 1x to 2x. And I think, that's a pretty good trade. But we've got to -- we're not there yet, and that's the goal, but that's what we're trying to accomplish."

Why is that the right number of stores for a retailer like A√©ropostale?

So it's very interesting. Sourcing -- look, there are 5 or 6 things that really make a retailer click. Sourcing, obviously, rent expense, store expense, the merchandise, the quality of it, the packaging, all the stuff that, I think, at the end of today are going to make us better real estate owners. But that remains to be seen. A√©ro, look, I'm probably going to get in trouble for this, but since I like you, I'm going to tell you. Right now, we're looking at around 500 stores in the U.S. It's kind of the model. And based upon -- we expect everyone of those stores to be profitable. So it's a much bigger business than we initially went in, in the investment -- we were thinking we could justify our investment at a much lower store base, the fact of the matter is we found out there's a lot more store profitability out there than we thought. So it's going to be around 500, give or take. But I think, store closings, it is -- the pressure for that retailers to invest in the Internet to close stores from their investment community is great. I would question whether that's the right strategy, because some of these stores are very profitable, yet they feel like the headline closing stores is the answer and then all of this investment into the Internet is going to pay all these dividends. Fact of the matter is, there is a really healthy physical store environment and mall environment. And I think, all of us can't lose sight of that and that's where we should be investing. So I do think there will be more pressure on store closings. Unfortunately, over our history, we're pros to that. I don't need to remind you that the top 10 tenants that we went public with in '93 no longer exist in 2016, and we will be able to deal with it. It's much easier to deal with it when you have a quality portfolio that we do across all the retail platforms that we have. But it's the -- it's the soup of the day. And so I don't think it needs to be 300 or 400 or 500. I think there are a lot of profitable stores that retailers are feeling the pressure. They've got to do something and I would like them to invest in their stores, is the something I would like them to do. But I don't always win that argument. So we're equipped to handle that. That's what we do. And -- but I expect that trend probably to continue. Now what we did say when we started this year, our occupancy is up. So put that, Christy -- it is up. So put that in perspective. We also said our bankruptcy store closings would be down in '16. It is down. We had much greater in '15, and we, basically, more or less leased all of the bankruptcies that we got back in '15 in a flat to tough retail environment. And I think, everybody needs to put that in perspective, okay? So but that doesn't mean were doing cartwheels here. It is -- we're grinding. We're as good as it gets when it comes to grinding. And that's the environment that is presented to us and we'll have to deal with it."

And I'm thinking, sales are okay, stabilizing, maybe the world gets over all of these stuff that's going on out there. Maybe we stabilize, a lot of people feel like we're headed for growth. So maybe we take more space back. But we've kept the buildings full, as evidenced by the occupancy, there is a trade-off. We're on our target for comp NOI increase. So it's not all that bad.

So the -- having the liquidation angle solved with Hilco and Gordon Brothers was critical. So it was really -- the long -- in a nutshell, it was really because the partners were able to do it.

I can't tell you that it's going to be a complete reversal. We try to right -- make the right judgment call. Now I will tell you, lease amendments are like anything else. They -- once you do it for one retailer, don't kid yourself, you hear about it, it goes everywhere else. Part of our job is to contain that. And -- but we've experienced this before.

We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed, opened, several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio, and we continued to achieve strong financial results.",1316,"Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed, opened, several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio, and we continued to achieve strong financial results. 
Before I get to some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to quickly highlight our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our performance year-to-date, our current view of the quarter, we are once again increasing our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $10.85 to $10.87, which was higher than our original guidance of $10.70 to $10.80.
Our increased range also reflects a potential charge of $0.08 per share, with respect to our likely decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower due to the rapidly rising construction cost and our beginning concerns around supply and demand in the Boston residential market.
Work will continue on redeveloping and modernizing the existing retail space at the center as well as the development of the Southwest corridor, which will create a new entrance to Copley. We expect this work will enhance the shopping experience for our guests and retailers and further strengthen our position in the heart of Boston, and will be completed by summer of '17. Assuming we make the decision to postpone, it does not foreclose the opportunity to build the tower in the future as market conditions warrant. 
Now let me turn to the quarter, FFO per share was $2.70, an increase of 6.3% compared to the prior year. For the first 9 months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up, 10.1% compared to the prior year period. 
We continued to see strong demand for space across our portfolio, combined occupancy for our malls and Premium Outlets, ended the quarter at 96.3%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Leasing activity remains solid. The Mall and Premium Outlets recorded re-leasing spreads of $6.71 per share -- per foot, an increase of 10.9%, given our high occupancy level of above 96%, the remaining space we are leasing, while not as well located, continues to produce healthy re-leasing spreads. 
And as a reminder, we include lease amendments for the restructuring of leases where we choose to work with retailers in certain situations, pre or post bankruptcy, such as PacSun. 
Base minimum rent was $50.76, up 4.5% compared to last year, reflecting growth in our rents, our occupancy cost of 13% as well.
Now just as everyone knows, my focus is on cash flow growth, and I believe this is the most important metric for the investment community to focus on. 
Our total portfolio NOI increased 7.3% year-to-date and 6.6% for the quarter -- third quarter. To put our growth rate in perspective, the 7.3% year-to-date growth is more than $300 million. Our result to date keep us on track for our full year guidance of total NOI growth of more than 6% for our portfolio.
On the NOI overview schedule included in our supplemental filed this morning, you can see the various platforms of growth that contribute to our portfolio NOI. 
The diversity of sources fueling our NOI growth is unique to Simon. Comp NOI increased 3.5% year-to-date and 2.2% for the quarter. Our comp NOI results are affected by declines in overage rent due solely to the impact of the strong dollar on our tourists, spending at our centers are active and re -- extensive redevelopment pipeline across all our property platforms as we relocate, reconfigure a significant number of tenants in order to enhance the future of retail and dining experiences at our properties and our decision to strategically moderate the marketing and specialty income in the common areas of our highly -- of our very high-end portfolio.
Total retail sales per square foot at our malls and Premium Outlets were $604 compared to $616 in the prior year period. Reported retailers centers continue to be impacted by this strong dollar at some of our tourist oriented malls and Premium Outlets. Reported retailer sales at our centers outside of our tourist oriented centers are stable. 
Reported sales also include initial dilution from newly opened space. And importantly, we're beginning to anniversary some of this decline. As you can see, our recent sequential quarters Q2 to Q3 of our sales productivity is basically flat.
The end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 32 properties across all of our platforms. Our share approximately 1.1. We opened as you know, King of Prussia, which connected the Plaza and the Court. We finished Fashion Center at Pentagon city. We started the expansion of Allen Premium Outlets of 120,000 square feet in North Texas and in the next several weeks, we opened 60,000 square-foot expansion at the outlets at Orange. And we, also, are opening our expansion in Venice, Italy, with our partner McArthurGlen of 67,000 square feet. So we continue to add value across the portfolio. 
Now on new developments, just so happens, tomorrow, we're opening Clarksburg Premium Outlets, the center will offer great retail line up. We expect it to cater to the whole Washington, D.C. metro area. We currently have 5, that's right, 5 outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia, 4 in the international markets, including France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada. All of these will open in '17. 
And even though we're opening a new outlet next week, the week after, we're actually opening Brickell City Centre in Miami. It's anchored by Saks. It's got a great retail line up with great partners in Swire and the Whitman Family and is part of a landmark mixed-use development, we look forward to managing the retail and as a reminder, we're only investing in the retail and construction continues on the full price development of Fort Worth, The Shops at Clearfork anchored by Neiman Marcus opening in the fall of '17. And these 8 new projects represent around $765 million of spend our share. 
Now let me turn to A√©ropostale. We are pleased to have partnered with GGP, Authentic Brands Group, Hilco, and Gordon Brothers to acquire A√©ropostale. In addition to the existing management team, the ABG group will add significant operating experience to A√©ro. We have a long track record of making smart capital allocation decisions. And after reviewing this opportunity with our partners, we believe this investment proved to be yet another opportunity for our company. 
It's also important to keep this investment in perspective. You've all seen the gross number of $243 million. I want you to understand that $188 million of that is inventory being purchased by Hilco and Gordon Brothers, and not by our buying group. Our initial investment is approximately $55 million by the group, of which our share is $33 million, including working capital. And the only reason we decided to make this investment is because we believe we can make money. 
If our model is right, we think we're buying this company at 1x to 2x EBITDA, with future growth opportunities ahead of it. And we continue to believe that this will be an astute investment, and for some of you who don't know ABG, it is backed by Leonard Green, which has been a significant important investor in retail throughout the years, Whole Foods, Neiman Marcus, J.Crew, just to name a handful. 
Also during the quarter, we acquired our partner's interest with McArthurGlen in our 2 outlets in Maples and Venice. We continue to focus on our industry leading balance sheet. We completed a number of secured financings during the quarter. We continue to lower our borrowing cost, increase our debt maturity, term our current liquidity at $6.5 billion. 
And finally, on our dividend, in 2016, we will have paid $6.50. That's an increase of 7.4% compared to $6.05 that we paid last year. That's a lot. I'm ready for your questions."

In fact, as we've done a tremendous job of outperforming that, but the long-term we've always kind of felt that, that $5 or $6 spread is kind of where we think the market is. We had a couple of years of significant outperformance, but we are not backing off our inherent value that we have in our leases as they roll over. And we're just getting back to kind of more of a normal environment. But for us, I don't know about our peers, but for us, we include these amendments and the bottom line is, that is having some impact on the leasing spread.

Well, sometimes it will work, sometimes we'll get the space back and certainly in the A√©ro case, we thought the opportunity was even more exciting to just buy the retailer and make a vertical investment that the entire S&P community is doing. Amazon makes vertical investments. The cable industry makes vertical investments. And again, I would encourage -- we decided to make vertical investments when we decided to franchise Starbucks locations 2, 3 years ago. That's the nature of our company, is that we're going to be nimble, we're going to -- we have the right judgment when to make a deal with the retailer, when not; when to make vertical investments, when not; when to go to Europe, when not; when to pull the plug on Copley and when not, and that's why we're in the position we are in today.

That, to me, is more material than any one operating statistic, quarter-by-quarter. So yes, we could -- we can slice and dice this any way, but if we can spend more time talking about how does a company grow its portfolio NOI -- there are many REITs that don't have $300 million of NOI, yet we grew that in 9 months. So I would rather talk about that that's more material than the fluctuations that have -- that are occurring with operating metrics. We could talk about sales. Sales are impacted by the fact that we have great properties in tourist markets and the strong dollar. That doesn't mean that that's going to last forever.

We've gotten better at what we've done. All sorts of reasons that we don't have to bore you. And you're right, we may be going back to kind of what we have promised our investor base for a long period of time. And the outperformance, I don't think, from our standpoint, we ever guarantee outperformance from how we looked at re-leasing spreads. We always said, ""Look, it's $5 or $6. One year it might be $8. One year it might be $4, but that's kind of what we see the long-term trend."" And I still feel comfortable that that's the basis. Now it's no surprise that retail, generally, has come under pressure. Lots of different reasons, which we could go into, but let's -- unless you want to, let's not. But the fact is -- and we are impacted, as I said, to you before, by our general GDP growth. And our -- today, our retail generally is -- there's no inflation, and our nominal GDP growth is 1.5%, yet we're growing our comp -- so I mean, and if nominal GDP, there is some inflation. So maybe real GDP growth is, I don't know, 50 basis points. We're still growing our business with no inflation in our particular business at 3.5% comp NOI. That's not bad. It's not 4% plus that we did last year or the year before, but it's still in the scheme of being able to grow our business. That's not bad. And we're -- I'm not defensive about it. I mean, that's kind of what, I think, we should expect when we have, essentially, real GDP growth of 1%. Maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more.

And that maybe the future of corporate America is that you're not going to pigeonhole these -- if we want to just talk about leasing a Sears box that we get back, I mean that's okay, for some companies, but that's not what we're about. So again, there's no -- we have no bucket -- it's not going to take away from what we're doing. My #1 priority is to make our product better anyway that we can, technology digital investments look and feel better retailers, different mix, redevelopment, whatever -- however that transpires and making a vertical investment here or there that can overwhelm us. But I want the latitude too, and I think the investment community should want us to. And at the end of the day, if our underwriting numbers are right and there is risk, we're buying a business that ought to be valued at 6x EBITDA, and we're buying at 1x to 2x. And I think, that's a pretty good trade. But we've got to -- we're not there yet, and that's the goal, but that's what we're trying to accomplish."

The consortium has talked about a 300 to 400 store base count for A√©ropostale. There's been a lot of talk about store count rationalization among national retailers generally and how many stores do they actually need to serve their customers in their market today. Why is that the right number of stores for a retailer like A√©ropostale? And what does that imply for your view of the need for other retailers to close stores, especially now that you're looking at this issues through that A√©ropostale lens?"

So it's very interesting. Sourcing -- look, there are 5 or 6 things that really make a retailer click. Sourcing, obviously, rent expense, store expense, the merchandise, the quality of it, the packaging, all the stuff that, I think, at the end of the day will make us better real estate owners. But that remains to be seen. A√©ro, look, I'm probably going to get in trouble for this, but since I like you, I'm going to tell you. Right now, we're looking at around 500 stores in the U.S. It's kind of the model. And based upon -- we expect everyone of those stores to be profitable. So it's a much bigger business than we initially went in, in the investment -- we were thinking we could justify our investment at a much lower store base, the fact of the matter is we found out there's a lot more store profitability out there than we thought. So it's going to be around 500, give or take. But I think, store closings, it is -- the pressure for that retailers to invest in the Internet to close stores from their investment community is great. I would question whether that's the right strategy, because some of these stores are very profitable, yet they feel like the headline closing stores is the answer and then all of this investment into the Internet is going to pay all these dividends. Fact of the matter is, there is a really healthy physical store environment and mall environment. And I think, all of us can't lose sight of that and that's where we should be investing. So I do think there will be more pressure on store closings. Unfortunately, over our history, we're pros to that. I don't need to remind you that the top 10 tenants that we went public with in '93 no longer exist in 2016, and we will be able to deal with it. It's much easier to deal with it when you have a quality portfolio that we do across all the retail platforms that we have. But it's the -- it's the soup of the day. And so I don't think it needs to be 300 or 400 or 500. I think there are a lot of profitable stores that retailers are feeling the pressure. They've got to do something and I would like them to invest in their stores, is the something I would like them to do. But I don't always win that argument. So we're equipped to handle that. That's what we do. And -- but I expect that trend probably to continue. Now what we did say when we started this year, our occupancy is up. So put that, Christy -- it is up. So put that in perspective. We also said our bankruptcy store closings would be down in '16. It is down. We had much greater in '15, and we, basically, more or less leased all of the bankruptcies that we got back in '15 in a flat to tough retail environment. And I think, everybody needs to put that in perspective, okay? So but that doesn't mean were doing cartwheels here. It is -- we're grinding. We're as good as it gets when it comes to grinding. And that's the environment that is presented to us and we'll have to deal with it."

They're great at brand building, having general growth as part of that and their ability to bring their real estate and their thoughtfulness to the table, in terms of how you operate a business, was very helpful. So the -- having the liquidation angle solved with Hilco and Gordon Brothers was critical. So it was really -- the long -- in a nutshell, it was really because the partners were able to do it. The partners brought so much to the table, that this was the right deal. If it were just us on our own, I'm not -- I'd be the first to tell you, I don't know that we would do it.

I can't tell you that it's going to be a complete reversal. We try to right -- make the right judgment call. Now I will tell you, lease amendments are like anything else. They -- once you do it for one retailer, don't kid yourself, you hear about it, it goes everywhere else. Part of our job is to contain that. And -- but we've experienced this before.

We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed, opened, several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio, and we continued to achieve strong financial results.",1316,"Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed, opened, several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio, and we continued to achieve strong financial results. 
Before I get to some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to quickly highlight our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our performance year-to-date, our current view of the quarter, we are once again increasing our full year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $10.85 to $10.87, which was higher than our original guidance of $10.70 to $10.80.
Our increased range also reflects a potential charge of $0.08 per share, with respect to our likely decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower due to the rapidly rising construction cost and our beginning concerns around supply and demand in the Boston residential market.
Work will continue on redeveloping and modernizing the existing retail space at the center as well as the development of the Southwest corridor, which will create a new entrance to Copley. We expect this work will enhance the shopping experience for our guests and retailers and further strengthen our position in the heart of Boston, and will be completed by summer of '17. Assuming we make the decision to postpone, it does not foreclose the opportunity to build the tower in the future as market conditions warrant. 
Now let me turn to the quarter, FFO per share was $2.70, an increase of 6.3% compared to the prior year. For the first 9 months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up, 10.1% compared to the prior year period. 
We continued to see strong demand for space across our portfolio, combined occupancy for our malls and Premium Outlets, ended the quarter at 96.3%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Leasing activity remains solid. The Mall and Premium Outlets recorded re-leasing spreads of $6.71 per share -- per foot, an increase of 10.9%, given our high occupancy level of above 96%, the remaining space we are leasing, while not as well located, continues to produce healthy re-leasing spreads. 
And as a reminder, we include lease amendments for the restructuring of leases where we choose to work with retailers in certain situations, pre or post bankruptcy, such as PacSun. 
Base minimum rent was $50.76, up 4.5% compared to last year, reflecting growth in our rents, our occupancy cost of 13% as well.
Now just as everyone knows, my focus is on cash flow growth, and I believe this is the most important metric for the investment community to focus on. 
Our total portfolio NOI increased 7.3% year-to-date and 6.6% for the quarter -- third quarter. To put our growth rate in perspective, the 7.3% year-to-date growth is more than $300 million. Our result to date keep us on track for our full year guidance of total NOI growth of more than 6% for our portfolio.
On the NOI overview schedule included in our supplemental filed this morning, you can see the various platforms of growth that contribute to our portfolio NOI. 
The diversity of sources fueling our NOI growth is unique to Simon. Comp NOI increased 3.5% year-to-date and 2.2% for the quarter. Our comp NOI results are affected by declines in overage rent due solely to the impact of the strong dollar on our tourists, spending at our centers are active and re -- extensive redevelopment pipeline across all our property platforms as we relocate, reconfigure a significant number of tenants in order to enhance the future of retail and dining experiences at our properties and our decision to strategically moderate the marketing and specialty income in the common areas of our highly -- of our very high-end portfolio.
Total retail sales per square foot at our malls and Premium Outlets were $604 compared to $616 in the prior year period. Reported retailers centers continue to be impacted by this strong dollar at some of our tourist oriented malls and Premium Outlets. Reported retailer sales at our centers outside of our tourist oriented centers are stable. 
Reported sales also include initial dilution from newly opened space. And importantly, we're beginning to anniversary some of this decline. As you can see, our recent sequential quarters Q2 to Q3 of our sales productivity is basically flat.
The end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 32 properties across all of our platforms. Our share approximately 1.1. We opened as you know, King of Prussia, which connected the Plaza and the Court. We finished Fashion Center at Pentagon city. We started the expansion of Allen Premium Outlets of 120,000 square feet in North Texas and in the next several weeks, we opened 60,000 square-foot expansion at the outlets at Orange. And we, also, are opening our expansion in Venice, Italy, with our partner McArthurGlen of 67,000 square feet. So we continue to add value across the portfolio. 
Now on new developments, just so happens, tomorrow, we're opening Clarksburg Premium Outlets, the center will offer great retail line up. We expect it to cater to the whole Washington, D.C. metro area. We currently have 5, that's right, 5 outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia, 4 in the international markets, including France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada. All of these will open in '17. 
And even though we're opening a new outlet next week, the week after, we're actually opening Brickell City Centre in Miami. It's anchored by Saks. It's got a great retail line up with great partners in Swire and the Whitman Family and is part of a landmark mixed-use development, we look forward to managing the retail and as a reminder, we're only investing in the retail and construction continues on the full price development of Fort Worth, The Shops at Clearfork anchored by Neiman Marcus opening in the fall of '17. And these 8 new projects represent around $765 million of spend our share. 
Now let me turn to A√©ropostale. We are pleased to have partnered with GGP, Authentic Brands Group, Hilco, and Gordon Brothers to acquire A√©ropostale. In addition to the existing management team, the ABG group will add significant operating experience to A√©ro. We have a long track record of making smart capital allocation decisions. And after reviewing this opportunity with our partners, we believe this investment proved to be yet another opportunity for our company. 
It's also important to keep this investment in perspective. You've all seen the gross number of $243 million. I want you to understand that $188 million of that is inventory being purchased by Hilco and Gordon Brothers, and not by our buying group. Our initial investment is approximately $55 million by the group, of which our share is $33 million, including working capital. And the only reason we decided to make this investment is because we believe we can make money. 
If our model is right, we think we're buying this company at 1x to 2x EBITDA, with future growth opportunities ahead of it. And we continue to believe that this will be an astute investment, and for some of you who don't know ABG, it is backed by Leonard Green, which has been a significant important investor in retail throughout the years, Whole Foods, Neiman Marcus, J.Crew, just to name a handful. 
Also during the quarter, we acquired our partner's interest with McArthurGlen in our 2 outlets in Maples and Venice. We continue to focus on our industry leading balance sheet. We completed a number of secured financings during the quarter. We continue to lower our borrowing cost, increase our debt maturity, term our current liquidity at $6.5 billion. 
And finally, on our dividend, in 2016, we will have paid $6.50. That's an increase of 7.4% compared to $6.05 that we paid last year. That's a lot. I'm ready for your questions."

Now our investors know that over a long period of time, we've always felt like the $5 to $6 spread was kind of always in our -- always part of our model. In fact, as we've done a tremendous job of outperforming that, but the long-term we've always kind of felt that, that $5 or $6 spread is kind of where we think the market is. We had a couple of years of significant outperformance, but we are not backing off our inherent value that we have in our leases as they roll over. And we're just getting back to kind of more of a normal environment. But for us, I don't know about our peers, but for us, we include these amendments and the bottom line is, that is having some impact on the leasing spread. But that $6 to $7 is maintaining itself, and that's kind of what we've told investors, year after year after year and we feel very good about that."

Well, sometimes it will work, sometimes we'll get the space back and certainly in the A√©ro case, we thought the opportunity was even more exciting to just buy the retailer and make a vertical investment that the entire S&P community is doing. Amazon makes vertical investments. The cable industry makes vertical investments. And again, I would encourage -- we decided to make vertical investments when we decided to franchise Starbucks locations 2, 3 years ago. That's the nature of our company, is that we're going to be nimble, we're going to -- we have the right judgment when to make a deal with the retailer, when not; when to make vertical investments, when not; when to go to Europe, when not; when to pull the plug on Copley and when not, and that's why we're in the position we are in today. And each and every case will be one by one. And I do appreciate and I hope I'm right with you, Caitlin, I do appreciate you waiting to write until we have our call.

That, to me, is more material than any one operating statistic, quarter-by-quarter. So yes, we could -- we can slice and dice this any way, but if we can spend more time talking about how does a company grow its portfolio NOI -- there are many REITs that don't have $300 million of NOI, yet we grew that in 9 months. So I would rather talk about that that's more material than the fluctuations that have -- that are occurring with operating metrics. We could talk about sales. Sales are impacted by the fact that we have great properties in tourist markets and the strong dollar. That doesn't mean that that's going to last forever. And -- but again, there's this high desire to make that the be all, end all of these metrics. And again, our numbers are clean. The results are the results.

And I don't think people are dismissing your ability to deploy capital whether it's through developments or expansions, but put clearly, there's been more pressure on the mall business. I just think anything that you can do to assuage the fears about the internal growth prospects going forward and perhaps it's just that a $6 to $7 spread on a roughly $60 or $61 expiring rents means that normalized leasing spread should be 10% and maybe that's what we're going to head to. There's a new normal in the business. That's okay, I think, people are just trying to get comfort with that."

We've gotten better at what we've done. All sorts of reasons that we don't have to bore you. And you're right, we may be going back to kind of what we have promised our investor base for a long period of time. And the outperformance, I don't think, from our standpoint, we ever guarantee outperformance from how we looked at re-leasing spreads. We always said, ""Look, it's $5 or $6. One year it might be $8. One year it might be $4, but that's kind of what we see the long-term trend."" And I still feel comfortable that that's the basis. Now it's no surprise that retail, generally, has come under pressure. Lots of different reasons, which we could go into, but let's -- unless you want to, let's not. But the fact is -- and we are impacted, as I said, to you before, by our general GDP growth. And our -- today, our retail generally is -- there's no inflation, and our nominal GDP growth is 1.5%, yet we're growing our comp -- so I mean, and if nominal GDP, there is some inflation. So maybe real GDP growth is, I don't know, 50 basis points. We're still growing our business with no inflation in our particular business at 3.5% comp NOI. That's not bad. It's not 4% plus that we did last year or the year before, but it's still in the scheme of being able to grow our business. That's not bad. And we're -- I'm not defensive about it. I mean, that's kind of what, I think, we should expect when we have, essentially, real GDP growth of 1%. Maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more.

I don't think, going back to your first question, I don't think this is going to be the wave of the future. I mean, AT&T -- I mentioned vertical because I just tried to put certain things outside of real estate in perspective, okay? So AT&T was buying, going vertical. They're spending $100 billion. I go vertical, I spend $33 million, okay? Million not billion, $33 million. And again, I'm not comparing -- I'm just trying to put these things in perspective. I'm not comparing our business to AT&T or anybody else. Amazon, what's made Amazon great? Is they've had the latitude to go vertical. They've gone vertical. They've gone content. They've gone distribution. They've gone retail. And that maybe the future of corporate America is that you're not going to pigeonhole these -- if we want to just talk about leasing a Sears box that we get back, I mean that's okay, for some companies, but that's not what we're about. So again, there's no -- we have no bucket -- it's not going to take away from what we're doing. My #1 priority is to make our product better anyway that we can, technology digital investments look and feel better retailers, different mix, redevelopment, whatever -- however that transpires and making a vertical investment here or there that can overwhelm us. But I want the latitude too, and I think the investment community should want us to. And at the end of the day, if our underwriting numbers are right and there is risk, we're buying a business that ought to be valued at 6x EBITDA, and we're buying at 1x to 2x. And I think, that's a pretty good trade. But we've got to -- we're not there yet, and that's the goal, but that's what we're trying to accomplish."

The consortium has talked about a 300 to 400 store base count for A√©ropostale. There's been a lot of talk about store count rationalization among national retailers generally and how many stores do they actually need to serve their customers in their market today. Why is that the right number of stores for a retailer like A√©ropostale? And what does that imply for your view of the need for other retailers to close stores, especially now that you're looking at this issues through that A√©ropostale lens?"

So it's very interesting. Sourcing -- look, there are 5 or 6 things that really make a retailer click. Sourcing, obviously, rent expense, store expense, the merchandise, the quality of it, the packaging, all the stuff that, I think, at the end of the day will make us better real estate owners. But that remains to be seen. A√©ro, look, I'm probably going to get in trouble for this, but since I like you, I'm going to tell you. Right now, we're looking at around 500 stores in the U.S. It's kind of the model. And based upon -- we expect everyone of those stores to be profitable. So it's a much bigger business than we initially went in, in the investment -- we were thinking we could justify our investment at a much lower store base, the fact of the matter is we found out there's a lot more store profitability out there than we thought. So it's going to be around 500, give or take. But I think, store closings, it is -- the pressure for that retailers to invest in the Internet to close stores from their investment community is great. I would question whether that's the right strategy, because some of these stores are very profitable, yet they feel like the headline closing stores is the answer and then all of this investment into the Internet is going to pay all these dividends. Fact of the matter is, there is a really healthy physical store environment and mall environment. And I think, all of us can't lose sight of that and that's where we should be investing. So I do think there will be more pressure on store closings. Unfortunately, over our history, we're pros to that. I don't need to remind you that the top 10 tenants that we went public with in '93 no longer exist in 2016, and we will be able to deal with it. It's much easier to deal with it when you have a quality portfolio that we do across all the retail platforms that we have. But it's the -- it's the soup of the day. And so I don't think it needs to be 300 or 400 or 500. I think there are a lot of profitable stores that retailers are feeling the pressure. They've got to do something and I would like them to invest in their stores, is the something I would like them to do. But I don't always win that argument. So we're equipped to handle that. That's what we do. And -- but I expect that trend probably to continue. Now what we did say when we started this year, our occupancy is up. So put that, Christy -- it is up. So put that in perspective. We also said our bankruptcy store closings would be down in '16. It is down. We had much greater in '15, and we, basically, more or less leased all of the bankruptcies that we got back in '15 in a flat to tough retail environment. And I think, everybody needs to put that in perspective, okay? So but that doesn't mean were doing cartwheels here. It is -- we're grinding. We're as good as it gets when it comes to grinding. And that's the environment that is presented to us and we'll have to deal with it."

Consumer really doesn't care, but on the other hand, we have 2 -- when it comes to the property business, we've got to listen to our clients, i.e. the retailers, et cetera.

They're great at brand building, having general growth as part of that and their ability to bring their real estate and their thoughtfulness to the table, in terms of how you operate a business, was very helpful. So the -- having the liquidation angle solved with Hilco and Gordon Brothers was critical. So it was really -- the long -- in a nutshell, it was really because the partners were able to do it. The partners brought so much to the table, that this was the right deal. If it were just us on our own, I'm not -- I'd be the first to tell you, I don't know that we would do it. We've done Starbucks franchises, but that's -- we did -- by the way, and I encourage everybody that goes to Del Amo, go to Pink's Hot Dogs, that's owned by your company, Simon Property Group. I'm so excited about that franchise that we own. It's great hotdogs. It's an institution. That's -- we've got a small group that kind of runs that business. This is a little bit out of the ordinary. And I would say, simply put, the fact that we had this partnership that was able to navigate all of the complexities of this.

Is that the right way to think about it?

As you know, last year, we had a lot of bankruptcies, and we gave direction to, like, okay. We're starting to change our attitude a little bit. I can't tell you that it's going to be a complete reversal. We try to right -- make the right judgment call. Now I will tell you, lease amendments are like anything else. They -- once you do it for one retailer, don't kid yourself, you hear about it, it goes everywhere else. Part of our job is to contain that. And -- but we've experienced this before. We did do it in other economic times. And again, our business is fine, but it's not -- we're trying to be accommodating.
