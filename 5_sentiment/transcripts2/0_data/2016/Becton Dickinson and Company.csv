Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com. 
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. 
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website. 
As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD. The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedule, in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. 
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

As we stated in our press release, we are pleased with our solid start to fiscal year 2016. Performance from both the Medical and Life Science segments contributed to revenue growth that was in line with our expectations. Strong underlying margin expansion was driven by the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, coupled with the positive impact of synergies. 
As we move through the first quarter, we continue to make progress with the strategic review of our portfolio. Many of you already know, we recently announced Fresenius Kabi has acquired the BD Simplist portfolio. We believe Fresenius is a better owner of the BD Rx business as it complements their existing products and capabilities in the injectable pharmaceutical industry. In addition, we are excited that we are initiating a long-term collaboration for Fresenius to supply us with a portfolio of competitive ID solutions in the U.S. This transaction is intended to enable BD to be responsive to our customers' needs and is complementary to our end-to-end Medication Management Solutions for our customers and their patients. 
Since we provided guidance in November, there have been a number of new dynamics that will affect our results this year. As most of you already know, several weeks ago there was a bipartisan agreement to suspend the Medical Device Tax. This critical relief is extremely important to BD as well as the patients, providers and research communities we serve. While some of the specifics are still being analyzed, we plan to reinvest this tax back into the business which further supports our innovation strategy. 
In summary, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We're also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year.
Moving on to Slide 5, I will review our first quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues grew 1.8%, which is in line with our prior guidance of 1% to 2% growth that we had anticipated and communicated on our last earnings call. Adjusting for tough comparisons for the prior year, this reflects solid underlying growth in both segments. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.96 driven by the solid underlying performance of the segments. Earnings were ahead of our expectations as the quarter also benefited from product mix that was incremental to already strong gross margin performance and some timing of expenses and below the line items. 
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,321567599,925239,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, performance in both segments contributed to a solid start to fiscal 2016.

As Vince just mentioned, performance in both segments contributed to a solid start to fiscal 2016. Total first quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion grew 1.8% on a comparable basis, which is in line with our previously disclosed guidance. Our growth rate this quarter reflects a tough comparison to strong prior year results of 6.7% organic growth, which includes CareFusion's final quarter as a stand-alone company growing at 10% organically. As a reminder, our results last year were driven by robust performance in the legacy CareFusion businesses, the impact of timing of orders in Pharmaceutical Systems, a very strong flu season, timing of tenders and strong emerging market performance. As a result, these items negatively impacted our first quarter growth rate by over 240 basis points. On an underlying basis, we are pleased with the solid performance of our segments and the momentum in our businesses.
BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 1.9%, reflecting the aforementioned items. Medication & Procedural Solutions or MPS growth was 2.0%, which reflects strength in pharmacy solutions, Infusion Therapy and safety-engineered products. Very strong results in the prior year negatively impacted the MPS growth rate by approximately 250 basis points. 
Despite extremely strong results in the prior year in Medication Management Solutions, revenues grew 4.3%, driven by both strong infusion and dispensing capital installations. Respiratory Solutions revenues declined 6.8%, reflecting the tough comparisons of prior year results due to the strong final quarter as part of legacy CareFusion. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.9%, driven by solid growth in pen needles. 
Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 2.6% reflects strong growth in SAIS, partially offset by the impact of timing of orders, which we expect to occur later this fiscal year. 
BD Life Sciences first quarter revenues increased 1.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Preanalytical Systems growth of 4.4% was driven by safety-engineered products in both the U.S. and Europe and also reflects strong growth in emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 1.2% reflects clinical tendered delays in emerging markets and a difficult comparison to the prior year when sequestration ended. This was offset by strong sales that were driven by an increased demand of high-end instruments and growth in research reagents. The Diagnostic Systems decline of 0.8% reflects a mild flu season, which impacted growth by approximately 400 basis points. Growth was also negatively impacted by a slowdown of capital spending in China. Solid microbiology growth as well as growth in molecular led by BD MAX and international growth in Women's Health partially offset the impact from the flu.
Moving to Slide 8, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth of 1.5% reflects the aforementioned prior year comparisons and timing impacts with BD Medical growing 1.9% and BD Life Sciences growing 0.3%. BD Medical's performance reflects strength in pharmacy solutions, infusion therapy pumps and related consumables and strength in Diabetes Care. This was partially offset by Respiratory Solutions. BD Life Sciences growth reflects the impact of a light of flu season this year and a difficult comparison to the prior year due to a strong flu season and the ending of sequestration. Offsetting these impacts was strong performance in the Biosciences business driven by research reagent sales, solid performance in our Preanalytical Systems unit, growth in microbiology and growth from BD MAX.
Moving on to international, revenues grew 2.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which reflects timing of tenders and capital installations. International revenues also reflect the moderation of growth in China in the quarter, and I'll provide more color on China in just a moment.
Medical segment grew 1.9%. This reflects solid performance in Pharmaceutical Systems and Medication Management Solutions, partially offset by a tough comparison due to large tenders in Brazil and the MA in the prior year as well as timing of capital installations in the dispensing business. 
Our Life Sciences segment grew 2.7%, which reflects strong growth in Diagnostic Systems driven by core microbiology, Women's Health and an expanded BD MAX menu in Europe. We also saw strong growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit. This was partially offset by a decline in the Biosciences business due to tender delays in emerging markets.
On Slide 9, emerging market revenues grew 2.4% currency-neutral, with developed markets growing 1.7%. The first quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects a very difficult comparison to the prior-year period, both the BD and CareFusion legacy businesses and a moderation of growth in China. 
China growth for the first quarter was 4.5% compared with growth of over 23% in the first quarter of last year. This difficult comparison was in line with our expectations. Beyond the difficult comparison, we also experienced a continued slowdown of capital spending in Diagnostic Systems, which resulted in inventory adjustments. Inventory adjustments negatively impacted growth in the quarter by approximately 350 basis points. While there are pockets of pressure, millions of patients are entering the healthcare system and, overall, emerging markets continue to be an important growth driver. For the total year, we expect China to grow in the low double-digit range and total emerging markets to grow 9% to 10%.
Moving to global safety on Slide 10, currency-neutral sales increased 4.9% and grew to $737 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 3.8%, while international sales grew 6.5% currency-neutral, with continued strength in Europe as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 10.9% in emerging markets. Medical Safety sales grew 5.4%, primarily driven by safety catheters and a range of products in Pharmaceutical Systems. Life Science safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.1% in the quarter.
Slide 11 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 1.8% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was about flat in the quarter. 
Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which include CareFusion results in the prior year, in order to give a better indication of our performance. 
Gross profit improved by 3.6%. I'll provide more color on gross profit in the next slide when we look at underlying performance and the impact of currency. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. 
R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.3% as we continue to invest in new products and innovation. 
Operating income grew 12%, reflecting strong P&L leverage, which I'll also address in more detail in the next slide. 
Our tax rate increased slightly. However, it continues to improve versus our initial deal model expectations. 
As discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $1.96, which is a 45.8% increase versus the prior year. This reflects solid underlying performance from the segments, positive product mix that was incremental to already strong gross margin performance, some timing of expenses and below-the-line items.
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the first quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 130 basis points was primarily driven by continuous improvement initiatives and product mix and, to a lesser extent, favorable raw material prices. Building off the strong momentum in fiscal year 2015 of 100 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion, operating margins grew 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies, continuous improvement and the positive impact of cost synergies. Currency had a negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins.
Moving on to Slide 14. Since we provided guidance in November, there have been a number of new dynamics that we anticipate will affect our results. Some of these items include the sale of BD Rx, the suspension of the Medical Device Tax,, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, lower oil prices, a milder flu season and additional FX pressure. As a result of these new dynamics, in combination with our first quarter results, we are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance by 4 percentage points from $8.73 to $8.80 to a range of $9.01 to $9.08. The increased currency-neutral guidance is offset by incremental FX pressures of approximately $0.28 due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Therefore, we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance of $8.37 to $8.44. We are extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments.
Turning to Slide 15, I'd like to walk you through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. In summary, we continue to expect comparable revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 20% and 20.5%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 450 basis points. U.S. dollar has strengthened further against most currencies since we last provided guidance in November. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1.09. We expect this unfavorable impact to be acute again in the second quarter with a revenue headwind of over 400 basis points on a comparable basis. We expect our currency-neutral revenue growth to be back in line with our guidance range of 4.5% to 5%. In the second half of the year, we expect the currency impact on revenue to moderate. 
We continue to expect growth in BD Medical of 4.5% to 5%. In our Life Sciences segment, we are revising our guidance to 4% to 4.5% to reflect the mild flu season in combination with lower sales in China. 
Based on the current view of the environment, we continue expect pricing to be about flat for the year. We continue to expect gross profit margin to be between 52% and 52.5% as the benefit from operating efficiencies, the sale of BD Rx and lower resin prices are expected to be partially offset by increased currency pressure. SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 24% and 24.5%. This is slightly better than our previous forecast as a result of the suspension of the Medical Device Tax, which was recorded within SSG&A. As we reinvest the medical device tax, we now expect R&D investment of about 6% to 6.5% of revenues. The reinvestment will help us to accelerate the strategies in both of our segments. 
Operating margin is expected to be between 21% and 22% of revenues as a result of the items I just reviewed. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we are raising our underlying operating margin guidance to 170 to 190 basis points. Once again, we are very pleased with our performance in driving margin expansion. 
We are broadening our tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. 
Our full-year guidance ranges for operating cash flow, capital expenditures, interest/other and share count remain unchanged from our November guidance. 
Now I would like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

Moving on to Slide 17, we are presenting a new slide that includes updates on our new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. With this new format, we will provide business updates each quarter. The product update slides that you are accustomed to seeing will remain in the appendix of the presentation for reference. 
Starting with new product innovation, within our Life Sciences business, we are very pleased with the early access customer response to the BD FACSSymphony, a novel cell analyzer enabling the simultaneous measurement of up to 50 different characteristics of a single cell. BD FACSSymphony  offers high-speed analysis that is 20x faster than other nonflow platforms. When combined with our BD Horizon Brilliant or the sirige and reagent portfolio, these capabilities will allow researchers improve identification and analysis of rare cell types and events. 
In early December, we successfully launched our FACSCelesta instrument, a mid-level cell analyzer with a very positive market reception. The new FACSCelesta system offers simultaneous measurement of up to 14 different single cell characteristics. The FACSCelesta system is also designed to leverage our broad BD Horizon Brilliant reagent portfolio. 
In our Diagnostic Systems business, we continue to focus on menu expansion and anticipate launching new assays on the BD MAX platform in fiscal year 2016, including CT/GC and Vaginitis. 
Within our strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have divested the BD Rx business and are excited to be adding IV solutions to our medication management portfolio. 
We continue to make progress with our portfolio strategic review process and will provide you with updates as we move forward. 
In January, we launched our new BD branded captures the new BD and our rearticulated purpose, advancing the world of health, which is more relevant than ever in a dynamic and ever-changing industry. 
And in an equally important area of partnerships and collaborations, we remain on track with our collaboration with Medtronic. The insulin infusion sets in our Diabetes Care business have an expected product launch in the middle of the fiscal year 2016, so this year. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing silent occlusions, simplify the user's experience and increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping. 
We continue to see strong growth in opportunities in our IDAST business, where we have built a comprehensive solution offering, which includes the BD Bruker Maldi Biotyper. This is a result of the collaboration with Bruker Corporation. We've seen success over the past several years with the BD Bruker MBT instrument due to its ability to provide rapid and accurate microbial identification and its adoption in new geographic markets. As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities that drive growth and innovation, and we look forward to updating you as we make progress throughout the year.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 18. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the first quarter, and we made progress with our back office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018. Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs as we discussed earlier. The consistent solid performance of our business, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in fiscal year 2015, we expect another 170 to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year.
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid start to fiscal year 2016, both segments performed well, and we delivered very strong earnings growth. 
Second, our margin profile has improved significantly. We are driving operational efficiencies and continuous improvement in addition to delivering on our synergy commitments. This is manifesting in our financial results with 200 basis points of operating margin expansion this quarter and increased guidance for the total year. 
Third, we continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio and focus on the appropriate strategic initiatives. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher-growth areas, which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers. 
Finally, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We are also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. 
We believe we are well-positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders and I look to the future with enthusiasm. Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

Just to remind everyone that there was very difficult comps, a strong flu season last year. We had CareFusion's last final quarter, and we talked in our prepared remarks about the 6.7% growth that we were jumping over, including the CareFusion 10% growth. And then we had a number of items like in pharmacy solutions, where we have the typical timing compares. All that goes away. In fact, it reverses in the second half. So if you remember, the CareFusion businesses actually grew minus 2% in the third quarter. So actually, we expect the second quarter to be back in basically the range that we normally have, the 4.5 to 5. And you'll start picking up more in the back half of the year against that CareFusion compare. Don't forget, we had the AVEA recall in respiratory, so that becomes an easier compare. Emerging markets actually start comparing to more normalized results. You saw China this year, first quarter of last year was 23% growth, we had a jumpover. So all that starts reversing. And so we are confident in our full-year guidance."

So taking China first, the weakness was really on the capital side. It was in Life Science.

So we're seeing that in China, and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year. On the disposable side, we did fine. And these are products that sustain the healthcare system. And so we expect stability in China on that side. That's really the difference as we look around the emerging markets. That's the biggest difference. If I talk about Latin America, Latin America is basically -- Brazil is where we said it was and then stronger performance in the other countries. So in terms of inventory, as you heard, we made inventory adjustments on the Medical side last time. And coming back to the Diagnostic piece, we actually thought that it was more of a timing issue, this audit issue. We're not saying that's going away, so we came back and we did make the inventory adjustment on the Diagnostic side because of the change in the situation. Chris, anything else you would add?"

We have taken a few products that were already approved and put those through our channels i n markets like China and we are seeing some early positive signs. But we've always said it'll take some time to ramp and that we would see that more in FY '17 and we're right on track to that."

The one thing that I would say is that 4% additional is things like the sale of BD Rx. Oil prices continue to give us a lift as the price per barrel went from 50 to 30. And so whether you call those synergies or -- it's all good. I mean what I would point to on that chart is that, that 9.01 to 9.08 represents a 37% to 38% increase over where we have been on a BDX legacy guidance basis. And so how you characterize that, whether it's just accretion or synergies, that's somewhat semantics. I mean, we were growing over the expectation that we would have grown 9% to 10% anyway. So we've stayed pure on that. The tax rate improvements, are those synergies? Yes, they're synergies as well, it's just not what we had originally contemplated in the deal. So we've tried to keep a very clear and transparent view of what is synergies and what's accretion. And that 4%, as I said, I wouldn't call those synergies. We are not raising our synergy guidance as we did last quarter because these are just kind of other things that are benefiting our cost structure and bottom line that hadn't been contemplated in November. So for what we control, we're really executing extremely well, very pleased with it. But obviously, the FX drag is worse. In that regard, since November, the euro has stabilized at 1.09. Of that 4% drag additional in FX, 1% comes from the euro remaining at that 1.09. And then another percent from other major currencies like Canada, for example, it's down 8% or 7% since November. Mexico is down 8%. China is down 3%. So that's another percent of that 4. The other 2 is every other currency in the world is weak against the U.S. dollar compared to where it was in November. And so that's another 2%. So an additional 4% drag. So we don't really have a lot of control over that. We do everything we can to mitigate that. So what we control, we're really feeling good about, but we are going against significant FX headwinds. But we really feel good about the fact that we were able to still meet our commitment of 8 37 to 8 44 despite those significant FX headwinds."

Right now, we have about 1/3 of that being executed against the other 2/3 we are still getting the projects in place and we do fully expect to spend that this year. There might be a little bit of timing issue. Obviously, in the month of January, we're getting the benefit and we're only executing on the 1/3. So we'll probably just naturally pick up a little bit in timing, but not a lot, and that's already in the guidance. But we fully expect to reinvest, and we want to reinvest and we're going through that process now. 
And then the second question was China. I think I'd bring you back to -- if you adjust for the difficult compare in the first quarter and you adjust for the inventory adjustments that we took in Life Sciences, it brings you back up to a double-digit number in China."

During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website. 
As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD. The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedule, in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.

As we stated in our press release, we are pleased with our solid start to fiscal year 2016. Performance from both the Medical and Life Science segments contributed to revenue growth that was in line with our expectations. Strong underlying margin expansion was driven by the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, coupled with the positive impact of synergies.
As we move through the first quarter, we continue to make progress with the strategic review of our portfolio. Many of you already know, we recently announced that Fresenius Kabi has acquired the BD Simplist portfolio. We believe Fresenius is a better owner of the BD Rx business as it complements their existing products and capabilities in the injectable pharmaceutical industry. In addition, we are excited that we are initiating a long-term collaboration for Fresenius to supply us with a portfolio of competitive IV solutions in the U.S. This transaction is intended to enable BD to be responsive to our customers' needs and is complementary to our end-to-end Medication Management Solutions for our customers and their patients.
Since we provided guidance in November, there have been a number of new dynamics that will affect our results this year. As most of you already know, several weeks ago, there was a bipartisan agreement to suspend the Medical Device Tax. This critical relief is extremely important to BD as well as the patients, providers and research communities we serve. While some of the specifics are still being analyzed, we plan to reinvest this tax back into the business, which further supports our innovation strategy. 
In summary, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We're also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year.
Moving on to Slide 5, I will review our first quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues grew 1.8%, which is in line with our prior guidance of 1% to 2% growth that we had anticipated and communicated on our last earnings call. Adjusting for tough comparisons for the prior year, this reflects solid underlying growth in both the segments. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.96, driven by the solid underlying performance of the segments. Earnings were ahead of our expectations as the quarter also benefited from product mix that was incremental to already strong gross margin performance and some timing of expenses and below the line items.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,321567599,925519,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, performance in both segments contributed to a solid start to fiscal 2016. Total first quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion grew 1.8% on a comparable basis, which is in line with o",1862,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, performance in both segments contributed to a solid start to fiscal 2016. Total first quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion grew 1.8% on a comparable basis, which is in line with our previously disclosed guidance. Our growth rate this quarter reflects a tough comparison to strong prior year results of 6.7% organic growth, which includes CareFusion's final quarter as a stand-alone company, growing at 10% organically. As a reminder, our results last year were driven by robust performance in the legacy CareFusion businesses, the impact of timing of orders in Pharmaceutical Systems, a very strong flu season, timing of tenders and strong emerging market performance. As a result, these items negatively impacted our first quarter growth rate by over 240 basis points. On an underlying basis, we are pleased with the solid performance of our segments and the momentum in our businesses.
BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 1.9%, reflecting the aforementioned items. Medication & Procedural Solutions or MPS growth was 2.0%, which reflects strength in pharmacy solutions, Infusion Therapy and safety-engineered products. Very strong results in the prior year negatively impacted the MPS growth rate by approximately 250 basis points. 
Despite extremely strong results in the prior year in Medication Management Solutions, revenues grew 4.3%, driven by both strong infusion and dispensing capital installations. Respiratory Solutions revenues declined 6.8%, reflecting the tough comparisons of prior year results due to the strong final quarter as part of legacy CareFusion. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.9%, driven by solid growth in pen needles. 
Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 2.6% reflect strong growth in SAIS, partially offset by the impact of timing of orders, which we expect to occur later this fiscal year. 
BD Life Sciences first quarter revenues increased 1.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Preanalytical Systems growth of 4.4% was driven by safety-engineered products in both the U.S. and Europe and also reflects strong growth in emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 1.2% reflects clinical tendered delays in emerging markets and a difficult comparison to the prior year when sequestration ended. This was offset by strong sales that were driven by an increased demand of high-end instruments and growth in research reagents. The Diagnostic Systems decline of 0.8% reflects a mild flu season, which impacted growth by approximately 400 basis points. Growth was also negatively impacted by a slowdown of capital spending in China. Solid microbiology growth as well as growth in molecular led by BD MAX and international growth in Women's Health partially offset the impact from the flu.
Moving to Slide 8, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth of 1.5% reflects the aforementioned prior year comparisons and timing impacts with BD Medical growing 1.9% and BD Life Sciences growing 0.3%. BD Medical's performance reflects strength in pharmacy solutions, infusion therapy pumps and related consumables and strength in Diabetes Care. This was partially offset by Respiratory Solutions. BD Life Sciences growth reflects the impact of a light flu season this year and a difficult comparison to the prior year due to a strong flu season and the ending of sequestration. Offsetting these impacts was strong performance in the Biosciences business driven by research reagent sales, solid performance in our Preanalytical Systems unit, growth in microbiology and growth from BD MAX.
Moving on to International, revenues grew 2.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which reflects timing of tenders and capital installations. International revenues also reflect the moderation of growth in China in the quarter, and I'll provide more color on China in just a moment.
The medical segment grew 1.9%. This reflects solid performance in Pharmaceutical Systems and Medication Management Solutions, partially offset by a tough comparison due to large tenders in Brazil and EMA in the prior year as well as timing of capital installations in the dispensing business.
Our Life Sciences segment grew 2.7%, which reflects strong growth in Diagnostic Systems driven by core microbiology, Women's Health and an expanded BD MAX menu in Europe. We also saw strong growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit. This was partially offset by a decline in the Biosciences business due to tender delays in emerging markets.
On Slide 9, emerging market revenues grew 2.4% currency-neutral, with developed markets growing 1.7%. The first quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects a very difficult comparison to the prior year period, both the BD and CareFusion legacy businesses and a moderation of growth in China.
China growth for the first quarter was 4.5% compared with growth of over 23% in the first quarter of last year. This difficult comparison was in line with our expectations. Beyond the difficult comparison, we also experienced a continued slowdown of capital spending in Diagnostic Systems, which resulted in inventory adjustments. Inventory adjustments negatively impacted growth in the quarter by approximately 350 basis points. While there are pockets of pressure, millions of patients are entering the health care system and, overall, emerging markets continue to be an important growth driver. For the total year, we expect China to grow in the low double-digit range and total emerging markets to grow 9% to 10%.
Moving to global safety on Slide 10, currency-neutral sales increased 4.9% and grew to $737 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S., grew 3.8%, while international sales grew 6.5% currency-neutral, with continued strength in Europe as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 10.9% in emerging markets. Medical Safety sales grew 5.4%, primarily driven by safety catheters and a range of products in Pharmaceutical Systems. Life Science safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.1% in the quarter.
Slide 11 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 1.8% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was about flat in the quarter.
Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which includes CareFusion results in the prior year, in order to give a better indication of our performance. 
Gross profit improved by 3.6%. I'll provide more color on gross profit in the next slide when we look at underlying performance and the impact of currency.
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. 
R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.3% as we continue to invest in new products and innovation. 
Operating income grew 12%, reflecting strong P&L leverage, which I'll also address in more detail in the next slide. 
Our tax rate increased slightly. However, it continues to improve versus our initial deal model expectations. 
As discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $1.96, which is a 45.8% increase versus the prior year. This reflects solid underlying performance from the segments, positive product mix that was incremental to already strong gross margin performance, some timing of expenses and below the line items.
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the first quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 130 basis points was primarily driven by continuous improvement initiatives and product mix and to a lesser extent, favorable raw material prices. Building off the strong momentum in fiscal year 2015 of 100 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion, operating margins grew 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion, combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies, continuous improvement and the positive impact of cost synergies. Currency had a negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins.
Moving on to Slide 14. Since we provided guidance in November, there have been a number of new dynamics that we anticipate will affect our results. Some of these items include the sale of BD Rx, the suspension of the Medical Device Tax, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, lower oil prices, a milder flu season and additional FX pressure. As a result of these new dynamics, in combination with our first quarter results, we are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance by 4 percentage points from $8.73 to $8.80 to a range of $9.01 to $9.08. The increased currency-neutral guidance is offset by incremental FX pressures of approximately $0.28 due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Therefore, we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance of $8.37 to $8.44. We are extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments.
Turning to Slide 15, I'd like to walk you through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. In summary, we continue to expect comparable revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 20% and 20.5%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 450 basis points. U.S. dollar has strengthened further against most currencies since we last provided guidance in November. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1.09. We expect this unfavorable impact to be acute again in the second quarter with a revenue headwind of over 400 basis points on a comparable basis. We expect our currency-neutral revenue growth to be back in line with our guidance range of 4.5% to 5%. In the second half of the year, we expect the currency impact on revenue to moderate.
We continue to expect growth in BD Medical of 4.5% to 5%. In our Life Sciences segment, we are revising our guidance to 4% to 4.5% to reflect the mild flu season in combination with lower sales in China. 
Based on the current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be about flat for the year. We continue to expect gross profit margin to be between 52% and 52.5% as the benefit from operating efficiencies, the sale of BD Rx and lower resin prices are expected to be partially offset by increased currency pressure. SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 24% and 24.5%. This is slightly better than our previous forecast as a result of the suspension of the Medical Device Tax, which was recorded within SSG&A. As we reinvest the medical device tax, we now expect R&D investments of about 6% to 6.5% of revenues. The reinvestment will help us to accelerate the strategies in both of our segments.
Operating margin is expected to be between 21% and 22% of revenues as a result of the items I just reviewed. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we are raising our underlying operating margin guidance to 170 to 190 basis points. Once again, we are very pleased with our performance in driving margin expansion. 
We are broadening our tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. 
Our full-year guidance range is for operating cash flow, capital expenditures, interest/other and share count remain unchanged from our November guidance. 
Now I would like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

Moving on to Slide 17, we are presenting a new slide that includes updates on our new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. With this new format, we will provide business updates each quarter. The product update slides that you are accustomed to seeing will remain in the appendix of the presentation for reference.
Starting with new product innovation, within our Life Sciences business, we are very pleased with the early access customer response to the BD FACSSymphony, a novel cell analyzer enabling the simultaneous measurement of up to 50 different characteristics of a single cell. BD FACSSymphony  offers high-speed analysis that is 20x faster than other nonflow platforms. When combined with our BD Horizon Brilliant over the Sirigen Reagent portfolio, these capabilities will allow researchers improve the identification and analysis of rare cell types and events.
In early December, we successfully launched our FACSCelesta instrument, a mid-level cell analyzer with a very positive market reception. The new FACSCelesta system offers simultaneous measurement of up to 14 different single cell characteristics. The FACSCelesta system is also designed to leverage our broad BD Horizon Brilliant reagent portfolio. 
In our Diagnostic Systems business, we continue to focus on menu expansion and anticipate launching new assays on the BD MAX platform in fiscal year 2016, including CT/GC and Vaginitis. 
Within our strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have divested the BD Rx business and are excited to be adding IV solutions to our Medication Management portfolio. 
We continue to make progress with our portfolio strategic review process and will provide you with updates as we move forward.
In January, we launched our new BD brand that captures the new BD and our rearticulated purpose, advancing the world of health, which is more relevant than ever in a dynamic and ever-changing industry.
And in an equally important area of partnerships and collaborations, we remain on track with our collaboration with Medtronic. The insulin infusion sets in our Diabetes Care business have an expected product launch in the middle of the fiscal year 2016, so this year. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing silent occlusions, simplify the user's experience and increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping. 
We continue to see strong growth in opportunities in our IDAST business, where we have built a comprehensive solution offering, which includes the BD Bruker Maldi Biotyper. This is a result of the collaboration with Bruker Corporation. We've seen success over the past several years with the BD Bruker MBT instrument due to its ability to provide rapid and accurate microbial identification and its adoption in new geographic markets. As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities that drive growth and innovation, and we look forward to updating you as we make progress throughout the year.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 18. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the first quarter, and we made progress with our back office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018. 
Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs as we discussed earlier. The consistent solid performance of our business, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in fiscal year 2015, we expect another 170 to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year.
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid start to fiscal year 2016, both segments performed well, and we delivered very strong earnings growth.  Second, our margin profile has improved significantly. We are driving operational efficiencies and continuous improvement in addition to delivering on our synergy commitments. This is manifesting in our financial results with 200 basis points of operating margin expansion this quarter and increased guidance for the total year.  Third, we continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio and focus on the appropriate strategic initiatives. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher growth areas, which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers.  Finally, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We are also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year.  We believe we are well-positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders and I look to the future with enthusiasm. Thank you. 
We will now open the call to questions."

So number one, you guys in the last call had guided to 1% to 2% constant currency growth this quarter over a tougher comp. The Street, they heard you, but didn't do a good job of reflecting at the numbers. But you're maintaining your FX neutral guidance for the year, which effectively implies that over the balance of the next 3 quarters you'll grow the top line 5.5% to 6% FX neutral. So, a, is that correct? And then, b, can you just walk us through your confidence in the top line outlook for the rest of the year?"

Yes, so we did have results that were right in line in the first quarter with what we guided, the 1% to 2%, it came in at 1.8%, which does imply greater growth for the rest of the year. Just to remind everyone that there was very difficult comps, a strong flu season last year. We had CareFusion's last final quarter, and we talked in our prepared remarks about the 6.7% growth that we were jumping over, including the CareFusion 10% growth. And then we had a number of items like in pharmacy solutions, where we have the typical timing compares. All of that goes away. In fact, it reverses in the second half. So if you remember, the CareFusion businesses actually grew minus 2% in the third quarter. So actually, we expect the second quarter to be back in basically the range that we normally have, the 4.5% to 5%. And you'll start picking up more in the back half of the year against that CareFusion compare. Don't forget, we had the AVEA recall in respiratory, so that becomes an easier compare. Emerging markets actually start comparing to more normalized results. You saw China this year, first quarter of last year was 23% growth, we had a jumpover. So all of that starts reversing. And so we are confident in our full year guidance."

So taking China first, the weakness was really on the capital side. It was in Life Science. And it does not appear to be driven so much by the financial situation as it was driven more by this issue that we brought up last quarter, which is the auditing of large capital purchases. So we're seeing that in China, and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year. On the disposable side, we did fine. And these are products that sustain the health care system. And so we expect stability in China on that side. That's really the difference as we look around the emerging markets. That's the biggest difference. If I talk about Latin America, Latin America is basically -- Brazil is where we said it was and then with stronger performance in the other countries. So in terms of inventory, as you heard, we made inventory adjustments on the Medical side last time. And coming back to the Diagnostic piece, we actually thought that it was more of a timing issue, this audit issue. We're not saying that's going away, so we came back and we did make the inventory adjustment on the Diagnostic side because of the change in the situation. Chris, anything else you would add?"

The one thing that I would say is that 4% additional is things like the sale of BD Rx. Oil prices continue to give us a lift as the price per barrel went from 50 to 30. And so whether you call those synergies or -- it's all good. I mean what I would point to one that chart is that, that $9.01 to $9.08 represents a 37% to 38% increase over where we would have been on a BDX legacy guidance basis. And so how you characterize that, whether it's just accretion or synergies, that's somewhat semantics. I mean, we were growing over the expectation that we would have grown 9% to 10% anyway. So we've stayed pure on that. But the tax rate improvements, are those synergies? Yes, they're synergies as well, it's just not what we had originally contemplated in the deal. So we've tried to keep a very clear and transparent view of what is synergies and what's accretion. And that 4%, as I said, I wouldn't call those synergies. We are not raising our synergy guidance as we did last quarter because these are just kind of other things that are benefiting our cost structure and bottom line that hadn't been contemplated in November. So for what we control, we're really executing extremely well, very pleased with it. But obviously, the FX drag is worse. In that regard, since November, the euro had stabilized at 1.09. Of that 4% drag additional in FX, 1% comes from the euro remaining at that 1.09. And then another percent from other major currencies like Canada, for example, it's down 8% or 7% since November. Mexico is down 8%. China is down 3%. So that's another percent of that 4%. The other 2% is every other currency in the world is weak against the U.S. dollar compared to where it was in November. And so that's another 2%. So the additional 4% drag. So we don't really have a lot of control over that. We do everything we can to mitigate that. So what we control, we're really feeling good about, but we are going against significant FX headwinds. But we really feel good about the fact that we were able to still meet our commitment of $8.37 to $8.44 despite those significant FX headwinds."

If you normalize for both of those, you'd be in double digits in China in the first quarter. As I said on the overall BD, revenue growth to come, the comparison to prior year eases in the second half of the year significantly. We have, for example, respiratory wasn't even shipping in China, towards the second half of last year, so that makes it an easier compare as well. So that's where we get the low double digits. We are getting a little bit of a lift. We talked about most of the CareFusion synergies coming next year. But there is a little bit connectors and things like that, that help us, actually an easy compare against CareFusion's China performance last year that gives us a little bit of a lift as well."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website. 
As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD. The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures, in the financial schedules, in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.

As we stated in our press release, we are pleased with our solid start to fiscal year 2016. Performance from both the Medical and Life Science segments contributed to revenue growth that was in line with our expectations. Strong underlying margin expansion was driven by the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, coupled with the positive impact of synergies.
As we move through the first quarter, we continue to make progress with the strategic review of our portfolio. Many of you already know, we recently announced that Fresenius Kabi has acquired the BD Simplist portfolio. We believe Fresenius is a better owner of the BD Rx business as it complements their existing products and capabilities in the injectable pharmaceutical industry. In addition, we are excited that we are initiating a long-term collaboration for Fresenius to supply us with a portfolio of competitive IV solutions in the U.S. This transaction is intended to enable BD to be responsive to our customers' needs and is complementary to our end-to-end Medication Management Solutions for our customers and their patients.
Since we provided guidance in November, there have been a number of new dynamics that will affect our results this year. As most of you already know, several weeks ago, there was a bipartisan agreement to suspend the Medical Device Tax. This critical relief is extremely important to BD as well as the patients, providers and research communities we serve. While some of the specifics are still being analyzed, we plan to reinvest this tax back into the business, which further supports our innovation strategy. 
In summary, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We're also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year.
Moving on to Slide 5, I will review our first quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues grew 1.8%, which is in line with our prior guidance of 1% to 2% growth that we had anticipated and communicated on our last earnings call. Adjusting for tough comparisons for the prior year, this reflects solid underlying growth in both segments. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.96, driven by the solid underlying performance of the segments. Earnings were ahead of our expectations as the quarter also benefited from product mix that was incremental to already strong gross margin performance and some timing of expenses and below the line items.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,321567599,925763,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, performance in both segments contributed to a solid start to fiscal 2016. Total first quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion grew 1.8% on a comparable basis, which is in line with o",1863,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, performance in both segments contributed to a solid start to fiscal 2016. Total first quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion grew 1.8% on a comparable basis, which is in line with our previously disclosed guidance. Our growth rate this quarter reflects a tough comparison to strong prior year results of 6.7% organic growth, which includes CareFusion's final quarter as a stand-alone company, growing at 10% organically. As a reminder, our results last year were driven by robust performance in the legacy CareFusion businesses, the impact of timing of orders in Pharmaceutical Systems, a very strong flu season, timing of tenders and strong emerging market performance. As a result, these items negatively impacted our first quarter growth rate by over 240 basis points. On an underlying basis, we are pleased with the solid performance of our segments and the momentum in our businesses.
BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 1.9%, reflecting the aforementioned items. Medication & Procedural Solutions or MPS growth was 2.0%, which reflects strength in Pharmacy Solutions, Infusion Therapy and safety-engineered products. Very strong results in the prior year negatively impacted the MPS growth rate by approximately 250 basis points. 
Despite extremely strong results in the prior year in Medication Management Solutions, revenues grew 4.3%, driven by both strong infusion and dispensing capital installations. Respiratory Solutions revenues declined 6.8%, reflecting the tough comparison to prior year results due to the strong final quarter as part of legacy CareFusion. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.9%, driven by solid growth in pen needles. 
Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 2.6% reflect strong growth in SAIS, partially offset by the impact of timing of orders, which we expect to occur later this fiscal year. 
BD Life Sciences first quarter revenues increased 1.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Preanalytical Systems growth of 4.4% was driven by safety-engineered products in both the U.S. and Europe and also reflects strong growth in emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 1.2% reflects clinical tendered delays in emerging markets and a difficult comparison to the prior year when sequestration ended. This was offset by strong sales that were driven by an increased demand of high-end instruments and growth in research reagents. The Diagnostic Systems decline of 0.8% reflects a mild flu season, which impacted growth by approximately 400 basis points. Growth was also negatively impacted by a slowdown of capital spending in China. Solid microbiology growth as well as growth in molecular led by BD MAX and international growth in Women's Health partially offset the impact from the flu.
Moving to Slide 8, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth of 1.5% reflects the aforementioned prior year comparisons and timing impacts with BD Medical growing 1.9% and BD Life Sciences growing 0.3%. BD Medical's performance reflects strength in Pharmacy Solutions, Infusion Therapy pumps and related consumables and strength in Diabetes Care. This was partially offset by Respiratory Solutions. BD Life Sciences growth reflects the impact of a light flu season this year and a difficult comparison to the prior year due to a strong flu season and the ending of sequestration. Offsetting these impacts was strong performance in the Biosciences business driven by research reagent sales, solid performance in our Preanalytical Systems unit, growth in microbiology and growth from BD MAX.
Moving on to International, revenues grew 2.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which reflects timing of tenders and capital installations. International revenues also reflect the moderation of growth in China in the quarter, and I'll provide more color on China in just a moment.
The medical segment grew 1.9%. This reflects solid performance in Pharmaceutical Systems and Medication Management Solutions, partially offset by a tough comparison due to large tenders in Brazil and EMA in the prior year as well as timing of capital installations in the dispensing business.
Our Life Sciences segment grew 2.7%, which reflects strong growth in Diagnostic Systems driven by core microbiology, Women's Health and an expanded BD MAX menu in Europe. We also saw strong growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit. This was partially offset by a decline in the Biosciences business due to tender delays in emerging markets.
On Slide 9, emerging market revenues grew 2.4% currency-neutral, with developed markets growing 1.7%. The first quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects a very difficult comparison to the prior year period, both the BD and CareFusion legacy businesses and a moderation of growth in China.
China growth for the first quarter was 4.5% compared with growth of over 23% in the first quarter of last year. This difficult comparison was in line with our expectations. Beyond the difficult comparison, we also experienced a continued slowdown of capital spending in Diagnostic Systems, which resulted in inventory adjustments. Inventory adjustments negatively impacted growth in the quarter by approximately 350 basis points. While there are pockets of pressure, millions of patients are entering the health care system and, overall, emerging markets continue to be an important growth driver. For the total year, we expect China to grow in the low double-digit range and total emerging markets to grow 9% to 10%.
Moving to global safety on Slide 10, currency-neutral sales increased 4.9% and grew to $737 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S., grew 3.8%, while international sales grew 6.5% currency-neutral, with continued strength in Europe as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 10.9% in emerging markets. Medical Safety sales grew 5.4%, primarily driven by safety catheters and a range of products in Pharmaceutical Systems. Life Science safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.1% in the quarter.
Slide 11 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 1.8% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was about flat in the quarter.
Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which includes CareFusion results in the prior year, in order to give a better indication of our performance. 
Gross profit improved by 3.6%. I'll provide more color on gross profit in the next slide when we look at underlying performance and the impact of currency.
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. 
R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.3% as we continue to invest in new products and innovation. 
Operating income grew 12%, reflecting strong P&L leverage, which I'll also address in more detail on the next slide. 
Our tax rate increased slightly. However, it continues to improve versus our initial deal model expectations. 
As discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $1.96, which is a 45.8% increase versus the prior year. This reflects solid underlying performance from the segments, positive product mix that was incremental to already strong gross margin performance, some timing of expenses and below the line items.
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the first quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 130 basis points was primarily driven by continuous improvement initiatives and product mix and to a lesser extent, favorable raw material prices. Building off the strong momentum in fiscal year 2015 of 100 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion, operating margins grew 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion, combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies, continuous improvement and the positive impact of cost synergies. Currency had a negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins.
Moving on to Slide 14. Since we provided guidance in November, there have been a number of new dynamics that we anticipate will affect our results. Some of these items include the sale of BD Rx, the suspension of the Medical Device Tax, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, lower oil prices, a milder flu season and additional FX pressure. As a result of these new dynamics, in combination with our first quarter results, we are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance by 4 percentage points from $8.73 to $8.80 to a range of $9.01 to $9.08. The increased currency-neutral guidance is offset by incremental FX pressures of approximately $0.28 due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Therefore, we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance of $8.37 to $8.44. We are extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments.
Turning to Slide 15, I'd like to walk you through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. In summary, we continue to expect comparable revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 20% and 20.5%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 450 basis points. The U.S. dollar has strengthened further against most currencies since we last provided guidance in November. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1.09. We expect this unfavorable impact to be acute again in the second quarter with a revenue headwind of over 400 basis points on a comparable basis. We expect our currency-neutral revenue growth to be back in line with our guidance range of 4.5% to 5%. In the second half of the year, we expect the currency impact on revenue to moderate.
We continue to expect growth in BD Medical of 4.5% to 5%. In our Life Sciences segment, we are revising our guidance to 4% to 4.5% to reflect the mild flu season in combination with lower sales in China. 
Based on the current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be about flat for the year. We continue to expect gross profit margin to be between 52% and 52.5% as the benefit from operating efficiencies, the sale of BD Rx and lower resin prices are expected to be partially offset by increased currency pressure. SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 24% and 24.5%. This is slightly better than our previous forecast as a result of the suspension of the Medical Device Tax, which was recorded within SSG&A. As we reinvest the medical device tax, we now expect R&D investment of about 6% to 6.5% of revenues. The reinvestment will help us to accelerate the strategies in both of our segments.
Operating margin is expected to be between 21% and 22% of revenues as a result of the items I just reviewed. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we are raising our underlying operating margin guidance to 170 to 190 basis points. Once again, we are very pleased with our performance in driving margin expansion. 
We are broadening our tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. 
Our full-year guidance range is for operating cash flow, capital expenditures, interest/other and share count remain unchanged from our November guidance. 
Now I would like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

In early December, we successfully launched our FACSCelesta instrument, a mid-level cell analyzer with a very positive market reception. The new FACSCelesta system offers simultaneous measurement of up to 14 different single cell characteristics. The FACSCelesta system is also designed to leverage our broad BD Horizon Brilliant reagent portfolio. 
In our Diagnostic Systems business, we continue to focus on menu expansion and anticipate launching new assays on the BD MAX platform in fiscal year 2016, including CT/GC and Vaginitis. 
Within our strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have divested the BD Rx business and are excited to be adding IV solutions to our Medication Management portfolio. 
We continue to make progress with our portfolio strategic review process and will provide you with updates as we move forward.
In January, we launched our new BD brand that captures the new BD and our rearticulated purpose, advancing the world of health, which is more relevant than ever in a dynamic and ever-changing industry.
And in the equally important area of partnerships and collaborations, we remain on track with our collaboration with Medtronic. The insulin infusion sets in our Diabetes Care business have an expected product launch in the middle of the fiscal year 2016, so this year. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing silent occlusions, simplify the user's experience and increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping. 
We continue to see strong growth in opportunities in our IDAST business, where we have built a comprehensive solution offering, which includes the BD Bruker MALDI Biotyper. This is a result of the collaboration with Bruker Corporation. We've seen success over the past several years with the BD Bruker MBT instrument due to its ability to provide rapid and accurate microbial identification and its adoption in new geographic markets. As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities that drive growth and innovation, and we look forward to updating you as we make progress throughout the year.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 18. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the first quarter, and we made progress with our back office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018. 
Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs as we discussed earlier. The consistent solid performance of our business, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in fiscal year 2015, we expect another 170 to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year.
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid start to fiscal year 2016. Both segments performed well, and we delivered very strong earnings growth. Second, our margin profile has improved significantly. We are driving operational efficiencies and continuous improvement in addition to delivering on our synergy commitments. This is manifesting in our financial results with 200 basis points of operating margin expansion this quarter and increased guidance for the total year. Third, we continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio and focus on the appropriate strategic initiatives. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher growth areas, which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers. Finally, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We are also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. We believe we are well-positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders and I look to the future with enthusiasm. Thank you. 
We will now open the call to questions."

Just to remind everyone that there was very difficult comps, a strong flu season last year. We had CareFusion's last final quarter, and we talked in our prepared remarks about the 6.7% growth that we were jumping over, including the CareFusion 10% growth. And then we had a number of items like in Pharmacy Solutions, where we have the typical timing compares. All of that goes away. In fact, it reverses in the second half. So if you remember, the CareFusion businesses actually grew minus 2% in the third quarter. So actually, we expect the second quarter to be back in basically the range that we normally have, the 4.5% to 5%. And you'll start picking up more in the back half of the year against that CareFusion compare. Don't forget, we had the AVEA recall in respiratory, so that becomes an easier compare. Emerging markets actually start comparing to more normalized results. You saw China this year; the first quarter of last year was 23% growth, we had a jump-over. So all of that starts reversing. And so we are confident in our full year guidance."

So taking China first, the weakness was really on the capital side. It was in Life Science. And it does not appear to be driven so much by the financial situation as it was driven more by this issue that we brought up last quarter, which is the auditing of large capital purchases. So we're seeing that in China, and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year. On the disposable side, we did fine. And these are products that sustain the health care system. And so we expect stability in China on that side. That's really the difference as we look around the emerging markets. That's the biggest difference. If I talk about Latin America, Latin America is basically -- Brazil is where we said it was and then with stronger performance in the other countries. So in terms of inventory, as you heard, we made inventory adjustments on the Medical side last time. And coming back to the Diagnostic piece, we actually thought that it was more of a timing issue, this audit issue. We're now saying that's going away, so we came back and we did make the inventory adjustment on the Diagnostic side because of the change in the situation. Chris, anything else you would add?"

The one thing that I would say is that 4% additional is things like the sale of BD Rx. Oil prices continue to give us a lift as the price per barrel went from 50 to 30. And so whether you call those synergies or -- it's all good. I mean what I would point to on that chart is that, that $9.01 to $9.08 represents a 37% to 38% increase over where we would have been on a BDX legacy guidance basis. And so how you characterize that, whether it's just accretion or synergies, that's somewhat semantics. I mean, we were growing over the expectation that we would have grown 9% to 10% anyway. So we've stayed pure on that. But the tax rate improvements, are those synergies? Yes, they're synergies as well, it's just not what we had originally contemplated in the deal. So we've tried to keep a very clear and transparent view of what is synergies and what's accretion. And that 4%, as I said, I wouldn't call those synergies. We are not raising our synergy guidance as we did last quarter because these are just kind of other things that are benefiting our cost structure and bottom line that hadn't been contemplated in November. So for what we control, we're really executing extremely well, very pleased with it. But obviously, the FX drag is worse. In that regard, since November, the euro has stabilized at 1.09. Of that 4% drag additional in FX, 1% comes from the euro remaining at that 1.09. And then another percent from other major currencies like Canada, for example, it's down 8% or 7% since November. Mexico is down 8%. China is down 3%. So that's another percent of that 4%. The other 2% is every other currency in the world is weak against the U.S. dollar compared to where it was in November. And so that's another 2%. So the additional 4% drag. So we don't really have a lot of control over that. We do everything we can to mitigate that. So what we control, we're really feeling good about, but we are going against significant FX headwinds. But we really feel good about the fact that we were able to still meet our commitment of $8.37 to $8.44 despite those significant FX headwinds."

But if I look at the portfolio and the number of new products, I would say we're in a strong position. I mean, it's across both the segments and it's over the next 3-year period. And so both portfolios on the Medical side and the Life Science side appear good. As I mentioned on the call, we feel very excited about the launch of the infusion set, the FlowSmart set. We haven't talked much about it lately, but SAIS is making progress with their micro infuser, and we have signed up a number of customers there. And so we're starting to see some nice momentum in SAIS. I'm not going to try to walk through all of the new products across MPS and MMS, but there is a nice portfolio, and Tom would tell you, in addition, that the backlog for Pyxis remains very robust.

So that would explain the delay because of the Bruker exclusivity. We are seeing, though, very good progress competitively in that space with now a more expanded solution to offer. And then as you note, we are seeing great performance ex U.S. now with a more expanded platform that includes our Totalys and focal point system for a full liquid cytology solution.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our first fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website. 
As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD. The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures, in the financial schedules, in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Bill Kozy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.

As we stated in our press release, we are pleased with our solid start to fiscal year 2016. Performance from both the Medical and Life Science segments contributed to revenue growth that was in line with our expectations. Strong underlying margin expansion was driven by the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, coupled with the positive impact of synergies.
As we move through the first quarter, we continue to make progress with the strategic review of our portfolio. Many of you already know, we recently announced that Fresenius Kabi has acquired the BD Simplist portfolio. We believe Fresenius is a better owner of the BD Rx business as it complements their existing products and capabilities in the injectable pharmaceutical industry. In addition, we are excited that we are initiating a long-term collaboration for Fresenius to supply us with a portfolio of competitive IV solutions in the U.S. This transaction is intended to enable BD to be responsive to our customers' needs and is complementary to our end-to-end Medication Management Solutions for our customers and their patients.
Since we provided guidance in November, there have been a number of new dynamics that will affect our results this year. As most of you already know, several weeks ago, there was a bipartisan agreement to suspend the Medical Device Tax. This critical relief is extremely important to BD as well as the patients, providers and research communities we serve. While some of the specifics are still being analyzed, we plan to reinvest this tax back into the business, which further supports our innovation strategy. 
In summary, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We're also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year.
Moving on to Slide 5, I will review our first quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues grew 1.8%, which is in line with our prior guidance of 1% to 2% growth that we had anticipated and communicated on our last earnings call. Adjusting for tough comparisons for the prior year, this reflects solid underlying growth in both segments. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.96, driven by the solid underlying performance of the segments. Earnings were ahead of our expectations as the quarter also benefited from product mix that was incremental to already strong gross margin performance and some timing of expenses and below the line items.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,321567599,926012,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, performance in both segments contributed to a solid start to fiscal 2016. Total first quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion grew 1.8% on a comparable basis, which is in line with o",1864,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, performance in both segments contributed to a solid start to fiscal 2016. Total first quarter revenues of approximately $3 billion grew 1.8% on a comparable basis, which is in line with our previously disclosed guidance. Our growth rate this quarter reflects a tough comparison to strong prior year results of 6.7% organic growth, which includes CareFusion's final quarter as a stand-alone company, growing at 10% organically. As a reminder, our results last year were driven by robust performance in the legacy CareFusion businesses, the impact of timing of orders in Pharmaceutical Systems, a very strong flu season, timing of tenders and strong emerging market performance. As a result, these items negatively impacted our first quarter growth rate by over 240 basis points. On an underlying basis, we are pleased with the solid performance of our segments and the momentum in our businesses.
BD Medical first quarter revenues increased 1.9%, reflecting the aforementioned items. Medication & Procedural Solutions or MPS growth was 2.0%, which reflects strength in Pharmacy Solutions, Infusion Therapy and safety-engineered products. Very strong results in the prior year negatively impacted the MPS growth rate by approximately 250 basis points. 
Despite extremely strong results in the prior year in Medication Management Solutions, revenues grew 4.3%, driven by both strong infusion and dispensing capital installations. Respiratory Solutions revenues declined 6.8%, reflecting the tough comparison to prior year results due to the strong final quarter as part of legacy CareFusion. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.9%, driven by solid growth in pen needles. 
Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 2.6% reflect strong growth in SAIS, partially offset by the impact of timing of orders, which we expect to occur later this fiscal year. 
BD Life Sciences first quarter revenues increased 1.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Preanalytical Systems growth of 4.4% was driven by safety-engineered products in both the U.S. and Europe and also reflects strong growth in emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 1.2% reflects clinical tendered delays in emerging markets and a difficult comparison to the prior year when sequestration ended. This was offset by strong sales that were driven by an increased demand of high-end instruments and growth in research reagents. The Diagnostic Systems decline of 0.8% reflects a mild flu season, which impacted growth by approximately 400 basis points. Growth was also negatively impacted by a slowdown of capital spending in China. Solid microbiology growth as well as growth in molecular led by BD MAX and international growth in Women's Health partially offset the impact from the flu.
Moving to Slide 8, I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the first quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth of 1.5% reflects the aforementioned prior year comparisons and timing impacts with BD Medical growing 1.9% and BD Life Sciences growing 0.3%. BD Medical's performance reflects strength in Pharmacy Solutions, Infusion Therapy pumps and related consumables and strength in Diabetes Care. This was partially offset by Respiratory Solutions. BD Life Sciences growth reflects the impact of a light flu season this year and a difficult comparison to the prior year due to a strong flu season and the ending of sequestration. Offsetting these impacts was strong performance in the Biosciences business driven by research reagent sales, solid performance in our Preanalytical Systems unit, growth in microbiology and growth from BD MAX.
Moving on to International, revenues grew 2.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which reflects timing of tenders and capital installations. International revenues also reflect the moderation of growth in China in the quarter, and I'll provide more color on China in just a moment.
The medical segment grew 1.9%. This reflects solid performance in Pharmaceutical Systems and Medication Management Solutions, partially offset by a tough comparison due to large tenders in Brazil and EMA in the prior year as well as timing of capital installations in the dispensing business.
Our Life Sciences segment grew 2.7%, which reflects strong growth in Diagnostic Systems driven by core microbiology, Women's Health and an expanded BD MAX menu in Europe. We also saw strong growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit. This was partially offset by a decline in the Biosciences business due to tender delays in emerging markets.
On Slide 9, emerging market revenues grew 2.4% currency-neutral, with developed markets growing 1.7%. The first quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects a very difficult comparison to the prior year period, both the BD and CareFusion legacy businesses and a moderation of growth in China.
China growth for the first quarter was 4.5% compared with growth of over 23% in the first quarter of last year. This difficult comparison was in line with our expectations. Beyond the difficult comparison, we also experienced a continued slowdown of capital spending in Diagnostic Systems, which resulted in inventory adjustments. Inventory adjustments negatively impacted growth in the quarter by approximately 350 basis points. While there are pockets of pressure, millions of patients are entering the health care system and, overall, emerging markets continue to be an important growth driver. For the total year, we expect China to grow in the low double-digit range and total emerging markets to grow 9% to 10%.
Moving to global safety on Slide 10, currency-neutral sales increased 4.9% and grew to $737 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S., grew 3.8%, while international sales grew 6.5% currency-neutral, with continued strength in Europe as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 10.9% in emerging markets. Medical Safety sales grew 5.4%, primarily driven by safety catheters and a range of products in Pharmaceutical Systems. Life Science safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.1% in the quarter.
Slide 11 recaps the first quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 1.8% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was about flat in the quarter.
Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which includes CareFusion results in the prior year, in order to give a better indication of our performance. 
Gross profit improved by 3.6%. I'll provide more color on gross profit in the next slide when we look at underlying performance and the impact of currency.
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. 
R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.3% as we continue to invest in new products and innovation. 
Operating income grew 12%, reflecting strong P&L leverage, which I'll also address in more detail on the next slide. 
Our tax rate increased slightly. However, it continues to improve versus our initial deal model expectations. 
As discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $1.96, which is a 45.8% increase versus the prior year. This reflects solid underlying performance from the segments, positive product mix that was incremental to already strong gross margin performance, some timing of expenses and below the line items.
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the first quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 130 basis points was primarily driven by continuous improvement initiatives and product mix and to a lesser extent, favorable raw material prices. Building off the strong momentum in fiscal year 2015 of 100 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion, operating margins grew 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion, combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies, continuous improvement and the positive impact of cost synergies. Currency had a negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins.
Moving on to Slide 14. Since we provided guidance in November, there have been a number of new dynamics that we anticipate will affect our results. Some of these items include the sale of BD Rx, the suspension of the Medical Device Tax, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, lower oil prices, a milder flu season and additional FX pressure. As a result of these new dynamics, in combination with our first quarter results, we are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance by 4 percentage points from $8.73 to $8.80 to a range of $9.01 to $9.08. The increased currency-neutral guidance is offset by incremental FX pressures of approximately $0.28 due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Therefore, we are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance of $8.37 to $8.44. We are extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments.
Turning to Slide 15, I'd like to walk you through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. In summary, we continue to expect comparable revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 20% and 20.5%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 450 basis points. The U.S. dollar has strengthened further against most currencies since we last provided guidance in November. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1.09. We expect this unfavorable impact to be acute again in the second quarter with a revenue headwind of over 400 basis points on a comparable basis. We expect our currency-neutral revenue growth to be back in line with our guidance range of 4.5% to 5%. In the second half of the year, we expect the currency impact on revenue to moderate.
We continue to expect growth in BD Medical of 4.5% to 5%. In our Life Sciences segment, we are revising our guidance to 4% to 4.5% to reflect the mild flu season in combination with lower sales in China. 
Based on the current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be about flat for the year. We continue to expect gross profit margin to be between 52% and 52.5% as the benefit from operating efficiencies, the sale of BD Rx and lower resin prices are expected to be partially offset by increased currency pressure. SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 24% and 24.5%. This is slightly better than our previous forecast as a result of the suspension of the Medical Device Tax, which was recorded within SSG&A. As we reinvest the medical device tax, we now expect R&D investment of about 6% to 6.5% of revenues. The reinvestment will help us to accelerate the strategies in both of our segments.
Operating margin is expected to be between 21% and 22% of revenues as a result of the items I just reviewed. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we are raising our underlying operating margin guidance to 170 to 190 basis points. Once again, we are very pleased with our performance in driving margin expansion. 
We are broadening our tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. 
Our full year guidance range is for operating cash flow, capital expenditures, interest/other and share count remain unchanged from our November guidance. 
Now I would like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

Moving on to Slide 17, we are presenting a new slide that includes updates on our new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. With this new format, we will provide business updates each quarter. The product update slides that you are accustomed to seeing will remain in the appendix of the presentation for reference.
Starting with new product innovation, within our Life Sciences business, we are very pleased with the early access customer response to BD FACSSymphony, a novel cell analyzer enabling the simultaneous measurement of up to 50 different characteristics of a single cell. BD FACSSymphony offers high-speed analysis that is 20x faster than other nonflow platforms. When combined with our BD Horizon Brilliant or the Sirigen reagent portfolio, these capabilities will allow researchers improved identification and analysis of rare cell types and events.
In early December, we successfully launched our FACSCelesta instrument, a mid-level cell analyzer with a very positive market reception. The new FACSCelesta system offers simultaneous measurement of up to 14 different single cell characteristics. The FACSCelesta system is also designed to leverage our broad BD Horizon Brilliant reagent portfolio. 
In our Diagnostic Systems business, we continue to focus on menu expansion and anticipate launching new assays on the BD MAX platform in fiscal year 2016, including CT/GC and Vaginitis. 
Within our strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have divested the BD Rx business and are excited to be adding IV solutions to our Medication Management portfolio. 
We continue to make progress with our portfolio strategic review process and will provide you with updates as we move forward.
In January, we launched our new BD brand that captures the new BD and our rearticulated purpose, advancing the world of health, which is more relevant than ever in a dynamic and ever-changing industry.
And in the equally important area of partnerships and collaborations, we remain on track with our collaboration with Medtronic. The insulin infusion sets in our Diabetes Care business have an expected product launch in the middle of the fiscal year 2016, so this year. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing silent occlusions, simplify the user's experience and increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping. 
We continue to see strong growth in opportunities in our IDAST business, where we have built a comprehensive solution offering, which includes the BD Bruker MALDI Biotyper. This is a result of the collaboration with Bruker Corporation. We've seen success over the past several years with the BD Bruker MBT instrument due to its ability to provide rapid and accurate microbial identification and its adoption in new geographic markets. As you can see, we continue to have strong opportunities that drive growth and innovation, and we look forward to updating you as we make progress throughout the year.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 18. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the first quarter, and we made progress with our back office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018. 
Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs as we discussed earlier. The consistent solid performance of our business, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in fiscal year 2015, we expect another 170 to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year.
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid start to fiscal year 2016. Both segments performed well, and we delivered very strong earnings growth. Second, our margin profile has improved significantly. We are driving operational efficiencies and continuous improvement in addition to delivering on our synergy commitments. This is manifesting in our financial results with 200 basis points of operating margin expansion this quarter and increased guidance for the total year. Third, we continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio and focus on the appropriate strategic initiatives. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher growth areas, which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers. Finally, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance. We are also maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance despite significant currency headwinds and are raising our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. We believe we are well-positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders and I look to the future with enthusiasm. Thank you. 
We will now open the call to questions."

We had CareFusion's last final quarter, and we talked in our prepared remarks about the 6.7% growth that we were jumping over, including the CareFusion 10% growth. And then we had a number of items like in Pharmacy Solutions, where we have the typical timing compares. All of that goes away. In fact, it reverses in the second half. So if you remember, the CareFusion businesses actually grew minus 2% in the third quarter. So actually, we expect the second quarter to be back in basically the range that we normally have, the 4.5% to 5%. And you'll start picking up more in the back half of the year against that CareFusion compare. Don't forget, we had the AVEA recall in respiratory, so that becomes an easier compare. Emerging markets actually start comparing to more normalized results. You saw China this year; the first quarter of last year was 23% growth, we had a jump-over. So all of that starts reversing. And so we are confident in our full year guidance."

So taking China first, the weakness was really on the capital side. It was in Life Science. And it does not appear to be driven so much by the financial situation as it was driven more by this issue that we brought up last quarter, which is the auditing of large capital purchases. So we're seeing that in China, and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year. On the disposable side, we did fine. And these are products that sustain the health care system. And so we expect stability in China on that side. That's really the difference as we look around the emerging markets. That's the biggest difference. If I talk about Latin America, Latin America is basically -- Brazil is where we said it was and then with stronger performance in the other countries. So in terms of inventory, as you heard, we made inventory adjustments on the Medical side last time. And coming back to the Diagnostic piece, we actually thought that it was more of a timing issue, this audit issue. We're now saying that's going away, so we came back and we did make the inventory adjustment on the Diagnostic side because of the change in the situation. Chris, anything else you would add?"

The one thing that I would say is that 4% additional is things like the sale of BD Rx. Oil prices continue to give us a lift as the price per barrel went from 50 to 30. And so whether you call those synergies or -- it's all good. I mean what I would point to on that chart is that, that $9.01 to $9.08 represents a 37% to 38% increase over where we would have been on a BDX legacy guidance basis. And so how you characterize that, whether it's just accretion or synergies, that's somewhat semantics. I mean, we were growing over the expectation that we would have grown 9% to 10% anyway. So we've stayed pure on that. But the tax rate improvements, are those synergies? Yes, they're synergies as well, it's just not what we had originally contemplated in the deal. So we've tried to keep a very clear and transparent view of what is synergies and what's accretion. And that 4%, as I said, I wouldn't call those synergies. We are not raising our synergy guidance as we did last quarter because these are just kind of other things that are benefiting our cost structure and bottom line that hadn't been contemplated in November. So for what we control, we're really executing extremely well, very pleased with it. But obviously, the FX drag is worse. In that regard, since November, the euro has stabilized at 1.09. Of that 4% drag additional in FX, 1% comes from the euro remaining at that 1.09. And then another percent from other major currencies like Canada, for example, it's down 8% or 7% since November. Mexico is down 8%. China is down 3%. So that's another percent of that 4%. The other 2% is every other currency in the world is weak against the U.S. dollar compared to where it was in November. And so that's another 2%. So the additional 4% drag. So we don't really have a lot of control over that. We do everything we can to mitigate that. So what we control, we're really feeling good about, but we are going against significant FX headwinds. But we really feel good about the fact that we were able to still meet our commitment of $8.37 to $8.44 despite those significant FX headwinds."

We have, for example, respiratory wasn't even shipping in China, towards the second half of last year, so that makes it an easier compare as well. So that's where we get the low double digits.

So I'll just put it into 2 here. But one in China, I guess maybe Vince or Linda, can you maybe talk a little bit more on the Life Sciences weakness on the auditing of large capital purchases? It seems like about 12 months later than what most Life Science companies have been seeing. Or most of them saw it a year ago and reported pretty good results in China this year. So just curious kind of why you think you're seeing those delays more significantly than others in the Life Sciences space? And then I just wanted on the new products on Totalys, I think in your presentation, you have that still launching in the U.S. in '16. I'm just curious what you're seeing with that in Europe and whether that still on track for '16?"

If you recall, we mentioned last year that we signed an exclusive partnership with Bruker on the ID side in China, specifically. So as we are putting those instruments into the market, really starting in our first quarter fiscal year '15, we had expectations on those that clearly in the first quarter, we saw that the overall number of tenders being issued were not at the level that we were expecting. So that would explain the delay because of the Bruker exclusivity. We are seeing, though, very good progress competitively in that space with now a more expanded solution to offer. And then as you note, we are seeing great performance ex U.S. now with a more expanded platform that includes our Totalys and focal point system for a full liquid cytology solution. So we saw this quarter high double-digit growth ex U.S. on those platforms. And the anticipated launch date for us in the U.S. is in FY '16.

And then below the line, there is a little bit in tax rate. So the 21.5% is a little bit better than expectations, and we see that flowing through to the total year. We were slightly better in interest income and slightly less in interest expense. You put all those things in and that flows through to the full year. Of course, it's overwhelmed by the items that I talked about with -- the oil prices being down will benefit the second half of the year as well as the sale of BD Rx.

The other 2/3 we are still getting the projects in place and we do fully expect to spend that this year. There might be a little bit of timing issue. Obviously, in the month of January, we're getting the benefit and we're only executing on the 1/3. So we'll probably just naturally pick up a little bit in timing, but not a lot, and that's already in the guidance. But we fully expect to reinvest, and we want to reinvest and we're going through that process now. And then the second question was China.

So for this quarter, we did see very good growth in our biopharma side, particularly in our Advanced Bioprocessing business, a business we do not talk about a lot but is doing very, very well for us. So that was a tremendous area of growth. And then as we've been talking about for the past several quarters, led by the U.S., our Total Research Solutions platform now, we feel very good about the prospects for that business.

A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the BD.com website. 
As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD. The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. 
In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules, in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. 
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

As we stated in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter growth profile. Our results this quarter highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio with both segments contributing to revenue growth. We continue to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement coupled with the positive impact of cost synergies. 
As many of you already know, in March, we celebrated the 1 year anniversary of the closing of CareFusion, and we are extremely proud of our achievements over the past year. We have been acutely focused on the integration, and a significant amount of work has been driven by the integration teams across the businesses. 
In terms of talent retention, we have a strong team that's in place that's comprised of both legacy CareFusion and legacy BD associates. They've been helping drive the company through our next phase of growth as a combined entity. 
In terms of our customers, we are becoming increasingly more relevant as they look -- as they are looking for providers that can really help them improve the quality, efficiency and safety processes. We have made good progress on this front 12 months postclose, and feedback from our customers has been a fairly positive. 
Also we had been actively working to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products and expanding their global reach by leveraging BD's global infrastructure. We are well into the registration process with dozens of products across multiple geographies. I will provide more details on this later in the presentation. 
Lastly, we are seeing strong productivity as we are overdelivering on our initial cost synergy capture commitments. As you already know, we have increased our total cost synergy target by about $100 million over the deal's horizon. We are clearly advancing our strategy to improve medication management. The value we bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we make progress integrating these 2 great companies. 
We're also pleased to inform you that the annual strategic review of our portfolio is now complete. In March, we announced that BD and Apax Partners, a private equity firm, will form a joint venture with Respiratory Solutions business. Apax will establish and stand up a newco, enabling more strategic focus and investment to build a leading global respiratory company. 
And more recently, we announced the divestiture of our vertebral augmentation solutions business. This product line was not aligned with our strategy, and we believe it can see more robust investment in growth under a different owner. The completion of our current strategic review process enables the company to remain focused on the areas we believe are high growth and aligned with our core capabilities. 
In addition, during our last call, we let you know about our intent to reinvest the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax that went into effect in January. Since that time, we have already allocated increased R&D dollars to highly strategic initiatives. Not only will this help to fund drive future growth for the company, but it will also enable better outcomes for our customers and their patients. 
Looking forward to the total year, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our fiscal 2016 currency-neutral revenue and EPS guidance. We are also increasing our adjusted guidance to reflect lower currency headwinds due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and other currencies. 
Moving to Slide 5. I will review our second quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company revenues grew 5.3% or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. Adjusted EPS of $2.18 was ahead of our expectations as the quarter benefited in part from some timing within the year. 
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,329827360,973576,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to a very solid second quarter results. Total second quarter revenues of approximately $3.1 billion grew 5.3% on a comp",1857,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to a very solid second quarter results. 
Total second quarter revenues of approximately $3.1 billion grew 5.3% on a comparable basis or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. This was slightly ahead of our expectations as the quarter benefited by about 50 basis points from the timing of revenues, which occurred earlier than expected. I'll discuss this as I take you through the business results. 
BD Medical's second quarter revenues increased 6.1%, reflecting solid growth across the segment. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 4%, which reflects strength in Infusion Therapy, safety-engineered products and infection prevention. Medication Management Solutions revenues grew 6%, driven by strong dispensing capital installations with our Pyxis platform. Pyxis ES demand was strong in the quarter, driven by several large customer conversions, and we saw a positive impact from our efforts to simplify the installation process. 
We also saw a solid growth in the infusion business, where we continue to expand our leadership position. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%, driven by pen needles and syringes. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 11% reflects a strong growth in SAIS. Performance in this business also reflected the favorable timing of customer orders that occurred 1 quarter earlier than we initially intended. 
Respiratory Solutions revenues increased 10.9%, reflecting the timing of capital placements, which similarly benefited the quarter as the placements were expected to occur later in the fiscal year. BD Life Sciences second quarter revenues increased 3.4%, driven by solid growth in Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems units. Preanalytical Systems growth of 5.7% was driven by safety-engineered products in the U.S. and solid growth in Europe and emerging markets. 
Diagnostic Systems growth of 4.6% was a result of strong growth in core microbiology, including IDAST and BD MAX assays. Growth was also aided in part by an increase in flu activity in the U.S. While the flu season is still mild in comparison to the prior year, the timing of the late flu season had a positive benefit year-over-year in the quarter of 10 basis points. 
Biosciences revenues were about flat when compared with last year's second quarter. Strong double-digit growth in the U.S. was driven by continued increased demand for high parameter instruments and growth in research reagents. This was offset by a 7% decline in Europe due to a difficult comparison related to timing of orders in the prior year. 
In addition, growth was negatively impacted by clinical tender delays in Africa associated with our HIV monitor related to the World Health Organization guidelines. 
Moving to Slide 8. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. revenues increased 5.7%. This was primarily driven by strength in Medication Management Solutions, Medication and Procedural Solutions, Biosciences and Diagnostics and was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of revenues. 
BD Medical's performance reflects strong dispensing capital installations and solid growth in the infusion business as well as strength in infection prevention and interventional specialties. BD Life Sciences growth reflects continued strong performance in the Biosciences business, driven by demand for high parameter research instruments and reagents sales. 
Diagnostic Systems had strong growth in microbiology, including KIESTRA and blood culture, BD MAX as well as a benefit from the increase in flu activity during the quarter. 
Moving on to international revenues grew 4.8%. This is below our normal growth rate and primarily reflects the aforementioned clinical tender delays in Africa. I'll provide more details on this in a moment. 
The Medical segment grew 6.9%. This reflects solid performance in Medication and Procedural Solutions, driven by sales of safety-engineered products, particularly in China and strong dispensing installations in Medication Management Solutions. Growth was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of customer ordering patterns and capital placements. 
The Life Sciences segment grew 1.4%. This reflects strong growth in Preanalytical Systems in Western Europe and Asia Pacific and strong growth in Western Europe and Latin America in Diagnostic Systems, driven by core microbiology. This was partially offset by the aforementioned tender delays in Africa and the difficult comparison in Europe in Biosciences. 
On Slide 9, emerging market revenues grew 5.1% currency neutral, with developed markets growing 5.3%. The second quarter growth rate in emerging market reflects solid growth in China and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in EMEA. China growth for the second quarter was 9.4%. Double-digit revenue growth in our Medical segment was driven by continued strong demand for consumables across all of our businesses in the segment. 
Within our Life Sciences segment, strength in Preanalytical Systems was offset by the slowdown of capital spending in Diagnostic Systems as communicated on our call last quarter. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. 
We now expect total emerging markets to grow in the high single-digit range compared to our previous guidance of 9% to 10% growth. This is offset by stronger performance in developed markets, growing between 4% and 4.5% for the second half of the year. 
Our revised guidance for emerging markets reflects the aforementioned impact in Africa to our Biosciences unit from the WHO guidelines. In addition, since we last provided guidance in February, the government of Saudi Arabia announced a new austerity measures, which affect the health care industry. This has begun to impact our business in that particular region, and we saw a small impact in the second quarter. We view this situation in Saudi Arabia as temporary though the timing of reversal may not occur within this fiscal year. Our new guidance range contemplates emerging markets growing between 10% and 12% for the second half of the year. 
Moving to global safety on Slide 10. Currency-neutral sales increased 6.7%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 4.5%, and international sales also grew 9.9% currency neutral, with continued strength in Europe as compliance with safety legislation continues. 
Safety revenues grew 15.6% in emerging markets. Medical Safety sales grew 8%, primarily driven by safety catheters. Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.6% in the quarter. 
Slide 11 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 5.3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. 
Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which include CareFusion's results in the prior year in order to give a better indication of our performance. Gross profit improved by 7.9%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at the underlying performance and the impact of currency. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.5%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.9%. Our expenditures in the quarter were slightly lower than our full year expectation of 6% to 6.5% of revenues due to the timing of spending. We continue to invest in new products and innovation and expect to further reinvest the benefits from the medical device tax suspension in the back half of the year. 
Operating income grew 24.8%, reflecting strong P&L leverage. In addition, as we had previously discussed, there were a number of items that negatively impacted operating margin in the prior year in the CareFusion business. I'll address the underlying growth in operating profit in more detail on the next slide. 
Our tax rate declined 70 basis points to 20.6%, below our full year expectation of 21% to 22% as the quarter included some timing benefits. As Vince discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $2.18, which is a 44.7% increase versus the prior year. This reflects our solid growth profile and strong underlying margin expansion. In addition, growth benefited from the timing of renewals earlier in the year than expected as well as timing within the year related to R&D expenditures and tax as we just discussed. 
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the second quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 170 basis points was primarily driven by robust operational performance and continuous improvement initiatives and, to a lesser extent, from favorable raw material prices. Strong operating margin performance of 370 basis points was primarily driven by gross margin expansion combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies and the positive impact of cost synergies. 
In addition, timing of R&D expenses and the benefit of the medical device tax suspension aided operating margin in the quarter. Also you will recall, several items drove low second quarter operating margins for CareFusion in the prior year. Currency had a slightly negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Since we provided guidance in February, the U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and other currencies. As a result, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance by 2% -- percentage points or $0.13 from a range of $8.37 to $8.44 to a range of $8.50 to $8.57. We are maintaining our currency neutral adjusted EPS guidance of $9.01 to $9.08 as we expect the second quarter tax timing to reverse and R&D spend to ramp over the back half of the year, which includes reinvestment of the medical device tax. We remain extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like you to walk you through the additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. In summary, we continue to expect comparable organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis, with the back half of the year growing between 5.5% and 6.5%. This contemplates the third quarter growth rate to be slightly lower than our full year guidance range and the fourth quarter to be well above the full year guidance range. 
On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 21.5% and 22%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 300 basis points, an improvement from our prior guidance of about 450 basis points of currency headwinds. The U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and most currencies since we last provided guidance in February. While our guidance assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.13 for the rest of the year, which is better than the actual rate from the second half of last year, we see some remaining FX headwinds over the second half as noneuro currencies remain unfavorable year-over-year. 
We continue to expect growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical and 4% to 4.5% in our Life Sciences segment. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be about flat for the year. Beyond revenue and EPS, all other P&L guidance from February remains unchanged. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

Moving on to Slide 17 and our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. Starting with new product innovation, within our Life Sciences business, our Preanalytical Systems business launched 2 new products this quarter: the UltraTouch Push Button Blood Collection Sets will deliver significant improvements in patient outcomes and lab efficiency. The BD Barricor tubes used gel-free technology, which significantly improves sample quality and lab turnaround time. The initial market feedback on both these products has been extremely positive. 
In our Bioscience business, as evidenced by our U.S. growth rate this quarter, we have seen very positive market uptake of our high parameter instrumentation, the FACSSymphony X-50 and X-20. In our genomics business, we anticipate launching our GenCell click library preparation platform and our FACSseq Cell Sorter designed specifically for genomics applications later this year -- this fiscal year. 
Within strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have completed our current portfolio review, having recently announced the Respiratory Solutions joint venture and sale of the vertebral augmentation solutions business. We remain focused on the areas we believe are high growth and aligned with our core capabilities. 
We have also made progress with our product registrations, having successfully registered more than 50 CareFusion products in over 20 countries. In addition, we have submitted registrations and are awaiting approval for an additional 25 products. This is consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies, and we remain on track for them to begin to materialize in fiscal year 2017. 
And in the areas of partnerships and collaborations, we remain excited for the launch of our infusion set, which we expect will move to broad commercial release with Medtronic in early fiscal year 2017. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing flow interruptions, simplify the user's experience and increase the patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping. 
We recently entered into a strategic partnership with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and we'll play a part in the Institute's vision of reducing cancer to a manageable disease. Support from the Parker Institute will help us advance our new cell sorter program while bringing our high parameter cell analysis solutions to these researchers as they work to discover the next breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy. As you can see, we are executing on our strategy and continue to have strong opportunities to drive growth and innovation. We look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 18. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the second quarter, and we made progress with our back-office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. 
We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018. Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs as we discussed earlier. 
The consistent, solid performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion we achieved last year, we expect another 170 to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year. 
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid second quarter. Both segments performed well, and our performance highlights the benefits of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. 
Second, we have made significant progress on the acquisition of CareFusion. The value we can bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we integrate these 2 great companies. 
Third, we have taken steps to optimize our portfolio. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher-growth areas, which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers. 
Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. We're maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance and raising our adjusted EPS. We believe we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders. I look to the future with optimism. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

But the other thing that you are seeing is that our businesses are performing quite well. You heard us talk about in the Bioscience business, the launch of those new products. We have a whole series of new products coming out, and I mentioned specifically the high parameter work that's going on. So yes, that showed up in this quarter right now, but that's going to continue as we move through the year. You also saw good performance in Diagnostics because we're getting some traction, blood culture and KIESTRA, that is moving forward, KIESTRA moving forward in the U.S. and then good performance across the Medical businesses, where we -- we're improving our competitive position in MMS, and so you see all of that coming together. Europe, I think, once again, I think, has stabilized, and it's really, of course, you have to drop out the CareFusion factors, but there was negative timing in Biosciences, but you've got the same product launches that are occurring there. Quite frankly, Japan is forming -- is performing better for us as well. Now on the other side of the coin, the situation in China seems to have stabilized. We're seeing good performance on the medical device side of the business, and the situation really hasn't changed all that much on Diagnostics on the capital side, but it had stabilized, and so we're getting good growth in China. We didn't mention it, we continue to get good growth in India. We're getting good growth in Latin America. There was some onetime events this quarter, which you heard in terms of Africa and Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia is more of an impact in the back half of the year. So yes, this is slightly less in emerging markets, yes. But the mix is quite good."

So you've got to really look at those absolute dollars. Looking at growth rates is a little misleading because the growth rate last year was negative in CareFusion and the third quarter, but that was more about the comparative prior year. But the absolute dollars are the grow over. And then as you model out the year, based on the guidance that we just gave you in terms of growth rates for the third and fourth quarter, you'll see steadily improving sequential revenue dollars for all 4 quarters this year.

Essentially all of those products fall within either MPS or MMS, the 2 businesses that are -- came from legacy CareFusion, and the majority of those products are actually within MPS. So think disposables, and this is right in line with what we had talked about over the last several quarters that as we think about the first products that would be able to help drive incremental revenue growth, it would be things like infusion sets, ChloraPrep, the consumables that fit very well with BD's traditional sales channels and market approaches and presence in the marketplaces, and those are the products that we focused on getting registration for first. So I would say we're seeing some early signs of success as we've been launching these products, which is very consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and really remain on track to start seeing them materialize more in 2017, but we do see sales now and obviously, on a company the size of BD and a segment of Medical, we'll see those start showing up more materially as we roll into '17, but they have started. And I would just say that obviously, we're going to continue those product registration work. We're continuing to the sales and marketing investments to support those initiatives, but overall, we're on track."

And the dynamic there is a couple of things. One is although the euro has improved, the noneuro currencies year-over-year are still providing a bit of a drag. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, is the phenomenon of the profit and inventory that we've talked about in the past so didn't quite catch up in the second quarter. Certainly, not much of a drag, and it's starting to level off and that, in my prepared remarks, was the commentary for the second half of the year. It doesn't really turn positive because of that phenomenon, but it certainly lightens up in terms of headwinds."

So we are actually quite pleased with the progress that we're making on Pyxis. As we actually just released another new version of the software, which we think really, it makes some very significant progress and actually addresses -- we'll make a big step forward in terms of installation efficiency, and so as we've shared in the past, we were really focused on improving the installation process. We had shared that there's quite large backlog at the time of the acquisition. And to really address that backlog, we needed to improve the installation efficiency process, and we've been working on that, applying some of our lean expertise as well as making some adjustments in the software that would automate a lot of that and simplify the other workload in the field. So we're seeing a lot of those efforts come to fruition. We did have very strong placements in Q2 that was part of the driver of MMS growth. We continue to see strong demand for the Pyxis ES platform, and we're equally looking forward to continued strong growth in the second half of the year in that as Vince alluded to earlier. So on the infusion side, we also are very pleased with the growth that we saw in the quarter here and have similar expectations for the back half of the year. As you know, we are the market leader in that space. We continue to strengthen our position over the last several years. We expect to continue to strengthen our position in the market by about the same amount this year as we have over the last couple of years. We do see customers continue to select the BD Alaris pumps in the incremental way really based on that interoperability and the power of one to be able to do all their infusion needs across both large volume infusions, syringes and narcotics, all in one product, the only item that can do that. So we're happy there. I would point out as well that as you look at our safety sales, particularly in the U.S., that was largely driven by growth in our -- in some of the connectors that are associated with our dedicated sets in the infusion category, and that's really a reflection of that strong performance in that infusion category and that renewing consumable stream that comes as we place pumps incrementally.

So let me start again on that question. So on -- in terms of cost synergies, we did, I would remind you, improve cost synergies fairly recently up to the 3 25 to 3 50, and that was identification of some new synergies from our recent or our original model. I would also remind you that we increased the overall synergies from the standpoint of the tax rate improvements that we saw that we originally didn't contemplate, and that's another 3% accretion that we had mentioned. Really, when you think about the synergies, we get initial synergies of duplicate public company costs. Then you move into the integration of systems and infrastructure, and we've gotten good traction on that, and that led to the last increase. And then towards the end are the more difficult synergies to get, which are the distribution centers and manufacturing plants, and we actually saw some good initial improvements in that area or traction in that area that led to our last increase. So we really feel great about what we're driving. All in, all in, it's significantly higher than our original expectations, particularly when you add the tax synergy. You see this year, the EPS quarter-over-quarter was over 44%, I think, is an indication of that. So we really feel good about our ability to drive those of synergies and executing on those synergies."

That was driven again by the very strong gross profit margin, which is really going around operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, a little bit of benefit from raw material prices as we talked in the past from oil. But on the operating side, SSG&A really reflective of getting on the synergies. It was a little bit of an easier compare in the second quarter because of the operating margin challenges in CareFusion that quarter last year. So you won't expect 370. In fact, we expect about 170 to 190 for the year on the operating margin basis. I'd remind you that's on top of of 100 basis of margin improvement last year. So really, improving the margins as you point out. As we think about going forward, as we execute on synergies, you would expect to see above normal. So we usually think 40 to 50 basis points of margin improvement. You're going to get more of that as we execute on the synergies in '17 and '18. You would also get a little bit of a lift from the fact that as we exit respiratory, which had challenging margins, you get a little bit of a lift. So not to give guidance on '17, but you're absolutely right. Directionally, we're going to see improved margins going forward in '17 and '18. And then as you start lapping those synergies, I think somewhere beyond that, you start going back to that 40 to 50 basis points. That's a few years out."

Outside the U.S., we're actually seeing a strong double-digit performance. And then the entire platform, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. is being helped by the tool automation we are doing across both our point and our Totalys system. So complete control of the sample from collection through the results. So that's a driving a lot of growth both in the U.S. and ex U.S. for us."

I believe this change in mix should benefit operating margin. It doesn't seem like your guidance reflects that margin mix dynamic. Am I wrong? And if not, why? And then the second question is for Tom. Regarding your plans for the 25 or so additional CareFusion product registrations, what's the time line for those?

In other cases, it's a combination of they're in certain countries that have longer registration. China has longer registration processes than most of Europe as an example, and then the other one is that certain product categories. So for example is registered at a drug in many markets, particularly, let's say, Latin America it's registered as a drug. Those typically sit in the regulatory process longer than medical devices. So it's kind of a combination of those 3 items, not one thing specific and not unexpected at all. It's right in line with our projection."

So what I'd say is you really have to look at the EPS guidance in 2 buckets. One is the FXN side, and then the FX impact. So what we did is we did flow through everything on the FX impact, and that was the $0.13. On an FXN basis, you're right, we were up around $0.14 to $0.16, but we see that as timing, and the timing buckets are the medical device tax spending, which we know, where we want to spend it. But because of the timing, don't forget, it happened in January, and we couldn't ramp that quickly. So that past quarter, we really got a lift from that, but we fully intend to spend that in the back half of the year. Then you had timing on the rate. So the tax rate was lower than our 21 to 22, and that's just lumpy throughout the year. We expect that to fall back within the rest of the year. So you have that piece. And then we had to pull forward of some of the revenues from the third quarter to the second quarter, and the impact of that. So all of that accounts for the bulk of that 14 to 16 on an FXN basis. The other thing I would point out is we actually raised the FX EPS guidance last quarter by $0.28. It was loss from the standpoint that at that point, FX was getting worse across the world and offset that but the FXN was raised prior. So you really got to think about this in those 2 buckets."

That remains unchanged. So we remain very excited about that opportunity. It's, of course, our first venture outside of the pen needles and syringes for the Diabetes Care business, moving into a fast growing market with a market leader, Medtronic, and we're, I think, equally excited about the product technology and what it can do to help patients and the partnership and what the power of us working together can do to make an impact there. So think about solutions. So as we, of course, shared before, we have announced a solutions partnership with Fresenius. We are looking at launching that, not necessary now in Q4 of '16 but more in early FY '17 just based on regulatory approval time lines there, but that does continue to move forward. And again we had not shared a specific number there, but we said it would certainly make up for any reduction in BD Rx sales that we have planned over the coming horizon, and that remains right on track."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second fiscal quarter results. 
As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com. 
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. 
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website. 
As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD. The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. 
In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliation to GAAP measures in the financial schedules, in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. 
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.

As we stated in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter growth profile. Our results this quarter highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio with both segments contributing to revenue growth. We continue to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement coupled with the positive impact of cost synergies. 
As many of you already know, in March we celebrated the 1 year anniversary of the closing of CareFusion, and we are extremely proud of our achievements over the past year. We have been acutely focused on the integration and a significant amount of work has been driven by the integration teams across the businesses. 
In terms of talent retention, we have a strong team that's in place that's comprised of both legacy CareFusion and legacy BD associates. They've been helping drive the company through our next phase of growth as a combined entity. 
In terms of our customers, we are becoming increasingly more relevant as they look -- as they are looking for providers that can really help them improve the quality, efficiency and safety of processes. We have made good progress on this front 12 months post close, and feedback from our customers has been extremely positive. 
Also, we had been actively working to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products and expanding their global reach by leveraging BD's global infrastructure. We are well into the registration process with dozens of products across multiple geographies. I will provide more details on this later in the presentation. 
Lastly, we are seeing strong productivity as we are overdelivering on our initial cost synergy capture commitments. As you already know, we have increased our total cost synergy target by about $100 million over the deal's horizon. We are clearly advancing our strategy to improve medication management. The value we bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we make progress integrating these 2 great companies. 
We're also pleased to inform you that the annual strategic review of our portfolio is now complete. In March, we announced that BD and Apax Partners, a private equity firm, will form a joint venture with the Respiratory Solutions business. Apax will establish and stand up a NewCo, enabling more strategic focus and investment to build a leading global respiratory company. 
And more recently, we announced the divestiture of our vertebral augmentation solutions business. This product line was not aligned with our strategy and we believe it can see more robust investment in growth under a different owner. 
The completion of our current strategic review process enables the company to remain focused on the areas we believe are high growth and aligned with our core capabilities. 
In addition, during our last call, we let you know about our intent to reinvest the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax that went into effect in January. Since that time, we have already allocated increased R&D dollars to highly strategic initiatives. Not only will this help to fund -- drive future growth for the company, but it will also enable better outcomes for our customers and their patients. 
Looking forward to the total year, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our fiscal 2016 currency-neutral revenue and EPS guidance. We are also increasing our adjusted guidance to reflect lower currency headwinds due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and other currencies. 
Moving to Slide 5. I will review our second quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. 
Total company revenues grew 5.3% or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. 
Adjusted EPS of $2.18 was ahead of our expectations as the quarter benefited in part from some timing within the year. 
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,329827360,973926,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone.

As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to a very solid second quarter results. 
Total second quarter revenues of approximately $3.1 billion grew 5.3% on a comparable basis or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. This was slightly ahead of our expectations as the quarter benefited by about 50 basis points from the timing of revenues, which occurred earlier than expected. I'll discuss this as I take you through the business results. 
BD Medical's second quarter revenues increased 6.1%, reflecting solid growth across the segment. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 4%, which reflects strength in Infusion Therapy, safety-engineered products and infection prevention. 
Medication Management Solutions revenues grew 6%, driven by strong dispensing capital installations with our Pyxis platform. Pyxis ES demand was strong in the quarter, driven by several large customer conversions, and we saw a positive impact from our efforts to simplify the installation process. 
We also saw solid growth in the infusion business, where we continued to expand our leadership position. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%, driven by pen needles and syringes. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 11% reflects a strong growth in SAIS. Performance in this business also reflected the favorable timing of customer orders that occurred 1 quarter earlier than we initially anticipated.  Respiratory Solutions revenues increased 10.9%, reflecting the timing of capital placements, which similarly benefited the quarter as the placements were expected to occur later in the fiscal year. 
BD Life Sciences second quarter revenues increased 3.4%, driven by solid growth in Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems units. Preanalytical Systems growth of 5.7% was driven by safety-engineered products in the U.S. and solid growth in Europe and emerging markets. 
Diagnostic Systems growth of 4.6% was the result of strong growth in core microbiology, including IDAST and BD MAX assays. Growth was also aided in part by an increase in flu activity in the U.S. While the flu season is still mild in comparison to the prior year, the timing of the late flu season had a positive benefit year-over-year in the quarter of 10 basis points. Biosciences revenues were about flat when compared with last year's second quarter. Strong double-digit growth in the U.S. was driven by continued increased demand for high-parameter instruments and growth in research reagents. This was offset by a 7% decline in Europe due to a difficult comparison related to timing of orders in the prior year. In addition, growth was negatively impacted by clinical tender delays in Africa associated with our HIV monitor related to the World Health Organization guidelines. 
Moving to Slide 8. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter on a currency-neutral basis. 
U.S. revenues increased 5.7%. This was primarily driven by strength in Medication Management Solutions, Medication and Procedural Solutions, Biosciences and Diagnostics and was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of revenues. 
BD Medical's performance reflects strong dispensing capital installations and solid growth in the infusion business as well as strength in infection prevention and interventional specialties. 
BD Life Sciences growth reflects continued strong performance in the Biosciences business, driven by demand for high parameter research instruments and reagents sales. Diagnostic Systems had strong growth in microbiology, including KIESTRA and blood culture, BD MAX as well as a benefit from the increase in flu activity during the quarter. 
Moving on to international. Revenues grew 4.8%. This is below our normal growth rate and primarily reflects the aforementioned clinical tender delays in Africa. I'll provide more details on this in a moment. 
The Medical segment grew 6.9%. This reflects solid performance in Medication and Procedural Solutions driven by sales of safety-engineered products, particularly in China, and strong dispensing installations in Medication Management Solutions. Growth was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of customer ordering patterns and capital placements. 
The Life Sciences segment grew 1.4%. This reflects strong growth in Preanalytical Systems in Western Europe and Asia Pacific and strong growth in Western Europe and Latin America in Diagnostic Systems driven by core microbiology. This was partially offset by the aforementioned tender delays in Africa and the difficult comparison in Europe in Biosciences. 
On Slide 9, emerging market revenues grew 5.1%, currency neutral, with developed markets growing 5.3%. The second quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects solid growth in China and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in EMA. China growth for the second quarter was 9.4%. Double-digit revenue growth in our Medical segment was driven by continued strong demand for consumables across all of our businesses in the segment. Within our Life Sciences segment, strength in Preanalytical Systems was offset by the slowdown of capital spending in Diagnostic Systems as communicated on our call last quarter. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. 
We now expect total emerging markets to grow in the high single-digit range compared to our previous guidance of 9% to 10% growth. This is offset by stronger performance in developed markets, growing between 4% and 4.5% for the second half of the year. 
Our revised guidance for emerging markets reflects the aforementioned impact in Africa to our Biosciences unit from the WHO guidelines. In addition, since we last provided guidance in February, the government of Saudi Arabia announced the new austerity measures, which affect the health care industry. This has begun to impact our business in that particular region, and we saw a small impact in the second quarter. We view this situation in Saudi Arabia as temporary, though the timing of reversal may not occur within this fiscal year. 
Our new guidance range contemplates emerging markets growing between 10% and 12% for the second half of the year. 
Moving to global safety on Slide 10. Currency-neutral sales increased 6.7%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 4.5% and international sales also grew 9.9%, currency neutral, with continued strength in Europe as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 15.6% in emerging markets. Medical Safety sales grew 8%, primarily driven by safety catheters. Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.6% in the quarter. 
Slide 11 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 5.3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. 
Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which include CareFusion's results in the prior year in order to give a better indication of our performance. 
Gross profit improved by 7.9%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at the underlying performance and the impact of currency. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.5%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. 
R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.9%. Our expenditures in the quarter were slightly lower than our full year expectation of 6% to 6.5% of revenues due to the timing of spending. We continue to invest in new products and innovation and expect to further reinvest the benefit from the medical device tax suspension in the back half of the year. 
Operating income grew 24.8%, reflecting strong P&L leverage. In addition, as we had previously discussed, there were a number of items that negatively impacted operating margin in the prior year in the CareFusion business. I'll address the underlying growth in operating profit in more detail on the next slide. 
Our tax rate declined 70 basis points to 20.6%, below our full year expectation of 21% to 22% as the quarter included some timing benefits. 
As Vince discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $2.18, which is a 44.7% increase versus the prior year. This reflects our solid growth profile and strong underlying margin expansion. In addition, growth benefited from the timing of revenues earlier than -- in the year than expected as well as timing within the year related to R&D expenditures and tax, as we just discussed. 
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the second quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 170 basis points was primarily driven by robust operational performance and continuous improvement initiatives and, to a lesser extent, from favorable raw material prices. 
Strong operating margin performance of 370 basis points was primarily driven by gross margin expansion combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies and the positive impact of cost synergies. In addition, timing of R&D expenses and the benefit of the medical device tax suspension aided operating margin in the quarter. Also, you will recall, several items drove lower second quarter operating margins for CareFusion in the prior year. 
Currency had a slightly negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Since we provided guidance in February, the U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and other currencies. As a result, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance by 2% -- percentage points or $0.13 from a range of $8.37 to $8.44 to a range of $8.50 to $8.57. We are maintaining our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance of $9.01 to $9.08 as we expect the second quarter tax timing to reverse and R&D spend to ramp over the back half of the year, which includes reinvestment of the medical device tax. We remain extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like you to walk you through the additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. 
In summary, we continue to expect comparable organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis with the back half of the year growing between 5.5% and 6.5%. This contemplates the third quarter growth rate to be slightly lower than our full year guidance range and the fourth quarter to be well above the full year guidance range. 
On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 21.5% and 22%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 300 basis points, an improvement from our prior guidance of about 450 basis points of currency headwinds. 
The U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and most currencies since we last provided guidance in February. While our guidance assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.13 for the rest of the year, which is better than the actual rate from the second half of last year, we see some remaining FX headwinds over the second half as non-euro currencies remain unfavorable year-over-year. 
We continue to expect growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical and 4% to 4.5% in our Life Sciences segment. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be about flat for the year. Beyond revenue and EPS, all other P&L guidance from February remains unchanged. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

Moving on to Slide 17 and our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. Starting with new product innovation. Within our Life Sciences business, our Preanalytical Systems",733,"Thank you, Chris. Moving on to Slide 17 and our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. 
Starting with new product innovation. Within our Life Sciences business, our Preanalytical Systems business launched 2 new products this quarter: the UltraTouch Push Button Blood Collection sets will deliver significant improvements in patient outcomes and lab efficiency. The BD Barricor tubes use gel-free technology, which significantly improves sample quality and lab turnaround time. The initial market feedback on both these products has been extremely positive. 
In our Bioscience business, as evidenced by our U.S. growth rate this quarter, we have seen very positive market uptake of our high-parameter instrumentation, the FACSSymphony X-50 and X-20. In our genomics business, we anticipate launching our GenCell CLiC library preparation platform and our FACSseq Cell Sorter designed specifically for genomics applications later this year -- this fiscal year. 
Within strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have completed our current portfolio review, having recently announced the Respiratory Solutions joint venture and sale of the vertebral augmentation solutions business. We remain focused on the areas we believe are high growth and aligned with our core capabilities. 
We have also made progress with our product registrations, having successfully registered more than 50 CareFusion products in over 20 countries. In addition, we have submitted registrations and are awaiting approval for an additional 25 products. This is consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies, and we remain on track for them to begin to materialize in fiscal year 2017. 
And in the areas of partnerships and collaborations, we remain excited for the launch of our infusion set, which we expect will move to broad commercial release with Medtronic in early fiscal year 2017. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing flow interruptions, simplify the user's experience and increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping. 
We recently entered into a strategic partnership with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and we'll play a part in the Institute's vision of reducing cancer to a manageable disease. Support from the Parker Institute will help us advance our new cell sorter program while bringing our high-parameter cell analysis solutions to these researchers as they work to discover the next breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy. As you can see, we are executing on our strategy and continue to have strong opportunities to drive growth and innovation. We look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 18. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the second quarter, and we made progress with our back-office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. 
We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018. Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs, as we discussed earlier. 
The consistent solid performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion we achieved last year, we expect another 170 to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year. 
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid second quarter. Both segments performed well and our performance highlights the benefits of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. 
Second, we have made significant progress on the acquisition of CareFusion. The value we can bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we integrate these 2 great companies. 
Third, we have taken steps to optimize our portfolio. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher-growth areas which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers. 
Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. We're maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance and raising our adjusted EPS. We believe we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders. I look to the future with optimism. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

I guess the first one is, the theme that you're showing the last several quarters is one  that the whole device industry is showing this quarter, which is this polarization. We've seen better U.S. performance and slightly softer ex U.S. performance, specifically emerging markets. Talk to us about how much of this in your mind is the quarter or just the trend that BD has been seeing for several quarters? And what's driving that strength in the U.S. in your opinion?"

But the other thing that you are seeing is that our businesses are performing quite well. You heard us talk about in the Bioscience business the launch of those new products. We have a whole series of new products coming out, and I mentioned -- and specifically the high-parameter work that's going on. So yes, that showed up in this quarter right now, but that's going to continue as we move through the year. You also saw good performance in Diagnostics because we're getting some traction in blood culture and KIESTRA, that is moving forward -- KIESTRA moving forward in the U.S. And then good performance across the Medical businesses, where we -- we're improving our competitive position in MMS. And so you see all of that coming together. And Europe, I think -- once again, I think, has stabilized, and it's really -- of course, you have to drop out the CareFusion factors, but there was negative timing in Biosciences. But you've got the same product launches that are occurring there. And quite frankly, Japan is forming -- is performing better for us as well. Now on the other side of the coin, the situation in China seems to have stabilized. We're seeing good performance on the medical device side of the business. And the situation really hasn't changed all that much on Diagnostics, on the capital side, but it had stabilized. And so we're getting good growth in China. We didn't mention it, we continue to get good growth in India. We're getting good growth in Latin America. There were some onetime events this quarter, which you heard in terms of Africa and Saudi Arabia. And Saudi Arabia is more of an impact in the back half of the year. So yes, this is slightly less in emerging markets, yes, but the mix is quite good."

We're actually up against the tough comparison in the third quarter because in terms of absolute dollars, that was our highest quarter last year. So you got to really look at those absolute dollars. Looking at growth rates is a little misleading because the growth rate last year was negative in CareFusion in the third quarter, but that was more about the compare to prior year. But yes, absolute dollars are the grow over. And then as you model out the year, based on the guidance that we just gave you in terms of growth rates for the third and fourth quarter, you'll see steadily improving sequential revenue dollars for all 4 quarters this year. So we really feel good about the trajectory, particularly on a sequential basis this year. It's all about the compare to last year revenue dollars."

So think disposables. And this is right in line with what we had talked about over the last several quarters that as we think about the first products that would be able to help drive incremental revenue growth, it would be things like infusion sets, ChloraPrep, the consumables that fit very well with BD's traditional sales channels and market approaches and presence in the marketplaces, and those are the products that we focused on getting registration for first. So I would say we're seeing some early signs of success as we've been launching these products, which is very consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and really remain on track to start seeing them materialize more in 2017. But we do see sales now. And obviously, on a company the size of BD and a segment of Medical, we'll see those start showing up more materially as we roll on to '17. But they have started. And I would just say that obviously, we're going to continue those product registration work. We're continuing the sales and marketing investments to support those initiatives.

One is, although the euro hasn't (sic) [ has ] improved, the non-euro currencies year-over-year are still providing a bit of a drag. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, is the phenomenon of the profit and inventory that we've talked about in the past. So it didn't quite catch up in the second quarter. Certainly not much of a drag and it's starting to level off, and that, in my prepared remarks, was the commentary for the second half of the year.

So we are actually quite pleased with the progress that we're making on Pyxis as we actually just released another new version of the software, which we think really it makes some very significant progress and actually addresses -- will make a big step forward in terms of installation efficiency. And so as we've shared in the past, we were really focused on improving the installation process. We had shared that there was a quite large backlog at the time of the acquisition. And to really address that backlog, we needed to improve the installation efficiency process, and we've been working on that, applying some of our lean expertise as well as making some adjustments in the software that would automate a lot of that and simplify the workload in the field. So we're seeing a lot of those efforts come to fruition. We did have very strong placements in Q2. That was part of the driver of MMS growth. We continue to see strong demand for the Pyxis ES platform, and we're equally looking forward to continued strong growth in the second half of the year in that, as Vince alluded to earlier. Then on the infusion side, we also are very pleased with the growth that we saw in the quarter here and have similar expectations for the back half of the year. As you know, we are the market leader in that space. We've continued to strengthen our position over the last several years. We expect to continue to strengthen our position in the market by about the same amount this year, as we have over the last couple of years. We do see customers continue to select the BD Alaris pumps in an incremental way really based on that interoperability and the power of one to be able to do all of their infusion needs across both large-volume infusions, syringes and narcotics, all in one product. It's the only item that can do that. So we're happy there. I would point out as well that as you look at our safety sales, particularly in the U.S., that was largely driven by growth in our -- in some of the connectors that are associated with our dedicated sets in the infusion category. And that's really a reflection of that strong performance in that infusion category and that renewing consumable stream that comes as we place pumps incrementally. Thank you."

So on -- in terms of cost synergies, we did, I would remind you, improve cost synergies fairly recently up to the $325 million to $350 million, and that was identification of some new synergies from our recent -- or our original model. I would also remind you that we increased the overall synergies from the standpoint of the tax rate improvements that we saw that we originally didn't contemplate, and that's another 3% accretion that we had mentioned. Really, the -- when you think about the synergies, we get initial synergies of duplicate public company costs. Then you move into the integration of systems and infrastructure, and we've gotten good traction on that and that led to the last increase. And then towards the end are the more difficult synergies to get, which are the distribution centers and manufacturing plants, and we actually saw some good initial improvements in that area or traction in that area that led to our last increase. So we really feel great about what we're driving. All in-all in, it's significantly higher than our original expectations, particularly when you add the tax synergy. You see this year the EPS quarter-over-quarter was over 44%, I think, is an indication of that. So we really feel good about our ability to drive those synergies and executing on those synergies."

That was driven again by the very strong gross profit margin, which is really going around operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, a little bit of benefit from raw material prices, as we've talked in the past, from oil. But then, on the operating side, SSG&A really reflective of hitting on the synergies. It was a little bit of an easier compare in the second quarter because of the operating margin challenges in CareFusion in that quarter last year. So you won't expect 370. In fact, we expect about 170 to 190 for the year on the operating margin basis. I'd remind you that's on top of a 100 basis of margin improvement last year. So really improving the margins, as you point out. And as we think about going forward, as we execute on synergies, you would expect to see above normal. So we usually think 40 to 50 basis points of margin improvement. You're going to get more of that as we execute on the synergies in '17 and '18. You would also get a little bit of a lift from the fact that as we exit respiratory, which had challenging margins, you get a little bit of a lift. So not to give guidance on '17, but you're absolutely right. Directionally, we're going to see improved margins going forward in '17 and '18. And then, as you start lapping those synergies, I think somewhere beyond that, you start going back to that 40 to 50 basis points. That's a few years out."

But we see that as timing, and the timing buckets are the medical device tax spending, which we know where we want to spend it, but because of the timing -- don't forget it happened in January and we couldn't ramp that quickly. So that past quarter, we really got a lift from that. But we fully intend to spend that in the back half of the year. Then you had timing on the tax rate. So the tax rate was lower than our 21% to 22%, and that's just lumpy throughout the year. We expect that to fall back within the rest of the year. So you had that piece.

So all of that accounts for the bulk of that $0.14 to $0.16 on an FXN basis. The other thing I'd point out is we actually raised the FXN EPS guidance last quarter by $0.28. It was loss from the standpoint that at that point, FX was getting worse across the world and it offset that, but the FXN was raised prior. So you really got to think about it in those 2 buckets."

This is Tom. So we haven't specifically sized the opportunity on infusion sets, but I think as we've said all year, we were expecting to get the product into some early-stage release in a controlled patient group this fiscal year and then really see more of the impact in the Diabetes Care business in FY '17. That remains unchanged. So we remain very excited about that opportunity. It's, of course, our first venture outside of the pen needles and syringes for the Diabetes Care business, moving into a fast-growing market with the market leader, Medtronic, and we're, I think, equally excited about the product technology and what it can do to help patients and the partnership and what the power of us working together can do to make an impact there. If you think about solutions, so we -- as we had, of course, shared before, we have announced the solutions partnership with Fresenius. We are looking at launching that not necessarily now in Q4 of '16 but more in early FY '17 just based on regulatory approval time lines there, but that does continue to move forward. And again, we had not shared a specific number there, but we said it would certainly make up for any reduction in BD Rx sales that we had planned over the coming horizon, and that remains right on track."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second fiscal quarter results. 
As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com. 
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. 
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website. 
As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD. The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. 
In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliation to GAAP measures in the financial schedules, in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. 
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

As we stated in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter growth profile. Our results this quarter highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio with both segments contributing to revenue growth. We continue to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement coupled with the positive impact of cost synergies. 
As many of you already know, in March we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the closing of CareFusion, and we are extremely proud of our achievements over the past year. We have been acutely focused on the integration, and a significant amount of work has been driven by the integration teams across the businesses. 
In terms of talent retention, we have a strong team that's in place that's comprised of both legacy CareFusion and legacy BD associates. They've been helping drive the company through our next phase of growth as a combined entity. 
In terms of our customers, we are becoming increasingly more relevant as they look -- as they are looking for providers that can really help them improve the quality, efficiency and safety of processes. We have made good progress on this front 12 months post-close, and feedback from our customers has been extremely positive. 
Also, we have been actively working to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products and expanding their global reach by leveraging BD's global infrastructure. We are well into the registration process with dozens of products across multiple geographies. I will provide more details on this later in the presentation. 
Lastly, we are seeing strong productivity as we are overdelivering on our initial cost synergy capture commitments. As you already know, we have increased our total cost synergy target by about $100 million over the deal's horizon. We are clearly advancing our strategy to improve medication management. The value we bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we make progress integrating these 2 great companies. 
We're also pleased to inform you that the annual strategic review of our portfolio is now complete. In March, we announced that BD and Apax Partners, a private equity firm, will form a joint venture with the Respiratory Solutions business. Apax will establish and stand up a newco, enabling more strategic focus and investment to build a leading global respiratory company. 
And more recently, we announced the divestiture of our vertebral augmentation solutions business. This product line was not aligned with our strategy and we believe it can see more robust investment in growth under a different owner. 
The completion of our current strategic review process enables the company to remain focused on the areas we believe are high growth and aligned with our core capabilities. 
In addition, during our last call, we let you know about our intent to reinvest the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax that went into effect in January. Since that time, we have already allocated increased R&D dollars to highly strategic initiatives. Not only will this help to fund -- drive future growth for the company, but it will also enable better outcomes for our customers and their patients. 
Looking forward to the total year, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our fiscal 2016 currency-neutral revenue and EPS guidance. We are also increasing our adjusted guidance to reflect lower currency headwinds due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and other currencies. 
Moving to Slide 5. I will review our second quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. 
Total company revenues grew 5.3% or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. 
Adjusted EPS of $2.18 was ahead of our expectations as the quarter benefited in part from some timing within the year. 
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,329827360,974139,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to our very solid second quarter results.

As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to our very solid second quarter results. 
Total second quarter revenues of approximately $3.1 billion grew 5.3% on a comparable basis or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. This was slightly ahead of our expectations as the quarter benefited by about 50 basis points from the timing of revenues, which occurred earlier than expected. I'll discuss this as I take you through the business results. 
BD Medical's second quarter revenues increased 6.1%, reflecting solid growth across the segment. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 4%, which reflects strength in Infusion Therapy, safety-engineered products and infection prevention. 
Medication Management Solutions revenues grew 6%, driven by strong dispensing capital installations with our Pyxis platform. Pyxis ES demand was strong in the quarter, driven by several large customer conversions, and we saw a positive impact from our efforts to simplify the installation process. 
We also saw solid growth in the infusion business, where we continue to expand our leadership position. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%, driven by pen needles and syringes. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 11% reflects a strong growth in SAIS. Performance in this business also reflected the favorable timing of customer orders that occurred 1 quarter earlier than we initially anticipated.  Respiratory Solutions revenues increased 10.9%, reflecting the timing of capital placements, which similarly benefited the quarter as the placements were expected to occur later in the fiscal year. 
BD Life Sciences second quarter revenues increased 3.4%, driven by solid growth in Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems units. Preanalytical Systems growth of 5.7% was driven by safety-engineered products in the U.S. and solid growth in Europe and emerging markets. 
Diagnostic Systems growth of 4.6% was the result of strong growth in core microbiology, including IDAST and BD MAX assays. Growth was also aided in part by an increase in flu activity in the U.S. While the flu season is still mild in comparison to the prior year, the timing of the late flu season had a positive benefit year-over-year in the quarter of 10 basis points. Biosciences revenues were about flat when compared with last year's second quarter. Strong double-digit growth in the U.S. was driven by continued increased demand for high-parameter instruments and growth in research reagents. This was offset by a 7% decline in Europe due to a difficult comparison related to timing of orders in the prior year. In addition, growth was negatively impacted by clinical tender delays in Africa associated with our HIV monitoring related to the World Health Organization guidelines. 
Moving to Slide 8. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter on a currency-neutral basis. 
U.S. revenues increased 5.7%. This was primarily driven by strength in Medication Management Solutions, Medication and Procedural Solutions, Biosciences and Diagnostics and was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of revenues. 
BD Medical's performance reflects strong dispensing capital installations and solid growth in the infusion business as well as strength in infection prevention and interventional specialties. 
BD Life Sciences growth reflects continued strong performance in the Biosciences business, driven by demand for high-parameter research instruments and reagent sales. Diagnostic Systems had strong growth in microbiology, including KIESTRA and blood culture, BD MAX as well as a benefit from the increase in flu activity during the quarter. 
Moving on to international. Revenues grew 4.8%. This is below our normal growth rate and primarily reflects the aforementioned clinical tender delays in Africa. I'll provide more details on this in a moment. 
The Medical segment grew 6.9%. This reflects solid performance in Medication and Procedural Solutions driven by sales of safety-engineered products, particularly in China, and strong dispensing installations in Medication Management Solutions. Growth was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of customer ordering patterns and capital placements. 
The Life Sciences segment grew 1.4%. This reflects strong growth in Preanalytical Systems in Western Europe and Asia Pacific and strong growth in Western Europe and Latin America in Diagnostic Systems, driven by core microbiology. This was partially offset by the aforementioned tender delays in Africa and the difficult comparison in Europe in Biosciences. 
On Slide 9, emerging market revenues grew 5.1%, currency neutral, with developed markets growing 5.3%. The second quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects solid growth in China and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in EMA. China growth for the second quarter was 9.4%. Double-digit revenue growth in our Medical segment was driven by continued strong demand for consumables across all of our businesses in the segment. Within our Life Sciences segment, strength in Preanalytical Systems was offset by the slowdown of capital spending in Diagnostic Systems as communicated on our call last quarter. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. 
We now expect total emerging markets to grow in the high single-digit range compared to our previous guidance of 9% to 10% growth. This is offset by stronger performance in developed markets, growing between 4% and 4.5% for the second half of the year. 
Our revised guidance for emerging markets reflects the aforementioned impact in Africa to our Biosciences unit from the WHO guidelines. In addition, since we last provided guidance in February, the government of Saudi Arabia announced the new austerity measures, which affect the health care industry. This has begun to impact our business in that particular region, and we saw a small impact in the second quarter. We view this situation in Saudi Arabia as temporary, though the timing of reversal may not occur within this fiscal year. 
Our new guidance range contemplates emerging markets growing between 10% and 12% for the second half of the year. 
Moving to global safety on Slide 10. Currency-neutral sales increased 6.7%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 4.5% and international sales also grew 9.9%, currency neutral, with continued strength in Europe as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 15.6% in emerging markets. Medical Safety sales grew 8%, primarily driven by safety catheters. Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.6% in the quarter. 
Slide 11 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 5.3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. 
Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which include CareFusion's results in the prior year in order to give a better indication of our performance. 
Gross profit improved by 7.9%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at the underlying performance and the impact of currency. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.5%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. 
R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.9%. Our expenditures in the quarter were slightly lower than our full year expectation of 6% to 6.5% of revenues due to the timing of spending. We continue to invest in new products and innovation and expect to further reinvest the benefit from the medical device tax suspension in the back half of the year. 
Operating income grew 24.8%, reflecting strong P&L leverage. In addition, as we had previously discussed, there were a number of items that negatively impacted operating margin in the prior year in the CareFusion business. I'll address the underlying growth in operating profit in more detail on the next slide. 
Our tax rate declined 70 basis points to 20.6%, below our full year expectation of 21% to 22% as the quarter included some timing benefits. 
As Vince discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $2.18, which is a 44.7% increase versus the prior year. This reflects our solid growth profile and strong underlying margin expansion. In addition, growth benefited from the timing of revenues earlier than -- in the year than expected as well as timing within the year related to R&D expenditures and tax, as we just discussed. 
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the second quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 170 basis points was primarily driven by robust operational performance and continuous improvement initiatives and, to a lesser extent, from favorable raw material prices. 
Strong operating margin performance of 370 basis points was primarily driven by gross margin expansion combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies and the positive impact of cost synergies. In addition, timing of R&D expenses and the benefit of the medical device tax suspension aided operating margin in the quarter. Also, you will recall, several items drove lower second quarter operating margins for CareFusion in the prior year. 
Currency had a slightly negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Since we provided guidance in February, the U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and other currencies. As a result, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance by 2% -- percentage points or $0.13 from a range of $8.37 to $8.44 to a range of $8.50 to $8.57. We are maintaining our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance of $9.01 to $9.08 as we expect the second quarter tax timing to reverse and R&D spend to ramp over the back half of the year, which includes reinvestment of the medical device tax. We remain extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like you to walk you through the additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. 
In summary, we continue to expect comparable organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis, with the back half of the year growing between 5.5% and 6.5%. This contemplates the third quarter growth rate to be slightly lower than our full year guidance range and the fourth quarter to be well above the full year guidance range. 
On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 21.5% and 22%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 300 basis points, an improvement from our prior guidance of about 450 basis points of currency headwinds. 
The U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and most currencies since we last provided guidance in February. While our guidance assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.13 for the rest of the year, which is better than the actual rate from the second half of last year, we see some remaining FX headwinds over the second half as non-euro currencies remain unfavorable year-over-year. 
We continue to expect growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical and 4% to 4.5% in our Life Sciences segment. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be about flat for the year. Beyond revenue and EPS, all other P&L guidance from February remains unchanged. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

Moving on to Slide 17 and our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. Starting with new product innovation. Within our Life Sciences business, our Preanalytical Systems",733,"Thank you, Chris. Moving on to Slide 17 and our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. 
Starting with new product innovation. Within our Life Sciences business, our Preanalytical Systems business launched 2 new products this quarter. The UltraTouch Push Button Blood Collection sets will deliver significant improvements in patient outcomes and lab efficiency. The BD Barricor tubes use gel-free technology, which significantly improves sample quality and lab turnaround time. The initial market feedback on both these products has been extremely positive. 
In our Bioscience business, as evidenced by our U.S. growth rate this quarter, we have seen very positive market uptake of our high-parameter instrumentation, the FACSSymphony X-50 and X-20. In our genomics business, we anticipate launching our GenCell CLiC library preparation platform and our FACSseq Cell Sorter designed specifically for genomics applications later this year -- this fiscal year. 
Within strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have completed our current portfolio review, having recently announced the Respiratory Solutions joint venture and sale of the vertebral augmentation solutions business. We remain focused on the areas we believe are high growth and aligned with our core capabilities. 
We have also made progress with our product registrations, having successfully registered more than 50 CareFusion products in over 20 countries. In addition, we have submitted registrations and are awaiting approval for an additional 25 products. This is consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies, and we remain on track for them to begin to materialize in fiscal year 2017. 
And in the areas of partnerships and collaborations, we remain excited for the launch of our infusion set, which we expect will move to broad commercial release with Medtronic in early fiscal year 2017. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing flow interruptions, simplify the user's experience and increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping. 
We recently entered into a strategic partnership with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and we'll play a part in the Institute's vision of reducing cancer to a manageable disease. Support from the Parker Institute will help us advance our new cell sorter program while bringing our high-parameter cell analysis solutions to these researchers as they work to discover the next breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy. As you can see, we are executing on our strategy and continue to have strong opportunities to drive growth and innovation. We look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 18. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the second quarter, and we made progress with our back-office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. 
We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018. Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs, as we discussed earlier. 
The consistent solid performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion we achieved last year, we expect another 170 to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year. 
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid second quarter. Both segments performed well and our performance highlights the benefits of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. 
Second, we have made significant progress on the acquisition of CareFusion. The value we can bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we integrate these 2 great companies. 
Third, we have taken steps to optimize our portfolio. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher-growth areas which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers. 
Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. We're maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance and raising our adjusted EPS. We believe we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders. I look to the future with optimism. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

You also saw good performance in Diagnostics because we're getting some traction in blood culture and KIESTRA, that is moving forward -- KIESTRA moving forward in the U.S. And then good performance across the Medical businesses, where we -- we're improving our competitive position in MMS. And so you see all of that coming together. And Europe, I think -- once again, I think, has stabilized, and it's really -- of course, you have to drop out the CareFusion factors, but there was negative timing in Biosciences. But you've got the same product launches that are occurring there. And quite frankly, Japan is forming -- is performing better for us as well. Now on the other side of the coin, the situation in China seems to have stabilized. We're seeing good performance on the medical device side of the business. And the situation really hasn't changed all that much on Diagnostics, on the capital side, but it has stabilized. And so we're getting good growth in China. We didn't mention it, we continue to get good growth in India. We're getting good growth in Latin America. There were some onetime events this quarter, which you heard in terms of Africa and Saudi Arabia. And Saudi Arabia is more of an impact in the back half of the year. So yes, this is slightly less in emerging markets, yes, but the mix is quite good."

We're actually up against the tough comparison in the third quarter because in terms of absolute dollars, that was our highest quarter last year. So you got to really look at those absolute dollars. Looking at growth rates is a little misleading because the growth rate last year was negative in CareFusion in the third quarter, but that was more about the compare to prior year. But the absolute dollars are the grow over. And then as you model out the year, based on the guidance that we just gave you in terms of growth rates for the third and fourth quarter, you'll see steadily improving sequential revenue dollars for all 4 quarters this year. So we really feel good about the trajectory, particularly on a sequential basis. This year, it's all about the compare to last year revenue dollars."

So think disposables. And this is right in line with what we had talked about over the last several quarters, that as we think about the first products that would be able to help drive incremental revenue growth, it would be things like infusion sets, ChloraPrep, the consumables that fit very well with BD's traditional sales channels and market approaches and presence in the marketplaces, and those are the products that we focused on getting registrations for first. So I would say we're seeing some early signs of success as we've been launching these products, which is very consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and really remain on track to start seeing them materialize more in 2017. But we do see sales now. And obviously, on a company the size of BD and a segment of Medical, we'll see those start showing up more materially as we roll into '17. But they have started. And I would just say that obviously, we're going to continue those product registration work. We're continuing the sales and marketing investments to support those initiatives.

One is, although the euro has improved, the non-euro currencies year-over-year are still providing a bit of a drag. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, is the phenomenon of the profit and inventory that we've talked about in the past. So it didn't quite catch up in the second quarter. Certainly not much of a drag and it's starting to level off, and that, in my prepared remarks, was the commentary for the second half of the year.

So we are actually quite pleased with the progress that we're making on Pyxis as we actually just released another new version of the software, which we think really it makes some very significant progress and actually addresses -- will make a big step forward in terms of installation efficiency. And so as we've shared in the past, we were really focused on improving the installation process. We had shared that there was a quite large backlog at the time of the acquisition. And to really address that backlog, we needed to improve the installation efficiency process, and we've been working on that, applying some of our lean expertise as well as making some adjustments in the software that would automate a lot of that and simplify the workload in the field. So we're seeing a lot of those efforts come to fruition. We did have very strong placements in Q2. That was part of the driver of MMS growth. We continue to see strong demand for the Pyxis ES platform, and we're equally looking forward to continued strong growth in the second half of the year in that, as Vince alluded to earlier. Then on the infusion side, we also are very pleased with the growth that we saw in the quarter here and have similar expectations for the back half of the year. As you know, we are the market leader in that space. We've continued to strengthen our position over the last several years. We expect to continue to strengthen our position in the market by about the same amount this year, as we have over the last couple of years. We do see customers continue to select the BD Alaris pumps in an incremental way really based on that interoperability and the power of one to be able to do all of their infusion needs across both large-volume infusions, syringes and narcotics, all in one product. It's the only item that can do that. So we're happy there. I would point out as well that as you look at our safety sales, particularly in the U.S., that was largely driven by growth in our -- in some of the connectors that are associated with our dedicated sets in the infusion category. And that's really a reflection of that strong performance in that infusion category and that renewing consumable stream that comes as we place pumps incrementally. Thank you."

So on -- in terms of cost synergies, we did, I would remind you, improve cost synergies fairly recently up to the $325 million to $350 million, and that was identification of some new synergies from our recent -- or our original model. I would also remind you that we increased the overall synergies from the standpoint of the tax rate improvements that we saw that we originally didn't contemplate, and that's another 3% accretion that we had mentioned. Really, the -- when you think about the synergies, we get initial synergies of duplicate public company costs. Then you move into the integration of systems and infrastructure, and we've gotten good traction on that and that led to the last increase. And then towards the end are the more difficult synergies to get, which are the distribution centers and manufacturing plants, and we actually saw some good initial improvements in that area or traction in that area that led to our last increase. So we really feel great about what we're driving. All-in all-in, it's significantly higher than our original expectations, particularly when you add the tax synergy. You see this year the EPS quarter-over-quarter was over 44% and, I think, is an indication of that.

That was driven again by the very strong gross profit margin, which is really going around operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, a little bit of benefit from raw material prices, as we've talked in the past, from oil. But then, on the operating side, SSG&A really reflective of hitting on the synergies. It was a little bit of an easier compare in the second quarter because of the operating margin challenges in CareFusion in that quarter last year. So you won't expect 370. In fact, we expect about 170 to 190 for the year on the operating margin basis. I'd remind you that's on top of a 100 basis of margin improvement last year. So really improving the margins, as you point out. And as we think about going forward, as we execute on synergies, you would expect to see above normal. So we usually think 40 to 50 basis points of margin improvement. You're going to get more of that as we execute on the synergies in '17 and '18. You would also get a little bit of a lift from the fact that as we exit respiratory, which had challenging margins, you get a little bit of a lift. So not to give guidance on '17, but you're absolutely right. Directionally, we're going to see improved margins going forward in '17 and '18. And then, as you start lapping those synergies, I think somewhere beyond that, you start going back to that 40 to 50 basis points. That's a few years out."

So what we did is we did flow through everything on the FX impact, and that was the $0.13. On an FXN basis, you're right, we were up around $0.14 to $0.16. But we see that as timing, and the timing buckets are the medical device tax spending, which we know where we want to spend it, but because of the timing -- don't forget it happened in January and we couldn't ramp that quickly. So that past quarter, we really got a lift from that. But we fully intend to spend that in the back half of the year. Then you had timing on the tax rate. So the tax rate was lower than our 21% to 22%, and that's just lumpy throughout the year. We expect that to fall back within the rest of the year. So you had that piece. And then we had the pull-forward of some of the revenues from the third quarter to the second quarter and the impact of that. So all of that accounts for the bulk of that $0.14 to $0.16 on an FXN basis. The other thing I'd point out is we actually raised the FXN EPS guidance last quarter by $0.28. It was loss from the standpoint that at that point, FX was getting worse across the world and it offset that, but the FXN was raised prior. So you really got to think about it in those 2 buckets."

If you think about solutions, so we -- as we had, of course, shared before, we have announced the solutions partnership with Fresenius. We are looking at launching that not necessarily now in Q4 of '16 but more in early FY '17 just based on regulatory approval time lines there, but that does continue to move forward.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second fiscal quarter results. 
As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com. 
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our second fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. 
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website. 
As a reminder, until we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we will speak to our revenue results on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which includes BD and CareFusion in the current and prior year periods. We believe this provides additional visibility into the new BD. The comparable current period revenues are adjusted to exclude a small impact related to a purchase accounting adjustment to record CareFusion's deferred revenues at fair value as of the acquisition date. 
In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliation to GAAP measures in the financial schedules, in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. 
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.

As we stated in our press release, we are very pleased with our second quarter growth profile. Our results this quarter highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio with both segments contributing to revenue growth. We continue to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of operational efficiencies and continuous improvement coupled with the positive impact of cost synergies. 
As many of you already know, in March we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of the closing of CareFusion, and we are extremely proud of our achievements over the past year. We have been acutely focused on the integration, and a significant amount of work has been driven by the integration teams across the businesses. 
In terms of talent retention, we have a strong team that's in place that's comprised of both legacy CareFusion and legacy BD associates. They've been helping drive the company through our next phase of growth as a combined entity. 
In terms of our customers, we are becoming increasingly more relevant as they look -- as they are looking for providers that can really help them improve the quality, efficiency and safety of processes. We have made good progress on this front 12 months post-close, and feedback from our customers has been extremely positive. 
Also, we have been actively working to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products and expanding their global reach by leveraging BD's global infrastructure. We are well into the registration process with dozens of products across multiple geographies. I will provide more details on this later in the presentation. 
Lastly, we are seeing strong productivity as we are overdelivering on our initial cost synergy capture commitments. As you already know, we have increased our total cost synergy target by about $100 million over the deal's horizon. We are clearly advancing our strategy to improve medication management. The value we bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we make progress integrating these 2 great companies. 
We're also pleased to inform you that the annual strategic review of our portfolio is now complete. In March, we announced that BD and Apax Partners, a private equity firm, will form a joint venture with the Respiratory Solutions business. Apax will establish and stand up a newco, enabling more strategic focus and investment to build a leading global respiratory company. 
And more recently, we announced the divestiture of our vertebral augmentation solutions business. This product line was not aligned with our strategy and we believe it can see more robust investment in growth under a different owner. 
The completion of our current strategic review process enables the company to remain focused on the areas we believe are high growth and aligned with our core capabilities. 
In addition, during our last call, we let you know about our intent to reinvest the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax that went into effect in January. Since that time, we have already allocated increased R&D dollars to highly strategic initiatives. Not only will this help to fund -- drive future growth for the company, but it will also enable better outcomes for our customers and their patients. 
Looking forward to the total year, we are confident in our outlook and are maintaining our fiscal 2016 currency-neutral revenue and EPS guidance. We are also increasing our adjusted guidance to reflect lower currency headwinds due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and other currencies. 
Moving to Slide 5. I will review our second quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. 
Total company revenues grew 5.3% or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. 
Adjusted EPS of $2.18 was ahead of our expectations as the quarter benefited in part from some timing within the year. 
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,329827360,975007,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to our very solid second quarter results.

As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to our very solid second quarter results. 
Total second quarter revenues of approximately $3.1 billion grew 5.3% on a comparable basis or 5.2% on a combined organic basis. This was slightly ahead of our expectations as the quarter benefited by about 50 basis points from the timing of revenues, which occurred earlier than expected. I'll discuss this as I take you through the business results. 
BD Medical's second quarter revenues increased 6.1%, reflecting solid growth across the segment. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 4%, which reflects strength in Infusion Therapy, safety-engineered products and infection prevention. 
Medication Management Solutions revenues grew 6%, driven by strong dispensing capital installations with our Pyxis platform. Pyxis ES demand was strong in the quarter, driven by several large customer conversions, and we saw a positive impact from our efforts to simplify the installation process. 
We also saw solid growth in the infusion business, where we continue to expand our leadership position. Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%, driven by pen needles and syringes. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 11% reflects a strong growth in SAIS. Performance in this business also reflected the favorable timing of customer orders that occurred 1 quarter earlier than we initially anticipated.  Respiratory Solutions revenues increased 10.9%, reflecting the timing of capital placements, which similarly benefited the quarter as the placements were expected to occur later in the fiscal year. 
BD Life Sciences second quarter revenues increased 3.4%, driven by solid growth in Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems units. Preanalytical Systems growth of 5.7% was driven by safety-engineered products in the U.S. and solid growth in Europe and emerging markets. 
Diagnostic Systems growth of 4.6% was the result of strong growth in core microbiology, including IDAST and BD MAX assays. Growth was also aided in part by an increase in flu activity in the U.S. While the flu season is still mild in comparison to the prior year, the timing of the late flu season had a positive benefit year-over-year in the quarter of 10 basis points. Biosciences revenues were about flat when compared with last year's second quarter. Strong double-digit growth in the U.S. was driven by continued increased demand for high-parameter instruments and growth in research reagents. This was offset by a 7% decline in Europe due to a difficult comparison related to timing of orders in the prior year. In addition, growth was negatively impacted by clinical tender delays in Africa associated with our HIV monitoring related to the World Health Organization guidelines. 
Moving to Slide 8. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter on a currency-neutral basis. 
U.S. revenues increased 5.7%. This was primarily driven by strength in Medication Management Solutions, Medication and Procedural Solutions, Biosciences and Diagnostics and was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of revenues. 
BD Medical's performance reflects strong dispensing capital installations and solid growth in the infusion business as well as strength in infection prevention and interventional specialties. 
BD Life Sciences growth reflects continued strong performance in the Biosciences business, driven by demand for high-parameter research instruments and reagent sales. Diagnostic Systems had strong growth in microbiology, including KIESTRA and blood culture, BD MAX as well as a benefit from the increase in flu activity during the quarter. 
Moving on to international. Revenues grew 4.8%. This is below our normal growth rate and primarily reflects the aforementioned clinical tender delays in Africa. I'll provide more details on this in a moment. 
The Medical segment grew 6.9%. This reflects solid performance in Medication and Procedural Solutions driven by sales of safety-engineered products, particularly in China, and strong dispensing installations in Medication Management Solutions. Growth was aided in part by the aforementioned timing of customer ordering patterns and capital placements. 
The Life Sciences segment grew 1.4%. This reflects strong growth in Preanalytical Systems in Western Europe and Asia Pacific and strong growth in Western Europe and Latin America in Diagnostic Systems, driven by core microbiology. This was partially offset by the aforementioned tender delays in Africa and the difficult comparison in Europe in Biosciences. 
On Slide 9, emerging market revenues grew 5.1%, currency neutral, with developed markets growing 5.3%. The second quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects solid growth in China and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in EMA. China growth for the second quarter was 9.4%. Double-digit revenue growth in our Medical segment was driven by continued strong demand for consumables across all of our businesses in the segment. Within our Life Sciences segment, strength in Preanalytical Systems was offset by the slowdown of capital spending in Diagnostic Systems as communicated on our call last quarter. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. 
We now expect total emerging markets to grow in the high single-digit range compared to our previous guidance of 9% to 10% growth. This is offset by stronger performance in developed markets, growing between 4% and 4.5% for the second half of the year. 
Our revised guidance for emerging markets reflects the aforementioned impact in Africa to our Biosciences unit from the WHO guidelines. In addition, since we last provided guidance in February, the government of Saudi Arabia announced the new austerity measures, which affect the health care industry. This has begun to impact our business in that particular region, and we saw a small impact in the second quarter. We view this situation in Saudi Arabia as temporary, though the timing of reversal may not occur within this fiscal year. 
Our new guidance range contemplates emerging markets growing between 10% and 12% for the second half of the year. 
Moving to global safety on Slide 10. Currency-neutral sales increased 6.7%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 4.5% and international sales also grew 9.9%, currency neutral, with continued strength in Europe as compliance with safety legislation continues. Safety revenues grew 15.6% in emerging markets. Medical Safety sales grew 8%, primarily driven by safety catheters. Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4.6% in the quarter. 
Slide 11 recaps the second quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 5.3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. 
Moving down the P&L, I will focus on the comparable basis figures, which include CareFusion's results in the prior year in order to give a better indication of our performance. 
Gross profit improved by 7.9%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at the underlying performance and the impact of currency. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.5%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. 
R&D as a percentage of revenue was 5.9%. Our expenditures in the quarter were slightly lower than our full year expectation of 6% to 6.5% of revenues due to the timing of spending. We continue to invest in new products and innovation and expect to further reinvest the benefit from the medical device tax suspension in the back half of the year. 
Operating income grew 24.8%, reflecting strong P&L leverage. In addition, as we had previously discussed, there were a number of items that negatively impacted operating margin in the prior year in the CareFusion business. I'll address the underlying growth in operating profit in more detail on the next slide. 
Our tax rate declined 70 basis points to 20.6%, below our full year expectation of 21% to 22% as the quarter included some timing benefits. 
As Vince discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $2.18, which is a 44.7% increase versus the prior year. This reflects our solid growth profile and strong underlying margin expansion. In addition, growth benefited from the timing of revenues earlier than -- in the year than expected as well as timing within the year related to R&D expenditures and tax, as we just discussed. 
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the second quarter presented on a comparable basis. Strong gross profit margin performance of 170 basis points was primarily driven by robust operational performance and continuous improvement initiatives and, to a lesser extent, from favorable raw material prices. 
Strong operating margin performance of 370 basis points was primarily driven by gross margin expansion combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies and the positive impact of cost synergies. In addition, timing of R&D expenses and the benefit of the medical device tax suspension aided operating margin in the quarter. Also, you will recall, several items drove lower second quarter operating margins for CareFusion in the prior year. 
Currency had a slightly negative impact on both gross profit margin and operating margins. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Since we provided guidance in February, the U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and other currencies. As a result, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance by 2% -- percentage points or $0.13 from a range of $8.37 to $8.44 to a range of $8.50 to $8.57. We are maintaining our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance of $9.01 to $9.08 as we expect the second quarter tax timing to reverse and R&D spend to ramp over the back half of the year, which includes reinvestment of the medical device tax. We remain extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. 
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like you to walk you through the additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. 
In summary, we continue to expect comparable organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis, with the back half of the year growing between 5.5% and 6.5%. This contemplates the third quarter growth rate to be slightly lower than our full year guidance range and the fourth quarter to be well above the full year guidance range. 
On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 21.5% and 22%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 300 basis points, an improvement from our prior guidance of about 450 basis points of currency headwinds. 
The U.S. dollar has weakened against the euro and most currencies since we last provided guidance in February. While our guidance assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.13 for the rest of the year, which is better than the actual rate from the second half of last year, we see some remaining FX headwinds over the second half as non-euro currencies remain unfavorable year-over-year. 
We continue to expect growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical and 4% to 4.5% in our Life Sciences segment. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be about flat for the year. Beyond revenue and EPS, all other P&L guidance from February remains unchanged. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

Moving on to Slide 17 and our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. Starting with new product innovation. Within our Life Sciences business, our Preanalytical Systems",733,"Thank you, Chris. Moving on to Slide 17 and our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. 
Starting with new product innovation. Within our Life Sciences business, our Preanalytical Systems business launched 2 new products this quarter. The UltraTouch Push Button Blood Collection sets will deliver significant improvements in patient outcomes and lab efficiency. The BD Barricor tubes use gel-free technology, which significantly improves sample quality and lab turnaround time. The initial market feedback on both these products has been extremely positive. 
In our Bioscience business, as evidenced by our U.S. growth rate this quarter, we have seen very positive market uptake of our high-parameter instrumentation, the FACSSymphony X-50 and X-20. In our genomics business, we anticipate launching our GenCell CLiC library preparation platform and our FACSseq Cell Sorter designed specifically for genomics applications later this year -- this fiscal year. 
Within strategic and business initiatives, as we discussed earlier, we have completed our current portfolio review, having recently announced the Respiratory Solutions joint venture and sale of the vertebral augmentation solutions business. We remain focused on the areas we believe are high growth and aligned with our core capabilities. 
We have also made progress with our product registrations, having successfully registered more than 50 CareFusion products in over 20 countries. In addition, we have submitted registrations and are awaiting approval for an additional 25 products. This is consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies, and we remain on track for them to begin to materialize in fiscal year 2017. 
And in the areas of partnerships and collaborations, we remain excited for the launch of our infusion set, which we expect will move to broad commercial release with Medtronic in early fiscal year 2017. We believe this product will improve the consistency of insulin delivery by significantly reducing flow interruptions, simplify the user's experience and increase a patient's overall satisfaction with insulin pumping. 
We recently entered into a strategic partnership with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and we'll play a part in the Institute's vision of reducing cancer to a manageable disease. Support from the Parker Institute will help us advance our new cell sorter program while bringing our high-parameter cell analysis solutions to these researchers as they work to discover the next breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy. As you can see, we are executing on our strategy and continue to have strong opportunities to drive growth and innovation. We look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 18. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the second quarter, and we made progress with our back-office functions and with harmonizing our IT infrastructure. 
We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018. Contributing to our operational efficiencies is the benefit of sustained lower oil prices on raw material costs, as we discussed earlier. 
The consistent solid performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion we achieved last year, we expect another 170 to 190 basis points of expansion this fiscal year. 
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid second quarter. Both segments performed well and our performance highlights the benefits of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. 
Second, we have made significant progress on the acquisition of CareFusion. The value we can bring to customers around the world has become increasingly evident as we integrate these 2 great companies. 
Third, we have taken steps to optimize our portfolio. In doing so, we are positioning ourselves in higher-growth areas which are aligned with our core capabilities. By taking these actions, we are delivering the most value to our customers. 
Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. We're maintaining our currency-neutral revenue guidance and raising our adjusted EPS. We believe we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering value to our customers and shareholders. I look to the future with optimism. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

Maybe one for you and one for Chris. I guess the first one is, the theme that you're showing the last several quarters is one that the whole device industry is showing this quarter, which is this polarization between better U.S. performance and slightly softer ex U.S. performance, specifically emerging markets. Talk to us about how much of this in your mind is the quarter or just the trend that BD has been seeing for several quarters? And what's driving that strength in the U.S. in your opinion?"

But the other thing that you are seeing is that our businesses are performing quite well. You heard us talk about in the Bioscience business, the launch of those new products. We have a whole series of new products coming out, and I mentioned -- and specifically the high-parameter work that's going on. So yes, that showed up in this quarter right now, but that's going to continue as we move through the year. You also saw good performance in Diagnostics because we're getting some traction in blood culture and KIESTRA, that is moving forward -- KIESTRA moving forward in the U.S. And then good performance across the Medical businesses, where we -- we're improving our competitive position in MMS. And so you see all of that coming together. And Europe, I think -- once again, I think, has stabilized, and it's really -- of course, you have to drop out the CareFusion factors, but there was negative timing in Biosciences. But you've got the same product launches that are occurring there. And quite frankly, Japan is forming -- is performing better for us as well. Now on the other side of the coin, the situation in China seems to have stabilized. We're seeing good performance on the medical device side of the business. And the situation really hasn't changed all that much on Diagnostics, on the capital side, but it has stabilized. And so we're getting good growth in China. We didn't mention it, we continue to get good growth in India. We're getting good growth in Latin America. There were some onetime events this quarter, which you heard in terms of Africa and Saudi Arabia. And Saudi Arabia is more of an impact in the back half of the year. So yes, this is slightly less in emerging markets, yes, but the mix is quite good."

We're actually up against the tough comparison in the third quarter because in terms of absolute dollars, that was our highest quarter last year. So you got to really look at those absolute dollars. Looking at growth rates is a little misleading because the growth rate last year was negative in CareFusion in the third quarter, but that was more about the compare to prior year. But the absolute dollars are the grow over. And then as you model out the year, based on the guidance that we just gave you in terms of growth rates for the third and fourth quarter, you'll see steadily improving sequential revenue dollars for all 4 quarters this year. So we really feel good about the trajectory, particularly on a sequential basis. This year, it's all about the compare to last year revenue dollars."

Essentially all of those products fall within either MPS or MMS, the 2 businesses that are -- came from legacy CareFusion, and the majority of those products are actually within MPS. So think disposables. And this is right in line with what we had talked about over the last several quarters, that as we think about the first products that would be able to help drive incremental revenue growth, it would be things like infusion sets, ChloraPrep, the consumables that fit very well with BD's traditional sales channels and market approaches and presence in the marketplaces, and those are the products that we focused on getting registrations for first. So I would say we're seeing some early signs of success as we've been launching these products, which is very consistent with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and really remain on track to start seeing them materialize more in 2017. But we do see sales now. And obviously, on a company the size of BD and a segment of Medical, we'll see those start showing up more materially as we roll into '17. But they have started. And I would just say that obviously, we're going to continue those product registration work. We're continuing the sales and marketing investments to support those initiatives. But overall, we're on track."

It's 10 basis points of currency drag and 30 on operating margin. And the dynamic there is a couple of things. One is, although the euro has improved, the non-euro currencies year-over-year are still providing a bit of a drag. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, is the phenomenon of the profit and inventory that we've talked about in the past. So it didn't quite catch up in the second quarter. Certainly not much of a drag and it's starting to level off, and that, in my prepared remarks, was the commentary for the second half of the year. It doesn't really turn positive because of that phenomena, but it certainly lightens up in terms of headwinds."

So let me start off with the good Pyxis question and then I'll address infusion pumps. So we are actually quite pleased with the progress that we're making on Pyxis as we actually just released another new version of the software, which we think really it makes some very significant progress and actually addresses -- will make a big step forward in terms of installation efficiency. And so as we've shared in the past, we were really focused on improving the installation process. We had shared that there was a quite large backlog at the time of the acquisition. And to really address that backlog, we needed to improve the installation efficiency process, and we've been working on that, applying some of our lean expertise as well as making some adjustments in the software that would automate a lot of that and simplify the workload in the field. So we're seeing a lot of those efforts come to fruition. We did have very strong placements in Q2. That was part of the driver of MMS growth. We continue to see strong demand for the Pyxis ES platform, and we're equally looking forward to continued strong growth in the second half of the year in that, as Vince alluded to earlier. Then on the infusion side, we also are very pleased with the growth that we saw in the quarter here and have similar expectations for the back half of the year. As you know, we are the market leader in that space. We've continued to strengthen our position over the last several years. We expect to continue to strengthen our position in the market by about the same amount this year, as we have over the last couple of years. We do see customers continue to select the BD Alaris pumps in an incremental way really based on that interoperability and the power of one to be able to do all of their infusion needs across both large-volume infusions, syringes and narcotics, all in one product. It's the only item that can do that. So we're happy there. I would point out as well that as you look at our safety sales, particularly in the U.S., that was largely driven by growth in our -- in some of the connectors that are associated with our dedicated sets in the infusion category. And that's really a reflection of that strong performance in that infusion category and that renewing consumable stream that comes as we place pumps incrementally. Thank you."

So on -- in terms of cost synergies, we did, I would remind you, improve cost synergies fairly recently up to the $325 million to $350 million, and that was identification of some new synergies from our recent -- or our original model. I would also remind you that we increased the overall synergies from the standpoint of the tax rate improvements that we saw that we originally didn't contemplate, and that's another 3% accretion that we had mentioned. Really, the -- when you think about the synergies, we get initial synergies of duplicate public company costs. Then you move into the integration of systems and infrastructure, and we've gotten good traction on that and that led to the last increase. And then towards the end are the more difficult synergies to get, which are the distribution centers and manufacturing plants, and we actually saw some good initial improvements in that area or traction in that area that led to our last increase. So we really feel great about what we're driving. All-in all-in, it's significantly higher than our original expectations, particularly when you add the tax synergy. You see this year the EPS quarter-over-quarter was over 44% and, I think, is an indication of that. So we really feel good about our ability to drive those synergies and executing on those synergies."

That was driven again by the very strong gross profit margin, which is really going around operational efficiencies and continuous improvement, a little bit of benefit from raw material prices, as we've talked in the past, from oil. But then, on the operating side, SSG&A really reflective of hitting on the synergies. It was a little bit of an easier compare in the second quarter because of the operating margin challenges in CareFusion in that quarter last year. So you won't expect 370. In fact, we expect about 170 to 190 for the year on the operating margin basis. I'd remind you that's on top of a 100 basis of margin improvement last year. So really improving the margins, as you point out. And as we think about going forward, as we execute on synergies, you would expect to see above normal. So we usually think 40 to 50 basis points of margin improvement. You're going to get more of that as we execute on the synergies in '17 and '18. You would also get a little bit of a lift from the fact that as we exit respiratory, which had challenging margins, you get a little bit of a lift. So not to give guidance on '17, but you're absolutely right. Directionally, we're going to see improved margins going forward in '17 and '18. And then, as you start lapping those synergies, I think somewhere beyond that, you start going back to that 40 to 50 basis points. That's a few years out."

And then the entire platform, both in the U.S. and ex U.S., is being held by the Total automation we're doing across both our FocalPoint and our Totalys system.

In other cases, it's a combination of they're in certain countries that have longer registration. China has longer registration processes than most of Europe, as an example. And then the other one is, is that certain product categories -- so ChloraPrep, for example, is registered as a drug in many markets. Particularly, let's say, Latin America, it's registered as a drug. Those typically sit in the regulatory process longer than medical devices. So it's kind of a combination of those 3 items, not one thing specific, and not unexpected at all. It's right in line with our projection."

So what we did is we did flow through everything on the FX impact, and that was the $0.13. On an FXN basis, you're right, we were up around $0.14 to $0.16. But we see that as timing, and the timing buckets are the medical device tax spending, which we know where we want to spend it, but because of the timing -- don't forget it happened in January and we couldn't ramp that quickly. So that past quarter, we really got a lift from that. But we fully intend to spend that in the back half of the year. Then you had timing on the tax rate. So the tax rate was lower than our 21% to 22%, and that's just lumpy throughout the year. We expect that to fall back within the rest of the year. So you had that piece. And then we had the pull-forward of some of the revenues from the third quarter to the second quarter and the impact of that. So all of that accounts for the bulk of that $0.14 to $0.16 on an FXN basis. The other thing I'd point out is we actually raised the FXN EPS guidance last quarter by $0.28. It was loss from the standpoint that at that point, FX was getting worse across the world and it offset that, but the FXN was raised prior. So you really got to think about it in those 2 buckets."

That remains unchanged. So we remain very excited about that opportunity. It's, of course, our first venture outside of the pen needles and syringes for the Diabetes Care business, moving into a fast-growing market with the market leader, Medtronic, and we're, I think, equally excited about the product technology and what it can do to help patients and the partnership and what the power of us working together can do to make an impact there. If you think about solutions, so we -- as we had, of course, shared before, we have announced the solutions partnership with Fresenius. We are looking at launching that not necessarily now in Q4 of '16 but more in early FY '17 just based on regulatory approval time lines there, but that does continue to move forward.

During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations.
Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.
As a reminder, we annualize the acquisition of CareFusion in March, and as such, our third quarter results reflect the new BD in both the current and prior year period.
In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of [indiscernible] respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance.
Comparable organic revenues are adjusted to further exclude the impact of nonannualized acquisitions and closed divestitures. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliation to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides. 
At this time, we would like to announce some leadership changes, which will take place on October 1. Jerry Hurwitz, Executive Vice President of HR and Chief Human Resources Officer, has announced his intention to retire from the company. We thank Jerry for his many contributions and his 24 years of service to BD. 
We are also very pleased to announce that Linda Tharby will be our next Executive Vice President of HR and Chief Human Resources Officer effective with Jerry's retirement. We are confident that Linda's drive for performance, combined with her strong strategic agility and passion for people development, will make her well suited to lead HR. 
Linda's appointment helps the company meet a unique business needs and enables Linda to gain personal developments on the functional leadership side. 
We also pleased to announce that Alberto Mas, currently the Worldwide President of Diagnostic Systems, will succeed Linda as Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. Having served as President of 3 major business units during his 24-year career at BD, Alberto is uniquely positioned for this next step. Since assuming his position of Worldwide President of Diagnostic Systems in 2013, Alberto has focused the business on reinventing the labs through automation and standardization and advancing our position in the Molecular Diagnostics through differentiated assays. 
We are confident that both of these leaders will make major contributions to our future success as we build a bigger, better, bolder BD. 
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby in her current role as Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.

We're extremely pleased to announce Linda and Alberto's new roles as they help lead the company through our next phase of growth. 
Now turning to Slide 4 and the company's results. We are pleased with our third quarter growth profile. Performance from both the Medical and Life Sciences segments contributed to solid organic revenue growth that was in line with our expectations. Our results this quarter continue to highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse portfolio. We continue to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of synergies, operational efficiencies and continuous improvement. 
We're also increasing our R&D investment in key strategic opportunities and expect to fully utilize the benefit of the medical device tax suspension. As we've shared with you, we have a robust pipeline and look forward to sharing new opportunities with you in the near future. Looking ahead, I feel good about the business, and our performance year-to-date gives us confidence in our full year outlook. 
Moving to Slide 5. I will review our third quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company organic revenues grew 4%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.35 was ahead of our expectations. As I just mentioned, this was driven by strong operating performance, which enables us to invest incremental dollars in R&D. Chris will provide more details on this later in his remarks. 
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."

As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to solid third quarter results. Total third quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4% on a comparable organic basis. Thi",2004,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to solid third quarter results. 
Total third quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4% on a comparable organic basis. This was in line with the growth expectations we had outlined on last quarter's earnings call. As a reminder, the second fiscal quarter had benefited by about 50 basis points from the timing of revenues, which occurred earlier than originally anticipated. In turn, this negatively impacted the third quarter by about 50 basis points. I'll discuss this further as I take you through the business results. 
BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 3%, reflecting strong performance in Medication Management Solutions and Diabetes Care units and solid growth in the Medication and Procedural Solutions unit. As anticipated, performance in the Pharmaceutical Systems and Respiratory Solution units were negatively impacted, in part by customer ordering patterns and the timing of capital placements. These items occurred earlier than originally anticipated, benefiting the second fiscal quarter as communicated on last quarter's earnings call. 
Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 2.1%, which reflects strengthen in Infusion Therapy and safety-engineered products but was negatively impacted by the divestiture of our spine business and a tough comparison to the prior year. Medication Management Solutions revenues grew 6.2%, driven by strong dispensing capital installations with our Pyxis platform. We also saw solid growth in the infusion business. 
Growth in Diabetes Care was 6.6%, driven by pen needles and a favorable comparison to the prior year. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 1.5% reflects strong growth in SAIS and safety-engineered products, partially offset by the aforementioned timing of customer orders. 
Respiratory Solutions revenues decreased 3.3%, reflecting the aforementioned timing of capital placements. Respiratory Solutions had a negative impact of 60 basis points to the third quarter organic growth. Excluding the Respiratory Solutions business, total company organic growth was 4.6%. 
BD Life Sciences third quarter revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by strong growth in the Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems units. Preanalytical Systems growth of 6.6% was driven by international market and safety-engineered products in the U.S. 
Diagnostic Systems growth of 9.5% was the result of strong growth in microbiology, led by the timing of BD KIESTRA installations as well as continued strength in blood culture and growth in BD MAX. Biosciences revenues grew 1.2% in the third quarter. We are seeing additional pressure in Africa related to our clinical HIV business, and we continue to monitor this situation. In the U.S., Biosciences had double-digit growth, driven by sales of research instruments. In addition, we experienced strong sales of research reagents globally. Growth was partially offset by funding delays, primarily in Western Europe and Japan. 
Moving to Slide 8. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. revenues increased 3.4%, reflecting strength in both the Medical and Life Sciences segments. BD Medical's performance reflects strength in dispensing capital installations, which includes the benefit of a large customer installation as well as strong performance in infusion systems, which included double-digit growth in our disposables business. SAIS and safety-engineered products also contributed to growth in the quarter. 
BD Life Sciences growth in the U.S. reflects continued strength in our research business in Biosciences, led by the recently launched FACSSymphony and FACSCelesta instruments and a growing research reagent and surgeon dye portfolio, including our new optibuild platform for customized reagents. 
Diagnostic Systems was driven by strong growth in molecular, including BD MAX and growth in core blood culture. Preanalytical Systems also had solid performance across all 4 platforms during the quarter. 
Moving on to international. Revenues grew 4.6%. This is below our normal growth rate and primarily reflects some unfavorable timing events within the Medical segment. The Medical segment grew 2.6%. This reflects strength in China and sales of safety-engineered products and strong dispensing installations in Medication Management Solutions. This growth was partially offset by the timing events in Pharmaceutical Systems and Respiratory Solutions and softness in the Middle East as we expected. 
The Life Sciences segment grew 8.1%. Preanalytical Systems growth was very strong across all regions, primarily due to the continued expansion of safety-engineered products. Diagnostic Systems had strong growth in Western Europe, driven by KIESTRA installations in the quarter. Overall strength in core microbiology and cervical cancer-related sales also contributed to growth in Diagnostic Systems. The Biosciences business was negatively impacted by the aforementioned decline in the HIV business and funding delays. 
Now turning to Slide 9. Developed markets revenues grew 3.7%, and emerging markets revenues grew 5.2%. Third quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects solid growth in China and Latin America, partially offset by declines in the Middle East and Africa as communicated on last quarter's earnings call. The Middle East and Africa had a negative impact of approximately 400 basis points. Excluding these regions, emerging markets grew approximately 9% in the quarter. China growth for the third quarter was 9.5%. Revenue growth across the Medical and Life Sciences segments was driven by continued strong demand for consumables. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. We now anticipate total emerging markets to grow in the mid-single-digit range. We expect as we exit fiscal year 2016, these headwinds in the Middle East and Africa will largely be behind us. It's important to note that we anticipate emerging markets growth of high single digits as we move forward. 
Moving to global safety on Slide 10. Currency-neutral sales increased 8.9%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 5.3%, and international sales grew 13.9% currency neutral, driven by strength in Asia Pacific and Europe. Safety revenues grew 19.6% in emerging markets. 
Medical Safety sales grew 9.6%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products, including safety catheters and strength in Pharmaceutical Systems. The benefits from EU safety legislation continued aid growth in the quarter. 
Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 7.6% in the quarter. 
Slide 11 recaps the third quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 4% on a comparable organic currency-neutral basis. Pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. 
Gross profit improved 6.3%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at the underlying performance and the impact of currency. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 22.7%. We're very pleased with the leverage we're getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. The suspension of the medical device tax also had a positive impact on SSG&A that as we previously communicated, we intend to reinvest the savings in R&D, which you are beginning to see on the R&D line. 
R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.5%. We continue to invest in new products and innovation and expect to incrementally reinvest approximately $25 million of the medical device tax in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect R&D as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be above our full year guidance range. This brings our total year R&D dollars as a percentage of revenue closer to 6.5%. 
Operating income grew 12.8%, reflecting strong P&L leverage. Our tax rate declined 350 basis points to 21.3%, which is in line with our full year expectations of 21% to 22%. 
As Vince discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $2.35, which is a 19.5% increase versus the prior year. This reflects our solid growth profile, strong underlying margin expansion and a lower tax rate. I'd also like to highlight that year-to-date, we have driven very strong earnings growth of 33.9%. 
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of about 50 basis points on our gross profit margin in the quarter. On a performance basis, strong gross margin expansion of 160 basis points was primarily driven by operational performance and continuous improvement initiatives and, to a lesser extent, from favorable raw material prices. Strong operating margin performance of 210 basis points was primarily driven by gross margin expansion combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies and the positive impact of cost synergies. These contributions were partially offset by increased R&D expenses we incurred following the medical device tax suspension. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 60 basis points on operating margin in the quarter. 
Year-to-date, we have driven approximately 280 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion. This strong performance gives us the ability to raise our guidance for the year to a range of 200 to 210 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion. 
Moving on to Slide 14. To ensure consistency and clarity, I'd like to provide more color on revenue growth guidance. Last quarter, we noted there was approximately a 50 basis point benefit from the timing of revenues that occurred earlier than we anticipated. We expected that timing to bring down the third quarter growth rate a bit, and we had guided this quarter to be below our revenue growth range for the total year. 
The key to understanding our second half revenue growth trajectory is to focus on the absolute dollars we're achieving this year versus last year. We are up against a tough comparison this quarter because in terms of absolute dollars, that was our highest quarter last year. As you model out the total fiscal year, we have been steadily improving sequential revenue dollars every quarter. While our year-to-date performance implies a revenue growth rate of about 7% in the fourth quarter, you will see that in terms of absolute dollars, it's reasonable and achievable as illustrated on Slide 14. 
Moving on to Slide 15. We are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.50 to $8.57. Our strong performance in the third quarter and our full year outlook give us the confidence to raise our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance fiscal 2016 by 1 percentage point to a range of $9.08 to $9.15 while increasing our investment in R&D. Offsetting this increased performance are incremental currency headwinds of approximately 1 percentage point that have resulted from the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and other currencies since we provided guidance in May. We remain extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. 
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to walk through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. We continue to expect growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical. Due to the aforementioned challenges in Africa in our Biosciences business, we now expect revenues in BD Life Sciences to grow between 3.5% and 4%. This brings total BD to the bottom end of our revenue growth guidance range of 4.5% to 5% for the total year. 
On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 21% and 21.5%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 350 basis points, which is an incremental 50 basis point headwind compared to our prior guidance of about 300 basis points of currency headwinds. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be flat to slightly positive for the year. 
Our guidance assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.11 for the rest of the year. We see some remaining FX headwinds over the fourth quarter as noneuro currencies are also expected to be unfavorable year-over-year. 
Before I turn the call back over to Vince, I'd like to note that in June, we continued to deleverage as we paid down a $750 million debt maturity associated with the CareFusion acquisition. At the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.4x, and we remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3x gross debt leverage within 24 months of close or March of 2017. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

I will walk through our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations. 
Starting with new product innovation. Within our Medical business, we reached over 100 hospitals with Alaris infusion pump interoperability. Bidirectional interoperability to a hospital's electronic medical records improves patient safety and care by reducing manual input of data and programming errors while also improving staff efficiency. 
Within our Life Science business, we are seeing strong performance from our recently launched research instruments, FACSSymphony and FACSCelesta. In addition, to complement the portfolio, we recently introduced the unique mid-level cell sorter, the FACSMelody, which has received positive customer feedback. The FACSMelody will have a full-scale commercial launch in the fourth quarter. 
All of these instruments are complemented by our Sirigen Dyes and recently launched optibuild customized reagents. 
In the area of Women's Health, we have continued to make good progress. We have already submitted our vaginitis and GC/CT assays and are now in the process of submitting our HPV assay to the FDA for approval. This assay is designed to provide physicians access to broader, high-risk HPV genotype information beyond type 16 and 18 to guide and inform treatment decisions for their patients. This is an important milestone for the company and is complementary to our current portfolio. 
As part of our menu expansion on BD MAX, we have completed an agreement with Check-Points B.V., a Netherlands-based company, which is focused on the development of rapid molecular test for the detection of carbapenem-resistant organisms. Check-Points currently has a CE Mark product optimized for the BD MAX that incorporates our Open System Reagents. 
Within strategic and business initiatives, we're pleased with the progress towards the creation of the Respiratory Solutions joint venture and remain on track to close late in fiscal year 2016 or early in fiscal 2017. As we told you last quarter, we have also continued to make good progress with our CareFusion product registration process. We remain on track with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and continue to expect them to begin to materialize in fiscal year 2017 in our Medication and Procedural Solutions business. 
And in the areas of partnerships and collaborations, we recently completed an in-depth launch planning meeting with Medtronic to integrate our commercial plans in operations as we anticipate the launch of our insulin infusion set. We remain on track for broad commercial release in early fiscal year 2017. 
As you can see, we are executing on our strategy and continue to have strong opportunities to drive growth and innovation. We look forward to updating you further at our Analyst Day in New York City in November. 
Moving on to our business update on Slide 19. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the third quarter. We're making progress expanding and leveraging global shared services and centers of excellence. We also continue to focus on implementing lean and efficient end-to-end processes with our corporate functions. 
During the quarter, we also announced plans to close 2 plants as we made progress with our footprint optimization. We continue to expect the majority of manufacturing-related synergies to be achieved in the latter part of our deal horizon. 
We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies related to the CareFusion acquisition as we exit fiscal year 2018. 
Turning to operating margin expansion. The consistent solid performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion we achieved last year, we expect another 200 to 210 basis points of expansion this fiscal year. 
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid third quarter. Both segments performed well, and our results highlight the benefit of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. 
Second, we are delivering strong operating performance. Also, with respect to our operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, are generating significant operating margin improvement as evidenced by our increased guidance for the total year. Also, we have many exciting opportunities in the pipeline, and we are incrementally investing in an R&D to fund those strategic opportunities. 
Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. We remain very optimistic about BD's prospects for the future and our ability to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders over time. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

So it's good, continuous improvement, and that's coming from 2 things. Obviously, the synergies are helping us on the operating margins, SSG&A and that type of thing, but we're also seeing very good performance on the gross profit line, and a lot of that is really coming from continuous improvement-type initiatives that we've had in place. So we feel good about that. And the good news is that, that continues going forward, particularly on the synergy piece. So you would expect to see, on top of the normal 40 to 50 basis points that we drive every year, you would expect to see an incremental 40 to 50 basis points just coming from the natural synergies that you get over the life of the deal horizon. On top of that, you would also think about the fact that with the respiratory going away and with that joint venture, you'll get a benefit on margins as well because as we've mentioned, the respiratory margins really were headwinds to the overall margins. So we feel good about the margin profile going out into the future over the next couple of years."

This is not about going after new areas. This is really about fortifying what we were doing and so it's spread over both the medication management strategy and over to the Life Science side of things. So I'll give you one example on the Life Science side. We've been doing very well with KIESTRA. We see enhancements that we can make to KIESTRA. We know that the market is going to like these, and so this is an opportunity to accelerate that work that would have taken us another year or 2 to get to. On the medication management side, what I would tell you is that where we're spending is core to that medication management strategy. We saw there's a great opportunity. There was an opportunity to get some technology at the same time. So we're a little opportunistic to do this in the fourth quarter, made all the sense in the world. So right down the middle of what we're doing is the way to think about that, Rick. So I'll turn that over Tom."

Thanks for those questions. Absolutely as I think through fiscal year '17, I would take you back to our normal model, which is mid single digits, 5 percentage [ph] on the top and 10% on the bottom.

Absolutely as I think through fiscal year '17, I would take you back to our normal model, which is mid single digits, 5 percentage [ph] on the top and 10% on the bottom. Then on top of that, you get a couple hundred basis points coming from the synergies that we've talked about. And then I think you just have to take into consideration, and I'm not sure everybody's models shows this yet, the $0.10 to $0.14 that come from the respiratory dilution. So that gets you a number that is clearly in the low double digits, as you said. So I have a lot of confidence in that. What I'd also point to, though, is the variables of the headwinds and tailwinds, which generally come from FX and pension, and it's too early to call either of those, and we'll certainly give more guidance on that in November as we provide specific guidance. But right now, neither one of those seem too bad. If FX stayed where it is, it'd be pretty neutral. Pension right now interest rates are probably slight negative, but that could change between now and September when it gets measured. So bottom line, is we are really feeling good about that. Onto your second question in terms of capital allocation, you see that we are making great progress towards our 3x leverage. We're already down to 3.4. So we're well on our way. So thinking about the second half of next year, we will certainly be in a position where we can -- our cash flow is good. We'll be in a position to start redirecting some of that cash away from debt pay-down and back to the more traditional capital allocation methods that we have. I think what you could expect us to do is go back to a similar model that we had pre-CareFusion acquisition, where we look at tuck-in acquisitions. We make sure we're invested in the business clearly first. We have always been increasing our dividend, and we continue to increase the dividend, obviously, as we do the CareFusion transaction, and we've been increasing 10%. But because the bottom line's growing more than 10%, the payout ratios come down. So I think we've got to bring that more in the line and do a little bit of catch up there. And then obviously, that still leaves a lot of cash leftover. We would rather not have that build up on the balance sheet, and so we would likely go back to some share buyback. Having said that, I intend to go through that in November. We do have some time. I'm actually thinking of getting all of your input between now and March to let us know what you think, and so I'd encourage that. And as you know, we've been already beginning that kind of dialogue, and so the good news is I think we have a lot of cash and some positive things that we can do in terms of allocating that. So that's sort of a way to think about it."

You're pointing to Slide 14 to give you a sense that the revenue growth in the quarter just increases a little bit in the fourth quarter, but the growth rate is significantly different, and that's all about last year. So if you remember last quarter, I mentioned this time we actually give you a chart that kind of demonstrates it because I think if you really study that chart, you can see that the growth rates moving around, but the dollars a nice sequential increases every quarter, and so that gives us the confidence that we can achieve that in the fourth quarter. To your point on EPS, it's really all about the fact that we let the overperformance in the third quarter, we let half of that flow through, and then the other half is what we're investing. If you do the math on that investment of R&D, that's about 20 -- that's $25 million. That takes you up close to 7.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter, and so that's the other half of the overachievement in the third quarter that we're going to spend. And when you think about that, it's really -- we couldn't really spend it in the second quarter. We just couldn't get the programs in place fast enough. We spent the fair share in the third quarter. That's 6.5% of revenues. So we started to getting some traction on reinvesting in Medical device there, and fourth quarter is really a catch up. So when you look at how much we're spending this year on R&D related to medical device tax, it's the entire amount of the medical device tax that we get in benefit. So think about that more as a catch-up. Now in addition to that, on EPS, we talked about headwinds from FX, and that's certainly the other piece of it. We get a little bit of a headwind from the euro going from 1 13 down to 1 11, but the bigger portion is the other currencies, and those other currencies are -- there's really 3 that are driving that impact. The yuan in China is significantly weakened against the dollar since May, about 3% weakness. The Mexican peso has weakened about 6% versus the dollar. And obviously, the British pounds we all know from Brexit impacted by about 9% from our May call, and those are the 3 that are driving the preponderance of the headwinds and FX in the fourth quarter. Thanks very much."

Moving onto microbiology, broadly, of course, saw a lot of share gains over the course of the last year in our BACTEC. But if we think about what we're trying to do with a microbiology lab, it's really about our KIESTRA system and doing 2 things. So first thing we've done with KIESTRA acquisition a few years back is really focus on the full automation. So moving that plate right from start of streaking that plate through IDAST, KIESTRA links all of those systems completely together, and then over the course of the last year, we worked on our [indiscernible] program, which we now advise informatics around that platform, and of course, the first thing that we will do in that informatics side is launch our Veritor plus, which is our flu. It will be next-generation of Veritor for us, which will link into that system, which will launch in Q4 of this year. So hopefully that gives you good picture of both on the PAS side. We're really excited about the innovation. I talked about the tube side. We also have innovation on the needle side and then what we're doing in the microbiology lab."

When we think about emerging markets, obviously, we start with Asia. And within Asia, we start with China, and we're looking at health care spending in China and how that is unfolding.

And within Asia, we start with China, and we're looking at health care spending in China and how that is unfolding. And what we're seeing is consistent spending in China. We break that down then to look at business by business, what's happening on kind of the capital side of things as they're purchasing. That's more of an impact, obviously, on the Life Science than on the Medical side. And then we go back and look at the Medical piece in 2 ways course, what's the opportunity for core growth. And then as Tom was talking about earlier, all the product registrations we have for China and other marketplaces from the CareFusion acquisition. So that's China, number one. Number two, we're looking at India as a growth driver, and that has -- the last 2 years, that has picked up and been a good growth driver for us. Yes, there's pluses and minuses in India. We're seeing good fundamental demand there with the burgeoning middle class. We're expanding our distribution in India. So we will take that into account. There are some headwinds in India in terms of tariffs that are -- that have been put in place. So we make sure that's not any significant impact but -- so I would say we still find it as a very attractive marketplace for us. And Middle East and Africa, of course, we're much more careful about what's going on in Saudi Arabia. We follow what the government funding is. In this case, of course, the funding was not just in health care, but it was a significant change linked to the price of oil that we saw, and so the way we're thinking about that is kind of price of oil staying where it is, which means on the low side, which says that they're going to fund their health care, but it's not a big expansion of health care. That was going on in the first half of the year. That's not happening now. But they have to continue to provide care. That's what we're thinking about there. In Africa, we talked about the CD4 business and some of the shift in the guidelines. We believe we've seen the majority of that impact that's really driven by [indiscernible], not the entire marketplace. So it was a segment of that market. So we'll watch how that evolves as Linda said. Then Latin America, as you know, a mixture for us. Mexico's doing well. Brazil is doing okay is what we would say, and we watch the economy there and what's happening from an inflationary standpoint. And of course, funding -- but the other countries in Latin America contributing quite nicely. So that's how we build it up."

The numbers that we cited are certainly less than half of the products that we intend to have registered outside. We obviously started with those products that we have the data available for that you need to have additional data generated, and we're in existing formats that those markets would accept. Take, for example, as we think about pumps in some cases, we need to do translation and get the language done first, and that's an R&D program to get that ready. Some of the markets require infusion sets to be adapted a bit for local practices, and so what you saw come through first are, obviously, those products that meet the needs of specific geographies. We have the data ready, and we move forward and submit right away and so most of those also tend to be on the consumable side I shared earlier, which is why is we think about FY '17, we would expect those synergies to really be focused within our NPS business because that's where those more simple medical devices that are more universal in nature in terms of how they fit in with the health care system. That's where we tend to be focused."

And again just to put things in perspective, we're really pleased with the performance and outlook and even though we've gotten as early as in FY '16, of course, as we have said, CareFusion was 3, 3.5 at best growth business as a stand-alone. We're holding at our 4.5% to 5% growth for the segment overall. And as you know, when you take a 3% grower and a nearly 5% grower, you don't get within the range that we are sharing, and so we are already -- we see some good performance this year already as a result of the 2 companies coming together. We've been some incremental improvements on that in FY '17 within the NPS business in that tens of bps as Chris described. The other thing as you also to keep in mind is that some geographies take a lot longer. So China although with the market that we are filing registrations in, once you file a registration in China, it's a 3-year process. So you can't get into certain markets that fast. More of the European Latin America Southeast Asian markets are those geographies that you can actually get into within an 18-month window, and so that's where you'll see us entering first. Those aren't necessarily as large a some of the markets in China, which will be later on in our 3-year kind of outlook horizon."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.
As a reminder, we annualized the acquisition of CareFusion in March, and as such, our third quarter results reflect the new BD in both the current and prior year period.
In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance.
Comparable organic revenues are adjusted to further exclude the impact of nonannualized acquisitions and closed divestitures. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliation to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.
At this time, we would like to announce some leadership changes, which will take place on October 1. Jerry Hurwitz, Executive Vice President of HR and Chief Human Resources Officer, has announced his intention to retire from the company. We thank Jerry for his many contributions and his 24 years of service to BD.
We are also very pleased to announce that Linda Tharby will be our next Executive Vice President of HR and Chief Human Resources Officer effective with Jerry's retirement. We are confident that Linda's drive for performance, combined with her strong strategic agility and passion for people development, will make her well suited to lead HR. Linda's appointment helps the company meet a unique business need and enables Linda to gain personal development on the functional leadership side.
We are also pleased to announce that Alberto Mas, currently the Worldwide President of Diagnostic Systems, will succeed Linda as Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. Having served as President of 3 major business units during his 24-year career at BD, Alberto is uniquely positioned for this next step. Since assuming his position of Worldwide President of Diagnostic Systems in 2013, Alberto has focused the business on reinventing the labs through automation and standardization and advancing our position in the molecular diagnostics through differentiated assays. We are confident that both of these leaders will make major contributions to our future success as we build a bigger, better, bolder BD.
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby in her current role as Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

Our leadership team is designed to support the company's strategy and increase focus on growth as we develop more impactful solutions for our customers. We're extremely pleased to announce Linda and Alberto's new roles as they help lead the company through our next phase of growth.
Now turning to Slide 4 and the company's results. We're pleased with our third quarter growth profile. Performance from both the Medical and Life Sciences segments contributed to solid organic revenue growth that was in line with our expectations. Our results this quarter continue to highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse portfolio. We continue to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of synergies, operational efficiencies and continuous improvement. We're also increasing our R&D investment in key strategic opportunities and expect to fully utilize the benefit of the medical device tax suspension.
As we've shared with you, we have a robust pipeline and look forward to sharing new opportunities with you in the near future. Looking ahead, I feel good about the business, and our performance year-to-date gives us confidence in our full year outlook.
Moving to Slide 5. I will review our third quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company organic revenues grew 4%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.35 was ahead of our expectations. As I just mentioned, this was driven by strong operating performance, which enables us to invest incremental dollars in R&D. Chris will provide more details on this later in his remarks.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,370563082,1025017,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to solid third quarter results.Total third quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4% on a comparable organic basis. This",2004,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to solid third quarter results.
Total third quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4% on a comparable organic basis. This was in line with the growth expectations we had outlined on last quarter's earnings call. As a reminder, the second fiscal quarter had benefited by about 50 basis points from the timing of revenues, which occurred earlier than originally anticipated. In turn, this negatively impacted the third quarter by about 50 basis points. I'll discuss this further as I take you through the business results.
BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 3%, reflecting strong performance in Medication Management Solutions and Diabetes Care units and solid growth in the Medication and Procedural Solutions unit. As anticipated, performance in the Pharmaceutical Systems and Respiratory Solution units were negatively impacted, in part by customer ordering patterns and the timing of capital placements. These items occurred earlier than originally anticipated, benefiting the second fiscal quarter as communicated on last quarter's earnings call.
Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 2.1%, which reflects strength in infusion therapy and safety-engineered products but was negatively impacted by the divestiture of our spine business and a tough comparison to the prior year. Medication Management Solution revenues grew 6.2%, driven by strong dispensing capital installations with our Pyxis platform. We also saw solid growth in the infusion business.
Growth in Diabetes Care was 6.6%, driven by pen needles and a favorable comparison to the prior year. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 1.5% reflects strong growth in SAIS and safety-engineered products, partially offset by the aforementioned timing of customer orders.
Respiratory Solutions revenues decreased 3.3%, reflecting the aforementioned timing of capital placements. Respiratory Solutions had a negative impact of 60 basis points to the third quarter organic growth. Excluding the Respiratory Solutions business, total company organic growth was 4.6%.
BD Life Sciences third quarter revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by strong growth in the Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems units. Preanalytical Systems growth of 6.6% was driven by international market and safety-engineered products in the U.S.
Diagnostic Systems growth of 9.5% was the result of strong growth in microbiology, led by the timing of BD KIESTRA installations as well as continued strength in blood culture and growth in BD MAX.
Biosciences revenues grew 1.2% in the third quarter. We are seeing additional pressure in Africa related to our clinical HIV business, and we continue to monitor this situation. In the U.S., Biosciences had double-digit growth, driven by sales of research instruments. In addition, we experienced strong sales of research reagents globally. Growth was partially offset by funding delays, primarily in Western Europe and Japan.
Moving to Slide 8. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. revenues increased 3.4%, reflecting strength in both the Medical and Life Sciences segments. BD Medical's performance reflects strength in dispensing capital installations, which includes the benefit of a large customer installation as well as strong performance in infusion systems, which included double-digit growth in our disposables business. SAIS and safety-engineered products also contributed to growth in the quarter.
BD Life Sciences growth in the U.S. reflects continued strength in our research business and biosciences, led by the recently launched FACSSymphony and FACSCelesta instruments and a growing research reagent and Sirigen dye portfolio, including our new OptiBuild platform for customized reagents. 
Diagnostic Systems was driven by strong growth in molecular, including BD MAX and growth in core blood culture. Preanalytical Systems also had solid performance across all 4 platforms during the quarter.
Moving on to International. Revenues grew 4.6%. This is below our normal growth rate and primarily reflects some unfavorable timing events within the Medical segment. The Medical segment grew 2.6%. This reflects strength in China and sales of safety-engineered products and strong dispensing installations in Medication Management Solutions. This growth was partially offset by the timing events in Pharmaceutical Systems and Respiratory Solutions and softness in the Middle East as we expected.
The Life Sciences segment grew 8.1%. Preanalytical Systems growth was very strong across all regions, primarily due to continued expansion of safety-engineered products. Diagnostic Systems had strong growth in Western Europe, driven by KIESTRA installations in the quarter. Overall strength in core microbiology and cervical cancer-related sales also contributed to growth in Diagnostic Systems. The Biosciences business was negatively impacted by the aforementioned declines in the HIV business and funding delays.
Now turning to Slide 9. Developed markets revenues grew 3.7%, and emerging markets revenues grew 5.2%. Third quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects solid growth in China and Latin America, partially offset by declines in the Middle East and Africa, as communicated on last quarter's earnings call. The Middle East and Africa had a negative impact of approximately 400 basis points. Excluding these regions, emerging markets grew approximately 9% in the quarter.
China growth for the third quarter was 9.5%. Revenue growth across the Medical and Life Sciences segments was driven by continued strong demand for consumables. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. We now anticipate total emerging markets to grow in the mid-single-digit range. We expect as we exit fiscal year 2016, these headwinds in the Middle East and Africa will largely be behind us. It's important to note that we anticipate emerging markets growth of high single digits as we move forward.
Moving to global safety on Slide 10. Currency-neutral sales increased 8.9%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 5.3%, and international sales grew 13.9% currency neutral, driven by strength in Asia Pacific and Europe. Safety revenues grew 19.6% in emerging markets.
Medical Safety sales grew 9.6%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products, including safety catheters and strength in Pharmaceutical Systems. The benefits from EU safety legislation continue to aid growth in the quarter.
Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 7.6% in the quarter.
Slide 11 recaps the third quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 4% on a comparable organic currency-neutral basis. Pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. Gross profit improved 6.3%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at the underlying performance and the impact of currency.
SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 22.7%. We're very pleased with the leverage we're getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. The suspension of the medical device tax also had a positive impact on SSG&A. As we previously communicated, we intend to reinvest the savings in R&D, which you are beginning to see on the R&D line.
R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.5%. We continue to invest in new products and innovation and expect to incrementally reinvest approximately $25 million of the medical device tax in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect R&D as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be above our full year guidance range. This brings our total year R&D dollars as a percentage of revenue closer to 6.5%.
Operating income grew 12.8%, reflecting strong P&L leverage. Our tax rate declined 350 basis points to 21.3%, which is in line with our full year expectations of 21% to 22%.
As Vince discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $2.35, which is a 19.5% increase versus the prior year. This reflects our solid growth profile, strong underlying margin expansion and a lower tax rate. I'd also like to highlight that year-to-date, we have driven very strong earnings growth of 33.9%.
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of about 50 basis points on our gross profit margin in the quarter. On a performance basis, strong gross margin expansion of 160 basis points was primarily driven by operational performance and continuous improvement initiatives and, to a lesser extent, from favorable raw material prices. Strong operating margin performance of 210 basis points was primarily driven by gross margin expansion combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies and the positive impact of cost synergies. These contributions were partially offset by increased R&D expenses we incurred following the medical device tax suspension. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 60 basis points on operating margin in the quarter.
Year-to-date, we have driven approximately 280 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion. This strong performance gives us the ability to raise our guidance for the year to a range of 200 to 210 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion.
Moving on to Slide 14. To ensure consistency and clarity, I'd like to provide more color on revenue growth guidance. Last quarter, we noted there was approximately a 50 basis point benefit from the timing of revenues that occurred earlier than we anticipated. We expected that timing to bring down the third quarter growth rate a bit, and we had guided this quarter to be below our revenue growth range for the total year.
The key to understanding our second half revenue growth trajectory is to focus on the absolute dollars we're achieving this year versus last year. We are up against a tough comparison this quarter because in terms of absolute dollars, that was our highest quarter last year. As you model out the total fiscal year, we have been steadily improving sequential revenue dollars every quarter. While our year-to-date performance implies a revenue growth rate of about 7% in the fourth quarter, you will see that in terms of absolute dollars, it's reasonable and achievable, as illustrated on Slide 14.
Moving on to Slide 15. We are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.50 to $8.57. Our strong performance in the third quarter and our full year outlook give us the confidence to raise our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 by 1 percentage point to a range of $9.08 to $9.15 while increasing our investment in R&D. Offsetting this increased performance are incremental currency headwinds of approximately 1 percentage point that have resulted from the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and other currencies since we provided guidance in May. We remain extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments.
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to walk through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. We continue to expect growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical. Due to the aforementioned challenges in Africa in our Biosciences business, we now expect revenues in BD Life Sciences to grow between 3.5% and 4%. This brings total BD to the bottom end of our revenue growth guidance range of 4.5% to 5% for the total year.
On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 21% and 21.5%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 350 basis points, which is an incremental 50 basis point headwind compared to our prior guidance of about 300 basis points of currency headwinds. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be flat to slightly positive for the year.
Our guidance assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.11 for the rest of the year. We see some remaining FX headwinds over the fourth quarter as non-euro currencies are also expected to be unfavorable year-over-year.
Before I turn the call back over to Vince, I'd like to note that in June, we continued to deleverage as we paid down a $750 million debt maturity associated with the CareFusion acquisition. At the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.4x, and we remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3x gross debt leverage within 24 months of close or March of 2017.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

Within our Medical business, we reached over",778,"Thank you, Chris. Moving on to Slide 18. I will walk through our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations.
Starting with new product innovation. Within our Medical business, we reached over 100 hospitals with Alaris infusion pump interoperability. Bidirectional interoperability to a hospital's electronic medical records improves patient safety and care by reducing manual input of data and programming errors while also improving staff efficiency.
Within our Life Science business, we are seeing strong performance from our recently launched research instruments, FACSSymphony and FACSCelesta. In addition, to complement the portfolio, we recently introduced the unique mid-level cell sorter, the FACSMelody, which has received positive customer feedback. The FACSMelody will have a full-scale commercial launch in the fourth quarter.
All of these instruments are complemented by our Sirigen dyes and recently launched OptiBuild customized reagents.
In the area of Women's Health, we have continued to make good progress. We have already submitted our vaginitis and GC/CT assays and are now in the process of submitting our HPV assay to the FDA for approval. This assay is designed to provide physicians access to broader, high-risk HPV genotype information beyond type 16 and 18 to guide and form treatment decisions for their patients. This is an important milestone for the company and is complementary to our current portfolio.
As part of our menu expansion on BD MAX, we have completed an agreement with Check-Points B.V., a Netherlands-based company which is focused on the development of rapid molecular test for the detection of carbapenem-resistant organisms. Check-Points currently has a CE Mark product optimized for the BD MAX that incorporates our open system reagents.
Within strategic and business initiatives, we're pleased with the progress towards the creation of the Respiratory Solutions joint venture and remain on track to close late in fiscal year 2016 or early in fiscal 2017.
As we told you last quarter, we have also continued to make good progress with our CareFusion product registration process. We remain on track with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and continue to expect them to begin to materialize in fiscal year 2017 in our Medication and Procedural Solutions business.
And in the areas of partnerships and collaborations, we recently completed an in-depth launch planning meeting with Medtronic to integrate our commercial plans and operations as we anticipate the launch of our insulin infusion set. We remain on track for broad commercial release in early fiscal year 2017.
As you can see, we are executing on our strategy and continue to have strong opportunities to drive growth and innovation. We look forward to updating you further at our Analyst Day in New York City in November.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 19. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the third quarter. We're making progress expanding and leveraging global shared services and centers of excellence. We also continue to focus on implementing lean and efficient end-to-end processes with our corporate functions.
During the quarter, we also announced plans to close 2 plants as we made progress with our footprint optimization. We continue to expect the majority of manufacturing-related synergies to be achieved in the latter part of our deal horizon.
We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies related to the CareFusion acquisition as we exit fiscal year 2018.
Turning to operating margin expansion. The consistent solid performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion we achieved last year, we expect another 200 to 210 basis points of expansion this fiscal year.
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid third quarter. Both segments performed well, and our results highlight the benefit of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. Second, we are delivering strong operating performance. Also, with respect to our operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture are generating significant operating margin improvement as evidenced by our increased guidance for the total year. Also, we have many exciting opportunities in the pipeline, and we are incrementally investing in R&D to fund those strategic opportunities. Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. We remain very optimistic about BD's prospects for the future and our ability to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders over time.
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

Maybe just stepping back, how much -- actually, I'll start it differently. Becton has consistently, for a long time, every year, done a good job of expanding margins, reducing costs. But this kind of performance we've seen in fiscal '15 and 2016, how do we think about the next 2 years? What are the opportunities that are remaining? And I mean, do you have a lot more to go in terms of consolidating plant manufacturing? Just give us some larger perspective to think about the future."

And so it's a good, continuous improvement, and that's coming from 2 things. Obviously, the synergies are helping us on the operating margins, SSG&A and that type of thing, but we're also seeing very good performance on the gross profit line, and a lot of that is really coming from continuous improvement-type initiatives that we've had in place. So we feel good about that. And the good news is that, that continues going forward, particularly on the synergy piece. So you would expect to see, on top of the normal 40 to 50 basis points that we drive every year, you would expect to see an incremental 40 to 50 basis points just coming from the natural synergies that you get over the life of the deal horizon. On top of that, you would also think about the fact that with the respiratory going away and with that joint venture, you'll get a benefit on margins as well because as we've mentioned, the respiratory margins really were headwinds to the overall margins. So we feel good about the margin profile going out into the future over the next couple of years."

So I really do think that this is a great opportunity for us with the suspension of the medical device tax to, Rick, accelerate our strategy is what this is really about. This is not about going after new areas. This is really about fortifying what we were doing. And so it's spread over both the medication management strategy and over to the life science side of things. So I'll give you one example on the Life Science side. We've been doing very well with KIESTRA. We see enhancements that we can make to KIESTRA. We know that the market is going to like these, and so this is an opportunity to accelerate that work that would have taken us another year or 2 to get to. On the medication management side, what I would tell you is that where we're spending is core to that medication management strategy. We saw there's a great opportunity. There was an opportunity to get some technology at the same time. So we're a little opportunistic to do this in the fourth quarter, made all the sense in the world. So right down the middle of what we're doing is the way to think about that, Rick. So I'll turn that over to Tom."

And then just maybe for a second one for Chris, just capital deployment priorities. You mentioned deleveraging here into this year and into next year. Just how are you thinking about capital priorities? Maybe it's also a question for Vince in terms of future M&A, share repurchase activity or further deleverage."

Absolutely, as I think through fiscal year '17, I would take you back to our normal model, which is mid-single digits, 5 percentage on the top and 10% on the bottom. Then on top of that, you get a couple hundred basis points coming from the synergies that we've talked about. And then I think you just have to take into consideration, and I'm not sure everybody's model shows this yet, the $0.10 to $0.14 that come from the respiratory dilution. So that gets you to a number that is clearly in the low double digits, as you said. So I have a lot of confidence in that. What I'd also point to, though, is the variables of the headwinds and tailwinds which generally come from FX and pension. And it's too early to call either of those, and we'll certainly give more guidance on that in November as we provide specific guidance. But right now, neither one of those seem too bad. If FX stayed where it is, it'd be pretty neutral. Pension right now with interest rates are probably a slight negative, but that could change between now and September when it gets measured. So bottom line is we are really feeling good about that. Onto your second question in terms of capital allocation, you see that we are making great progress towards our 3x leverage. We're already down to 3.4. So we're well on our way. So thinking about the second half of next year, we will certainly be in a position where we can -- our cash flow is good. We'll be in a position to start redirecting some of that cash away from debt pay-down and back to the more traditional capital allocation methods that we have. I think what you could expect us to do is go back to a similar model that we had pre-CareFusion acquisition, where we look at tuck-in acquisitions. We make sure we're invested in the business clearly first. We have always been increasing our dividend, and we continued to increase the dividend, obviously, as we did the CareFusion transaction. And we've been increasing 10%. But because the bottom line is growing more than 10%, the payout ratios come down. So I think we've got to bring that more in the line and do a little bit of catch-up there. And then obviously, that still leaves a lot of cash leftover. We would rather not have that build up on the balance sheet, and so we would likely go back to some share buybacks. Having said that, I intend to go through that in November. We do have some time. I'm actually thinking of getting all of your input between now and March to let us know what you think, and so I'd encourage that. And as you know, we've been already beginning that kind of dialogue. And so the good news is I think we have a lot of cash and some positive things that we can do in terms of allocating that. So that's sort of a way to think about it."

So you're pointing to Slide 14, and I think we gave that to give you a sense that the revenue growth in the quarter just increases a little bit in the fourth quarter, but the growth rate is significantly different. And that's all about l",427,"Yes -- no, Vijay. So you're pointing to Slide 14, and I think we gave that to give you a sense that the revenue growth in the quarter just increases a little bit in the fourth quarter, but the growth rate is significantly different. And that's all about last year. So if you remember, last quarter, I mentioned this, this time we thought we'd actually give you a chart that kind of demonstrates it because I think if you really study that chart, you can see that the growth rate is moving around, but the dollar is a nice sequential increases every quarter. And so that gives us the confidence that we can achieve that in the fourth quarter. To your point on EPS, it's really all about the fact that we let the overperformance in the third quarter -- we let half of that flow through, and then the other half is what we're investing. If you do the math on that investment of R&D, that's about $25 million. That takes you up close to 7.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter. And so that's the other half of the overachievement in the third quarter that we're going to spend. And when you think about that, it's really -- we couldn't really spend it in the second quarter. We just couldn't get the programs in place fast enough. We spent the fair share in the third quarter. That's 6.5% of revenues. So we started to getting some traction on reinvesting in medical device there. And fourth quarter is really a catch-up. So when you look at how much we're spending this year on R&D related to medical device tax, it's the entire amount of the medical device tax that we get in benefit. So think about that more as a catch-up. Now in addition to that, on EPS, we talked about headwinds from FX, and that's certainly the other piece of it. We get a little bit of a headwind from the euro going from $1.13 down to $1.11. But the bigger portion is the other currencies, and those other currencies are -- there's really 3 that are driving that impact. The yuan in China has significantly weakened against the dollar since May, about 3% weakness. The Mexican peso has weakened about 6% versus the dollar. And obviously, the British pound's, we all know from Brexit, impacted by about 9% from our May call. And those are the 3 that are driving the preponderance of the headwinds and FX in the fourth quarter. Thanks very much."

Moving on to microbiology, broadly, of course, saw a lot of share gains over the course of the last year in our BACTEC. But if we think about what we're trying to do in a microbiology lab, it's really about our KIESTRA system and doing 2 things. So first thing we've done with KIESTRA acquisition a few years back is really focus on the full automation. So moving that plate rate from start of streaking that plate rate through the IDAST. KIESTRA links all of those systems completely together. And then over the course of the last year, we worked on our Infostratus program, which we now advise informatics around that platform. And of course, the first thing that we will do on that informatics side is launch our Veritor Plus, which is our flu. It will be the next-generation Veritor for us, which will link into that system, which will launch in Q4 of this year. So hopefully, that gives you a good picture both on the PAS side.

And within Asia, we start with China, and we're looking at health care spending in China and how that is unfolding. And what we're seeing is consistent spending in China. We break that down then to look at business by business, what's happening on kind of the capital side of things as they're purchasing. That's more of an impact, obviously, on the Life Science side than on the Medical side. And then we go back and look at the Medical piece in 2 ways course, what's the opportunity for core growth, and then as Tom was talking about earlier, all the product registrations that we have for China and other marketplaces from the CareFusion acquisition. So that's China, number one. Number two, we're looking at India as a growth driver, and that has -- the last 2 years, that has picked up and been a good growth driver for us. Yes, there's pluses and minuses in India. We're seeing good fundamental demand there with the burgeoning middle class. We're expanding our distribution in India. So we will take that into account. There are some headwinds in India in terms of tariffs that are -- that have been put in place. So we make sure that that's not any significant impact, so I would say we still find it as a very attractive marketplace for us. And Middle East and Africa, of course, we're much more careful about what's going on in Saudi Arabia. We follow what the government funding is. In this case, of course, the funding was not just in health care, but it was a significant change linked to the price of oil that we saw. And so the way we're thinking about that is kind of price of oil staying where it is, which means on the low side, which says that they're going to fund their health care, but it's not a big expansion of health care. That was going on in the first half of the year. That's not happening now. But they have to continue to provide care. That's what we're thinking about there. In Africa, we talked about the CD4 business and some of the shift in the guidelines. We've seen -- we believe we've seen the majority of that impact that's really driven by Pepkor, not the entire marketplace. So it was a segment of that market. So we'll watch how that evolves, as Linda said. Then Latin America, as you know, a mixture for us. Mexico's doing well. Brazil is doing okay is what we would say, and we watch the economy there and what's happening from an inflationary standpoint. And of course, funding -- but the other countries in Latin America contributing quite nicely. So that's how we build it up."

The numbers that we cited are certainly less than half of the products that we intend to have registered outside. We obviously started with those products that we have the data available for, that you'd need to have additional data generated. And we're in existing formats that those markets would accept. Take, for example, as we think about pumps, in some cases, we need to do translation and get the language done first, and that's an R&D program to get that ready. Some of the markets require infusion sets to be adapted a bit for local practices. And so what you saw come through first are, obviously, those products that meet the needs of specific geographies. We have the data ready, and we move forward and submit right away. And so most of those also tend to be on the consumable side I shared earlier, which is why as we think about FY '17, we would expect those synergies to really be focused within our MPS business because that's where those more simple medical devices that are more universal in nature in terms of how they fit in with the health care system. That's where we tend to be focused."

And again, just to put things in perspective, we're really pleased with the performance and outlook. And even though we've gotten as early as in FY '16, of course, as we have said, CareFusion was 3%, 3.5% at best growth business as a stand-alone, all right. We're holding at our 4.5% to 5% growth for the segment overall. And as you know, when you take a 3% grower and a nearly 5% grower, you don't get within the range that we're sharing. And so we're already -- we see some good performance this year already as a result of the 2 companies coming together. We think some incremental improvements on that in FY '17, specifically within the MPS business in that tens of bps, as Chris described. The other thing as you -- also to keep in mind is that some geographies take a lot longer. So China, although it's a market that we are filing registrations in, once you file a registration in China, it's a 3-year process. So you can't get into certain markets that fast. Typically, more of the European, Latin America, Southeast Asia markets are those geographies that you can actually get into within an 18-month window. And so that's where you'll see us entering first. Those aren't necessarily as large as some of the markets like China, which will be later on in our 3-year kind of outlook horizon."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.
As a reminder, we annualized the acquisition of CareFusion in March, and as such, our third quarter results reflect the new BD in both the current and prior year period.
In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance.
Comparable organic revenues are adjusted to further exclude the impact of nonannualized acquisitions and closed divestitures. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliation to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.
At this time, we would like to announce some leadership changes which will take place on October 1. Jerry Hurwitz, Executive Vice President of HR and Chief Human Resources Officer, has announced his intention to retire from the company. We thank Jerry for his many contributions and his 24 years of service to BD.
We are also very pleased to announce that Linda Tharby will be our next Executive Vice President of HR and Chief Human Resources Officer effective with Jerry's retirement. We are confident that Linda's drive for performance, combined with her strong strategic agility and passion for people development, will make her well suited to lead HR. Linda's appointment helps the company meet a unique business need and enables Linda to gain personal development on the functional leadership side.
We are also pleased to announce that Alberto Mas, currently the Worldwide President of Diagnostic Systems, will succeed Linda as Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. Having served as President of 3 major business units during his 24-year career at BD, Alberto is uniquely positioned for this next step. Since assuming his position of Worldwide President of Diagnostic Systems in 2013, Alberto has focused the business on reinventing the labs through automation and standardization and advancing our position in molecular diagnostics through differentiated assays. We are confident that both of these leaders will make major contributions to our future success as we build a bigger, better, bolder BD.
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby in her current role as Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

Our leadership team is designed to support the company's strategy and increased focus on growth as we develop more impactful solutions for our customers. We're extremely pleased to announce Linda and Alberto's new roles as they help lead the company through our next phase of growth.
Now turning to Slide 4 and the company's results. We're pleased with our third quarter growth profile. Performance from both the Medical and Life Sciences segments contributed to solid organic revenue growth that was in line with our expectations. Our results this quarter continued to highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse portfolio. We continued to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of synergies, operational efficiencies and continuous improvement. We're also increasing our R&D investment in key strategic opportunities and expect to fully utilize the benefit of the medical device tax suspension.
As we've shared with you, we have a robust pipeline and look forward to sharing new opportunities with you in the near future. Looking ahead, I feel good about the business, and our performance year-to-date gives us confidence in our full year outlook.
Moving to Slide 5. I will review our third quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company organic revenues grew 4%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.35 was ahead of our expectations. As I just mentioned, this was driven by strong operating performance, which enables us to invest incremental dollars in R&D. Chris will provide more details on this later in his remarks.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,370563082,1025485,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to solid third quarter results.Total third quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4% on a comparable organic basis. This",2006,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to solid third quarter results.
Total third quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4% on a comparable organic basis. This was in line with the growth expectations we had outlined on last quarter's earnings call. As a reminder, the second fiscal quarter had benefited by about 50 basis points from the timing of revenues, which occurred earlier than originally anticipated. In turn, this negatively impacted the third quarter by about 50 basis points. I'll discuss this further as I take you through the business results.
BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 3%, reflecting strong performance in Medication Management Solutions and Diabetes Care units and solid growth in the Medication and Procedural Solutions unit. As anticipated, performance in the Pharmaceutical Systems and Respiratory Solution units were negatively impacted, in part by customer ordering patterns and the timing of capital placements. These items occurred earlier than originally anticipated, benefiting the second fiscal quarter as communicated on last quarter's earnings call.
Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 2.1%, which reflects strength in infusion therapy and safety-engineered products but was negatively impacted by the divestiture of our spine business and a tough comparison to the prior year. Medication Management Solution revenues grew 6.2%, driven by strong dispensing capital installations with our Pyxis platform. We also saw solid growth in the infusion business.
Growth in Diabetes Care was 6.6%, driven by pen needles and a favorable comparison to the prior year. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 1.5% reflects strong growth in SAIS and safety-engineered products, partially offset by the aforementioned timing of customer orders.
Respiratory Solutions revenues decreased 3.3%, reflecting the aforementioned timing of capital placements. Respiratory Solutions had a negative impact of 60 basis points to the third quarter organic growth. Excluding the Respiratory Solutions business, total company organic growth was 4.6%.
BD Life Sciences third quarter revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by strong growth in the Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems units. Preanalytical Systems growth of 6.6% was driven by international market and safety-engineered products in the U.S.
Diagnostic Systems growth of 9.5% was the result of strong growth in microbiology, led by the timing of BD KIESTRA installations as well as continued strength in blood culture and growth in BD MAX.
Biosciences revenues grew 1.2% in the third quarter. We are seeing additional pressure in Africa related to our clinical HIV business, and we continue to monitor this situation. In the U.S., Biosciences had double-digit growth, driven by sales of research instruments. In addition, we experienced strong sales of research reagents globally. Growth was partially offset by funding delays, primarily in Western Europe and Japan.
Moving to Slide 8. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. revenues increased 3.4%, reflecting strength in both the Medical and Life Sciences segments. BD Medical's performance reflects strength in dispensing capital installations, which includes the benefit of a large customer installation as well as strong performance in infusion systems, which included double-digit growth in our disposables business. SAIS and safety-engineered products also contributed to growth in the quarter.
BD Life Sciences growth in the U.S. reflects continued strength in our research business and biosciences, led by the recently launched FACSSymphony and FACSCelesta instruments and a growing research reagent and Sirigen dye portfolio, including our new OptiBuild platform for customized reagents. 
Diagnostic Systems was driven by strong growth in molecular, including BD MAX, and growth in core blood culture. Preanalytical Systems also had solid performance across all 4 platforms during the quarter.
Moving on to International. Revenues grew 4.6%. This is below our normal growth rate and primarily reflects some unfavorable timing events within the Medical segment. The Medical segment grew 2.6%. This reflects strength in China and sales of safety-engineered products and strong dispensing installations in Medication Management Solutions. This growth was partially offset by the timing events in Pharmaceutical Systems and Respiratory Solutions and softness in the Middle East as we expected.
The Life Sciences segment grew 8.1%. Preanalytical Systems growth was very strong across all regions, primarily due to continued expansion of safety-engineered products. Diagnostic Systems had strong growth in Western Europe, driven by KIESTRA installations in the quarter. Overall strength in core microbiology and cervical cancer-related sales also contributed to growth in Diagnostic Systems. The Biosciences business was negatively impacted by the aforementioned declines in the HIV business and funding delays.
Now turning to Slide 9. Developed markets revenues grew 3.7%, and emerging markets revenues grew 5.2%. Third quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects solid growth in China and Latin America, partially offset by declines in the Middle East and Africa, as communicated on last quarter's earnings call. The Middle East and Africa had a negative impact of approximately 400 basis points. Excluding these regions, emerging markets grew approximately 9% in the quarter.
China growth for the third quarter was 9.5%. Revenue growth across the Medical and Life Sciences segments was driven by continued strong demand for consumables. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. We now anticipate total emerging markets to grow in the mid-single-digit range. We expect that as we exit fiscal year 2016, these headwinds in the Middle East and Africa will largely be behind us. It's important to note that we anticipate emerging markets growth of high single digits as we move forward.
Moving to global safety on Slide 10. Currency-neutral sales increased 8.9%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 5.3%, and international sales grew 13.9% currency neutral, driven by strength in Asia Pacific and Europe. Safety revenues grew 19.6% in emerging markets.
Medical Safety sales grew 9.6%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products, including safety catheters and strength in Pharmaceutical Systems. The benefits from EU safety legislation continue to aid growth in the quarter.
Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 7.6% in the quarter.
Slide 11 recaps the third quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 4% on a comparable organic currency-neutral basis. Pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. Gross profit improved 6.3%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at the underlying performance and the impact of currency.
SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 22.7%. We're very pleased with the leverage we're getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. The suspension of the medical device tax also had a positive impact on SSG&A, though as we’ve previously communicated, we intend to reinvest the savings in R&D, which you are beginning to see on the R&D line.
R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.5%. We continue to invest in new products and innovation and expect to incrementally reinvest approximately $25 million of the medical device tax in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect R&D as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be above our full year guidance range. This brings our total year R&D dollars as a percentage of revenue closer to 6.5%.
Operating income grew 12.8%, reflecting strong P&L leverage. Our tax rate declined 350 basis points to 21.3%, which is in line with our full year expectations of 21% to 22%.
As Vince discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $2.35, which is a 19.5% increase versus the prior year. This reflects our solid growth profile, strong underlying margin expansion and a lower tax rate. I'd also like to highlight that year-to-date, we have driven very strong earnings growth of 33.9%.
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of about 50 basis points on our gross profit margin in the quarter. On a performance basis, strong gross margin expansion of 160 basis points was primarily driven by operational performance and continuous improvement initiatives and, to a lesser extent, from favorable raw material prices. Strong operating margin performance of 210 basis points was primarily driven by gross margin expansion combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies and the positive impact of cost synergies. These contributions were partially offset by increased R&D expenses we incurred following the medical device tax suspension. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 60 basis points on operating margin in the quarter.
Year-to-date, we have driven approximately 280 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion. This strong performance gives us the ability to raise our guidance for the year to a range of 200 to 210 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion.
Moving on to Slide 14. To ensure consistency and clarity, I'd like to provide more color on revenue growth guidance. Last quarter, we noted there was approximately a 50 basis point benefit from the timing of revenues that occurred earlier than we anticipated. We expected that timing to bring down the third quarter growth rate a bit, and we had guided this quarter to be below our revenue growth range for the total year.
The key to understanding our second half revenue growth trajectory is to focus on the absolute dollars we're achieving this year versus last year. We are up against a tough comparison this quarter because in terms of absolute dollars, that was our highest quarter last year. As you model out the total fiscal year, we have been steadily improving sequential revenue dollars every quarter. While our year-to-date performance implies a revenue growth rate of about 7% in the fourth quarter, you will see that in terms of absolute dollars, it's reasonable and achievable, as illustrated on Slide 14.
Moving on to Slide 15. We are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.50 to $8.57. Our strong performance in the third quarter and our full year outlook give us the confidence to raise our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 by 1 percentage point to a range of $9.08 to $9.15 while increasing our investment in R&D. Offsetting this increased performance are incremental currency headwinds of approximately 1 percentage point that have resulted from the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and other currencies since we provided guidance in May. We remain extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments.
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to walk through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. We continue to expect growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical. Due to the aforementioned challenges in Africa in our Biosciences business, we now expect revenues in BD Life Sciences to grow between 3.5% and 4%. This brings total BD to the bottom end of our revenue growth guidance range of 4.5% to 5% for the total year.
On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 21% and 21.5%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 350 basis points, which is an incremental 50 basis point headwind compared to our prior guidance of about 300 basis points of currency headwinds. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be flat to slightly positive for the year.
Our guidance assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.11 for the rest of the year. We see some remaining FX headwinds over the fourth quarter as non-euro currencies are also expected to be unfavorable year-over-year.
Before I turn the call back over to Vince, I'd like to note that in June, we continued to deleverage as we paid down a $750 million debt maturity associated with the CareFusion acquisition. At the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.4x, and we remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3x gross debt leverage within 24 months of close or March of 2017.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

Within our Medical business, we reached over",778,"Thank you, Chris. Moving on to Slide 18. I will walk through our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations.
Starting with new product innovation. Within our Medical business, we reached over 100 hospitals with Alaris infusion pump interoperability. Bidirectional interoperability to a hospital's electronic medical records improves patient safety and care by reducing manual input of data and programming errors while also improving staff efficiency.
Within our Life Science business, we are seeing strong performance from our recently launched research instruments, FACSSymphony and FACSCelesta. In addition, to complement the portfolio, we recently introduced the unique mid-level cell sorter, the FACSMelody, which has received positive customer feedback. The FACSMelody will have a full-scale commercial launch in the fourth quarter.
All of these instruments are complemented by our Sirigen dyes and recently launched OptiBuild customized reagents.
In the area of Women's Health, we have continued to make good progress. We have already submitted our vaginitis and GC/CT assays and are now in the process of submitting our HPV assay to the FDA for approval. This assay is designed to provide physicians access to broader, high-risk HPV genotype information beyond type 16 and 18 to guide and form treatment decisions for their patients. This is an important milestone for the company and is complementary to our current portfolio.
As part of our menu expansion on BD MAX, we have completed an agreement with Check-Points B.V., a Netherlands-based company which is focused on the development of rapid molecular test for the detection of carbapenem-resistant organisms. Check-Points currently has a CE Mark product optimized for the BD MAX that incorporates our open system reagents.
Within strategic and business initiatives, we're pleased with the progress towards the creation of the Respiratory Solutions joint venture and remain on track to close late in fiscal year 2016 or early in fiscal 2017.
As we told you last quarter, we have also continued to make good progress with our CareFusion product registration process. We remain on track with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and continue to expect them to begin to materialize in fiscal year 2017 in our Medication and Procedural Solutions business.
And in the areas of partnerships and collaborations, we recently completed an in-depth launch planning meeting with Medtronic to integrate our commercial plans and operations as we anticipate the launch of our insulin infusion set. We remain on track for broad commercial release in early fiscal year 2017.
As you can see, we are executing on our strategy and continue to have strong opportunities to drive growth and innovation. We look forward to updating you further at our Analyst Day in New York City in November.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 19. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the third quarter. We're making progress expanding and leveraging global shared services and centers of excellence. We also continue to focus on implementing lean and efficient end-to-end processes with our corporate functions.
During the quarter, we also announced plans to close 2 plants as we made progress with our footprint optimization. We continue to expect the majority of manufacturing-related synergies to be achieved in the latter part of our deal horizon.
We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies related to the CareFusion acquisition as we exit fiscal year 2018.
Turning to operating margin expansion. The consistent solid performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion we achieved last year, we expect another 200 to 210 basis points of expansion this fiscal year.
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid third quarter. Both segments performed well, and our results highlight the benefit of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. Second, we are delivering strong operating performance. Also, with respect to our operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture are generating significant operating margin improvement as evidenced by our increased guidance for the total year. Also, we have many exciting opportunities in the pipeline, and we are incrementally investing in R&D to fund those strategic opportunities. Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. We remain very optimistic about BD's prospects for the future and our ability to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders over time.
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

Maybe just stepping back, how much -- actually, I'll start it differently. Becton has consistently, for a long time, every year, done a good job of expanding margins, reducing costs. But this kind of performance we've seen in fiscal '15 and 2016, how do we think about the next 2 years? What are the opportunities that are remaining? And I mean, do you have a lot more to go in terms of consolidating plant manufacturing? Just give us some larger perspective to think about the future."

And so it's a good, continuous improvement, and that's coming from 2 things. Obviously, the synergies are helping us on the operating margins, SSG&A and that type of thing, but we're also seeing very good performance on the gross profit line, and a lot of that is really coming from continuous improvement-type initiatives that we've had in place. So we feel good about that. And the good news is that, that continues going forward, particularly on the synergy piece. So you would expect to see, on top of the normal 40 to 50 basis points that we drive every year, you would expect to see an incremental 40 to 50 basis points just coming from the natural synergies that you get over the life of the deal horizon. On top of that, you would also think about the fact that with the respiratory going away and with that joint venture, you'll get a benefit on margins as well because as we've mentioned, the respiratory margins really were headwinds to the overall margins. So we feel good about the margin profile going out into the future over the next couple of years."

So I really do think that this is a great opportunity for us with the suspension of the medical device tax to, Rick, accelerate our strategy is what this is really about. This is not about going after new areas. This is really about fortifying what we were doing. And so it's spread over both the medication management strategy and over to the life science side of things. So I'll give you one example on the Life Science side. We've been doing very well with KIESTRA. We see enhancements that we can make to KIESTRA. We know that the market is going to like these, and so this is an opportunity to accelerate that work that would have taken us another year or 2 to get to. On the medication management side, what I would tell you is that where we're spending is core to that medication management strategy. We saw there's a great opportunity, and there was an opportunity to get some technology at the same time. So we're a little opportunistic to do this in the fourth quarter, made all the sense in the world. So right down the middle of what we're doing is the way to think about that, Rick. So I'll turn that over to Tom."

And so as we shared before, we're on track with our expectations, begin seeing the initial sign of some of those synergies coming through in FY '17.

And then just maybe for a second one for Chris, just capital deployment priorities. You mentioned deleveraging here into this year and into next year. Just how are you thinking about capital priorities? Maybe it's also a question for Vince in terms of future M&A, share repurchase activity or further deleverage."

Absolutely, as I think through fiscal year '17, I would take you back to our normal model, which is mid-single digits, 5 percentage on the top and 10% on the bottom. Then on top of that, you get a couple hundred basis points coming from the synergies that we've talked about. And then I think you just have to take into consideration, and I'm not sure everybody's model shows this yet, the $0.10 to $0.14 that come from the respiratory dilution. So that gets you to a number that is clearly in the low double digits, as you said. So I have a lot of confidence in that. What I'd also point to, though, is the variables of the headwinds and tailwinds which generally come from FX and pension. And it's too early to call either of those, and we'll certainly give more guidance on that in November as we provide specific guidance. But right now, neither one of those seem too bad. If FX stayed where it is, it'd be pretty neutral. Pension right now with interest rates are probably a slight negative, but that could change between now and September when it gets measured. So bottom line is we are really feeling good about that. Onto your second question in terms of capital allocation, you see that we are making great progress towards our 3x leverage. We're already down to 3.4. So we're well on our way. So thinking about the second half of next year, we will certainly be in a position where we can -- our cash flow is good. We'll be in a position to start redirecting some of that cash away from debt pay-down and back to the more traditional capital allocation methods that we have. I think what you could expect us to do is go back to a similar model that we had pre-CareFusion acquisition, where we look at tuck-in acquisitions. We make sure we're invested in the business clearly first. We have always been increasing our dividend, and we continued to increase the dividend, obviously, as we did the CareFusion transaction. And we've been increasing 10%. But because the bottom line is growing more than 10%, the payout ratios come down. So I think we've got to bring that more in the line and do a little bit of catch-up there. And then obviously, that still leaves a lot of cash left over. We would rather not have that build up on the balance sheet, and so we would likely go back to some share buybacks. Having said that, I intend to go through that in November. We do have some time. I'm actually thinking of getting all of your input between now and March to let us know what you think, and so I'd encourage that. And as you know, we've been already beginning that kind of dialogue. And so the good news is I think we have a lot of cash and some positive things that we can do in terms of allocating that. So that's sort of a way to think about it."

So if you remember, last quarter, I mentioned this, this time we thought we'd actually give you a chart that kind of demonstrates it because I think if you really study that chart, you can see that the growth rate is moving around, but the dollar is a nice sequential increases every quarter. And so that gives us the confidence that we can achieve that in the fourth quarter. To your point on EPS, it's really all about the fact that we let the overperformance in the third quarter -- we let half of that flow through, and then the other half is what we're investing. If you do the math on that investment of R&D, that's about $25 million. That takes you up close to 7.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter. And so that's the other half of the overachievement in the third quarter that we're going to spend. And when you think about that, it's really -- we couldn't really spend it in the second quarter. We just couldn't get the programs in place fast enough. We spent the fair share in the third quarter. That's 6.5% of revenues. So we started to getting some traction on reinvesting in medical device there. And fourth quarter is really a catch-up. So when you look at how much we're spending this year on R&D related to medical device tax, it's the entire amount of the medical device tax that we get in benefit. So think about that more as a catch-up. Now in addition to that, on EPS, we talked about headwinds from FX, and that's certainly the other piece of it. We get a little bit of a headwind from the euro going from $1.13 down to $1.11. But the bigger portion is the other currencies, and those other currencies are -- there's really 3 that are driving that impact. The yuan in China has significantly weakened against the dollar since May, about 3% weakness. The Mexican peso has weakened about 6% versus the dollar. And obviously, the British pound, we all know from Brexit, impacted by about 9% from our May call. And those are the 3 that are driving the preponderance of the headwinds on FX in the fourth quarter. Thanks very much."

Think about all the breakdowns due to the gel in the clinical diagnostic systems, think about that going away and then just driving better workflow efficiency and lower costs. So we've now rolled that product out outside of the U.S. We're seeing a lot of activity in terms of numbers of accounts that are validating this. So the validation cycle will take some time. So really start to see the impact of this in '17. And then we expect our U.S. launch to occur in '16. So really excited about that one. Moving on to microbiology, broadly, of course, saw a lot of share gains over the course of the last year in our BACTEC. But if we think about what we're trying to do in a microbiology lab, it's really about our KIESTRA system and doing 2 things. So first thing we've done with KIESTRA acquisition a few years back is really focus on the full automation. So moving that plate rate from start of streaking that plate rate through the IDAST. KIESTRA links all of those systems completely together. And then over the course of the last year, we worked on our Infostratus program, which will now drive informatics around that platform. And of course, the first thing that we will do on that informatics side is launch our Veritor Plus, which is our flu. It will be the next-generation Veritor for us, which will link into that system, which will launch in Q4 of this year. So hopefully, that gives you a good picture both on the PAS side. We're really excited about the innovation. I talked about the tube side. We also have innovation on the needle side and then what we're doing in the microbiology lab."

And then we go back and look at the Medical piece in 2 ways, of course, what's the opportunity for core growth, and then as Tom was talking about earlier, all the product registrations that we have for China and other marketplaces from the CareFusion acquisition. So that's China, number one. Number two, we're looking at India as a growth driver, and that has -- the last 2 years, that has picked up and been a good growth driver for us. Yes, there's pluses and minuses in India. We're seeing good fundamental demand there with the burgeoning middle class. We're expanding our distribution in India. So we will take that into account. There are some headwinds in India in terms of tariffs that are -- that have been put in place. So we make sure that that's not any significant impact, so I would say we still find it as a very attractive marketplace for us. And Middle East and Africa, of course, we're much more careful about what's going on in Saudi Arabia. We follow what the government funding is. In this case, of course, the funding was not just in health care, but it was a significant change linked to the price of oil that we saw. And so the way we're thinking about that is kind of price of oil staying where it is, which means on the low side, which says that they're going to fund their health care, but it's not a big expansion of health care. That was going on in the first half of the year. That's not happening now. But they have to continue to provide care. That's what we're thinking about there. In Africa, we talked about the CD4 business and some of the shift in the guidelines. We've seen -- we believe we've seen the majority of that impact that's really driven by Pepkor, not the entire marketplace. So it was a segment of that market. So we'll watch how that evolves, as Linda said. Then Latin America, as you know, a mixture for us. Mexico's doing well. Brazil is doing okay is what we would say, and we watch the economy there and what's happening from an inflationary standpoint. And of course, funding -- but the other countries in Latin America contributing quite nicely. So that's how we build it up."

The numbers that we cited are certainly less than half of the products that we intend to have registered outside. We obviously started with those products that we have the data available for, that didn’t need to have additional data generated and were in existing formats that those markets would accept. Take, for example, as we think about pumps, in some cases, we need to do translation and get the language done first, and that's an R&D program to get that ready. Some of the markets require infusion sets to be adapted a bit for local practices. And so what you saw come through first are, obviously, those products that meet the needs of specific geographies. We have the data ready, and we move forward and submit right away. And so most of those also tend to be on the consumable side as I shared earlier, which is why as we think about FY '17, we would expect those synergies to really be focused within our MPS business because that's where those more simple medical devices that are more universal in nature in terms of how they fit in with the health care system. That's where we tend to be focused."

And again, just to put things in perspective, we're really pleased with the performance and outlook. And even though we've gotten as early as in FY '16, of course, as we have said, CareFusion was 3%, 3.5% at best growth business as a stand-alone, all right. We're holding at our 4.5% to 5% growth for the segment overall. And as you know, when you take a 3% grower and a nearly 5% grower, you don't get within the range that we're sharing. And so we're already -- we see some good performance this year already as a result of the 2 companies coming together. We think some incremental improvements on that in FY '17, specifically within the MPS business in that tens of bps, as Chris described. The other thing as you -- also to keep in mind is that some geographies take a lot longer. So China, although it's a market that we are filing registrations in, once you file a registration in China, it's a 3-year process. So you can't get into certain markets that fast. Typically, more of the European, Latin America, Southeast Asia markets are those geographies that you can actually get into within an 18-month window. And so that's where you'll see us enter in first. Those aren't necessarily as large as some of the markets like China, which will be later on in our 3-year kind of outlook horizon."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our third fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings.
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.
As a reminder, we annualized the acquisition of CareFusion in March, and as such, our third quarter results reflect the new BD in both the current and prior year period.
In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of Fisher & Paykel's respiratory care products. The fiscal year 2016 comparable revenue guidance provided today will also exclude the year-over-year impact of this contract termination. The impact to the bottom line is not material and is included in our EPS guidance.
Comparable organic revenues are adjusted to further exclude the impact of nonannualized acquisitions and closed divestitures. Details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliation to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of the Investor Relations slides.
At this time, we would like to announce some leadership changes which will take place on October 1. Jerry Hurwitz, Executive Vice President of HR and Chief Human Resources Officer, has announced his intention to retire from the company. We thank Jerry for his many contributions and his 24 years of service to BD.
We are also very pleased to announce that Linda Tharby will be our next Executive Vice President of HR and Chief Human Resources Officer effective with Jerry's retirement. We are confident that Linda's drive for performance, combined with her strong strategic agility and passion for people development, will make her well suited to lead HR. Linda's appointment helps the company meet a unique business need and enables Linda to gain personal development on the functional leadership side.
We are also pleased to announce that Alberto Mas, currently the Worldwide President of Diagnostic Systems, will succeed Linda as Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment. Having served as President of 3 major business units during his 24-year career at BD, Alberto is uniquely positioned for this next step. Since assuming his position of Worldwide President of Diagnostic Systems in 2013, Alberto has focused the business on reinventing the labs through automation and standardization and advancing our position in molecular diagnostics through differentiated assays. We are confident that both of these leaders will make major contributions to our future success as we build a bigger, better, bolder BD.
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Linda Tharby in her current role as Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

Over the past several years, we have continued to strengthen our leadership team through a diversity of experiences and perspectives to form a global team that helps ensure our future success and the continued development of our senior leaders. Our leadership team is designed to support the company's strategy and increased focus on growth as we develop more impactful solutions for our customers. We're extremely pleased to announce Linda and Alberto's new roles as they help lead the company through our next phase of growth.
Now turning to Slide 4 and the company's results. We're pleased with our third quarter growth profile. Performance from both the Medical and Life Sciences segments contributed to solid organic revenue growth that was in line with our expectations. Our results this quarter continued to highlight our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse portfolio. We continued to drive strong underlying margin expansion through the achievement of synergies, operational efficiencies and continuous improvement. We're also increasing our R&D investment in key strategic opportunities and expect to fully utilize the benefit of the medical device tax suspension.
As we've shared with you, we have a robust pipeline and look forward to sharing new opportunities with you in the near future. Looking ahead, I feel good about the business, and our performance year-to-date gives us confidence in our full year outlook.
Moving to Slide 5. I will review our third quarter revenue and EPS results, which I will speak to on a currency-neutral basis. Total company organic revenues grew 4%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.35 was ahead of our expectations. As I just mentioned, this was driven by strong operating performance, which enables us to invest incremental dollars in R&D. Chris will provide more details on this later in his remarks.
Now I'd like to turn things over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter financial performance and our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance."
103678,370563082,1026314,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to solid third quarter results.Total third quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4% on a comparable organic basis. This",2006,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. As Vince just mentioned, the breadth and geographic diversity of our portfolio contributed to solid third quarter results.
Total third quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4% on a comparable organic basis. This was in line with the growth expectations we had outlined on last quarter's earnings call. As a reminder, the second fiscal quarter had benefited by about 50 basis points from the timing of revenues, which occurred earlier than originally anticipated. In turn, this negatively impacted the third quarter by about 50 basis points. I'll discuss this further as I take you through the business results.
BD Medical third quarter revenues increased 3%, reflecting strong performance in Medication Management Solutions and Diabetes Care units and solid growth in the Medication and Procedural Solutions unit. As anticipated, performance in the Pharmaceutical Systems and Respiratory Solution units were negatively impacted, in part by customer ordering patterns and the timing of capital placements. These items occurred earlier than originally anticipated, benefiting the second fiscal quarter as communicated on last quarter's earnings call.
Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 2.1%, which reflects strength in infusion therapy and safety-engineered products but was negatively impacted by the divestiture of our spine business and a tough comparison to the prior year. Medication Management Solution revenues grew 6.2%, driven by strong dispensing capital installations with our Pyxis platform. We also saw solid growth in the infusion business.
Growth in Diabetes Care was 6.6%, driven by pen needles and a favorable comparison to the prior year. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 1.5% reflects strong growth in SAIS and safety-engineered products, partially offset by the aforementioned timing of customer orders.
Respiratory Solutions revenues decreased 3.3%, reflecting the aforementioned timing of capital placements. Respiratory Solutions had a negative impact of 60 basis points to the third quarter organic growth. Excluding the Respiratory Solutions business, total company organic growth was 4.6%.
BD Life Sciences third quarter revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by strong growth in the Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems units. Preanalytical Systems growth of 6.6% was driven by international market and safety-engineered products in the U.S.
Diagnostic Systems growth of 9.5% was the result of strong growth in microbiology, led by the timing of BD KIESTRA installations as well as continued strength in blood culture and growth in BD MAX.
Biosciences revenues grew 1.2% in the third quarter. We are seeing additional pressure in Africa related to our clinical HIV business, and we continue to monitor this situation. In the U.S., Biosciences had double-digit growth, driven by sales of research instruments. In addition, we experienced strong sales of research reagents globally. Growth was partially offset by funding delays, primarily in Western Europe and Japan.
Moving to Slide 8. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the third quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. revenues increased 3.4%, reflecting strength in both the Medical and Life Sciences segments. BD Medical's performance reflects strength in dispensing capital installations, which includes the benefit of a large customer installation as well as strong performance in infusion systems, which included double-digit growth in our disposables business. SAIS and safety-engineered products also contributed to growth in the quarter.
BD Life Sciences growth in the U.S. reflects continued strength in our research business and biosciences, led by the recently launched FACSSymphony and FACSCelesta instruments and a growing research reagent and Sirigen dye portfolio, including our new OptiBuild platform for customized reagents. 
Diagnostic Systems was driven by strong growth in molecular, including BD MAX, and growth in core blood culture. Preanalytical Systems also had solid performance across all 4 platforms during the quarter.
Moving on to International. Revenues grew 4.6%. This is below our normal growth rate and primarily reflects some unfavorable timing events within the Medical segment. The Medical segment grew 2.6%. This reflects strength in China and sales of safety-engineered products and strong dispensing installations in Medication Management Solutions. This growth was partially offset by the timing events in Pharmaceutical Systems and Respiratory Solutions and softness in the Middle East as we expected.
The Life Sciences segment grew 8.1%. Preanalytical Systems growth was very strong across all regions, primarily due to continued expansion of safety-engineered products. Diagnostic Systems had strong growth in Western Europe, driven by KIESTRA installations in the quarter. Overall strength in core microbiology and cervical cancer-related sales also contributed to growth in Diagnostic Systems. The Biosciences business was negatively impacted by the aforementioned declines in the HIV business and funding delays.
Now turning to Slide 9. Developed markets revenues grew 3.7%, and emerging markets revenues grew 5.2%. Third quarter growth rate in emerging markets reflects solid growth in China and Latin America, partially offset by declines in the Middle East and Africa, as communicated on last quarter's earnings call. The Middle East and Africa had a negative impact of approximately 400 basis points. Excluding these regions, emerging markets grew approximately 9% in the quarter.
China growth for the third quarter was 9.5%. Revenue growth across the Medical and Life Sciences segments was driven by continued strong demand for consumables. For the total year, we continue to expect China to grow in the low double-digit range. We now anticipate total emerging markets to grow in the mid-single-digit range. We expect that as we exit fiscal year 2016, these headwinds in the Middle East and Africa will largely be behind us. It's important to note that we anticipate emerging markets growth of high single digits as we move forward.
Moving to global safety on Slide 10. Currency-neutral sales increased 8.9%. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 5.3%, and international sales grew 13.9% currency neutral, driven by strength in Asia Pacific and Europe. Safety revenues grew 19.6% in emerging markets.
Medical Safety sales grew 9.6%, driven by a range of safety-engineered products, including safety catheters and strength in Pharmaceutical Systems. The benefits from EU safety legislation continue to aid growth in the quarter.
Life Sciences safety sales, which are driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 7.6% in the quarter.
Slide 11 recaps the third quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. As I mentioned a few moments ago, revenues grew 4% on a comparable organic currency-neutral basis. Pricing was slightly positive in the quarter. Gross profit improved 6.3%. I'll provide more color on gross profit on the next slide when we look at the underlying performance and the impact of currency.
SSG&A as a percentage of revenues was 22.7%. We're very pleased with the leverage we're getting, which includes the benefit of cost synergy capture. The suspension of the medical device tax also had a positive impact on SSG&A, though as we’ve previously communicated, we intend to reinvest the savings in R&D, which you are beginning to see on the R&D line.
R&D as a percentage of revenues was 6.5%. We continue to invest in new products and innovation and expect to incrementally reinvest approximately $25 million of the medical device tax in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect R&D as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be above our full year guidance range. This brings our total year R&D dollars as a percentage of revenue closer to 6.5%.
Operating income grew 12.8%, reflecting strong P&L leverage. Our tax rate declined 350 basis points to 21.3%, which is in line with our full year expectations of 21% to 22%.
As Vince discussed earlier, adjusted earnings per share were $2.35, which is a 19.5% increase versus the prior year. This reflects our solid growth profile, strong underlying margin expansion and a lower tax rate. I'd also like to highlight that year-to-date, we have driven very strong earnings growth of 33.9%.
Slide 12 illustrates our gross profit and operating margin for the third quarter. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of about 50 basis points on our gross profit margin in the quarter. On a performance basis, strong gross margin expansion of 160 basis points was primarily driven by operational performance and continuous improvement initiatives and, to a lesser extent, from favorable raw material prices. Strong operating margin performance of 210 basis points was primarily driven by gross margin expansion combined with the achievement of operational efficiencies and the positive impact of cost synergies. These contributions were partially offset by increased R&D expenses we incurred following the medical device tax suspension. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 60 basis points on operating margin in the quarter.
Year-to-date, we have driven approximately 280 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion. This strong performance gives us the ability to raise our guidance for the year to a range of 200 to 210 basis points of underlying operating margin expansion.
Moving on to Slide 14. To ensure consistency and clarity, I'd like to provide more color on revenue growth guidance. Last quarter, we noted there was approximately a 50 basis point benefit from the timing of revenues that occurred earlier than we anticipated. We expected that timing to bring down the third quarter growth rate a bit, and we had guided this quarter to be below our revenue growth range for the total year.
The key to understanding our second half revenue growth trajectory is to focus on the absolute dollars we're achieving this year versus last year. We are up against a tough comparison this quarter because in terms of absolute dollars, that was our highest quarter last year. As you model out the total fiscal year, we have been steadily improving sequential revenue dollars every quarter. While our year-to-date performance implies a revenue growth rate of about 7% in the fourth quarter, you will see that in terms of absolute dollars, it's reasonable and achievable, as illustrated on Slide 14.
Moving on to Slide 15. We are maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.50 to $8.57. Our strong performance in the third quarter and our full year outlook give us the confidence to raise our currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 by 1 percentage point to a range of $9.08 to $9.15 while increasing our investment in R&D. Offsetting this increased performance are incremental currency headwinds of approximately 1 percentage point that have resulted from the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and other currencies since we provided guidance in May. We remain extremely pleased with our performance and our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments.
Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to walk through additional elements of our guidance for the full fiscal year 2016. We continue to expect growth of 4.5% to 5% in BD Medical. Due to the aforementioned challenges in Africa in our Biosciences business, we now expect revenues in BD Life Sciences to grow between 3.5% and 4%. This brings total BD to the bottom end of our revenue growth guidance range of 4.5% to 5% for the total year.
On a reported basis, revenue growth for the total year is expected to be between 21% and 21.5%, which reflects a currency headwind of about 350 basis points, which is an incremental 50 basis point headwind compared to our prior guidance of about 300 basis points of currency headwinds. Based on our current view of the environment, we continue to expect pricing to be flat to slightly positive for the year.
Our guidance assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.11 for the rest of the year. We see some remaining FX headwinds over the fourth quarter as non-euro currencies are also expected to be unfavorable year-over-year.
Before I turn the call back over to Vince, I'd like to note that in June, we continued to deleverage as we paid down a $750 million debt maturity associated with the CareFusion acquisition. At the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.4x, and we remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3x gross debt leverage within 24 months of close or March of 2017.
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who will provide you with an update on our key initiatives and product portfolio."

I will walk through our updates on new product innovation, strategic and business initiatives and partnerships and collaborations.
Starting with new product innovation. Within our Medical business, we reached over 100 hospitals with Alaris infusion pump interoperability. Bidirectional interoperability to a hospital's electronic medical records improves patient safety and care by reducing manual input of data and programming errors while also improving staff efficiency.
Within our Life Science business, we are seeing strong performance from our recently launched research instruments, FACSSymphony and FACSCelesta. In addition, to complement the portfolio, we recently introduced the unique mid-level cell sorter, the FACSMelody, which has received positive customer feedback. The FACSMelody will have a full-scale commercial launch in the fourth quarter.
All of these instruments are complemented by our Sirigen dyes and recently launched OptiBuild customized reagents.
In the area of Women's Health, we have continued to make good progress. We have already submitted our vaginitis and GC/CT assays and are now in the process of submitting our HPV assay to the FDA for approval. This assay is designed to provide physicians access to broader, high-risk HPV genotype information beyond type 16 and 18 to guide and form treatment decisions for their patients. This is an important milestone for the company and is complementary to our current portfolio.
As part of our menu expansion on BD MAX, we have completed an agreement with Check-Points B.V., a Netherlands-based company which is focused on the development of rapid molecular test for the detection of carbapenem-resistant organisms. Check-Points currently has a CE Mark product optimized for the BD MAX that incorporates our open system reagents.
Within strategic and business initiatives, we're pleased with the progress towards the creation of the Respiratory Solutions joint venture and remain on track to close late in fiscal year 2016 or early in fiscal 2017.
As we told you last quarter, we have also continued to make good progress with our CareFusion product registration process. We remain on track with our plans to achieve revenue synergies and continue to expect them to begin to materialize in fiscal year 2017 in our Medication and Procedural Solutions business.
And in the areas of partnerships and collaborations, we recently completed an in-depth launch planning meeting with Medtronic to integrate our commercial plans and operations as we anticipate the launch of our insulin infusion set. We remain on track for broad commercial release in early fiscal year 2017.
As you can see, we are executing on our strategy and continue to have strong opportunities to drive growth and innovation. We look forward to updating you further at our Analyst Day in New York City in November.
Moving on to our business update on Slide 19. We continue to make progress with our cost synergy capture. Our G&A functional transformation continued in the third quarter. We're making progress expanding and leveraging global shared services and centers of excellence. We also continue to focus on implementing lean and efficient end-to-end processes with our corporate functions.
During the quarter, we also announced plans to close 2 plants as we made progress with our footprint optimization. We continue to expect the majority of manufacturing-related synergies to be achieved in the latter part of our deal horizon.
We remain on track to achieve our FY '16 cost synergies and continue to expect $325 million to $350 million in total cost synergies related to the CareFusion acquisition as we exit fiscal year 2018.
Turning to operating margin expansion. The consistent solid performance of our businesses, combined with operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture, is driving continued underlying operating margin expansion. In addition to the 100 basis points of operating margin expansion we achieved last year, we expect another 200 to 210 basis points of expansion this fiscal year.
Now I'd like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, this was a solid third quarter. Both segments performed well, and our results highlight the benefit of our diverse portfolio, both from a product and geographic standpoint. Second, we are delivering strong operating performance. Also, with respect to our operating efficiencies, cost leverage and cost synergy capture are generating significant operating margin improvement as evidenced by our increased guidance for the total year. Also, we have many exciting opportunities in the pipeline, and we are incrementally investing in R&D to fund those strategic opportunities. Finally, we are confident in our outlook for the full fiscal year. We remain very optimistic about BD's prospects for the future and our ability to continue to deliver strong returns to shareholders over time.
Thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

Maybe just stepping back, how much -- actually, I'll start it differently. Becton has consistently, for a long time, every year, done a good job of expanding margins, reducing costs. But this kind of performance we've seen in fiscal '15 and 2016, how do we think about the next 2 years? What are the opportunities that are remaining? And I mean, do you have a lot more to go in terms of consolidating plant manufacturing? Just give us some larger perspective to think about the future."

And so it's a good, continuous improvement, and that's coming from 2 things. Obviously, the synergies are helping us on the operating margins, SSG&A and that type of thing, but we're also seeing very good performance on the gross profit line, and a lot of that is really coming from continuous improvement-type initiatives that we've had in place. So we feel good about that. And the good news is that, that continues going forward, particularly on the synergy piece. So you would expect to see, on top of the normal 40 to 50 basis points that we drive every year, you would expect to see an incremental 40 to 50 basis points just coming from the natural synergies that you get over the life of the deal horizon. On top of that, you would also think about the fact that with the respiratory going away and with that joint venture, you'll get a benefit on margins as well because as we've mentioned, the respiratory margins really were headwinds to the overall margins. So we feel good about the margin profile going out into the future over the next couple of years."

So I really do think that this is a great opportunity for us with the suspension of the medical device tax to, Rick, accelerate our strategy is what this is really about. This is not about going after new areas. This is really about fortifying what we were doing. And so it's spread over both the medication management strategy and over to the life science side of things. So I'll give you one example on the Life Science side. We've been doing very well with KIESTRA. We see enhancements that we can make to KIESTRA. We know that the market is going to like these, and so this is an opportunity to accelerate that work that would have taken us another year or 2 to get to. On the medication management side, what I would tell you is that where we're spending is core to that medication management strategy. We saw there's a great opportunity, and there was an opportunity to get some technology at the same time. So we're a little opportunistic to do this in the fourth quarter, made all the sense in the world. So right down the middle of what we're doing is the way to think about that, Rick.

Absolutely, as I think through fiscal year '17, I would take you back to our normal model, which is mid-single digits, 5 percentage on the top and 10% on the bottom. Then on top of that, you get a couple hundred basis points coming from the synergies that we've talked about. And then I think you just have to take into consideration, and I'm not sure everybody's model shows this yet, the $0.10 to $0.14 that come from the respiratory dilution. So that gets you to a number that is clearly in the low double digits, as you said. So I have a lot of confidence in that. What I'd also point to, though, is the variables of the headwinds and tailwinds which generally come from FX and pension. And it's too early to call either of those, and we'll certainly give more guidance on that in November as we provide specific guidance. But right now, neither one of those seem too bad. If FX stayed where it is, it'd be pretty neutral. Pension right now with interest rates are probably a slight negative, but that could change between now and September when it gets measured. So bottom line is we are really feeling good about that. Onto your second question in terms of capital allocation, you see that we are making great progress towards our 3x leverage. We're already down to 3.4. So we're well on our way. So thinking about the second half of next year, we will certainly be in a position where we can -- our cash flow is good. We'll be in a position to start redirecting some of that cash away from debt pay-down and back to the more traditional capital allocation methods that we have. I think what you could expect us to do is go back to a similar model that we had pre-CareFusion acquisition, where we look at tuck-in acquisitions. We make sure we're invested in the business clearly first. We have always been increasing our dividend, and we continued to increase the dividend, obviously, as we did the CareFusion transaction. And we've been increasing 10%. But because the bottom line is growing more than 10%, the payout ratios come down. So I think we've got to bring that more in the line and do a little bit of catch-up there. And then obviously, that still leaves a lot of cash left over. We would rather not have that build up on the balance sheet, and so we would likely go back to some share buybacks. Having said that, I intend to go through that in November. We do have some time. I'm actually thinking of getting all of your input between now and March to let us know what you think, and so I'd encourage that. And as you know, we've been already beginning that kind of dialogue. And so the good news is I think we have a lot of cash and some positive things that we can do in terms of allocating that. So that's sort of a way to think about it."

So you're pointing to Slide 14, and I think we gave that to give you a sense that the revenue growth in the quarter just increases a little bit in the fourth quarter, but the growth rate is significantly different. And that's all about last year. So if you remember, last quarter, I mentioned this, this time we thought we'd actually give you a chart that kind of demonstrates it because I think if you really study that chart, you can see that the growth rate is moving around, but the dollar is a nice sequential increases every quarter. And so that gives us the confidence that we can achieve that in the fourth quarter. To your point on EPS, it's really all about the fact that we let the overperformance in the third quarter -- we let half of that flow through, and then the other half is what we're investing. If you do the math on that investment of R&D, that's about $25 million. That takes you up close to 7.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter. And so that's the other half of the overachievement in the third quarter that we're going to spend. And when you think about that, it's really -- we couldn't really spend it in the second quarter. We just couldn't get the programs in place fast enough. We spent the fair share in the third quarter. That's 6.5% of revenues. So we started to getting some traction on reinvesting in medical device there. And fourth quarter is really a catch-up. So when you look at how much we're spending this year on R&D related to medical device tax, it's the entire amount of the medical device tax that we get in benefit. So think about that more as a catch-up. Now in addition to that, on EPS, we talked about headwinds from FX, and that's certainly the other piece of it. We get a little bit of a headwind from the euro going from $1.13 down to $1.11. But the bigger portion is the other currencies, and those other currencies are -- there's really 3 that are driving that impact. The yuan in China has significantly weakened against the dollar since May, about 3% weakness. The Mexican peso has weakened about 6% versus the dollar. And obviously, the British pound, we all know from Brexit, impacted by about 9% from our May call. And those are the 3 that are driving the preponderance of the headwinds on FX in the fourth quarter. Thanks very much."

And so we do see safety continuing to also perform well in Europe. Compliance with the regulation is continuing and is the major driver of that safety growth. We've shared in the past that we really see stronger conversion in the infusion therapy and still more often in infusion therapy as well as blood collection with less conversion in injection.

So if you think about blood collection, we created the blood collection tube with our gel about 25-plus years ago. So this is the next generation, uses no gel. It's a mechanical separator. So we're really looking forward -- if you think about what this drives for the lab is really drives a much higher-quality, cleaner sample. Think about all the breakdowns due to the gel in the clinical diagnostic systems, think about that going away and then just driving better workflow efficiency and lower costs. So we've now rolled that product out outside of the U.S. We're seeing a lot of activity in terms of numbers of accounts that are validating this. So the validation cycle will take some time. So really start to see the impact of this in '17. And then we expect our U.S. launch to occur in '16. So really excited about that one. Moving on to microbiology, broadly, of course, saw a lot of share gains over the course of the last year in our BACTEC. But if we think about what we're trying to do in a microbiology lab, it's really about our KIESTRA system and doing 2 things. So first thing we've done with KIESTRA acquisition a few years back is really focus on the full automation. So moving that plate rate from start of streaking that plate rate through the IDAST. KIESTRA links all of those systems completely together. And then over the course of the last year, we worked on our Infostratus program, which will now drive informatics around that platform. And of course, the first thing that we will do on that informatics side is launch our Veritor Plus, which is our flu. It will be the next-generation Veritor for us, which will link into that system, which will launch in Q4 of this year. So hopefully, that gives you a good picture both on the PAS side. We're really excited about the innovation. I talked about the tube side. We also have innovation on the needle side and then what we're doing in the microbiology lab."

You were mentioning microbiology in your question, and we said that is one of the areas in terms of the automation that we felt, with the opportunity that we're seeing for that platform globally, that we could extend that platform. We had finished the technology feasibility. So we felt really good about it. And so Linda took the opportunity to do that. Then on the other side, Tom had a series of opportunities in the medication management area, where he could accelerate his programs around medication management, including the informatics piece of that strategy.

We break that down then to look at business by business, what's happening on kind of the capital side of things as they're purchasing. That's more of an impact, obviously, on the Life Science side than on the Medical side. And then we go back and look at the Medical piece in 2 ways, of course, what's the opportunity for core growth, and then as Tom was talking about earlier, all the product registrations that we have for China and other marketplaces from the CareFusion acquisition. So that's China, number one. Number two, we're looking at India as a growth driver, and that has -- the last 2 years, that has picked up and been a good growth driver for us. Yes, there's pluses and minuses in India. We're seeing good fundamental demand there with the burgeoning middle class. We're expanding our distribution in India. So we will take that into account. There are some headwinds in India in terms of tariffs that are -- that have been put in place. So we make sure that that's not any significant impact, so I would say we still find it as a very attractive marketplace for us. And Middle East and Africa, of course, we're much more careful about what's going on in Saudi Arabia. We follow what the government funding is. In this case, of course, the funding was not just in health care, but it was a significant change linked to the price of oil that we saw. And so the way we're thinking about that is kind of price of oil staying where it is, which means on the low side, which says that they're going to fund their health care, but it's not a big expansion of health care. That was going on in the first half of the year. That's not happening now. But they have to continue to provide care. That's what we're thinking about there. In Africa, we talked about the CD4 business and some of the shift in the guidelines. We've seen -- we believe we've seen the majority of that impact that's really driven by Pepkor, not the entire marketplace. So it was a segment of that market. So we'll watch how that evolves, as Linda said. Then Latin America, as you know, a mixture for us. Mexico's doing well. Brazil is doing okay is what we would say, and we watch the economy there and what's happening from an inflationary standpoint. And of course, funding -- but the other countries in Latin America contributing quite nicely. So that's how we build it up."

The numbers that we cited are certainly less than half of the products that we intend to have registered outside. We obviously started with those products that we have the data available for, that didn’t need to have additional data generated and were in existing formats that those markets would accept. Take, for example, as we think about pumps, in some cases, we need to do translation and get the language done first, and that's an R&D program to get that ready. Some of the markets require infusion sets to be adapted a bit for local practices. And so what you saw come through first are, obviously, those products that meet the needs of specific geographies. We have the data ready, and we move forward and submit right away. And so most of those also tend to be on the consumable side as I shared earlier, which is why as we think about FY '17, we would expect those synergies to really be focused within our MPS business because that's where those more simple medical devices that are more universal in nature in terms of how they fit in with the health care system. That's where we tend to be focused."

And again, just to put things in perspective, we're really pleased with the performance and outlook. And even though we've gotten as early as in FY '16, of course, as we have said, CareFusion was 3%, 3.5% at best growth business as a stand-alone, all right. We're holding at our 4.5% to 5% growth for the segment overall. And as you know, when you take a 3% grower and a nearly 5% grower, you don't get within the range that we're sharing. And so we're already -- we see some good performance this year already as a result of the 2 companies coming together. We think some incremental improvements on that in FY '17, specifically within the MPS business in that tens of bps, as Chris described. The other thing as you -- also to keep in mind is that some geographies take a lot longer. So China, although it's a market that we are filing registrations in, once you file a registration in China, it's a 3-year process. So you can't get into certain markets that fast. Typically, more of the European, Latin America, Southeast Asia markets are those geographies that you can actually get into within an 18-month window. And so that's where you'll see us enter in first. Those aren't necessarily as large as some of the markets like China, which will be later on in our 3-year kind of outlook horizon."

The presentation",387,"Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter fiscal results.
As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.
As a reminder, we annualized the acquisition of CareFusion in March, and as such, our fourth quarter results reflect the new BD in both the current and prior year periods. In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude the sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of F&P's respiratory care products. The impact to the bottom line is not material. Comparable organic revenues are adjusted to further exclude the impact of non-annualized acquisition and closed divestitures. The fiscal 2017 comparable revenue guidance provided today will exclude revenues of closed divestitures, most notably the Respiratory Solutions business that was divested in October of 2016 just after our fiscal year-end. 
In the fourth quarter, the company recorded a noncash impairment charge for capitalized internal use IT software assets. This charge, along with the details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in and reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules in our press release or the appendix of Investor Relations slides.
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical segment; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

In the words of Brian Weinstein, go Cubs. 
Moving on to my presentation. As we stated in our press release, we are extremely proud of our accomplishments in our first full fiscal year as the new BD. As you already know, the acquisition of CareFusion 18 months ago significantly accelerated our strategy, and the powerful combination of BD and CareFusion continues to deliver positive results. We've seen significant benefits as a result of this transaction from a customer, employee and shareholder standpoint, and we think there's more to come. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal year 2016.
First, our results reflect our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio. Legacy BD remains solid, and the CareFusion portfolio has performed in line with our expectations. 
Second, emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver for the company. We experienced some headwinds this year, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, but remain confident that emerging markets are well-positioned for continued growth. We also continue to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products in these markets and expand their global reach by leveraging BD's international infrastructure. 
We're on track with our new product approval and submission plans and look forward to providing more color at our analyst meeting later this month. Developed markets continued to show stabilization, and growth has accelerated over the past year. 
Third, we made key strategic decisions to optimize our portfolio. This included the divestitures of BD Rx and the spine business in conjunction with the joint venture for the respiratory business, which we just completed in October. These actions further enabled the organization to prioritize and invest in the most important opportunities for future growth. We were deliberate in increasing our R&D investment in targeted high-growth areas and fully utilized the benefit of the medical device tax suspension.
Fourth, we remain focused on our operating effectiveness and efficiency initiatives, which have generated significant margin expansion. This year, we drove approximately 200 basis points of underlying margin expansion, which includes approximately $120 million in cost synergies. We also delivered robust earnings growth of almost 30%, which is greater than our initial expectations.
Lastly, we closed our first full year as the new BD, having achieved all important milestones and also demonstrated that we are successfully executing on our acquisition of CareFusion. As we look forward, we continue to build on our solid foundation and look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence. 
Moving to Slide 5. You will see the guidance for fiscal year 2017 on a currency-neutral basis. For the fiscal year 2017, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% based on our current view of the environment and various macroeconomic factors. There are a number of items that could bring us to the top or bottom end of that range, including a stronger or weaker flu season than expected, the performance of new product launches, emerging market growth and pricing. On the bottom line, we will continue to deliver high-quality earnings growth. For fiscal year 2017, we expect EPS of $9.45 to $9.55 or $9.62 to $9.72 currency neutral, which reflects growth of 12% to 13%.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris, who will walk you through our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year, along with the additional details about our fiscal year 2017 guidance."
103678,403765314,1071912,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7. I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of approx",2260,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7. I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of approximately $3.2 billion grew 6.4% on a comparable basis. Fully diluted adjusted EPS came in ahead of our expectations at $2.12, growing at 16.5% over the prior year. 
As Vince mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our solid finish to the year, the first full year as a combined entity with CareFusion. For the total year, revenues grew 4.3%. We significantly expanded our margins and captured approximately $120 million in synergy cost savings. Adjusted EPS of $8.59 exceeded our expectations, driven by solid revenues, margin expansion and an improved tax rate. In addition to the cost synergies, tax synergies have materialized sooner and have exceeded the benefits we anticipated in the early days of the transaction. We are also pleased to announce that we have continued to delever as we reduced the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion. We are currently at 3.3x gross leverage and remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3x gross leverage by March of 2017.
On Slide 8, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenue growth was 6.4% for the total company in the quarter, pricing was about flat. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 7.9%. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 6.6%, which reflects strength in flush, ChloraPrep and safety-engineered products. Revenues in Medication Management Solutions or MMS grew 12.8%. This was driven by double-digit growth in both dispensing and infusion sales.  
Respiratory Solution revenues increased 12.7%, as expected. This reflects strong capital installations and a favorable comparison to the prior year period.
Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%. This reflects solid growth in pen needles, which was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 5.1% reflects strength in our self-injection platform. For the total year, BD Medical grew 4.7%. 
BD Life Sciences fourth quarter revenues increased 2.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Diagnostic System revenues were about flat compared to the prior year. This reflects continued strength in core microbiology and BD MAX, which grew double digits in the quarter. This growth was offset by the timing of KIESTRA installations outside of the U.S., which I'll speak to in just a moment. For the total year, we are extremely pleased with our microbiology business, with KIESTRA growing at about 19%.
Preanalytical Systems growth of 4% was driven by safety-engineered products and growth in the U.S. and emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 4% was driven by continued strong research instrument placements in the U.S. and reagent sales. For the total year, Life Sciences grew 3.4%. The headwinds we experienced in Africa negatively impacted segment results by 60 basis points, bringing underlying growth to 4% for the total year.  
Moving to Slide 9. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth was very strong at 7.2%. This was comprised of BD Medical growing at 7.7% and BD Life Sciences growing at 5.8%. BD Medical's performance reflects strong growth in capital placements and a wide range of infusion disposable products in our Medication and Procedural Solutions business. Growth was also driven by our Pharmaceutical Systems business. 
BD Life Sciences growth reflects strong performance across the segment in the U.S. The growth in our Biosciences business was driven by high-parameter research instruments, including FACSSymphony, our FACSCelesta mid-level analyzer and the launch of the FACSMelody. Our U.S. Diagnostics business saw continued growth in microbiology, including KIESTRA and the BD MAX molecular platform. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 5%, driven by safety-engineered products.
Moving on to international. Revenues grew 5.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which is primarily related to the Life Sciences segment. The Medical segment grew 8.2%. This was driven by strong performance from infusion disposal products in the MPS business and strong performance in China. Growth was also driven by medication management, reflecting double-digit growth in both dispensing and infusion.
Growth in the Life Science segment was about flat compared to the prior year. We experienced a decline in Diagnostic Systems due to the timing of KIESTRA installations. Increased installations in the third fiscal quarter negatively impacted the fourth fiscal quarter in conjunction with the tough comparison to the prior year fourth quarter. Biosciences growth was lower in the quarter due to continued declines in Africa, as we anticipated. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 2.9%, driven by strength in China, which was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year period.
On Slide 10, developed markets grew a healthy 5.8%, bringing the total year growth to 4.1%. Emerging market revenues grew 8.5% currency neutral, bringing our year-to-date growth rate to 5.3%. China growth for the fourth quarter was 17.7%, bringing the total year growth rate to 10.1%. Growth in emerging markets this fiscal year was lower than initially expected in the Middle East and Africa, and we believe those challenges are largely behind us after we exit the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Emerging markets remain an important growth driver, and given our robust international footprint, we are well positioned to drive growth well into the future.
Looking into fiscal year 2017. We expect emerging markets to grow high single digits, driven by a diversified base, with China growing low double digits, continued strength in Latin America and fewer headwinds in EMA and Africa. In terms of developed markets, we believe the stability we have seen in the market over the past 12 to 18 months will continue, yielding a growth rate of about 4%.
Moving to global safety on Slide 11. Currency-neutral sales increased 5.9% and grew to $783 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 5.7%. This reflects continued strength of safety catheters as well as a benefit from the timing of orders across our hypodermic products.
International sales grew 6.2% currency neutral. International performance in the Medical segment was driven by the continued strength in China, and safety revenues grew 13.8% in emerging markets.
Medical safety sales grew 7%, driven by infusion disposables, catheters and a range of safety-engineered products. Life Sciences safety sales, which were driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4% in the quarter.
Slide 12 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. Revenues grew a strong 6.4% in the quarter. Gross profit was strong, growing faster than revenues, at 7.9%. And I'll provide more details on gross profit in just a moment. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.4%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which is masked in this quarter by key strategic investments in product launches in both segments. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 7.8%, which is higher than normal due to the timing of spend as anticipated. As a result of the medical device tax suspension, we were able to make additional investments in a number of high-growth areas. After normalizing for this significant additional investment in R&D, underlying operating income would have grown about 10% in the quarter.
Our tax rate declined to 16.2% in the quarter due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, tax synergies materializing earlier than expected and continued favorable geographic mix. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.12, which is a 16.5% increase versus the prior year.
Turning to Slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 90 basis points, driven by continuous improvement initiatives. This was more than offset by significant currency headwinds of 110 basis points. On an operating margin basis, we are extremely pleased to have delivered about 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion. As I mentioned on the previous slide, the leverage we are getting in SSG&A as we continue to drive cost synergies is being masked in the quarter by investments in key product launches. In addition, margin expansion was partially offset by significant R&D investments, as expected, and unfavorable currency. 
I'd like to take a moment on Slide 14 to highlight some of our key operational achievements for fiscal year 2016. The acquisition of CareFusion provided BD a unique opportunity to leverage the transaction to optimize the combined organization through functional transformations, and we have made significant progress in this area. All of our efforts have yielded results, and we are on track to deliver continued synergies. In aggregate, we have achieved over $170 million in total cost synergies to date. 
We have also driven significant margin expansion on a multiyear trajectory. Starting with fiscal year 2015, we delivered 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. This year, we achieved another 200 basis points, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver another 175 to 225 basis points in fiscal year 2017. Over those 3 years, we will have driven over 500 basis points of cumulative margin expansion, and I believe that we continue to drive robust performance with additional synergies in conjunction with continuous improvement going forward. We're extremely proud of the organization's ability to continue improving on our skills and expertise by executing against our synergy commitment initiatives through these transformations.
Moving on to Slide 15. I'd like to highlight our robust EPS growth, which exceeded our expectations this year. Starting with 2015 EPS of $7.16, we had communicated last November that we would grow EPS 22% to 23% on a currency-neutral basis. Beyond our initial expectations, we delivered an incremental 400 basis points from margin improvement. We also realized incremental benefits from our tax rate improvement, which yielded 300 basis points, bringing EPS to $9.24. Unfavorable currency headwinds impacted earnings per share by 900 basis points. Despite that significant headwind, we were still able to deliver $8.59 of earnings. On a currency-neutral basis, earnings grew 29.1%, which we believe demonstrates our ability to deliver on our commitment.
Moving on to Slide 17. There are a number of factors to consider when discussing our earnings per share in fiscal year 2017. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on our EPS guidance. First, as I mentioned, we are extremely pleased with strong EPS growth this year. Looking forward, we expect currency-neutral EPS to grow between 12% and 13%. This is partially muted by the impact of the respiratory JV, as we previously communicated. Pension also presents a headwind next year of approximately 100 basis points. 
Contributing to EPS growth is approximately 200 basis points from the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the tax accounting on our stock compensation programs. In addition, we estimate that currency will once again present a headwind. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.10. On an adjusted basis, we expect to achieve very strong earnings of $9.45 to $9.55.
Turning to Slide 18. I'd like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2017. As Vince mentioned earlier in the presentation, we expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%, with BD Medical growing 4.5% to 5% and Life Sciences growing between 4% to 5%. Growth in both segments contemplates a small amount of pricing pressure. 
From a phasing perspective, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the first quarter to be below this range. This is primarily due to some lingering softness in the EMA region and the timing of tenders in our Biosciences business. This will result in a currency-neutral revenue growth of about 4% in the first fiscal quarter. We expect revenue growth to return back to our guidance range in the second fiscal quarter, with continued acceleration over the back half of the year. We expect gross profit margin to be between 53% and 54%, which is a significant milestone for BD.
SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 23.5% and 24%. Our guidance also reflects continued investments in emerging markets as well as costs related to new product launches and registration costs. We expect our R&D investments to be in line with fiscal year 2016 at about 6% to 6.5% of revenues as we continue to invest in new products and platforms. 
As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 23% and 24% of revenues, up from 20.8% this year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve by 175 to 225 basis points. This also excludes slight pension headwinds.
We expect our tax rate to be between 17% and 19%, driven by tax synergies, favorable geographic mix and a benefit from accounting change in our stock compensation program. For fiscal year 2017, we anticipate our average fully diluted share count to be approximately 219 million. Cash flow is expected to remain strong, with operating cash flow of about $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $700 million. 
In summary, we have good momentum exiting this fiscal year, and looking forward into 2017, we are building off a solid foundation. I'm confident that fiscal year 2017 will be another strong year of performance, positioning us well for continued success. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who'll provide you with our concluding remarks."

We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on our pipeline and believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history. We have recently obtained a number of approvals. I'll touch on just a few. 
On the Medical side of the business, we are pleased that our partner, Fresenius, received their first FDA approval for IV solution products. Additional approvals are expected, and we are on track to start shipping these products late in the first half of the year. Last quarter, we received our first orders for FlowSmart, our new insulin infusion set, where Medtronic serves as our distribution partner. Early patient feedback has been extremely positive. 
On the life side -- Life Science side of the business, we're pleased that the FDA has approved the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and also the GC/CT/TV assay. We launched our new Phoenix IDAST instrument. We launched the FACSMelody and received approval for Barricor in the U.S. We plan to share more about our pipeline on November 17 at our upcoming Analyst Day.
Also on Analyst Day, we will discuss the company's strategy and vision for the future and how we are helping to address health care's most pressing challenges. The segment leaders will do a deep dive into our business units, which will include some key product launches that we will be unveiling for the first time. We will conclude the day with a financial framework that will outline our plans for sustainable revenue growth, continued margin expansion, strong cash flow generation and capital deployment and, ultimately, demonstrate how all of those things will drive long-term value not only for our customers and patients they serve but also for our employees and our shareholders.
Moving on to Slide 21. I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we're extremely pleased with our first fiscal year as the new BD. We believe that we have demonstrated that we can successfully execute on the integration of the largest transaction in the company's history.  Second, the diversity of our portfolio from a product and geographic perspective provides consistent and reliable earnings growth. Third, we continue to invest in key strategic areas and, at the same time, deliver significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. 
We're looking forward to sharing more details about our pipeline at our Analyst Day in 2 weeks. We believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history, and we look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence.
Finally, I would like to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for our successful first full fiscal year as a combined company with CareFusion. It's a testament to the hard work of all of our employees that we delivered on our commitments. I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to create a true industry leader as we continue to advance the world of health. 
So with that, thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

And some of the businesses, as I look over the quarter and the full year '16, did a little bit better. Some businesses were a bit more challenged. And so maybe just focusing a bit on the more challenged businesses first. Can you just talk a little bit about some of the headwinds that you saw, particularly international, in the Life Sciences business this quarter, this year and how you think about some of those end markets in FY '17? And then if you think about that in aggregate, that 4.5% to 5% revenue growth target for FY '17, what gets you to the higher end of that range?"

Sure, happy to do that. I feel good about the 4.5% to 5%. And let me walk through the markets, and I'll hit the Bioscience issue, which you brought up, which was really the real drag along with, quite frankly, the flu early on in the year. So f",639,"Yes, Mike. Sure, happy to do that. I feel good about the 4.5% to 5%. And let me walk through the markets, and I'll hit the Bioscience issue, which you brought up, which was really the real drag along with, quite frankly, the flu early on in the year. So from a market perspective, let me just start with the developed markets. The developed markets certainly have stabilized, and you've seen that -- our growth rate going up in the developed markets and the U.S. The U.S. was very strong. By the way, including Biosciences, Europe was good, Japan was good. So we feel good about our position in developed markets and the product pipeline we have for those marketplaces. If I come to emerging markets, the issue really this year was, number one, Saudi Arabia, where we saw the government do a 35% cut of all types of expenses, not just health care. And that will annualize during the year. We already saw a stabilization in Saudi Arabia. In terms of Africa, Africa was basically CD4 testing. And CD4 testing was driven by, one, some conversion to viral load; and two, actually, confusion over a change in the purchasing organization for CD4 and viral load. And we think we have one more quarter of that. We did start to see some CD4 orders come in the fourth quarter and a little bit of a rebound. But we know we have that in the first quarter and then that annualizes and improves. Coming back to opportunities. On China, you saw the strong growth in China in the fourth quarter. If you actually go back and look at China after the first quarter, where we had some inventory take-down, China was strong for the other 3 quarters. We expect that to continue. It was especially strong this year on the Medical side of the business, and we think we're well positioned with the work that Tom and the regulatory team have been doing with the CareFusion product lines there. And as I've mentioned on previous calls, we've started with some of those product lines kind of the simpler disposables, and I'm sure Tom will talk more about that later on in the call. If there was any softness in China this year from a true demand standpoint, it was on the Life Science side, and it was related to those anticorruption campaign. What we saw was stabilization starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. And Alberto can mention to you he's starting to get ramped up the Bruker deal in China as well, which was a whole new thing for us. We had to learn how to do that and work our way through some submissions. So we feel good about China. The rest of Asia has been good. Latin America has performed well this year. In spite of all those issues in Brazil, it's been -- the rest of the geography has done fine. Coming back to the 4.5% to 5%. Then the other element that you have to think about is 2 other things. One is we will not have respiratory anymore, and that has been a bit of a headwind for the company. And then we think, in the back half of the year, you'll start to see more traction with our product launches. Things like Barricor, they have to do the validation first, so that takes a little while to get going. Customer feedback has been excellent. Alberto can talk about the product launches that you heard for BD MAX. Those are really critical assays to that program. We're excited about them. And so there's a whole list of these things, and we'll show you more about that as we do the Analyst Day. So that's the way we're thinking about it."

We see those headwinds abating after the first quarter because they really came up in the second quarter -- second, third and fourth of this year. So we still have a little bit of a tough compare in the first quarter that we talked about, particularly in Saudi and Africa. But once we get through that with the new product launches that we're seeing, the strength of the rest of the business, we feel real good about our prospects for '17."

We've been talking about taking the tax rate down to the high teens for some time now, and we've been making great progress against that. As we mentioned on the last call, the tax synergies coming from CareFusion happened faster and greater than we ever expected, and so we're seeing the benefit of that. So as we look out into next year, we see that bringing us to the high teens. And then we've got the benefit of the stock comp accounting adjustment. That brings us down to the 17% to 19% range. So this move down is part of the march down in the tax rate that we've been seeing, coupled with the benefits that we're getting from the synergies from CareFusion. And so we really feel good about that. We've also closed out a lot of tax exams in multiple jurisdictions. We're part of the IRS' CAP program, so they're auditing us on a real-time basis. So the sustainability of this tax rate is extremely strong, and we feel real good about it."

And maybe just to touch base on the 2 areas that you mentioned, Pyxis and Alaris. Certainly, Pyxis ES continues to go very well. We talked earlier in the year about some of the process improvements we had made to accelerate the installation process. I think you're seeing the results of that work come to fruition now with faster installations, getting those systems in. We now have over 1,100 sites live on ES or about 1/3 of our installed base is now upgraded to the ES platform. And the receptivity is very solid, and we extract -- expect strong demand on that going forward. Alaris, we continue to gain about 2 to 3 points of category share this past year in FY '16, and we're looking at kind of a similar progress outlook for FY '17 as well. And so we certainly do have organizations that are cross-selling those as an integrated offering. You'll see at Analyst Day us talk about some new informatic capabilities and other new products coming out that will further strengthen the integration and the value that we can deliver to customers who are using that complete end-to-end offering.

So as we think about the use of that cash flow, we'll probably do something on the dividend rate. You know that the payout ratio has come down a little bit. We increased 10% a year for the last couple of years. The good news is our EPS is going up over 20%. So the payout ratio has come down a little bit, and we will have to address that going forward. I think CapEx, as you think about it, will be in the $700 million range. That's pretty consistent with where it has been. So that leaves a lot of cash left over. We'll allocate some of that to tuck-in acquisitions, and that will still leave a lot of cash left over. And we're not going to let that cash build up on the balance sheet. So we'll return to doing some share buybacks. You will hear more about that at Analyst Day. And certainly, as we approach the March period of getting to the 3x leverage, we'll be giving a little bit more specificity on where we're going.

It's a significant milestone for us to hit that 53% to 54%. We do see a little bit of -- more synergies coming because as we execute on the synergies that affect gross profit and cost of goods sold, which we said would come towards the latter end of our synergies, and that is the way that's playing out, but, again, continued -- continuous improvement in that area.

Again, we do have some new technologies being added to the platform, which we'll share also at the upcoming Analyst Meeting. So we're very positive on the outlook there. But as we think about IV solutions as we mentioned before, you're going to see, I would expect, a rolling series of approvals on that platform. This is the first -- of course, there's numbers of different formations of IV solutions as well as bag sizes when you think about building out a portfolio that customers really need to run their institution.

You got to look at that The pricing environment has been, as Vince said, it hasn't really changed. And so then I think the next part of your question came to the phasing of revenue going forward. As we said, we do see some headwinds continuing as we annualize the headwinds from Saudi and Africa. That will bring us down in the area of about 4% in the first quarter, plus or minus 20 basis points, particularly as that's a high quarter for the flu. So it could go one way or the other on us. But then the ramp in the second quarter brings us back well within the range -- the high end of the range. And the ramping of new products that we see in the second half of the year bring us back to a strong 4.5% to 5% range. So that feels really good. In terms of capital deployment, the share buybacks, we're committed to not buyback any shares other than what we've already done for respiratory, which we've talked about. But we're not looking to do anything until we get to the 3x leverage. We want to hit that commitment that we have, and that brings us through March. So halfway through the year. And then from that point on, you're right, there could be some -- if you look at the full year impact of that at that point, so more to come on that.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.
As a reminder, we annualized the acquisition of CareFusion in March, and as such, our fourth quarter results reflect the new BD in both the current and prior year periods. In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude the sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of F&P's respiratory care products. The impact to the bottom line is not material. Comparable organic revenues are adjusted to further exclude the impact of non-annualized acquisitions and closed divestitures. The fiscal 2017 comparable revenue guidance provided today will exclude revenues of closed divestitures, most notably the Respiratory Solutions business that was divested in October of 2016 just after our fiscal year-end. 
In the fourth quarter, the company recorded a noncash impairment charge for capitalized internal-use IT software assets. This charge, along with the details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules, in our press release or the appendix of Investor Relations slides.
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical Segment; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

In the words of Brian Weinstein, go Cubs. 
Moving on to my presentation. As we stated in our press release, we are extremely proud of our accomplishments in our first full fiscal year as the new BD. As you already know, the acquisition of CareFusion 18 months ago significantly accelerated our strategy, and the powerful combination of BD and CareFusion continues to deliver positive results. We've seen significant benefits as a result of this transaction from a customer, employee and shareholder standpoint, and we think there's more to come. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal year 2016. First, our results reflect our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio. Legacy BD remains solid, and the CareFusion portfolio has performed in line with our expectations. 
Second, emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver for the company. We experienced some headwinds this year, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, but remain confident that emerging markets are well positioned for continued growth. We also continue to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products in these markets and expand their global reach by leveraging BD's international infrastructure. We're on track with our new product approval and submission plans and look forward to providing more color at our Analyst Meeting later this month. Developed markets continued to show stabilization, and growth has accelerated over the past year. 
Third, we made key strategic decisions to optimize our portfolio. This included the divestitures of BD Rx and the spine business in conjunction with the joint venture for the respiratory business, which we just completed in October. These actions further enabled the organization to prioritize and invest in the most important opportunities for future growth. We were deliberate in increasing our R&D investment in targeted high-growth areas and fully utilized the benefit of the medical device tax suspension.
Fourth, we remain focused on our operating effectiveness and efficiency initiatives, which have generated significant margin expansion. This year, we drove approximately 200 basis points of underlying margin expansion, which includes approximately $120 million in cost synergies. We also delivered robust earnings growth of almost 30%, which is greater than our initial expectations.
Lastly, we closed our first full year as the new BD, having achieved all important milestones and also demonstrated that we are successfully executing on our acquisition of CareFusion. As we look forward, we continue to build on our solid foundation and look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence. 
Moving to Slide 5. You will see the guidance for fiscal year 2017 on a currency-neutral basis. For the fiscal year 2017, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% based on our current view of the environment and various macroeconomic factors. There are a number of items that could bring us to the top or bottom end of that range, including a stronger or weaker flu season than expected, the performance of new product launches, emerging market growth and pricing. On the bottom line, we will continue to deliver high-quality earnings growth. For fiscal year 2017, we expect EPS of $9.45 to $9.55 or $9.62 to $9.72 currency neutral, which reflects growth of 12% to 13%.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris, who will walk you through our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year, along with the additional details about our fiscal year 2017 guidance."
103678,403765314,1071918,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7. I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of approx",2260,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7. I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of approximately $3.2 billion grew 6.4% on a comparable basis. Fully diluted adjusted EPS came in ahead of our expectations at $2.12, growing at 16.5% over the prior year. 
As Vince mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our solid finish to the year, the first full year as a combined entity with CareFusion. For the total year, revenues grew 4.3%. We significantly expanded our margins and captured approximately $120 million in synergy cost savings. Adjusted EPS of $8.59 exceeded our expectations, driven by solid revenues, margin expansion and an improved tax rate. In addition to the cost synergies, tax synergies have materialized sooner and have exceeded the benefits we anticipated in the early days of the transaction. We are also pleased to announce that we have continued to delever as we reduced the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion. We are currently at 3.3x gross leverage and remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3x gross leverage by March of 2017.
On Slide 8, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenue growth was 6.4% for the total company in the quarter, pricing was about flat. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 7.9%. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 6.6%, which reflects strength in flush, ChloraPrep and safety-engineered products. Revenues in Medication Management Solutions or MMS grew 12.8%. This was driven by double-digit growth in both dispensing and infusion sales.  
Respiratory Solution revenues increased 12.7%, as expected. This reflects strong capital installations and a favorable comparison to the prior year period.
Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%. This reflects solid growth in pen needles, which was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 5.1% reflects strength in our self-injection platform. For the total year, BD Medical grew 4.7%. 
BD Life Sciences fourth quarter revenues increased 2.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Diagnostic System revenues were about flat compared to the prior year. This reflects continued strength in core microbiology and BD MAX, which grew double digits in the quarter. This growth was offset by the timing of KIESTRA installations outside of the U.S., which I'll speak to in just a moment. For the total year, we are extremely pleased with our microbiology business, with KIESTRA growing at about 19%.
Preanalytical Systems growth of 4% was driven by safety-engineered products and growth in the U.S. and emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 4% was driven by continued strong research instrument placements in the U.S. and reagent sales. For the total year, Life Sciences grew 3.4%. The headwinds we experienced in Africa negatively impacted segment results by 60 basis points, bringing underlying growth to 4% for the total year.  
Moving to Slide 9. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth was very strong at 7.2%. This was comprised of BD Medical growing at 7.7% and BD Life Sciences growing at 5.8%. BD Medical's performance reflects strong growth in capital placements and a wide range of infusion disposable products in our Medication and Procedural Solutions business. Growth was also driven by our Pharmaceutical Systems business. 
BD Life Sciences growth reflects strong performance across the segment in the U.S. The growth in our Biosciences business was driven by high-parameter research instruments, including FACSSymphony, our FACSCelesta mid-level analyzer and the launch of the FACSMelody. Our U.S. Diagnostics business saw continued growth in microbiology, including KIESTRA and the BD MAX molecular platform. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 5%, driven by safety-engineered products.
Moving on to international. Revenues grew 5.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which is primarily related to the Life Sciences segment. The Medical segment grew 8.2%. This was driven by strong performance from infusion disposal products in the MPS business and strong performance in China. Growth was also driven by medication management, reflecting double-digit growth in both dispensing and infusion.
Growth in the Life Science segment was about flat compared to the prior year. We experienced a decline in Diagnostic Systems due to the timing of KIESTRA installations. Increased installations in the third fiscal quarter negatively impacted the fourth fiscal quarter in conjunction with the tough comparison to the prior year fourth quarter. Biosciences growth was lower in the quarter due to continued declines in Africa, as we anticipated. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 2.9%, driven by strength in China, which was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year period.
On Slide 10, developed markets grew a healthy 5.8%, bringing the total year growth to 4.1%. Emerging market revenues grew 8.5% currency neutral, bringing our year-to-date growth rate to 5.3%. China growth for the fourth quarter was 17.7%, bringing the total year growth rate to 10.1%. Growth in emerging markets this fiscal year was lower than initially expected in the Middle East and Africa, and we believe those challenges are largely behind us after we exit the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Emerging markets remain an important growth driver, and given our robust international footprint, we are well positioned to drive growth well into the future.
Looking into fiscal year 2017. We expect emerging markets to grow high single digits, driven by a diversified base, with China growing low double digits, continued strength in Latin America and fewer headwinds in EMA and Africa. In terms of developed markets, we believe the stability we have seen in the market over the past 12 to 18 months will continue, yielding a growth rate of about 4%.
Moving to global safety on Slide 11. Currency-neutral sales increased 5.9% and grew to $783 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 5.7%. This reflects continued strength of safety catheters as well as a benefit from the timing of orders across our hypodermic products.
International sales grew 6.2% currency neutral. International performance in the Medical segment was driven by the continued strength in China, and safety revenues grew 13.8% in emerging markets.
Medical safety sales grew 7%, driven by infusion disposables, catheters and a range of safety-engineered products. Life Sciences safety sales, which were driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4% in the quarter.
Slide 12 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. Revenues grew a strong 6.4% in the quarter. Gross profit was strong, growing faster than revenues, at 7.9%. And I'll provide more details on gross profit in just a moment. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.4%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which is masked in this quarter by key strategic investments in product launches in both segments. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 7.8%, which is higher than normal due to the timing of spend as anticipated. As a result of the medical device tax suspension, we were able to make additional investments in a number of high-growth areas. After normalizing for this significant additional investment in R&D, underlying operating income would have grown about 10% in the quarter.
Our tax rate declined to 16.2% in the quarter due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, tax synergies materializing earlier than expected and continued favorable geographic mix. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.12, which is a 16.5% increase versus the prior year.
Turning to Slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 90 basis points, driven by continuous improvement initiatives. This was more than offset by significant currency headwinds of 110 basis points. On an operating margin basis, we are extremely pleased to have delivered about 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion. As I mentioned on the previous slide, the leverage we are getting in SSG&A as we continue to drive cost synergies is being masked in the quarter by investments in key product launches. In addition, margin expansion was partially offset by significant R&D investments, as expected, and unfavorable currency. 
I'd like to take a moment on Slide 14 to highlight some of our key operational achievements for fiscal year 2016. The acquisition of CareFusion provided BD a unique opportunity to leverage the transaction to optimize the combined organization through functional transformations, and we have made significant progress in this area. All of our efforts have yielded results, and we are on track to deliver continued synergies. In aggregate, we have achieved over $170 million in total cost synergies to date. 
We have also driven significant margin expansion on a multiyear trajectory. Starting with fiscal year 2015, we delivered 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. This year, we achieved another 200 basis points, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver another 175 to 225 basis points in fiscal year 2017. Over those 3 years, we will have driven over 500 basis points of cumulative margin expansion, and I believe that we continue to drive robust performance with additional synergies in conjunction with continuous improvement going forward. We're extremely proud of the organization's ability to continue improving on our skills and expertise by executing against our synergy commitment initiatives through these transformations.
Moving on to Slide 15. I'd like to highlight our robust EPS growth, which exceeded our expectations this year. Starting with 2015 EPS of $7.16, we had communicated last November that we would grow EPS 22% to 23% on a currency-neutral basis. Beyond our initial expectations, we delivered an incremental 400 basis points from margin improvement. We also realized incremental benefits from our tax rate improvement, which yielded 300 basis points, bringing EPS to $9.24. Unfavorable currency headwinds impacted earnings per share by 900 basis points. Despite that significant headwind, we were still able to deliver $8.59 of earnings. On a currency-neutral basis, earnings grew 29.1%, which we believe demonstrates our ability to deliver on our commitment.
Moving on to Slide 17. There are a number of factors to consider when discussing our earnings per share in fiscal year 2017. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on our EPS guidance. First, as I mentioned, we are extremely pleased with strong EPS growth this year. Looking forward, we expect currency-neutral EPS to grow between 12% and 13%. This is partially muted by the impact of the respiratory JV, as we previously communicated. Pension also presents a headwind next year of approximately 100 basis points. 
Contributing to EPS growth is approximately 200 basis points from the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the tax accounting on our stock compensation programs. In addition, we estimate that currency will once again present a headwind. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.10. On an adjusted basis, we expect to achieve very strong earnings of $9.45 to $9.55.
Turning to Slide 18. I'd like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2017. As Vince mentioned earlier in the presentation, we expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%, with BD Medical growing 4.5% to 5% and Life Sciences growing between 4% to 5%. Growth in both segments contemplates a small amount of pricing pressure. 
From a phasing perspective, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the first quarter to be below this range. This is primarily due to some lingering softness in the EMA region and the timing of tenders in our Biosciences business. This will result in a currency-neutral revenue growth of about 4% in the first fiscal quarter. We expect revenue growth to return back to our guidance range in the second fiscal quarter, with continued acceleration over the back half of the year. We expect gross profit margin to be between 53% and 54%, which is a significant milestone for BD.
SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 23.5% and 24%. Our guidance also reflects continued investments in emerging markets as well as costs related to new product launches and registration costs. We expect our R&D investments to be in line with fiscal year 2016 at about 6% to 6.5% of revenues as we continue to invest in new products and platforms. 
As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 23% and 24% of revenues, up from 20.8% this year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve by 175 to 225 basis points. This also excludes slight pension headwinds.
We expect our tax rate to be between 17% and 19%, driven by tax synergies, favorable geographic mix and a benefit from accounting change in our stock compensation program. For fiscal year 2017, we anticipate our average fully diluted share count to be approximately 219 million. Cash flow is expected to remain strong, with operating cash flow of about $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $700 million. 
In summary, we have good momentum exiting this fiscal year, and looking forward into 2017, we are building off a solid foundation. I'm confident that fiscal year 2017 will be another strong year of performance, positioning us well for continued success. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who'll provide you with our concluding remarks."

We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on our pipeline and believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history. We have recently obtained a number of approvals. I'll touch on just a few. 
On the Medical side of the business, we are pleased that our partner, Fresenius, received their first FDA approval for IV solution products. Additional approvals are expected, and we are on track to start shipping these products late in the first half of the year. Last quarter, we received our first orders for FlowSmart, our new insulin infusion set, where Medtronic serves as our distribution partner. Early patient feedback has been extremely positive. 
On the life side -- Life Science side of the business, we're pleased that the FDA has approved the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and also the GC/CT/TV assay. We launched our new Phoenix IDAST instrument. We launched the FACSMelody and received approval for Barricor in the U.S. We plan to share more about our pipeline on November 17 at our upcoming Analyst Day.
Also on Analyst Day, we will discuss the company's strategy and vision for the future and how we are helping to address health care's most pressing challenges. The segment leaders will do a deep dive into our business units, which will include some key product launches that we will be unveiling for the first time. We will conclude the day with a financial framework that will outline our plans for sustainable revenue growth, continued margin expansion, strong cash flow generation and capital deployment and, ultimately, demonstrate how all of those things will drive long-term value not only for our customers and patients they serve but also for our employees and our shareholders.
Moving on to Slide 21. I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we're extremely pleased with our first fiscal year as the new BD. We believe that we have demonstrated that we can successfully execute on the integration of the largest transaction in the company's history.  Second, the diversity of our portfolio from a product and geographic perspective provides consistent and reliable earnings growth. Third, we continue to invest in key strategic areas and, at the same time, deliver significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. 
We're looking forward to sharing more details about our pipeline at our Analyst Day in 2 weeks. We believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history, and we look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence.
Finally, I would like to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for our successful first full fiscal year as a combined company with CareFusion. It's a testament to the hard work of all of our employees that we delivered on our commitments. I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to create a true industry leader as we continue to advance the world of health. 
So with that, thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

The developed markets certainly have stabilized, and you've seen that -- our growth rate going up in the developed markets and the U.S. The U.S. was very strong. By the way, including Biosciences, Europe was good, Japan was good. So we feel good about our position in developed markets and the product pipeline we have for those marketplaces. If I come to emerging markets, the issue really this year was, number one, Saudi Arabia, where we saw the government do a 35% cut of all types of expenses, not just health care. And that will annualize during the year. We already saw a stabilization in Saudi Arabia. In terms of Africa, Africa was basically CD4 testing. And CD4 testing was driven by, one, some conversion to viral load; and two, actually, confusion over a change in the purchasing organization for CD4 and viral load. And we think we have one more quarter of that. We did start to see some CD4 orders come in the fourth quarter and a little bit of a rebound. But we know we have that in the first quarter and then that annualizes and improves. Coming back to opportunities. On China, you saw the strong growth in China in the fourth quarter. If you actually go back and look at China after the first quarter, where we had some inventory take-down, China was strong for the other 3 quarters. We expect that to continue. It was especially strong this year on the Medical side of the business, and we think we're well positioned with the work that Tom and the regulatory team have been doing with the CareFusion product lines there. And as I've mentioned on previous calls, we've started with some of those product lines kind of the simpler disposables, and I'm sure Tom will talk more about that later on in the call. If there was any softness in China this year from a true demand standpoint, it was on the Life Science side, and it was related to those anticorruption campaign. What we saw was stabilization starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. And Alberto can mention to you he's starting to get ramped up the Bruker deal in China as well, which was a whole new thing for us. We had to learn how to do that and work our way through some submissions. So we feel good about China. The rest of Asia has been good. Latin America has performed well this year. In spite of all those issues in Brazil, it's been -- the rest of the geography has done fine. Coming back to the 4.5% to 5%. Then the other element that you have to think about is 2 other things. One is we will not have respiratory anymore, and that has been a bit of a headwind for the company. And then we think, in the back half of the year, you'll start to see more traction with our product launches. Things like Barricor, they have to do the validation first, so that takes a little while to get going. Customer feedback has been excellent. Alberto can talk about the product launches that you heard for BD MAX. Those are really critical assays to that program. We're excited about them. And so there's a whole list of these things, and we'll show you more about that as we do the Analyst Day. So that's the way we're thinking about it."

We've been talking about taking the tax rate down to the high teens for some time now, and we've been making great progress against that. As we mentioned on the last call, the tax synergies coming from CareFusion happened faster and greater than we ever expected, and so we're seeing the benefit of that. So as we look out into next year, we see that bringing us to the high teens. And then we've got the benefit of the stock comp accounting adjustment. That brings us down to the 17% to 19% range. So this move down is part of the march down in the tax rate that we've been seeing, coupled with the benefits that we're getting from the synergies from CareFusion. And so we really feel good about that. We've also closed out a lot of tax exams in multiple jurisdictions. We're part of the IRS' CAP program, so they're auditing us on a real-time basis.

We talked earlier in the year about some of the process improvements we had made to accelerate the installation process. I think you're seeing the results of that work come to fruition now with faster installations, getting those systems in. We now have over 1,100 sites live on ES or about 1/3 of our installed base is now upgraded to the ES platform. And the receptivity is very solid, and we extract -- expect strong demand on that going forward. Alaris, we continue to gain about 2 to 3 points of category share this past year in FY '16, and we're looking at kind of a similar progress outlook for FY '17 as well. And so we certainly do have organizations that are cross-selling those as an integrated offering.

So as we think about the use of that cash flow, we'll probably do something on the dividend rate. You know that the payout ratio has come down a little bit. We increased 10% a year for the last couple of years. The good news is our EPS is going up over 20%. So the payout ratio has come down a little bit, and we will have to address that going forward. I think CapEx, as you think about it, will be in the $700 million range. That's pretty consistent with where it has been. So that leaves a lot of cash left over. We'll allocate some of that to tuck-in acquisitions, and that will still leave a lot of cash left over. And we're not going to let that cash build up on the balance sheet. So we'll return to doing some share buybacks. You will hear more about that at Analyst Day. And certainly, as we approach the March period of getting to the 3x leverage, we'll be giving a little bit more specificity on where we're going. But the good news is we have really good strong cash flow and a really solid balance sheet with a lot of flexibility."

It's a significant milestone for us to hit that 53% to 54%. We do see a little bit of -- more synergies coming because as we execute on the synergies that affect gross profit and cost of goods sold, which we said would come towards the latter end of our synergies, and that is the way that's playing out, but, again, continued -- continuous improvement in that area. So we feel really good about the gross profit margin. Also, that flows down to the operating margin. So as we mentioned, this year, 200 basis points; last year, 100 basis points; next year, in that 200 basis points kind of range, 500 basis points in total, again, driven both from execution of the synergies as well as continuous improvement initiatives.

So that share gain that we saw this year is actually relatively consistent with share trajectory that we've seen over the last, let's call it, 4 to 5 years within the Alaris platform. I think what customers certainly value in the platform around the power of one, the ability to do not just large volume but also syringe-based and narcotic infusions off the same platform as well as its leading interoperability position with electronic medical records, are some of the key reasons why people have been choosing it at a higher rate and continue to do so going forward. Again, we do have some new technologies being added to the platform, which we'll share also at the upcoming Analyst Meeting. So we're very positive on the outlook there. I think, as we think about IV solutions, and we've mentioned before that you're going to see, I would expect, a rolling series of approvals on that platform. This is the first -- of course, there's a number of different formulations of IV solutions as well as bag sizes when you think about building out a portfolio that customers really need to run their institution. And so what you just saw get approved was the first in a series of products, and we would expect the additional products to be coming out over the months ahead.

And as we said, we do see some headwinds continuing as we annualize the headwinds from Saudi and Africa. That will bring us down in the area of about 4% in the first quarter plus or minus 20 basis points, particularly as that's a high quarter for the flu. So it could go one way or the other on us. But then the ramp in the second quarter brings us back well within the range -- the high end of the range. And the ramping of new products we see in the second half of the year bring us back to a strong 4.5% to 5% range. So that feels real good. In terms of capital deployment, the share buybacks, we are committed to not buy back any shares other than what we've already done for respiratory, which we've talked about. But we're not looking to do anything until we get to the 3x leverage. We want to hit that commitment that we had, and that brings us through March, so halfway through the year.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.
As a reminder, we annualized the acquisition of CareFusion in March, and as such, our fourth quarter results reflect the new BD in both the current and prior year periods. In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude the sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of F&P's respiratory care products. The impact to the bottom line is not material. Comparable organic revenues are adjusted to further exclude the impact of non-annualized acquisitions and closed divestitures. The fiscal 2017 comparable revenue guidance provided today will exclude revenues of closed divestitures, most notably the Respiratory Solutions business that was divested in October of 2016 just after our fiscal year-end. 
In the fourth quarter, the company recorded a noncash impairment charge for capitalized internal-use IT software assets. This charge, along with the details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results, can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules, in our press release or the appendix of Investor Relations slides.
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical Segment; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

In the words of Brian Weinstein, go Cubs. 
Moving on to my presentation. As we stated in our press release, we are extremely proud of our accomplishments in our first full fiscal year as the new BD. As you already know, the acquisition of CareFusion 18 months ago significantly accelerated our strategy, and the powerful combination of BD and CareFusion continues to deliver positive results. We've seen significant benefits as a result of this transaction from a customer, employee and shareholder standpoint, and we think there's more to come. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal year 2016. First, our results reflect our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio. Legacy BD remains solid, and the CareFusion portfolio has performed in line with our expectations. 
Second, emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver for the company. We experienced some headwinds this year, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, but remain confident that emerging markets are well positioned for continued growth. We also continue to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products in these markets and expand their global reach by leveraging BD's international infrastructure. We're on track with our new product approval and submission plans and look forward to providing more color at our Analyst Meeting later this month. Developed markets continued to show stabilization, and growth has accelerated over the past year. 
Third, we made key strategic decisions to optimize our portfolio. This included the divestitures of BD Rx and the spine business in conjunction with the joint venture for the respiratory business, which we just completed in October. These actions further enabled the organization to prioritize and invest in the most important opportunities for future growth. We were deliberate in increasing our R&D investment in targeted high-growth areas and fully utilized the benefit of the medical device tax suspension.
Fourth, we remain focused on our operating effectiveness and efficiency initiatives, which have generated significant margin expansion. This year, we drove approximately 200 basis points of underlying margin expansion, which includes approximately $120 million in cost synergies. We also delivered robust earnings growth of almost 30%, which is greater than our initial expectations.
Lastly, we closed our first full year as the new BD having achieved all important milestones and also demonstrated that we are successfully executing on our acquisition of CareFusion. As we look forward, we continue to build on our solid foundation and look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence. 
Moving to Slide 5. You will see the guidance for fiscal year 2017 on a currency-neutral basis. For the fiscal year 2017, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% based on our current view of the environment and various macroeconomic factors. There are a number of items that could bring us to the top or bottom end of that range, including a stronger or weaker flu season than expected, the performance of new product launches, emerging market growth and pricing. On the bottom line, we will continue to deliver high-quality earnings growth. For fiscal year 2017, we expect EPS of $9.45 to $9.55 or $9.62 to $9.72 currency neutral, which reflects growth of 12% to 13%.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris, who will walk you through our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year, along with the additional details about our fiscal year 2017 guidance."
103678,403765314,1072178,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7. I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of approx",2259,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7. I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of approximately $3.2 billion grew 6.4% on a comparable basis. Fully diluted adjusted EPS came in ahead of our expectations at $2.12, growing at 16.5% over the prior year. 
As Vince mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our solid finish to the year, the first full year as a combined entity with CareFusion. For the total year, revenues grew 4.3%. We significantly expanded our margins and captured approximately $120 million in synergy cost savings. Adjusted EPS of $8.59 exceeded our expectations, driven by solid revenues, margin expansion and an improved tax rate. In addition to the cost synergies, tax synergies have materialized sooner and have exceeded the benefits we anticipated in the early days of the transaction. We are also pleased to announce that we have continued to delever as we reduced the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion. We are currently at 3.3x gross leverage and remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3x gross leverage by March of 2017.
On Slide 8, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenue growth was 6.4% for the total company. In the quarter, pricing was about flat. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 7.9%. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 6.6%, which reflects strength in flush, ChloraPrep and safety-engineered products. Revenues in Medication Management Solutions or MMS grew 12.8%. This was driven by double-digit growth in both dispensing and infusion sales.  
Respiratory Solution revenues increased 12.7%, as expected. This reflects strong capital installations and a favorable comparison to the prior-year period.
Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%. This reflects solid growth in pen needles, which was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 5.1% reflects strength in our self-injection platform. For the total year, BD Medical grew 4.7%. 
BD Life Sciences fourth quarter revenues increased 2.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Diagnostic System revenues were about flat compared to the prior year. This reflects continued strength in core microbiology and BD MAX, which grew double digits in the quarter. This growth was offset by the timing of KIESTRA installations outside of the U.S., which I'll speak to in just a moment. For the total year, we are extremely pleased with our microbiology business, with KIESTRA growing at about 19%.
Preanalytical Systems growth of 4% was driven by safety-engineered products and growth in the U.S. and emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 4% was driven by continued strong research instrument placements in the U.S. and reagent sales. For the total year, Life Sciences grew 3.4%. The headwinds we experienced in Africa negatively impacted segment results by 60 basis points, bringing underlying growth to 4% for the total year.  
Moving to Slide 9. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth was very strong at 7.2%. This was comprised of BD Medical growing at 7.7% and BD Life Sciences growing at 5.8%. BD Medical's performance reflects strong growth in capital placements and a wide range of infusion disposable products in our Medication and Procedural Solutions business. Growth was also driven by our Pharmaceutical Systems business. 
BD Life Sciences growth reflects strong performance across the segment in the U.S. The growth in our Biosciences business was driven by high-parameter research instruments, including FACSSymphony, our FACSCelesta mid-level analyzer and the launch of the FACSMelody. Our U.S. Diagnostics business saw continued growth in microbiology, including KIESTRA and the BD MAX molecular platform. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 5%, driven by safety-engineered products.
Moving on to international. Revenues grew 5.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which is primarily related to the Life Sciences segment. The Medical segment grew 8.2%. This was driven by strong performance from infusion disposal products in the MPS business and strong performance in China. Growth was also driven by medication management, reflecting double-digit growth in both dispensing and infusion.
Growth in the Life Science segment was about flat compared to the prior year. We experienced a decline in Diagnostic Systems due to the timing of KIESTRA installations. Increased installations in the third fiscal quarter negatively impacted the fourth fiscal quarter in conjunction with the tough comparison to the prior year fourth quarter. Biosciences growth was lower in the quarter due to continued declines in Africa, as we anticipated. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 2.9%, driven by strength in China, which was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year period.
On Slide 10, developed markets grew a healthy 5.8%, bringing the total year growth to 4.1%. Emerging market revenues grew 8.5% currency neutral, bringing our year-to-date growth rate to 5.3%. China growth for the fourth quarter was 17.7%, bringing the total year growth rate to 10.1%. Growth in emerging markets this fiscal year was lower than initially expected in the Middle East and Africa, and we believe those challenges are largely behind us after we exit the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Emerging markets remain an important growth driver, and given our robust international footprint, we are well positioned to drive growth well into the future.
Looking into fiscal year 2017. We expect emerging markets to grow high single digits, driven by a diversified base, with China growing low double digits, continued strength in Latin America and fewer headwinds in EMA and Africa. In terms of developed markets, we believe the stability we have seen in the market over the past 12 to 18 months will continue, yielding a growth rate of about 4%.
Moving to global safety on Slide 11. Currency-neutral sales increased 5.9% and grew to $783 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 5.7%. This reflects continued strength of safety catheters as well as a benefit from the timing of orders across our hypodermic products.
International sales grew 6.2% currency neutral. International performance in the Medical segment was driven by the continued strength in China, and safety revenues grew 13.8% in emerging markets.
Medical safety sales grew 7%, driven by infusion disposables, catheters and a range of safety-engineered products. Life Sciences safety sales, which were driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4% in the quarter.
Slide 12 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. Revenues grew a strong 6.4% in the quarter. Gross profit was strong, growing faster than revenues, at 7.9%. And I'll provide more details on gross profit in just a moment. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.4%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which is masked in this quarter by key strategic investments in product launches in both segments. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 7.8%, which is higher than normal due to the timing of spend as anticipated. As a result of the medical device tax suspension, we were able to make additional investments in a number of high-growth areas. After normalizing for this significant additional investment in R&D, underlying operating income would have grown about 10% in the quarter.
Our tax rate declined to 16.2% in the quarter due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, tax synergies materializing earlier than expected and continued favorable geographic mix. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.12, which is a 16.5% increase versus the prior year.
Turning to Slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 90 basis points, driven by continuous improvement initiatives. This was more than offset by significant currency headwinds of 110 basis points. On an operating margin basis, we are extremely pleased to have delivered about 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion. As I mentioned on the previous slide, the leverage we are getting in SSG&A as we continue to drive cost synergies is being masked in the quarter by investments in key product launches. In addition, margin expansion was partially offset by significant R&D investments, as expected, and unfavorable currency. 
I'd like to take a moment on Slide 14 to highlight some of our key operational achievements for fiscal year 2016. The acquisition of CareFusion provided BD a unique opportunity to leverage the transaction to optimize the combined organization through functional transformations, and we have made significant progress in this area. All of our efforts have yielded results, and we are on track to deliver continued synergies. In aggregate, we have achieved over $170 million in total cost synergies to date. 
We have also driven significant margin expansion on a multiyear trajectory. Starting with fiscal year 2015, we delivered 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. This year, we achieved another 200 basis points, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver another 175 to 225 basis points in fiscal year 2017. Over those 3 years, we will have driven over 500 basis points of cumulative margin expansion, and I believe that we continue to drive robust performance with additional synergies in conjunction with continuous improvement going forward. We're extremely proud of the organization's ability to continue improving on our skills and expertise by executing against our synergy commitment initiatives through these transformations.
Moving on to Slide 15. I'd like to highlight our robust EPS growth, which exceeded our expectations this year. Starting with 2015 EPS of $7.16, we had communicated last November that we would grow EPS 22% to 23% on a currency-neutral basis. Beyond our initial expectations, we delivered an incremental 400 basis points from margin improvement. We also realized incremental benefits from our tax rate improvement, which yielded 300 basis points, bringing EPS to $9.24. Unfavorable currency headwinds impacted earnings per share by 900 basis points. Despite that significant headwind, we were still able to deliver $8.59 of earnings. On a currency-neutral basis, earnings grew 29.1%, which we believe demonstrates our ability to deliver on our commitment.
Moving on to Slide 17. There are a number of factors to consider when discussing our earnings per share in fiscal year 2017. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on our EPS guidance. First, as I mentioned, we are extremely pleased with strong EPS growth this year. Looking forward, we expect currency-neutral EPS to grow between 12% and 13%. This is partially muted by the impact of the respiratory JV, as we previously communicated. Pension also presents a headwind next year of approximately 100 basis points. 
Contributing to EPS growth is approximately 200 basis points from the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the tax accounting on our stock compensation programs. In addition, we estimate that currency will once again present a headwind. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.10. On an adjusted basis, we expect to achieve very strong earnings of $9.45 to $9.55.
Turning to Slide 18. I'd like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2017. As Vince mentioned earlier in the presentation, we expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%, with BD Medical growing 4.5% to 5% and Life Sciences growing between 4% to 5%. Growth in both segments contemplates a small amount of pricing pressure. 
From a phasing perspective, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the first quarter to be below this range. This is primarily due to some lingering softness in the EMA region and the timing of tenders in our Biosciences business. This will result in a currency-neutral revenue growth of about 4% in the first fiscal quarter. We expect revenue growth to return back to our guidance range in the second fiscal quarter, with continued acceleration over the back half of the year. We expect gross profit margin to be between 53% and 54%, which is a significant milestone for BD.
SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 23.5% and 24%. Our guidance also reflects continued investments in emerging markets as well as costs related to new product launches and registration costs. We expect our R&D investments to be in line with fiscal year 2016 at about 6% to 6.5% of revenues as we continue to invest in new products and platforms. 
As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 23% and 24% of revenues, up from 20.8% this year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve by 175 to 225 basis points. This also excludes slight pension headwinds.
We expect our tax rate to be between 17% and 19%, driven by tax synergies, favorable geographic mix and a benefit from accounting change in our stock compensation program. For fiscal year 2017, we anticipate our average fully diluted share count to be approximately 219 million. Cash flow is expected to remain strong, with operating cash flow of about $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $700 million. 
In summary, we have good momentum exiting this fiscal year, and looking forward into 2017, we are building off a solid foundation. I'm confident that fiscal year 2017 will be another strong year of performance, positioning us well for continued success. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who'll provide you with our concluding remarks."

We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on our pipeline and believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history. We have recently obtained a number of approvals. I'll touch on just a few. 
On the Medical side of the business, we are pleased that our partner, Fresenius, received their first FDA approval for IV solution products. Additional approvals are expected, and we are on track to start shipping these products late in the first half of the year. Last quarter, we received our first orders for FlowSmart, our new insulin infusion set, where Medtronic serves as our distribution partner. Early patient feedback has been extremely positive. 
On the life side -- Life Science side of the business, we're pleased that the FDA has approved the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and also the GC/CT/TV assay. We launched our new Phoenix IDAST instrument. We launched the FACSMelody and received approval for Barricor in the U.S. We plan to share more about our pipeline on November 17 at our upcoming Analyst Day.
Also on Analyst Day, we will discuss the company's strategy and vision for the future and how we are helping to address health care's most pressing challenges. The segment leaders will do a deep dive into our business units, which will include some key product launches that we will be unveiling for the first time. We will conclude the day with a financial framework that will outline our plans for sustainable revenue growth, continued margin expansion, strong cash flow generation and capital deployment and, ultimately, demonstrate how all of those things will drive long-term value not only for our customers and patients they serve but also for our employees and our shareholders.
Moving on to Slide 21. I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we're extremely pleased with our first fiscal year as the new BD. We believe that we have demonstrated that we can successfully execute on the integration of the largest transaction in the company's history.  Second, the diversity of our portfolio from a product and geographic perspective provides consistent and reliable earnings growth. Third, we continue to invest in key strategic areas and, at the same time, deliver significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. 
We're looking forward to sharing more details about our pipeline at our Analyst Day in 2 weeks. We believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history, and we look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence.
Finally, I would like to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for our successful first full fiscal year as a combined company with CareFusion. It's a testament to the hard work of all of our employees that we delivered on our commitments. I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to create a true industry leader as we continue to advance the world of health. 
So with that, thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

And so maybe just focusing a bit on the more challenged businesses first. Can you just talk a little bit about some of the headwinds that you saw, particularly internationally in the Life Sciences business this quarter, this year and how you think about some of those end markets in FY '17? And then if you think about that in aggregate, that 4.5% to 5% revenue growth target for FY '17, what gets you to the higher end of that range?"

Sure, happy to do that. I feel good about the 4.5% to 5%.

And let me walk through the markets, and I'll hit the Bioscience issue which you brought up, which was really the real drag along with, quite frankly, the flu early on in the year. So from a market perspective, let me just start with the developed markets. The developed markets certainly have stabilized, and you've seen that -- our growth rate going up in the developed markets and the U.S. The U.S. was very strong. By the way, including Biosciences, Europe was good, Japan was good. So we feel good about our position in developed markets and the product pipeline we have for those marketplaces. If I come to emerging markets, the issue really this year was, number one, Saudi Arabia, where we saw the government do a 35% cut of all types of expenses, not just health care. And that will annualize during the year. We already saw a stabilization in Saudi Arabia. In terms of Africa, Africa was basically CD4 testing. And CD4 testing was driven by, one, some conversion to viral load; and two, actually, confusion over a change in the purchasing organization for CD4 and viral load. And we think we have one more quarter of that. We did start to see some CD4 orders coming in the fourth quarter and a little bit of a rebound. But we know we have that in the first quarter and then that annualizes and improves. Coming back to opportunities. On China, you saw the strong growth in China in the fourth quarter. If you actually go back and look at China after the first quarter, where we had some inventory take-down, China was strong for the other 3 quarters. We expect that to continue. It was especially strong this year on the Medical side of the business, and we think we're well positioned with the work that Tom and the regulatory team have been doing with the CareFusion product lines there. And as I've mentioned on previous calls, we've started with some of those product lines, kind of the simpler disposables, and I'm sure Tom will talk more about that later on in the call. If there was any softness in China this year from a true demand standpoint, it was on the Life Science side, and it was related to those anticorruption campaign. What we saw was stabilization starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. And Alberto can mention to you he's starting to get ramped up the Bruker deal in China as well, which was a whole new thing for us. We had to learn how to do that and work our way through some submissions. So we feel good about China. The rest of Asia has been good. Latin America has performed well this year. In spite of all those issues in Brazil, it's been the rest of the geography has done fine. Coming back to the 4.5% to 5%. Then the other element that you have to think about is 2 other things. One is we will not have respiratory anymore, and that has been a bit of a headwind for the company. And then we think, in the back half of the year, you'll start to see more traction with our product launches. Things like Barricor, they have to do the validation first, so that takes a little while to get going. Customer feedback has been excellent. Alberto can talk about the product launches that you heard for BD MAX. Those are really critical assays to that program. We're excited about them. And so there's a whole list of these things, and we'll show you more about that as we do the Analyst Day. So that's the way we're thinking about it."

But once we get through that with the new product launches that we're seeing, the strength of the rest of the business, we feel real good about our prospects for '17."

As we mentioned on the last call, the tax synergies coming from CareFusion happened faster and greater than we ever expected, and so we're seeing the benefit of that. So as we look out into next year, we see that bringing us to the high teens. Then we've got the benefit of the stock comp accounting adjustment that brings us down to the 17% to 19% range. So this move down is part of the march down in the tax rate that we've been seeing, coupled with the benefits that we're getting from the synergies from CareFusion. And so we really feel good about that. We've also closed out a lot of tax exams in multiple jurisdictions. We're part of the IRS' CAP program, so they're auditing us on a real-time basis.

I think you're seeing the results of that work come to fruition now with faster installations, getting those systems in. We now have over 1,100 sites live on ES or about 1/3 of our installed base is now upgraded to the ES platform. And the receptivity is very solid, and we extract -- expect strong demand on that going forward. Alaris, we continue to gain about 2 to 3 points of category share this past year in FY '16, and we're looking at kind of a similar progress outlook for FY '17 as well. And so we certainly do have organizations that are cross-selling those as an integrated offering.

So as we think about the use of that cash flow, we'll probably do something on the dividend rate. You know that the payout ratio has come down a little bit. We increased 10% a year for the last couple of years. The good news is our EPS is going up over 20%. So the payout ratio has come down a little bit, and we will have to address that going forward. I think CapEx, as you think about it, will be in the $700 million range. That's pretty consistent with where it has been. So that leaves a lot of cash left over. We'll allocate some of that to tuck-in acquisitions, and that will still leave a lot of cash left over. And we're not going to let that cash build up on the balance sheet. So we'll return to doing some share buybacks. You'll hear more about that at Analyst Day. And certainly, as we approach the March period of getting to the 3x leverage, we'll be giving a little bit more specificity on where we're going.

It's a significant milestone for us to hit that 53% to 54%. We do see a little bit of -- more synergies coming because as we execute on the synergies that affect gross profit and cost of goods sold, which we said would come towards the latter end of our synergies, and that is the way that's playing out, but, again, continued -- continuous improvement in that area. So we feel really good about the gross profit margin. Also, that flows down to the operating margin. So as we mentioned, this year, 200 basis points; last year, 100 basis points; next year, in that 200 basis points kind of range, 500 basis points in total, again, driven both from execution of the synergies as well as continuous improvement initiatives.

So that share gain that we saw this year is actually relatively consistent with share trajectory that we've seen over the last, let's call it, 4 to 5 years within the Alaris platform. I think what customers certainly value in the platform around the power of, one, the ability to do not just large volume but also syringe-based and narcotic infusions off the same platform as well as its leading interoperability position with electronic medical records, are some of the key reasons why people have been choosing it at a higher rate and continue to do so going forward. Again, we do have some new technologies being added to the platform, which we'll share also at the upcoming Analyst Meeting. So we're very positive on the outlook there. And as we think about IV solutions, as we've mentioned before that you're going to see, I would expect, a rolling series of approvals on that platform. This is the first -- of course, there's a number of different formulations of IV solutions as well as bag sizes when you think about building out a portfolio that customers really need to run their institution. And so what you just saw get approved was the first in a series of products, and we would expect additional products to be coming out over the months ahead.

The pricing environment, as Vince said, hasn't really changed. And so then, I think the next part of your question came to the phasing of the revenue going forward. And as we said, we do see some headwinds continuing as we annualize the headwinds from Saudi and Africa. That will bring us down in the area of about 4% in the first quarter plus or minus 20 basis points, particularly as that's a high quarter for the flu. So it could go one way or the other on us. But then the ramp in the second quarter brings us back well within the range -- the high end of the range. And the ramping of new products we see in the second half of the year bring us back to a strong 4.5% to 5% range. So that feels real good. In terms of capital deployment, the share buybacks, we are committed to not buy back any shares other than what we've already done for respiratory, which we've talked about. But we're not looking to do anything until we get to the 3x leverage. We want to hit that commitment that we had, and that brings us through March, so halfway through the year. And then from that point on, you're right, there could be some -- but you don't get the full year impact of that at that point, so more to come on that.

It was fun doing this 5 years ago, so I'm looking forward to it. And then we're going to take that and we're -- and Chris is going to kind of give you a financial model of how this all holds together. And lastly, we're going to talk about the capabilities that it's going to require to do all this. And we're going to show you how we built the capabilities foundationally over the last 5 years and then how we build upon them. Tom mentioned informatics for example, but we'll also get into how we approach emerging markets, what's different about our strategy and why we see that continuing to work and some of the other capabilities that we will be bringing to bear, which all is an extension of the work we've done over the 5 years.

Strongest conversion rates we see in infusion therapy and blood collection, a little bit lagging in injection.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth fiscal quarter results. As we referenced in our press release, we are presenting a set of slides to accompany our remarks on this call. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at bd.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, and it is possible that actual results could differ from our expectations. Factors that could cause such differences appear in our fourth fiscal quarter press release and in the MD&A sections of our recent SEC filings. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial schedules and in the slides. A copy of the release, including the financial schedules, is posted on the bd.com website.
As a reminder, we annualized the acquisition of CareFusion in March, and as such, our fourth quarter results reflect the new BD in both the current and prior year periods. In addition, comparable prior year revenues are adjusted to exclude the sales related to the terminated agreement with CareFusion for the sale of F&P's respiratory care products. The impact to the bottom line is not material. Comparable organic revenues are adjusted to further exclude the impact of non-annualized acquisitions and closed divestitures. The fiscal 2017 comparable revenue guidance provided today will exclude revenues of closed divestitures, most notably the Respiratory Solutions business that was divested in October of 2016 just after our fiscal year-end. 
In the fourth quarter, the company recorded a noncash impairment charge for capitalized internal-use IT software assets. This charge, along with the details of the purchase accounting and other smaller adjustments and the comparable basis revenue results, can be found in the reconciliations to GAAP measures in the financial schedules, in our press release or the appendix of Investor Relations slides.
Leading the call this morning is Vince Forlenza, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Also joining us are Chris Reidy, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer; Tom Polen, Executive Vice President and President of the Medical Segment; and Alberto Mas, Executive Vice President and President of the Life Sciences segment.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Vince."

In the words of Brian Weinstein, go Cubs. 
Moving on to my presentation. As we stated in our press release, we are extremely proud of our accomplishments in our first full fiscal year as the new BD. As you already know, the acquisition of CareFusion 18 months ago significantly accelerated our strategy, and the powerful combination of BD and CareFusion continues to deliver positive results. We've seen significant benefits as a result of this transaction from a customer, employee and shareholder standpoint, and we think there's more to come. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal year 2016. First, our results reflect our consistent performance and the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio. Legacy BD remains solid, and the CareFusion portfolio has performed in line with our expectations. 
Second, emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver for the company. We experienced some headwinds this year, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, but remain confident that emerging markets are well positioned for continued growth. We also continue to create new growth opportunities for CareFusion products in these markets and expand their global reach by leveraging BD's international infrastructure. We're on track with our new product approval and submission plans and look forward to providing more color at our Analyst Meeting later this month. Developed markets continued to show stabilization, and growth has accelerated over the past year. 
Third, we made key strategic decisions to optimize our portfolio. This included the divestitures of BD Rx and the spine business in conjunction with the joint venture for the respiratory business, which we just completed in October. These actions further enabled the organization to prioritize and invest in the most important opportunities for future growth. We were deliberate in increasing our R&D investment in targeted high-growth areas and fully utilized the benefit of the medical device tax suspension.
Fourth, we remain focused on our operating effectiveness and efficiency initiatives, which have generated significant margin expansion. This year, we drove approximately 200 basis points of underlying margin expansion, which includes approximately $120 million in cost synergies. We also delivered robust earnings growth of almost 30%, which is greater than our initial expectations.
Lastly, we closed our first full year as the new BD having achieved all important milestones and also demonstrated that we are successfully executing on our acquisition of CareFusion. As we look forward, we continue to build on our solid foundation and look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence. 
Moving to Slide 5. You will see the guidance for fiscal year 2017 on a currency-neutral basis. For the fiscal year 2017, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% based on our current view of the environment and various macroeconomic factors. There are a number of items that could bring us to the top or bottom end of that range, including a stronger or weaker flu season than expected, the performance of new product launches, emerging market growth and pricing. On the bottom line, we will continue to deliver high-quality earnings growth. For fiscal year 2017, we expect EPS of $9.45 to $9.55 or $9.62 to $9.72 currency neutral, which reflects growth of 12% to 13%.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris, who will walk you through our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year, along with the additional details about our fiscal year 2017 guidance."
103678,403765314,1073676,"Becton, Dickinson and Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Becton, Dickinson and Company","Executives","Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7. I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of approx",2259,"Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to Slide 7. I'd like to begin by discussing our fourth quarter revenue and EPS results as well as the key financial highlights for the quarter and the total year. Total fourth quarter revenues of approximately $3.2 billion grew 6.4% on a comparable basis. Fully diluted adjusted EPS came in ahead of our expectations at $2.12, growing at 16.5% over the prior year. 
As Vince mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our solid finish to the year, the first full year as a combined entity with CareFusion. For the total year, revenues grew 4.3%. We significantly expanded our margins and captured approximately $120 million in synergy cost savings. Adjusted EPS of $8.59 exceeded our expectations, driven by solid revenues, margin expansion and an improved tax rate. In addition to the cost synergies, tax synergies have materialized sooner and have exceeded the benefits we anticipated in the early days of the transaction. We are also pleased to announce that we have continued to delever as we reduced the debt associated with the acquisition of CareFusion. We are currently at 3.3x gross leverage and remain on track to achieve our commitment of 3x gross leverage by March of 2017.
On Slide 8, I'll review our revenue growth by segment on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenue growth was 6.4% for the total company. In the quarter, pricing was about flat. BD Medical fourth quarter revenues increased 7.9%. Medication and Procedural Solutions growth was 6.6%, which reflects strength in flush, ChloraPrep and safety-engineered products. Revenues in Medication Management Solutions or MMS grew 12.8%. This was driven by double-digit growth in both dispensing and infusion sales.  
Respiratory Solution revenues increased 12.7%, as expected. This reflects strong capital installations and a favorable comparison to the prior-year period.
Growth in Diabetes Care was 3.6%. This reflects solid growth in pen needles, which was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period. Pharmaceutical Systems growth of 5.1% reflects strength in our self-injection platform. For the total year, BD Medical grew 4.7%. 
BD Life Sciences fourth quarter revenues increased 2.7%, primarily driven by growth in Preanalytical Systems and Biosciences. Diagnostic System revenues were about flat compared to the prior year. This reflects continued strength in core microbiology and BD MAX, which grew double digits in the quarter. This growth was offset by the timing of KIESTRA installations outside of the U.S., which I'll speak to in just a moment. For the total year, we are extremely pleased with our microbiology business, with KIESTRA growing at about 19%.
Preanalytical Systems growth of 4% was driven by safety-engineered products and growth in the U.S. and emerging markets. BD Biosciences growth of 4% was driven by continued strong research instrument placements in the U.S. and reagent sales. For the total year, Life Sciences grew 3.4%. The headwinds we experienced in Africa negatively impacted segment results by 60 basis points, bringing underlying growth to 4% for the total year.  
Moving to Slide 9. I'll walk you through our geographic revenues for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. growth was very strong at 7.2%. This was comprised of BD Medical growing at 7.7% and BD Life Sciences growing at 5.8%. BD Medical's performance reflects strong growth in capital placements and a wide range of infusion disposable products in our Medication and Procedural Solutions business. Growth was also driven by our Pharmaceutical Systems business. 
BD Life Sciences growth reflects strong performance across the segment in the U.S. The growth in our Biosciences business was driven by high-parameter research instruments, including FACSSymphony, our FACSCelesta mid-level analyzer and the launch of the FACSMelody. Our U.S. Diagnostics business saw continued growth in microbiology, including KIESTRA and the BD MAX molecular platform. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 5%, driven by safety-engineered products.
Moving on to international. Revenues grew 5.2%. This is below our normal growth rate, which is primarily related to the Life Sciences segment. The Medical segment grew 8.2%. This was driven by strong performance from infusion disposal products in the MPS business and strong performance in China. Growth was also driven by medication management, reflecting double-digit growth in both dispensing and infusion.
Growth in the Life Science segment was about flat compared to the prior year. We experienced a decline in Diagnostic Systems due to the timing of KIESTRA installations. Increased installations in the third fiscal quarter negatively impacted the fourth fiscal quarter in conjunction with the tough comparison to the prior year fourth quarter. Biosciences growth was lower in the quarter due to continued declines in Africa, as we anticipated. The Preanalytical Systems business grew 2.9%, driven by strength in China, which was partially offset by a tough comparison to the prior year period.
On Slide 10, developed markets grew a healthy 5.8%, bringing the total year growth to 4.1%. Emerging market revenues grew 8.5% currency neutral, bringing our year-to-date growth rate to 5.3%. China growth for the fourth quarter was 17.7%, bringing the total year growth rate to 10.1%. Growth in emerging markets this fiscal year was lower than initially expected in the Middle East and Africa, and we believe those challenges are largely behind us after we exit the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Emerging markets remain an important growth driver, and given our robust international footprint, we are well positioned to drive growth well into the future.
Looking into fiscal year 2017. We expect emerging markets to grow high single digits, driven by a diversified base, with China growing low double digits, continued strength in Latin America and fewer headwinds in EMA and Africa. In terms of developed markets, we believe the stability we have seen in the market over the past 12 to 18 months will continue, yielding a growth rate of about 4%.
Moving to global safety on Slide 11. Currency-neutral sales increased 5.9% and grew to $783 million in the quarter. Safety revenues in the U.S. grew 5.7%. This reflects continued strength of safety catheters as well as a benefit from the timing of orders across our hypodermic products.
International sales grew 6.2% currency neutral. International performance in the Medical segment was driven by the continued strength in China, and safety revenues grew 13.8% in emerging markets.
Medical safety sales grew 7%, driven by infusion disposables, catheters and a range of safety-engineered products. Life Sciences safety sales, which were driven by our Preanalytical Systems unit, grew 4% in the quarter.
Slide 12 recaps the fourth quarter income statement and highlights our currency-neutral results. Revenues grew a strong 6.4% in the quarter. Gross profit was strong, growing faster than revenues, at 7.9%. And I'll provide more details on gross profit in just a moment. 
SSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.4%. We are very pleased with the leverage we are getting, which is masked in this quarter by key strategic investments in product launches in both segments. R&D as a percentage of revenues was 7.8%, which is higher than normal due to the timing of spend as anticipated. As a result of the medical device tax suspension, we were able to make additional investments in a number of high-growth areas. After normalizing for this significant additional investment in R&D, underlying operating income would have grown about 10% in the quarter.
Our tax rate declined to 16.2% in the quarter due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, tax synergies materializing earlier than expected and continued favorable geographic mix. In the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $2.12, which is a 16.5% increase versus the prior year.
Turning to Slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the fourth quarter. On a performance basis, gross profit margin improved by 90 basis points, driven by continuous improvement initiatives. This was more than offset by significant currency headwinds of 110 basis points. On an operating margin basis, we are extremely pleased to have delivered about 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion. As I mentioned on the previous slide, the leverage we are getting in SSG&A as we continue to drive cost synergies is being masked in the quarter by investments in key product launches. In addition, margin expansion was partially offset by significant R&D investments, as expected, and unfavorable currency. 
I'd like to take a moment on Slide 14 to highlight some of our key operational achievements for fiscal year 2016. The acquisition of CareFusion provided BD a unique opportunity to leverage the transaction to optimize the combined organization through functional transformations, and we have made significant progress in this area. All of our efforts have yielded results, and we are on track to deliver continued synergies. In aggregate, we have achieved over $170 million in total cost synergies to date. 
We have also driven significant margin expansion on a multiyear trajectory. Starting with fiscal year 2015, we delivered 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. This year, we achieved another 200 basis points, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver another 175 to 225 basis points in fiscal year 2017. Over those 3 years, we will have driven over 500 basis points of cumulative margin expansion, and I believe that we continue to drive robust performance with additional synergies in conjunction with continuous improvement going forward. We're extremely proud of the organization's ability to continue improving on our skills and expertise by executing against our synergy commitment initiatives through these transformations.
Moving on to Slide 15. I'd like to highlight our robust EPS growth, which exceeded our expectations this year. Starting with 2015 EPS of $7.16, we had communicated last November that we would grow EPS 22% to 23% on a currency-neutral basis. Beyond our initial expectations, we delivered an incremental 400 basis points from margin improvement. We also realized incremental benefits from our tax rate improvement, which yielded 300 basis points, bringing EPS to $9.24. Unfavorable currency headwinds impacted earnings per share by 900 basis points. Despite that significant headwind, we were still able to deliver $8.59 of earnings. On a currency-neutral basis, earnings grew 29.1%, which we believe demonstrates our ability to deliver on our commitment.
Moving on to Slide 17. There are a number of factors to consider when discussing our earnings per share in fiscal year 2017. For modeling purposes and to ensure consistency, I'd like to provide more color on our EPS guidance. First, as I mentioned, we are extremely pleased with strong EPS growth this year. Looking forward, we expect currency-neutral EPS to grow between 12% and 13%. This is partially muted by the impact of the respiratory JV, as we previously communicated. Pension also presents a headwind next year of approximately 100 basis points. 
Contributing to EPS growth is approximately 200 basis points from the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the tax accounting on our stock compensation programs. In addition, we estimate that currency will once again present a headwind. Our guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.10. On an adjusted basis, we expect to achieve very strong earnings of $9.45 to $9.55.
Turning to Slide 18. I'd like to walk you through the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2017. As Vince mentioned earlier in the presentation, we expect revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%, with BD Medical growing 4.5% to 5% and Life Sciences growing between 4% to 5%. Growth in both segments contemplates a small amount of pricing pressure. 
From a phasing perspective, we expect currency-neutral revenue growth in the first quarter to be below this range. This is primarily due to some lingering softness in the EMA region and the timing of tenders in our Biosciences business. This will result in a currency-neutral revenue growth of about 4% in the first fiscal quarter. We expect revenue growth to return back to our guidance range in the second fiscal quarter, with continued acceleration over the back half of the year. We expect gross profit margin to be between 53% and 54%, which is a significant milestone for BD.
SSG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 23.5% and 24%. Our guidance also reflects continued investments in emerging markets as well as costs related to new product launches and registration costs. We expect our R&D investments to be in line with fiscal year 2016 at about 6% to 6.5% of revenues as we continue to invest in new products and platforms. 
As a result of the items I just detailed, operating margin is expected to be between 23% and 24% of revenues, up from 20.8% this year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve by 175 to 225 basis points. This also excludes slight pension headwinds.
We expect our tax rate to be between 17% and 19%, driven by tax synergies, favorable geographic mix and a benefit from accounting change in our stock compensation program. For fiscal year 2017, we anticipate our average fully diluted share count to be approximately 219 million. Cash flow is expected to remain strong, with operating cash flow of about $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $700 million. 
In summary, we have good momentum exiting this fiscal year, and looking forward into 2017, we are building off a solid foundation. I'm confident that fiscal year 2017 will be another strong year of performance, positioning us well for continued success. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince, who'll provide you with our concluding remarks."

We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on our pipeline and believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history. We have recently obtained a number of approvals. I'll touch on just a few. 
On the Medical side of the business, we are pleased that our partner, Fresenius, received their first FDA approval for IV solution products. Additional approvals are expected, and we are on track to start shipping these products late in the first half of the year. Last quarter, we received our first orders for FlowSmart, our new insulin infusion set, where Medtronic serves as our distribution partner. Early patient feedback has been extremely positive. 
On the life side -- Life Science side of the business, we're pleased that the FDA has approved the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and also the GC/CT/TV assay. We launched our new Phoenix IDAST instrument. We launched the FACSMelody and received approval for Barricor in the U.S. We plan to share more about our pipeline on November 17 at our upcoming Analyst Day.
Also on Analyst Day, we will discuss the company's strategy and vision for the future and how we are helping to address health care's most pressing challenges. The segment leaders will do a deep dive into our business units, which will include some key product launches that we will be unveiling for the first time. We will conclude the day with a financial framework that will outline our plans for sustainable revenue growth, continued margin expansion, strong cash flow generation and capital deployment and, ultimately, demonstrate how all of those things will drive long-term value not only for our customers and patients they serve but also for our employees and our shareholders.
Moving on to Slide 21. I would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today. First, we're extremely pleased with our first fiscal year as the new BD. We believe that we have demonstrated that we can successfully execute on the integration of the largest transaction in the company's history.  Second, the diversity of our portfolio from a product and geographic perspective provides consistent and reliable earnings growth. Third, we continue to invest in key strategic areas and, at the same time, deliver significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. 
We're looking forward to sharing more details about our pipeline at our Analyst Day in 2 weeks. We believe we have the most robust pipeline in the company's history, and we look to fiscal year 2017 and beyond with confidence.
Finally, I would like to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for our successful first full fiscal year as a combined company with CareFusion. It's a testament to the hard work of all of our employees that we delivered on our commitments. I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to create a true industry leader as we continue to advance the world of health. 
So with that, thank you. We will now open the call to questions."

And some of the businesses, as I look over the quarter and the full year '16, did a little bit better. Some businesses were a bit more challenged. And so maybe just focusing a bit on the more challenged businesses first. Can you just talk a little bit about some of the headwinds that you saw, particularly internationally in the Life Sciences business this quarter, this year and how you think about some of those end markets in FY '17? And then if you think about that in aggregate, that 4.5% to 5% revenue growth target for FY '17, what gets you to the higher end of that range?"

Sure, happy to do that. I feel good about the 4.5% to 5%. And let me walk through the markets, and I'll hit the Bioscience issue which you brought up, which was really the real drag along with, quite frankly, the flu early on in the year. So fr",638,"Yes, Mike. Sure, happy to do that. I feel good about the 4.5% to 5%. And let me walk through the markets, and I'll hit the Bioscience issue which you brought up, which was really the real drag along with, quite frankly, the flu early on in the year. So from a market perspective, let me just start with the developed markets. The developed markets certainly have stabilized, and you've seen that -- our growth rate going up in the developed markets and the U.S. The U.S. was very strong. By the way, including Biosciences, Europe was good, Japan was good. So we feel good about our position in developed markets and the product pipeline we have for those marketplaces. If I come to emerging markets, the issue really this year was, number one, Saudi Arabia, where we saw the government do a 35% cut of all types of expenses, not just health care. And that will annualize during the year. We already saw a stabilization in Saudi Arabia. In terms of Africa, Africa was basically CD4 testing. And CD4 testing was driven by, one, some conversion to viral load; and two, actually, confusion over a change in the purchasing organization for CD4 and viral load. And we think we have one more quarter of that. We did start to see some CD4 orders coming in the fourth quarter and a little bit of a rebound. But we know we have that in the first quarter and then that annualizes and improves. Coming back to opportunities. On China, you saw the strong growth in China in the fourth quarter. If you actually go back and look at China after the first quarter, where we had some inventory take-down, China was strong for the other 3 quarters. We expect that to continue. It was especially strong this year on the Medical side of the business, and we think we're well positioned with the work that Tom and the regulatory team have been doing with the CareFusion product lines there. And as I've mentioned on previous calls, we've started with some of those product lines, kind of the simpler disposables, and I'm sure Tom will talk more about that later on in the call. If there was any softness in China this year from a true demand standpoint, it was on the Life Science side, and it was related to those anticorruption campaign. What we saw was stabilization starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter. And Alberto can mention to you he's starting to get ramped up the Bruker deal in China as well, which was a whole new thing for us. We had to learn how to do that and work our way through some submissions. So we feel good about China. The rest of Asia has been good. Latin America has performed well this year. In spite of all those issues in Brazil, it's been the rest of the geography has done fine. Coming back to the 4.5% to 5%. Then the other element that you have to think about is 2 other things. One is we will not have respiratory anymore, and that has been a bit of a headwind for the company. And then we think, in the back half of the year, you'll start to see more traction with our product launches. Things like Barricor, they have to do the validation first, so that takes a little while to get going. Customer feedback has been excellent.

We see those headwinds abating after the first quarter because they really came up in the second quarter -- second, third and fourth of this year.

But once we get through that with the new product launches that we're seeing, the strength of the rest of the business, we feel real good about our prospects for '17."

As we mentioned on the last call, the tax synergies coming from CareFusion happened faster and greater than we ever expected, and so we're seeing the benefit of that. So as we look out into next year, we see that bringing us to the high teens. Then we've got the benefit of the stock comp accounting adjustment that brings us down to the 17% to 19% range. So this move down is part of the march down in the tax rate that we've been seeing, coupled with the benefits that we're getting from the synergies from CareFusion. And so we really feel good about that. We've also closed out a lot of tax exams in multiple jurisdictions. We're part of the IRS' CAP program, so they're auditing us on a real-time basis.

We now have over 1,100 sites live on ES or about 1/3 of our installed base is now upgraded to the ES platform. And the receptivity is very solid, and we extract -- expect strong demand on that going forward. Alaris, we continue to gain about 2 to 3 points of category share this past year in FY '16, and we're looking at kind of a similar progress outlook for FY '17 as well. And so we certainly do have organizations that are cross-selling those as an integrated offering.

So as we think about the use of that cash flow, we'll probably do something on the dividend rate. You know that the payout ratio has come down a little bit. We increased 10% a year for the last couple of years. The good news is our EPS is going up over 20%. So the payout ratio has come down a little bit, and we will have to address that going forward. I think CapEx, as you think about it, will be in the $700 million range. That's pretty consistent with where it has been. So that leaves a lot of cash left over. We'll allocate some of that to tuck-in acquisitions, and that will still leave a lot of cash left over. And we're not going to let that cash build up on the balance sheet. So we'll return to doing some share buybacks. You'll hear more about that at Analyst Day. And certainly, as we approach the March period of getting to the 3x leverage, we'll be giving a little bit more specificity on where we're going.

It's a significant milestone for us to hit that 53% to 54%. We do see a little bit of -- more synergies coming because as we execute on the synergies that affect gross profit and cost of goods sold, which we said would come towards the latter end of our synergies, and that is the way that's playing out, but, again, continued -- continuous improvement in that area. So we feel really good about the gross profit margin. Also, that flows down to the operating margin. So as we mentioned, this year, 200 basis points; last year, 100 basis points; next year, in that 200 basis points kind of range, 500 basis points in total, again, driven both from execution of the synergies as well as continuous improvement initiatives.

So that share gain that we saw this year is actually relatively consistent with share trajectory that we've seen over the last, let's call it, 4 to 5 years within the Alaris platform. I think what customers certainly value in the platform around the power of, one, the ability to do not just large volume but also syringe-based and narcotic infusions off the same platform as well as its leading interoperability position with electronic medical records, are some of the key reasons why people have been choosing it at a higher rate and continue to do so going forward. Again, we do have some new technologies being added to the platform, which we'll share also at the upcoming Analyst Meeting. So we're very positive on the outlook there. And as we think about IV solutions, as we've mentioned before that you're going to see, I would expect, a rolling series of approvals on that platform. This is the first -- of course, there's a number of different formulations of IV solutions as well as bag sizes when you think about building out a portfolio that customers really need to run their institution. And so what you just saw get approved was the first in a series of products, and we would expect additional products to be coming out over the months ahead.

The pricing environment, as Vince said, hasn't really changed. And so then, I think the next part of your question came to the phasing of the revenue going forward. And as we said, we do see some headwinds continuing as we annualize the headwinds from Saudi and Africa. That will bring us down in the area of about 4% in the first quarter plus or minus 20 basis points, particularly as that's a high quarter for the flu. So it could go one way or the other on us. But then the ramp in the second quarter brings us back well within the range -- the high end of the range. And the ramping of new products we see in the second half of the year bring us back to a strong 4.5% to 5% range. So that feels real good. In terms of capital deployment, the share buybacks, we are committed to not buy back any shares other than what we've already done for respiratory, which we've talked about. But we're not looking to do anything until we get to the 3x leverage. We want to hit that commitment that we had, and that brings us through March, so halfway through the year. And then from that point on, you're right, there could be some -- but you don't get the full year impact of that at that point, so more to come on that.

It was fun doing this 5 years ago, so I'm looking forward to it. And then we're going to take that and we're -- and Chris is going to kind of give you a financial model of how this all holds together. And lastly, we're going to talk about the capabilities that it's going to require to do all this. And we're going to show you how we built the capabilities foundationally over the last 5 years and then how we build upon them. Tom mentioned informatics for example, but we'll also get into how we approach emerging markets, what's different about our strategy and why we see that continuing to work and some of the other capabilities that we will be bringing to bear, which all is an extension of the work we've done over the 5 years. So that's the kind of day, and look forward to seeing you there, Jon."

Just remind us where we are on the ongoing European conversion. And then secondly, the Life Sciences business, at least relative to Medical, has been a little less predictable, and we certainly appreciate all new product launches, both in-launch as well as near-term development.

It's a little weaker in the alternate settings. That's true in most markets where individual doctor compliance may be less than a large governed hospital setting. Strongest conversion rates we see in infusion therapy and blood collection, a little bit lagging in injection. That's also the exact same trend that we saw in the U.S. So still good growth prospects there, and we're in the middle innings. You also mentioned China. Overall in emerging markets, we see safety in the very early innings at less than 15% conversion, so still quite a ways to go."

We do expect that, that probably will expand to a broader full launch in early Q2. And that's well on track.
