After Mitchelle completes his segment, I will return with a few summary remarks before I give you an opportunity to ask questions. Except where noted otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results. A full reconciliation to our GAAP results is available in our 10-Q that was filed alongside our earnings release earlier this morning. Both documents are available on our website. 
Let me start with a high-level overview of our fourth quarter 2015 results the global business before I move on to discuss full year results and then performance of each of our regions. As we exited the year and I refer now to fourth quarter results specifically, I'm pleased to say we saw a sequential improvement versus the third quarter in our underlying sales performance. Net of withheld shipments to Venezuela, a topic I'll return to later, we saw sequential growth in constant dollars sales of 1%. This represented a modest reversal of the trend we've seen over the previous 3 quarters, despite sales performance being adversely affected by select of retailer inventory adjustments in Thailand and Malaysia. 
Structural changes made to our investment profile in China and the recent launch of our fully imported line of Enfa products helped us deliver on the promise we made in July. At that time, we said we expected to see sequential improvement in China sales as we exited the year. And in the fourth quarter, our China/Hong Kong business grew 2% sequentially over the third quarter. 
Our North America/Europe segment also grew sequentially by nearly 5% on a constant-dollar basis. 
Let me now address our full year results. 2015 was a challenging year for us. We were challenged by a strengthening dollar and the general weakness in many economies throughout Asia and Latin America. GDP growth across Asia and Latin America was lower than prior year and this affected both consumer and retailer confidence. Additionally, in China, we saw increased price-based competition and channel shifts that adversely impact sales growth and required us to boost investment to protect our competitiveness. 
In Southeast Asia, in particular, we saw a slowing economic growth in Thailand and Malaysia. Combined with some company-specific executional issues, this resulted in lower volumes through the year. 
In the Philippines, where GDP growth remain more robust, we saw relatively better performance and there, we are satisfied with the progress we made through the year. We continue to benefit from lower dairy costs and an improved gross margin as a consequence. This helped partially offset the EBIT and EPS impact of foreign exchange and lower sales. For full year 2015, constant dollar net sales were 2% below prior year, largely due to our challenges in China and Hong Kong. Gross sales, however, were in line with 2014. This shows continued solid demand for our branch though a challenging trading environment so as report sales below prior year level. 
The impact of a strengthening dollar was significant throughout the year reducing reported sales by about 6%, and earnings per share by $0.26. Where possible, we took price to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange. However, competitor strategies and abnormally low dairy costs made price increases more difficult than we've seen in recent years. Price consequently contributed 1% -- percentage point of growth for the full year. As we progress through the year, the carryover benefit of price increases taken in 2014 gradually disappeared and price promotional activity became more evident. Against the same quarter of prior year, this increased dynamic adversely affected fourth quarter gross by 1 percentage point. This was largely driven by increased trade promotional activity in China. 
Global volume was 3% lower than prior year, growth in North America and Europe didn't fully offset weaker performance in Asia and Latin America and the impact of our decision to slow shipments into Venezuela was also significant. Infant formula and product sales for 2015 were in line with prior year on a constant-dollar basis. It follows that we were relatively more challenged within our children's category outside of North America. The children's category is more price-sensitive and prior to reshaping our competitive starts in the third quarter, we suffer share losses due to competitors price commotion of activity. However, having addressed the price disadvantage as the cohort of infants age the consumer brand, this should help sales of our children's franchise going forward. We understand recovery of momentum in China and select other emerging markets could take time, and we need to probably fund key growth initiatives. As a consequence, the company invests -- as the company's advancement in advertising and promotion remain strong in the fourth quarter at 15.6% of sales. This was 190 basis points above prior year's fourth quarter level. 
To help fund these investments and offset the impact of foreign exchange, we accelerated the implementation of some of our operating expense reductions. We refer to this initiative as fuel for growth. As a direct result of this focus, our operating expenses came in approximately $20 million favorable versus the forecast that underpinned guidance issued in October. This favorability allowed us to offset the impact of unanticipated dollar strength in the final quarter of the year and still deliver earnings-per-share slightly above the high end of our guidance range. We delivered $0.78 in non-GAAP earnings per share for the final quarter of 2015. As mentioned, this was slightly better-than-expected and allowed us to finish 2015 with $3.44 in non-GAAP earnings per share. Even as we grapple with our adverse dynamics in many of our markets in 2015, I'm pleased that we avoided any temptation to fuel bank and investment. We know that continues innovation is critical to our long-term growth prospects. Here's some examples of new products we introduced around the world. In the United States, we introduced new and more convenient plastic packaging for our 32-ounce ready-to-feed liquid infant formula, building on the success of our 8-ounce launch a couple of years ago. We also responded quickly to competitive activity by introducing a new formulation of infant formula free from genetically-modified raw materials. Across North America, we became the first company to meet newly developed guidance for premature infant formula. And in China, we introduced a fully imported range of Enfa-branded products to complement our manufactured range. These fully imported products now account for 35% of our sales within the mainland. 
In Southeast Asia, we upgraded our formulations and added increased levels of DHA to our children's products. We also introduced plastics packaging in several countries, and we had a ready-to-drink versions to our lineup of Enfa products. In Latin America, we introduced liquid versions of our key infant formula products and in Mexico, I Enfagrow Toddler product. For our powdered products, we began the introduction of upgraded plastics packaging. 
Further, over more than 70 years, we worked diligently to develop clinical evidence in support of our specialty portfolio, predominantly on our new and allergy brand. Educating health care professionals about and its benefits allowed us to grow constant-dollar sales double digits in 2015. As I complete my comments on overall company performance and before I moved to discussing our reporting segments in more detail, I want to maintain that as promised, we executed and accelerated share repurchase program in the most recent quarter. This reflects our commitment to the creation of long-term shareholder value. Michele will be quivered to this topic later. Let me now briefly comment on the performance within each of our recording segment and I begin with Asia. 
Sequentially, Asia's sales were in line with third quarter with improvements in China, offset by lower sales in Thailand and Malaysia. For fourth quarter, constant dollar sales were 10% below the prior year quarter and full year sales compared unfavorably to 2014 by 8%. As mentioned, sequentially, we grew sales in China/Hong Kong by 2% from the third quarter of 2015. A more aggressive trading stance allowed as the stabilize sales of our locally manufactured product line. Though we've had to increase our investments we encourage the prices to consumers at appear to have stabilized in the fourth quarter. 
At the same time, demand for our recently introduced fully imported range continued to grow. As mentioned earlier, sales of this product range now accounts to 35% of our sales in Mainland China and a full 22% of our combined China/Hong Kong business. As we expand direct shipments of our fully imported product into Mainland China, we expect to see continued cannibalization of our Hong Kong business. Such channel ships may obscure underlying business process in the near term, but ultimately, should be favorable to the company overall as we build a stronger, more sustainable portfolio with greater reach inside Mainland China. 
As mentioned at our Investor Day in October, we are committed to make investments in support of our recent introductions. We're advancing digital marketing capabilities, expanding our channel coverage and strengthening our retail chain relationships through focused investments. Beyond the early sales success with our imported product range, as a further sign our strategy is working, we are seeing market share gains in baby stores. As you know, we've also focused on strengthening our presence in business to consumer e-commerce. This represents the fastest growing part of the e-commerce market in China. And the segment is growing as approximately 5x the rate of the rest of the e-commerce channel. In a sign of our commitment to strengthening our presence in web and app-based commerce, we recently signed joint business partnership agreements with [indiscernible], owner of leading e-commerce site, JD.com; and $0.10, owner of WeChat, the leading social app in China. Under these agreements, we agreed to cooperate by sharing and technology platforms to the mutual benefits of our separate businesses. These agreements recognize the expertise of each party, including Mead Johnson China, and we are thrilled to partner with such great companies. 
While our China business began to show progress, our businesses in Malaysia and Thailand experienced challenges as mentioned earlier. Both economies are going through a challenging time due to political uncertainty and weak commodity prices. As a result, both consumer and business confidence is reduced. However, despite this backdrop, I want to acknowledge that we have not executed, as well as expected in either country for much of 2015. Though we cannot control economic trends, we can and will, control our execution, and we are taking steps to improve performance going forward. In the meantime, we continue to manage trade inventory bills carefully in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, we enhanced our products in Thailand with increased levels of DHA and introduce new packaging, including a plastic top. Early signs are encouraging with share increasing in the 3 months following our relaunch. However, it took longer than expected to defeat old inventory in the trade and consequently we chose to address this more aggressively in the most recent quarter. Having discussed some areas of relative challenge, let me now point to our relatively stronger performance in the Philippines. The Philippines business has delivered solid growth over the past 2 years. We've managed to offset foreign exchange impacts with improved pricing, and we've successfully expanded our that some children's brand into the infant formula category. This move gives us exposure to a growing economy beyond traditional premium price position. 
Turning now to Latin America. The region delivered constant-dollar sales growth of 3% for the full year cup period to 2014. Regional currencies weakened substantially through 2015, with large adverse impacts on sales growth in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico. As a consequence, reported sales was 13% below prior year level. For the fourth quarter, excluding Venezuela to where we post shipments for much of the quarter, sales grew 5% on a our constant dollar basis over the same quarter of prior year. Including Venezuela, the region sales for fourth quarter '15 were 4% lower in constant dollars than the same quarter in 2014. 
As you can tell, our decision to pause shipments to Venezuela was a significant driver of relatively weaker segment performance. As stated in previous calls, we are carefully managing risk associated with our intercompany payables within defined parameters. In the near term, this means matching new shipments to Venezuela to hard currency payments receipt. We are actually working with the Venezuelan government to address this challenge in order that in order that we can once again help provide much needed nutrition to children in that country. 
Looking at the overall economy of Latin America, over the past decade, these commodity-driven economies benefited substantially from stronger prices. Since the collapse in commodity prices, Latin America's GDP growth has slowed dramatically. Countries beyond the obvious example of Brazil that's in the recession are grappling with sharp reductions in their growth rates for the first time since 2009. These macroeconomic conditions, coupled with a strengthening dollar resulted in sharp depreciation of local currencies. I'd like to provide a little more detail in today's discussion. And for that purpose, I'll group the region into 3 sessions. I've excluded Venezuela which I've discussed separately already. 
I'll now discuss Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America as a distinct area from the southern cone area of Brazil and Argentina. And finally, touch briefly on the Andean region, in which we include Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. In Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America, the Enfa family of premium products grew strongly in constant dollars boasts sequentially over the third quarter and in full year 2015, and now represents about 2/3 of sales within the area. Outside of Mexico, much of our business in this area is conducted in U.S. dollars. This helped partially offset the impact from a decline in the Mexican peso. That said, the Mexican business is our third largest business globally and many of you already know our Mexican portfolio augments our global Enfa branded products with 2 very strong local brands amid modifiers, [indiscernible]. These 2 milk modifier brands gave us a leading-edge -- or a leading shared, I'm sorry, of the large Mexican modifier market. A large category that's, however, characterize by strong competition from global and local players. With limited potential to expand consumer penetration, competition is tough and occasionally price-based. These dynamics over the last several years of course our milk modifier brands to grow more slowly than our Enfa-branded infant and children's business. In 2015, milk modifiers net sales declined as we expanded trade discounts to protect our competitive position. This impacted the overall Mexico results adversely. Our performance in the South cone area was adversely impacted by the economic recession and currency weakness in Brazil. In Argentina price schemes more than covered the impact of currency depreciation. And across the area, we continue to grow our infant formula in toddler sales strongly in local currency. However, in Brazil, we also sell the Sustagen brand of milk modifiers. And in this category, we saw consumers moved to cheaper competitive offerings and we lost sales as a consequence. Within the Andean region, we saw Colombia delivered strong double-digit growth for both the latest quarter and the full year. The smaller market of Ecuador also performed well but these encouraging results were offset by challenging retail conditions in Peru. 
To wrap up, the key drivers for the Latin America full year results are volume, which was lower primarily from our intentional constraint of Venezuela shipments and Mexico the modifier sales reductions; price, that was predominantly from the high inflationary markets of Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela; and finally, foreign exchange that negatively impacted the region. 
I'll now turn to our performance in North America and Europe. In the full year 2015, the North America/Europe segment delivered 4% constant dollar revenue growth over 2014. Volume improved 1% with price and product mix contributing 3% to our annual growth rate. In the fourth quarter, this segment sales were in line with the prior year's quarter. Sequentially, as stated earlier, sales increased 5% over the third quarter. With little to no growth in the category in North America, our volume growth was realized through market share gains and our Enfagrow children's business continued double-digit growth. Our premium price specialty and solutions offerings also include double digits. 
And our Canadian business continued to execute extremely well and exited the year with record high-market shares. Europe posted its strongest sales and EBIT performance in the last 5 years, though the sales impact was partially offset by our exit from the Russian market earlier in the year. Overall, 2015 was another strong year for this segment. A year in which we saw profit margins expand to approach historic levels. In many ways, this was proof that our decision to maintain investment levels through the 2009 to 2012 economic downturn was the right one. 
Turning now to our outlook for 2016. Our outlook is broadly similar to that provided at our Investor Day in October. We expect constant-dollar sales to continue to show gradual improvement sequentially through the coming quarters. But due to tough comparisons from the first half of 2015, we do not expect to report positive revenue growth over same quarter of prior year till the second half of 2016. For this reason, we expect full year 2016 constant-dollar sales growth to be modest in the range of 0% to 2%. 
Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 600 basis points. As a result, reported sales may decrease by 4% to 6% this year. We now have a good fix on dairy costs, as this item will impact our profit and loss statement through the first 7 or 8 months of the year. Based on this year, we are comfortable saying that again in 2016, dairy prices would have a favorable impact on our cost of goods. At our Investor Day event last October, we characterized our 2016 as the year of transition. In the context of headwinds from a strengthening dollar, we committed to reduce non-demand-creating operating expenses by $60 million in order to reinvest in select growth initiatives and particular earnings growth. As headwinds from currencies have grown stronger since our October gathering, this initiative has become even more essential to our strategy, and I'm pleased to report, we're making good progress and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cost-reduction ambition. 
As mentioned in our press release this morning, I believe it's important for us to give you a better picture of the expected evolution and underlying profitability, without the polluting effect of currency impact. To this end, let me clarify that we expect to deliver 9% to 12% constant-dollar, non-GAAP earnings per share growth. And based on our assumption of power on foreign exchange, we expect therefore non-GAAP earnings per share when expressed in U.S. dollars to be in the range of $3.48 to $3.60. Not included in our estimates of 2016 as in additional benefits that might accrue from a review of efficiency and productivity opportunities within our demand-generating investments. Such overview is currently scheduled for mid-2016. I must point out that we remain highly focused on further strengthening on -- sorry, we remain highly exposed to the further strengthening of the dollar or selected weakening in foreign currencies. Anticipating that we may continue to see some variability in exchange rates through the year, we decided to provide to with a reconciliation to growth in non-GAAP constant dollar earnings per share. I'll now turn the call over to Michel who will provide some more details on our fourth quarter and full year financials. Michel will also elaborate on our guidance for 2016 and upon the completion of his prepared remarks, I'll return with some summary remarks before we open the lines to questions. Michel, over to you."

Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. I will then briefly highlight segment results and conclude with a summary of our 2016 guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my commen",2214,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. I will then briefly highlight segment results and conclude with a summary of our 2016 guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References a growth impact on the face of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars. 
Let me start with sales. Kasper addressed constant dollar sales growth. I will focus more on the foreign exchange impacts. As you can see, from Slide 3, fourth quarter sales on a reported basis were 12% below the prior year quarter. Adverse foreign exchange rates contributed to a decline of 6%, a similar rate to that seen in the third quarter. For the full year, sales on a reported basis were 8% below last year. The adverse foreign exchange impact on sales was 6%, or $229 million. On Slide 4, we have summarized the impact of foreign exchange or a quarter. The U.S. dollar continue to strengthen in the fourth quarter and its affect on translation of local currency negatively impact all reporting segments. Over 1/3 of the negative currency impact in the fourth quarter were from the Mexican peso and the Chinese renminbi. The balance of the foreign exchange impact was widespread especially from our large market by Canada and Malaysia and Thailand. We expect to see additional adverse foreign exchange impact in 2016 base on the continued strengthening of the across a very broad basket of currencies. I'll address this foreighn exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well. 
I will now move on to the factors that impacted our gross margin on Slide 5. Gross margin was 63.9% in the fourth quarter, up 200 basis points from the same quarter of 2014. Lower dairy costs fueled majority of the improvement. However, the benefit was cut in half but adverse foreign exchange impacts. Productivity improvements offset other commodity increases and higher manufacturing costs. In the last earnings call, we highlighted 3 factors that would result in a sequential gross margin decrease. That benefit from new price increase trade investment especially, China, and our annual U.S. plant shutdown. These factors came in as expected during the fourth quarter. 
On a full year basis, gross margin was 64.6%, which is due to 70 basis points improvement versus the prior year. Mainly due to lower dairy costs, which benefited all segments. Supply chain productivity delivered approximately 5% of savings in cost of goods sold, which mitigated other costs and as noted previously. 
Moving on to operating expenses on Slide #6. Our advertising and promotion spending was 15.6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 13.7% in the prior year quarter. This was an increase of 7% on a constant-dollar basis. A&P investment on the fourth quarter includes support for China's fully imported products media for the U.S. children business and support for new product launches like the 32-ounce liquid and non-GMO product line that Kasper described earlier. SG&A, on a constant dollar basis, was 6% or $14 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Savings were result of a lower incentive compensation and a reduction in corporate cost partly driven by our fuel for growth initiatives. SG&A, on a full year basis, were flat compared to 2014 on a constant-dollar basis. As you can see the from Slide 7, our cost-related research and development marketing decreased by 3% in 2015 versus 2014 on a constant-dollar basis. When comparing the second half year 2015 to the first half year 2015, the corporate support function decreased 8% mainly driven by the fuel for growth program. 
In the fourth quarter, we made the first wave of employee reductions. Compared to June, 2015, we reduced approximately 200 FTEs mainly within the corporate support functions where we reduced 18% of our headcount. 
We eliminated some outside services, initiated negotiations for key services. The headcount and outside sales' actions to take to date have allowed us to secure most of our $60 million fuel-for-growth target for 2016. We are very comfortable to deliver this year's savings. 
Turning now to Slide 8. On a constant-dollar basis, the fourth quarter EBIT was 3% below the prior year quarter and the full year EBIT was aligned with 2014. Including currency impact, EBIT was down 13% in the fourth quarter and down 7% for the full year. The EBIT margin as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was slightly lower than the prior year quarter as continued investments were not fully offset on a higher gross margin. EBIT margins percent of sales for the full year increased by 30 basis points. 
I will now discuss EBIT for each segment. Starting with Asia on Slide 9. In Q4, Asia delivered EBIT of $140 million, a decrease of 24% on a constant-dollar basis. On a reported basis, EBIT was 28% lower mainly due to impacts of the Chinese renminbi. The EBIT margin at 30% was lower than the fourth quarter 2014 and the third quarter '15. As we continued to invest especially in China, these investments included price promotions on the locally manufactured products to protect competitiveness. Along with AMP support for the fully imported product line introduced earlier this year. As custom mentioned Greater China sales imprint sequentially as a result of these investments. For the full year, the ESA EBIT margin at 32% remains the highest of our 3 segments. However, the EBIT margin was lower than in 2014 as lower sales and high-demand generation investments were not fully offset by the the dairy benefit. Latin America on Slide #10 delivered EBIT of $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 15% on a constant-dollar basis. On a reported basis, EBIT declined 26% as the region continued to have a large negative impact from currencies most notably, the Mexican peso. If we exclude the impact of Venezuela, where we contentiously reduced shipments, the segments reported EBITDA dollars for 2015 would have been in line with 2014 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. For the full year, Latin America EBIT margin improved slightly to 23.1%. Lower dairy costs more than offset the impact of the higher investments. 
Let me addressed North America and Europe on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, EBIT was $97 million, an increase of 14% on a constant dollar basis and 8% on a reported basis. In the midst of a type comparison, the gross margin continued to be strong. The team managed to maintain operating expense in line with the prior year quarter, while increase in AMP by 9% on a constant-currency basis. For the full year, the North America and European EBIT margin was 28%, benefiting primarily from gross margin. I will now address our financial results from EBIT to net results on Slides #12. The fourth quarter interest expense increased to approximately $22 million reflecting the issuance of the new $1.5 billion notes to finance the share repurchase programs. During our October earnings call, we announced a new share repurchase program of our $1.5 billion. Of the company's common stock, with $1 billion in the form an accelerated share repurchase or ASR. The ASR was executed after the close of business on that same date. Under the accelerated share repurchase program, 10.7 million shares of stock were delivered in the quarter. Following this portion of the ASR, the average number of shares in the fourth quarter were 189.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding shares were 186.4 million. It is expected that additional shares will be delivered in 2016 under the current ASR program. The ASR program was initially financed by a $1 billion term loan. Shortly thereafter, refinanced by the issuance notes, 7 of $50 million 5-year notes at a rate of 3% and $750 million 10-year notes at a rate of 4.125%. 
Taxes. For 2015, our non-GAAP effective tax rate or EPR was 24.8% compared to 22.5% in 2014. The 2014 rates was unusually low as a result of $0.05 per share nonrecurring tax benefit. Also, the 2015 EPR was also higher as a result of an a favorable change in geographic earnings mix. 
Let me briefly address our EPS on Slide 13. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.78, a decline of $0.14 versus the prior year quarter. Sales negatively impacted EPS by $0.16 offset by gross margin benefit. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EPS by $0.10. Full year non-GAAP EPS was $3.44, slightly above the high end of our guidance versus the prior year EPS declined by $0.30. The foreign-exchange alone negatively impacting EPS by $0.26. The sales decline impacted EPS by $0.26 as well. Gross margin benefit was offset by additional AMP investments to support our innovation especially our investments in China. 
Specified items. For 2015, specified items were $45 million or $0 17. The largest charge was $25 million. This occurred in the fourth quarter and was related to a restructuring provision fuel for growth productivity program. This was in line with our expectations we highlighted in our third quarter earnings call. Including the specified items, EPS on a non-GAAP basis was $3.27. 
Let me finish the 2015 discussion as a high-level overview of the cash flow and balance sheet. Despite the challenging operating environment, we generated strong cash flow, which further strengthened our balance sheet. As you can see, from Slide 14, free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures was $726 million due in 2015, up 20% from the prior year. For 2015, capital expenditures were $174 million consistent with our long-term goal of about 4% of sales. The most significant capital investments were to expand capacity at our European plant to support demand for the new China fully imported product line and in the U.S. to support new liquids manufacturing. Depreciation and amortization expenses was $99 million for the full year. For the full year 2015, we increased our dividends by 10% to $1.65 per share resulting in a total dividend payments of $326 million. The total payout ratio was close to 50% of our net results. Our cash balance, as of December 31, was $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million compared to December 2014. Nearly 90% of our cash is held outside the United States. Our net debt position as of December 31 was less than $1.3 billion. 
I will now wrap up with the summary of our 2016 guidance on a non-GAAP basis on Slide 15. We forecast constant-dollar sales in the range of 0% to 2% this year versus 2015. Assuming exchange rate remain at the current levels, this will translate to 2016 sales 4% to 6% below the prior year or reported basis. Please note that we expect positive sales comparison in the first half of 2016 versus 2015. This is due in part to a more favorable performance scene in China and especially in the first quarter of 2015. Constant-dollar sales in Q1 2016 are expected to be in line or slightly higher above the Q4 2015 performance. The company expects positive trend in the second half of 2016 on a constant-dollar basis. We expect higher investments in AMP in the first half of 2016. As a result, we expect the growth of non-GAAP EPS towards the second half of 2016. Please note that quarter 1 2016 non-GAAP EPS will have a tough comparison. From an EPS guidance perspective, there are several key factors to consider. We expect that our gross margins will be around 64%, similar to the fourth quarter 2015 level. We entered into dairy contracts at attractive prices to secure more than 80% of our expected 2016 dairy needs. Nearly all of the expected $60 million fuel for growth savings will be invested in demand-generating activities to enable long-term market share improvement. The benefits of all share repurchase in 2015, including the ASR program net of interest expense, is expected to be an $0.11 benefit per share. EPS guidance includes an annual estimated adverse impact of currency rates as of generated 2016, which is expected to be approximately $0.40 per share. Another 1% strengthening of the dollar against all currencies where we operate would lead to a further reduction EPS of about $0.04 per share. On a full year basis, just from translation. Taking all of this into account, non-GAAP EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $3.48 to $3.60, excluding specified items. On a constant dollar basis, non-GAAP EPS guidance expected to grow 9% to 12% this excludes $0.11 from the benefits of the share repurchase program in 2015. The company expects to incur charges of approximately $25 million to $30 million associated with the fuel for growth program in 2016. Specified items, including charges fuel for growth are expected to be approximately $0.12 per share. Therefor GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.36 to $3.48, excluding future costs related to market-to-market, pension adjustments, which are not reflected in the guidance. This concludes my discussion on our quarter 4 and full year 2015 financial results. Thanks again for your time this morning. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

Lets me briefly provide some summary remarks before we open the lines for your questions. I'm proud of many of the operational adjustments we made in the second half of 2015 when we were faced with significant change. Likewise, I feel good that our key strategies are paying off, much investment in the United States was made because we believe the profession of that market. Sales and margins have now rebounded and are helping us overcome challenges Likewise, our decision to reshape our portfolio in China and focus on new growing sales channels is showing signs of paying off. Faced with macroeconomic challenges, we are making adjustments in other markets to. Change is inevitable and in many ways, businesses should be just by how will the hedges and adapt, and I'm confident that we'll look back at the end of this year able to notice that we did this quite well. Through last year, I repeatedly pointed to 4 important factors that critically influence company's performance. To remind you all, I'm referring to currency movements, dairy cost evolution, our ability to evolve our strategy and portfolio in China and our momentum in North America particularly in the United States. All of these 4 variables remain as relevant in 2016 as they were to our performance in 2015, but I should add pricing to the list. Our ability to offset partially foreign-exchange weakness with price increases would be very important. I'd add that I see some encouraging signs at price increases will become easier as we move through the year. I'll close with message that we'll continue to provide the clear visibility on the impact of foreign exchange as we move through 2016. We'll do so by providing updates on both the sales and profit growth, net of foreign-exchange. In addition to our traditional non-GAAP earnings per share numbers, we hope you'll find this informative. Operators, I'd now like to open the lines to questions and because our prepared remarks have taken longer than anticipated, we're prepared to go a few minutes over if the questions doing so.

I think, we introduced the fully imported line of products into China sort of towards the back half really of the second quarter. And the fact that this product line is already making up 35% of our sales in the mainland and 22% of our sales in the combined China/Hong Kong business, I think, it's fairly impressive progress. I want to remind you also that of the message we gave on our Investor Day that we have confirmed our intention to enter the super-high premium category sometime in 2016. I'm sure you can understand that for competitive reasons, I'm not prepared to tell you what our plan timing is, but it goes without saying that we obviously have one. So I feel quite good about that. We now, if I add the Hong Kong business and our fully imported line together, we've now got more than half of our sales in the China/Hong Kong business coming out of our Netherlands facility. And therefore, meeting consumer desire for imported quality. So I think we're managing that transition quite well. I'm satisfied with the progress we're making in baby stores also. Through March of last year, we discussed the fact that we were under-indexing in baby stores, which is one of the faster growing sales channels. But as of late, we've seen some fairly satisfactory improvements to our market shares in the style. And I'm sure we'll continue to do so going forward."

I think, as you heard us talk about, we were quite some distance off managing to cover the impact of foreign-exchange weakness through price in 2015. So that will a be continued challenge or task for us as we go through 2016. As I was trying to indicate, I think, the pricing environment will become so much more friendly. What we saw in '15 was that there was still particularly, I would say, in Asia, there were still governments in Asia that were very resistant to price increases in our sector as they still focused very much on kind of inflationary pressure -- on perceived inflationary pressure, which we think we all know was really a threat that evaporated sometime in 2014. And they would repeatedly point to the fact that we were seeing significant upside from the dairy costs coming down as we discussed the price increases. I think now that the dairy prices have stabilized, I believe that as both us and our competitors lack the no dairy costs, it will become a little bit more straightforward to raise prices. But we obviously had to do that in a responsible manner. We have to assess that in the context of general price inflation and wage inflation in the markets we operate in."

I don't want to speculate on whether those regulatory adjustments will address all of the imbalances that we are seeing currently in China, but I believe that they will begin to address some of them. At the moment, it's clear that inadvertently, the China regulations have created a tilted playing field, but it's very much tilting in favor of imported products sold through e-commerce. I don't believe that, that was the intention of either the regulators or the China government at large and I think, they will find ways to address that. I also think that they remain concerned about the large number of smaller brands that have been created in China have that really led the expertise all the resources to guarantee consumer quality and I think, that will be addressed. So, I think, you're going to a whole slew attempt at least by regulators to get at some of these issues through this year.

So put another way, our marginal costs are very low in that business and hence, we see big swings in profitability as sales move up and down.

After Michel completes his segment, I will return with a few summary remarks before we give you an opportunity to ask questions. Except when noted otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results. A full reconciliation to our GAAP results is available in our 10-Q that was filed alongside our earnings release earlier this morning. Both documents are available on our website. 
Let me start with a high-level overview of our fourth quarter 2015 results for the global business before I move on to discuss full year results and then performance of each of our regions. As we exited the year, and I refer now to fourth quarter results specifically, I'm pleased to say we saw a sequential improvement versus the third quarter in our underlying sales performance. Net of withheld shipments to Venezuela, a topic I'll return to later, we saw a sequential growth in constant dollars sales of 1%. This represented a modest reversal of the trend we've seen over the previous 3 quarters, despite sales performance being adversely affected by selected retailer inventory adjustments in Thailand and Malaysia.
Structural changes made to our investment profile in China and the recent launch of our fully imported line of Enfa products helped us deliver on the promise we made in July. At that time, we said we expected to see sequential improvement in China sales as we exited the year. And in the fourth quarter, our China/Hong Kong business grew 2% sequentially over the third quarter. Our North America/Europe segment also grew sequentially by nearly 5% on a constant dollar basis. 
Let me now address our full year results. 2015 was a challenging year for us. We were challenged by a strengthening dollar and the general weakness in many economies throughout Asia and Latin America. GDP growth across Asia and Latin America was lower than prior year and this affected both consumer and retailer confidence. Additionally, in China, we saw increased price-based competition and channel shifts that adversely impacted sales growth and required us to boost investment to protect our competitiveness. 
In Southeast Asia, in particular, we saw slowing economic growth in Thailand and Malaysia. Combined with some company-specific executional issues, this resulted in lower volumes through the year. In the Philippines, where GDP growth remain more robust, we saw relatively better performance. And there, we are satisfied with the progress we made through the year. We continue to benefit from lower dairy costs and an improved gross margin as a consequence. This helped partially offset the EBIT and EPS impact of foreign exchange and lower sales.
For full year 2015, constant dollar net sales were 2% below prior year, largely due to our challenges in China and Hong Kong. Gross sales, however, were in line with 2014. This shows continued solid demand for our brands, though a challenging trading environment saw us report sales below prior year level. 
The impact of a strengthening dollar was significant throughout the year, reducing reported sales by about 6% and earnings per share by $0.26. Where possible, we took price to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange. However, competitor strategies and abnormally low dairy costs made price increases more difficult than we've seen in recent years.
Price consequently contributed 1% -- percentage point of growth to the full year. As we progress through the year, the carryover benefit of price increases taken in 2014 gradually disappeared and price promotional activity became more evident. Against the same quarter of prior year, this increased dynamic adversely affected fourth quarter gross by 1 percentage point. This was largely driven by increased trade promotional activity in China. Global volume was 3% lower than prior year, growth in North America and Europe didn't fully offset weaker performance in Asia and Latin America, and the impact of our decision to slow shipments into Venezuela was also significant.
Infant formula product sales for 2015 were in line with prior year on a constant dollar basis. It follows that we were relatively more challenged within our children's category outside of North America. The children's category is more price-sensitive and, prior to reshaping our competitive stance in the third quarter, we suffered share losses due to competitors' price promotional activity. However, having addressed the price disadvantage as the cohort of infants' age, that consumer brand, this should help sales of our children's franchise going forward.
We understand the recovery of momentum in China and select other emerging markets could take time, and we need to properly fund key growth initiatives. As a consequence, the company invests -- the company's investment in advertising and promotion remained strong in the fourth quarter at 15.6% of sales. This was 190 basis points above prior year's fourth quarter level. 
To help fund these investments and offset the impact of foreign exchange, we accelerated the implementation of some of our operating expense reductions. We refer to this initiative as Fuel for Growth. As a direct result of this focus, our operating expenses came in approximately $20 million favorable versus the forecast that underpinned guidance issued in October. This favorability allowed us to offset the impact of unanticipated dollar strength in the final quarter of the year and still delivered earnings-per-share slightly above the high end of our guidance range.
We delivered $0.78 in non-GAAP earnings per share for the final quarter of 2015. As mentioned, this was slightly better than expected and allowed us to finish 2015 with $3.44 in non-GAAP earnings per share. Even as we grappled with adverse dynamics in many of our markets in 2015, I'm pleased that we avoided any temptation to pull back on investment. We know that continues innovation is critical to our long-term growth prospects.
Here are some examples of new products we introduced around the world. In the United States, we introduced new and more convenient plastic packaging for our 32-ounce ready-to-feed liquid infant formula, building on the success of our 8-ounce launch a couple of years ago. We also responded quickly to competitive activity by introducing a new formulation of infant formula free from genetically-modified raw materials. Across North America, we became the first company to meet newly developed guidance for premature infant formula. And in China, we introduced a fully imported range of Enfa-branded products to complement our locally manufactured range. These fully imported products now account for 35% of our sales within the mainland. 
In Southeast Asia, we upgraded our formulations and added increased levels of DHA to our children's products. We also introduced plastics packaging in several countries, and we added ready-to-drink versions to our lineup of Enfa products. In Latin America, we introduced liquid versions of our key infant formula products; and in Mexico, our Enfagrow Toddler product. For our powdered products, we began the introduction of upgraded plastics packaging. 
Further, over more than 70 years, we worked diligently to develop clinical evidence in support of our specialty portfolio, predominantly our Nutramigen allergy brand. Educating health care professionals about Nutramigen's benefits allowed us to grow constant dollar sales double digits in 2015.
As I complete my comments on overall company performance and before I move to discussing our reporting segments in more detail, I want to mention that, as promised, we executed an accelerated share repurchase program in the most recent quarter. This reflects our commitment to the creation of long-term shareholder value. Michel will revert to this topic later. Let me now briefly comment on the performance within each of our reporting segment, and I begin with Asia. 
Sequentially, Asia's sales were in line with third quarter, with improvements in China, offset by lower sales in Thailand and Malaysia. For fourth quarter, constant dollar sales were 10% below the prior year. Quarter and full year sales compared unfavorably to 2014 by 8%. As mentioned, sequentially, we grew sales in China/Hong Kong by 2% from the third quarter of 2015. A more aggressive trading stance allowed us to stabilize sales of our locally manufactured product line, though we've had to increase our investment we encourage the prices to consumers, appear to have stabilized in the fourth quarter. 
At the same time, demand for our recently introduced fully imported range continued to grow. As mentioned earlier, sales of this product range now accounts to 35% of our sales in Mainland China and a full 22% of our combined China/Hong Kong business. As we expand direct shipments of fully imported products into Mainland China, we expect to see continued cannibalization of our Hong Kong business. Such channel shifts may obscure underlying business progress in the near term, but ultimately should be favorable to the company overall, as we build a stronger, more sustainable portfolio with greater reach inside Mainland China. 
As mentioned at our Investor Day in October, we are committed to make investments in support of our recent introductions. We're advancing digital marketing capabilities, expanding our channel coverage and strengthening our retail chain relationships through focused investments. Beyond the early sales success with our imported product range, as a further sign our strategy is working, we are seeing market share gains in baby stores.
As you know, we've also focused on strengthening our presence in business-to-consumer e-commerce. This represents the fastest growing part of the e-commerce market in China. And the segment is growing at approximately 5x the rate of the rest of the e-commerce channel. In a sign of our commitment to strengthening our presence in web and app-based commerce, we recently signed joint business partnership agreements with Jingdong, owner of leading e-commerce site, JD.com; and Tencent, owner of WeChat, the leading social app in China. Under these agreements, we agreed to cooperate by sharing data and technology platforms to the mutual benefits of our separate businesses. These agreements recognize the expertise of each party, including Mead Johnson China, and we are thrilled to partner with such great companies. 
While our China business began to show progress, our businesses in Malaysia and Thailand experienced challenges as mentioned earlier. Both economies are going through a challenging time due to political uncertainty and weak commodity prices. As a result, both consumer and business confidence is reduced. However, despite this backdrop, I want to acknowledge that we have not executed as well as expected in either country for much of 2015. Though we cannot control economic trends, we can and will control our execution, and we are taking steps to improve performance going forward. In the meantime, we continue to manage trade inventory bills carefully in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, we enhanced our products in Thailand with increased levels of DHA and introduced new packaging, including a plastic tub. Early signs are encouraging, with share increasing in the 3 months following our relaunch. However, it took longer than expected to deplete old inventory in the trade, and consequently, we chose to address this more aggressively in the most recent quarter.
Having discussed some areas of relative challenge, let me now point to our relatively stronger performance in the Philippines. The Philippines' business has delivered solid growth over the past 2 years. We've managed to offset foreign exchange impacts with improved pricing, and we've successfully extended our Lactum children's brand into the infant formula category. This move gives us exposure to a growing economy beyond our traditional premium price position. 
Turning now to Latin America. The region delivered constant dollar sales growth of 3% for the full year compared to 2014. Regional currencies weakened substantially through 2015, with large adverse impacts on sales growth in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico. As a consequence, reported sales were 13% below prior year level. For the fourth quarter, excluding Venezuela to where we paused shipments for much of the quarter, sales grew 5% on a our constant dollar basis over the same quarter of prior year. Including Venezuela, the region sales for fourth quarter '15 were 4% lower in constant dollars than the same quarter of 2014. 
As you can tell, our decision to pause shipments to Venezuela was a significant driver of relatively weaker segment performance. As stated in previous calls, we are carefully managing risk associated with our intercompany payables within defined parameters. In the near term, this means matching new shipments to Venezuela to hard currency payments received. We are actually working with the Venezuelan government to address this challenge in order that we can once again help provide much needed nutrition to children in that country. 
Looking at the overall economy of Latin America, over the past decade, these commodity-driven economies benefited substantially from stronger prices. Since the collapse in commodity prices, Latin America's GDP growth has slowed dramatically. Countries beyond the obvious example of Brazil, that's in the recession, are grappling with sharp reductions in their growth rates for the first time since 2009. These macroeconomic conditions, coupled with the strengthening dollar have resulted in sharp depreciation of local currencies.
I'd like to provide a little more detail in today's discussion. And for that purpose, I'll group the region into 3 sessions. I've excluded Venezuela, which I've discussed separately already. I'll now discuss Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America as a distinct area from the Southern Cone area of Brazil and Argentina. And finally, touch briefly on the Andean region, in which we include Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.
In Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America, the Enfa family of premium products grew strongly in constant dollars, both sequentially over the third quarter and in full year 2015, and now represents about 2/3 of sales within the area. Outside of Mexico, much of our business in this area is conducted in U.S. dollars. This helped to partially offset the impact from a decline in the Mexican peso. That said, the Mexican business is our third largest business globally. And many of you already know our Mexican portfolio augments our global Enfa-branded products with 2 very strong local brands milk modifiers, Choco Milk and Cal-C-Tose. 
These 2 milk modifier brands gave us a leading edge -- or a leading share, sorry, of the large Mexican milk modifier market. A large category that's, however, characterize by strong competition from global and local players. With limited potential to expand consumer penetration, competition is tough and occasionally price-based. These dynamics, over the last several years, have caused our milk modifier brands to grow more slowly than our Enfa-branded infant and children's business. In 2015, milk modifiers net sales declined as we expanded trade discounts to protect our competitive position. This impacted the overall Mexico results adversely.
Our performance in the South Cone area was adversely impacted by the economic recession and currency weakness in Brazil. In Argentina, price schemes more than covered the impact of currency depreciation. And across the area, we continue to grow our infant formula and toddler sales strongly in local currency. However, in Brazil, we also sell the Sustagen brand of milk modifiers. And in this category, we saw consumers move to cheaper competitive offerings and we lost sales as a consequence. Within the Andean region, we saw Colombia deliver strong double-digit growth for both the latest quarter and the full year. The smaller market of Ecuador also performed well, but these encouraging results were offset by challenging retail conditions in Peru. 
To wrap up, the key drivers for the Latin America full year results are: volume, which was lower primarily from our intentional constraint of Venezuela shipments and Mexico milk modifier sales reductions; price, that was predominantly from the high inflationary markets of Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela; and finally, foreign exchange that negatively impacted the region. 
I'll now turn to our performance in North America and Europe. In the full year 2015, the North America/Europe segment delivered 4% constant dollar revenue growth over 2014. Volume improved 1%, with price and product mix contributing 3% to our annual growth rate. In the fourth quarter, this segment's sales were in line with the prior year's quarter. Sequentially, as stated earlier, sales increased 5% over the third quarter. With little to no growth in the category in North America, our volume growth was realized through market share gains and our Enfagrow children's business continued double-digit growth. Our premium price specialty and solutions offerings also grew double digits. And our Canadian business continued to execute extremely well and exited the year with record high-market shares.
Europe posted its strongest sales and EBIT performance in the last 5 years, though the sales impact was partially offset by our exit from the Russian market earlier in the year. Overall, 2015 was another strong year for this segment. A year in which we saw profit margins expand to approach historic levels. In many ways, this was proof that our decision to maintain investment levels through the 2009 to 2012 economic downturn was the right one. 
Turning now to our outlook for 2016. Our outlook is broadly similar to that provided at our Investor Day in October. We expect constant dollar sales to continue to show gradual improvement sequentially through the coming quarters. But due to tough comparisons from the first half of 2015, we do not expect to report positive revenue growth over same quarter of prior year till the second half of 2016. For this reason, we expect full year 2016 constant dollar sales growth to be modest in the range of 0% to 2%. 
Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 600 basis points. As a result, reported sales may decrease by 4% to 6% this year. We now have a good fix on dairy costs, as this item will impact our profit and loss statement through the first 7 or 8 months of the year. Based on this, we are comfortable saying that, again, in 2016, dairy prices would have a favorable impact on our cost of goods.
At our Investor Day event last October, we characterized 2016 as a year of transition. In the context of headwinds from a strengthening dollar, we committed to reduce non-demand-creating operating expenses by $60 million in order to reinvest in select growth initiatives and protect earnings growth. As headwinds from currencies have grown stronger since our October gathering, this initiative has become even more essential to our strategy, and I'm pleased to report, we're making good progress and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cost-reduction ambition. 
As mentioned in our press release this morning, I believe it's important for us to give you a better picture of the expected evolution in underlying profitability without the polluting effect of currency impact. To this end, let me clarify that we expect to deliver 9% to 12% constant dollar, non-GAAP earnings per share growth. And based on our assumption around foreign exchange, we expect therefore non-GAAP earnings per share, when expressed in U.S. dollars, to be in the range of $3.48 to $3.60. Not included in our estimates of 2016 is any additional benefits that might accrue from a review of efficiency and productivity opportunities within our demand-generating investments. Such a review is currently scheduled for mid-2016.
I must point out that we remain highly focused on further strengthening -- sorry, we must -- we remain highly exposed to the further strengthening of the dollar or selected weakening in foreign currencies. Anticipating that we may continue to see some variability in exchange rates through the year, we've decided to provide you with a reconciliation to growth in non-GAAP constant dollar earnings per share.
I'll now turn the call over to Michel, who will provide some more details on our fourth quarter and full year financials. Michel will also elaborate on our guidance for 2016. And upon the completion of his prepared remarks, I'll return with some summary remarks before we open the lines to questions. Michel, over to you."

Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. I will then briefly highlight segment results and conclude with a summary of our 2016 guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my commen",2233,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. I will then briefly highlight segment results and conclude with a summary of our 2016 guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References to gross impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statement into U.S. dollars. 
Let me start with sales. Kasper addressed constant dollar sales growth, I will focus more on the foreign exchange impact. As you can see, from Slide 3, fourth quarter sales on a reported basis were 12% below the prior year quarter. Adverse foreign exchange rates contributed to a decline of 6%, a similar rate to that seen in the third quarter. For the full year, sales on a reported basis were 8% below last year. The adverse foreign exchange impact on sales was 6%, or $229 million.
On Slide 4, we have summarized the impact of foreign exchange for the quarter. The U.S. dollar continue to strengthen in the fourth quarter and its effect on translation of local currency negatively impact all reporting segments. Over 1/3 of the negative currency impact in the fourth quarter were from the Mexican peso and the Chinese renminbi. The balance of the foreign exchange impact was widespread, especially from our large markets like Canada and Malaysia and Thailand. We expect to see additional adverse foreign exchange impact in 2016 based on the continued strengthening of the dollar across a very broad basket of currencies. I'll address this foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well. 
I will now move on to the factors that impacted our gross margin on Slide 5. Gross margin was 63.9% in the fourth quarter, up 200 basis points from the same quarter of 2014. Lower dairy costs drove the majority of the improvement. However, the benefit was cut in half by adverse foreign exchange impacts. Productivity improvements offset our commodity increases and higher manufacturing costs. In the last earnings call, we highlighted 3 factors that would result in a sequential gross margin decrease: less benefit from new price increases; increased trade investment, especially China; and our annual U.S. plant shutdown. These factors came in as expected during the fourth quarter. 
On a full year basis, gross margin was 64.6%, which is 270 basis points improvement versus the prior year, mainly due to lower dairy costs, which benefited all segments. Supply chain productivity delivered approximately 5% of savings in cost of goods sold, which mitigated other costs as noted previously. 
Moving on to operating expenses on Slide #6. Our advertising and promotion spending was 15.6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 13.7% in the prior year quarter. This was an increase of 7% on a constant dollar basis. A&P investment on the fourth quarter includes support for China's fully imported products,   TV media for the U.S. children business and support for new product launches, like the 32-ounce liquid and non-GMO product line that Kasper described earlier. 
SG&A, on a constant dollar basis, was 6% or $14 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. Savings were a result of a lower incentive compensation and a reduction in corporate cost, partly driven by our Fuel for Growth initiatives. SG&A, on a full year basis, were flat compared to 2014 on a constant dollar basis. As you can see the from Slide 7, our cost-related research and development, marketing and G&A decreased by 3% in 2015 versus 2014 on a constant dollar basis. When comparing the second half year 2015 to the first half year 2015, the corporate support function decreased 8% mainly driven by the Fuel for Growth program.
In the fourth quarter, we made the first wave of employee reductions. Compared to June, 2015, we reduced approximately 200 FTEs mainly within the corporate support functions, where we reduced 18% of our headcount. We eliminated some outside services and initiated vendor negotiations for key services. The headcount and outside services actions to take to date have allowed us to secure most of our $60 million Fuel for Growth target for 2016. We are very comfortable to deliver this year's savings. 
Turning now to Slide 8. On a constant dollar basis, the fourth quarter EBIT was 3% below the prior year quarter, and the full year EBIT was aligned with 2014. Including currency impact, EBIT was down 13% in the fourth quarter and down 7% for the full year. The EBIT margin as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was slightly lower than the prior year quarter, as continued investments were not fully offset by the higher gross margin. EBIT margins percentage of sales for the full year increased by 30 basis points. 
I will now discuss EBIT for each segment. Starting with Asia on Slide 9. In Q4, Asia delivered EBIT of $140 million, a decrease of 24% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, EBIT was 28% lower, mainly due to impact of the Chinese renminbi. The EBIT margin at 30% was lower than the fourth quarter 2014 and the third quarter '15. As we continued to invest, especially in China, these investments included price promotions on the locally manufactured products to protect competitiveness, along with A&P support for the fully imported product line introduced earlier this year. As Kasper mentioned, Greater China sales improved sequentially as a result of these investments. For the full year, the Asia EBIT margin at 33% remains the highest of our 3 segments. However, the EBIT margin was lower than in 2014 as lower sales and high-demand generation investments were not fully offset by the dairy benefit.
Latin America, on Slide #10, delivered EBIT of $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 15% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, EBIT declined 26%, as the region continued to have a large negative impact from currencies, most notably the Mexican peso. If we exclude the impact of Venezuela, where we intentionally reduced shipments, the segment's reported EBIT dollars for 2015 would have been in line with 2014 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. For the full year, Latin America EBIT margin improved slightly to 23.1%. Lower dairy costs more than offset the impact of the higher investments. 
Let me address North America and Europe on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, EBIT was $97 million, an increase of 14% on a constant dollar basis and 8% on a reported basis. In the midst of a tough top line comparison, gross margin continued to be strong. The team managed to maintain operating expense in line with the prior year quarter, while increasing A&P by 9% on a constant-currency basis. For the full year, the North America and European EBIT margin was 28%, benefiting primarily from gross margin. I will now address our financial results from EBIT to net results on Slide #12.
The fourth quarter interest expense increased to approximately $22 million, reflecting the issuance of the new $1.5 billion notes to finance the share repurchase programs. During our October earnings call, we announced a new share repurchase program of our $1.5 billion of the company's common stock, with $1 billion in the form an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR. The ASR was executed after the close of business on that same day. Under the accelerated share repurchase program, 10.7 million shares of stock were delivered in the quarter.
Following this portion of the ASR, the average number of shares in the fourth quarter were 189.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding shares were 186.4 million. It is expected that additional shares will be delivered in 2016 under the current ASR program. The ASR program was initially financed by a $1 billion term loan. Shortly thereafter, refinanced by the issuance notes, $750 million 5-year notes at a rate of 3% and $750 million 10-year notes at a rate of 4.125%. 
Taxes. For 2015, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 24.8% compared to 22.5% in 2014. The 2014 rate was unusually low as a result of $0.05 per share nonrecurring tax benefit. Also, the 2015 ETR was also higher as a result of an unfavorable change in geographic earnings mix. 
Let me briefly address our EPS on Slide 13. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.78, a decline of $0.14 versus the prior year quarter. Sales negatively impacted EPS by $0.16 offset by gross margin benefit. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EPS by $0.10. Full year non-GAAP EPS were $3.44, slightly above the high end of our guidance. Versus the prior year, EPS declined by $0.30, the foreign exchange alone negatively impacting EPS by $0.26. The sales decline impacted EPS by $0.26 as well. Gross margin benefit was offset by additional A&P investments to support our innovation, especially our investments in China. 
Specified items. For 2015, specified items were $45 million or $0 17. The largest charge was $25 million. This occurred in the fourth quarter and was related to a restructuring provision for our Fuel for Growth productivity program. This was in line with expectations we highlighted in our third quarter earnings call. Including these specified items, EPS on a non-GAAP basis was $3.27. 
Let me finish the 2015 discussion with a high-level overview of the cash flow and balance sheet. Despite the challenging operating environment, we generated strong cash flow, which further strengthened our balance sheet. As you can see, from Slide 14, free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures was $726 million due in 2015, up 20% from the prior year. For 2015, capital expenditures were $174 million consistent with our long-term goal of about 4% of sales. The most significant capital investment were to expand capacity at our European plant to support demand for the new China fully imported product line, and in the U.S., to support new liquids manufacturing.
Depreciation and amortization expenses was $99 million for the full year. For the full year 2015, we increased our dividends by 10% to $1.65 per share resulting in a total dividend payment of $326 million. The total payout ratio was close to 50% of our net results. Our cash balance, as of December 31, was $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million compared to December 2014. Nearly 90% of our cash is held outside of the United States. Our net debt position, as of December 31, was less than $1.3 billion. 
I will now wrap up with a summary of our 2016 guidance on a non-GAAP basis on Slide 15. We forecast constant dollar sales in the range of 0% to 2% this year versus 2015. Assuming exchange rate remain at current levels, this would translate into 2016 sales 4% to 6% below the prior year on a reported basis. Please note that we expect tougher sales comparison in the first half of 2016 versus 2015. This is due in part to more favorable performance seen in China, and especially in the first quarter of 2015.
Constant dollar sales in Q1 2016 are expected to be in line or slightly higher above the Q4 2015 performance. The company expects a positive trend in the second half of 2016 on a constant dollar basis. We expect higher investments in A&P in the first half of 2016. As a result, we expect growth of non-GAAP EPS towards the second half of 2016. Please note that quarter 1 2016 non-GAAP EPS will have a tough comparison.
From an EPS guidance perspective, there are several key factors to consider. We expect that our gross margins will be around 64%, similar to the fourth quarter 2015 level. We entered into dairy contracts at attractive prices to secure more than 80% of our expected 2016 dairy needs. Nearly all of the expected $60 million Fuel for Growth savings will be invested in demand-generating activities to enable long-term market share improvement.
The benefits of all share repurchase in 2015, including the ASR program, net of interest expense, is expected to be an $0.11 benefit per share. EPS guidance includes an annual estimated adverse impact of currency rates as of January 2016, which is expected to be approximately $0.40 per share. Another 1% strengthening of the dollar against all currencies where we operate would lead to a further reduction in EPS of about $0.04 per share on a full year basis, just from translation.
Taking all of this into account, non-GAAP EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $3.48 to $3.60, excluding specified items. On a constant dollar basis, non-GAAP EPS guidance is expected to grow 9% to 12% this excludes $0.11 from the benefit of the share repurchase program in 2015. The company expects to incur charges of approximately $25 million to $30 million associated with the Fuel for Growth program in 2016. Specified items, including charges related to Fuel for Growth are expected to be approximately $0.12 per share. Therefore, GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.36 to $3.48, excluding future costs related to market-to-market pension adjustments which are not reflected in the guidance.
This concludes my discussion on our quarter 4 and full year 2015 financial results. Thanks again for your time this morning. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

Let me briefly provide some summary remarks before we open the lines to your questions. I'm proud of many of the operational adjustments we made in the second half of 2015 when we were faced with significant change. Likewise, I feel good that our key strategies are paying off. Our once-a-year investment much in the United States was made because we believe in the potential of that market. Sales and margins have now rebounded and are helping us overcome challenges abroad. Likewise, our decision to reshape our portfolio in China and focus on new growing sales channels is showing signs of paying off.
Faced with macroeconomic challenges, we're making adjustments in other markets, too. Change is inevitable, and in many ways, businesses should be judged by how well they adjust and adapt, and I'm confident that we'll look back at the end of this year able to acknowledge that we did this quite well. 
Through last year, I repeatedly pointed to 4 important factors that critically influenced company performance. To remind you all, I'm referring to currency movements, dairy cost evolution, our ability to evolve our strategy and portfolio in China and our momentum in North America, particularly in the United States. All of these 4 variables remain as relevant in 2016 as they were to our performance in 2015, but I should add pricing to the list. Our ability to offset, partially or in full, foreign exchange weakness with price increases would be very important. I'd add that I see some encouraging signs that price increases will become easier as we move through the year.
I'll close with message that we'll continue to provide clear visibility on the impact of foreign exchange as we move through 2016. We'll do so by providing updates on both sales and profit growth, net of foreign exchange. In addition to our traditional non-GAAP earnings per share numbers, we hope you'll find this informative.
Operator, I'd now like to open the lines to questions. And because our prepared remarks have taken longer than anticipated, we're prepared to go a few minutes over if the questions merit doing so. Operator, over to you. Thank you."

I think, we introduced the fully imported line of products into China sort of towards the back half really of the second quarter. And the fact that this product line is now already making up 35% of our sales in the mainland and 22% of our sales in the combined China/Hong Kong business, I think it's fairly impressive progress. I want to remind you also that -- of the message we gave on our Investor Day that we have confirmed our intention to enter the super-high premium category sometime in 2016. I'm sure you can understand that for competitive reasons, I'm not prepared to tell you what our plan timing is, but it goes without saying that we obviously have one. So I feel quite good about that. We now -- if I add the Hong Kong business and our fully imported line together, we've now got more than half of our sales in the China/Hong Kong business coming out of our Netherlands facility, and therefore, meeting consumer desire for imported quality. So I think we're managing that transition quite well. I'm satisfied with the progress we are making in baby stores also. We -- through much of last year, we discussed the fact that we were under-indexing in baby stores, which is one of the faster growing sales channels. But as of late, we've seen some fairly satisfactory improvements to our market shares in this channel, and I'm sure we'll continue to do so going forward."

I think, as you heard us talk about, we were quite some distance off managing to cover the impact of foreign exchange weakness through price in 2015. So that will a be continued challenge or task for us as we go through 2016. As I was trying to indicate, I think the pricing environment will become so much more friendly. What we saw in '15 was that there was still -- particularly, I would say, in Asia, there were still governments in Asia that were very resistant to price increases in our sector as they still focused very much on kind of inflationary pressure or perceived inflationary pressure, which we think we all know was really a threat that evaporated sometime in 2014, and they would repeatedly point to the fact that we were seeing significant upside from dairy costs coming down as we discussed price increases. I think now that the dairy prices have stabilized, I believe that as both us and our competitors lapped the low dairy costs, it will become a little bit more straightforward to raise prices. But we obviously had to do that in a responsible manner and we have to assess that in the context of general price inflation and wage inflation in the markets we operate in."

I don't want to speculate on whether those regulatory adjustments will address all of the imbalances that we are seeing currently in China, but I believe that they will begin to address some of them. At the moment, it's clear that inadvertently, the China regulations have created a tilted playing field, that is very much tilting in favor of imported products sold through e-commerce. I don't believe that, that was the intention of either the regulators or the China government at large, and I think they will find ways to address that. I also think that they remain concerned about the large number of smaller brands that have been created in China that really lack the expertise or the resources to guarantee consumer quality, and I think that would be addressed. So I think you're going to a whole slew of attempts at least by regulators to get at some of these issues through this year, but since you gave me a free pass on the timing, I'll probably take advantage of that, Amit."

So but it may go back to days before we were a public company, so you may have imperfect visibility. I guess, what I was trying to indicate was that I believe that these levels of profitability in the North American business are sustainable, to put it sort of candidly. It's not inconsistent with where we have been. And what we see in the North American business is that we get a lot of leverage on both sales and volume growth in that business. So put another way, our marginal costs are very low in that business, and hence, we see big swings in profitability as sales move up and down. So I'm quite comfortable. I feel good about where the margins are. And I think we've got other parts of our global portfolio where we are working in difficult trading environments and that results in -- perhaps in margin pressure, so it's quite rewarding to see that this part of our portfolio has the opposite dynamic paying in its favor."

I indicated in Investors Day that at that point of time, foreign exchange impact would have been around $0.15. Right now, we are looking at -- based on current spot rates, we're looking at the $0.40 impact from currencies. So we clearly looked into how we can mitigate that to still deliver mid-single-digit growth. On one hand side, like Kasper indicated, we clearly looked into pricing because that's an area where we think we need to be very cautious to see what can we do in certain markets, that's one. Two, I highlight specifically, and referred most in an earlier question, on dairy benefits. We secured 80%, which is higher than we expected also in quarter 3. So that's one of the -- whether you call it tactical or strategical initiatives to secure the benefit to avoid volatility. And thirdly, like Kasper also indicated, we are clearly starting further assessments to see what can we do in terms of demand investments, and that will be leaning more towards mid of this year.

I'll then hand over to Michel, who'll give a further analysis of our financial metrics and provide an outlook for key cost drivers. After Michel completes his segment, I will return with a few summary remarks before we give you an opportunity to ask questions. Except when noted otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results. A full reconciliation to our GAAP results is available in our 10-Q that was filed alongside our earnings release earlier this morning. Both documents are available on our website. 
Let me start with a high-level overview of our fourth quarter 2015 results for the global business, before I move on to discuss full year results and then performance of each of our regions. As we exited the year, and I refer now to fourth quarter results specifically, I'm pleased to say we saw a sequential improvement versus the third quarter in our underlying sales performance. Net of withheld shipments to Venezuela, a topic I'll return to later, we saw sequential growth in constant-dollars sales of 1%. This represented a modest reversal of the trend we've seen over the previous 3 quarters, despite sales performance being adversely affected by selective retailer inventory adjustments in Thailand and Malaysia.
Structural changes made to our investment profile in China and the recent launch of our fully imported line of Enfa products helped us deliver on the promise we made in July. At that time, we said we expected to see sequential improvement in China sales as we exited the year. And in the fourth quarter, our China/Hong Kong business grew 2% sequentially over the third quarter. Our North America/Europe segment also grew sequentially by nearly 5% on a constant-dollar basis. 
Let me now address our full year results. 2015 was a challenging year for us. We were challenged by a strengthening dollar and the general weakness in many economies throughout Asia and Latin America. GDP growth across Asia and Latin America was lower than prior year, and this affected both consumer and retailer confidence. Additionally, in China, we saw increased price-based competition and channel shifts that adversely impacted sales growth and required us to boost investment to protect our competitiveness. 
In Southeast Asia, in particular, we saw slowing economic growth in Thailand and Malaysia. Combined with some company-specific executional issues, this resulted in lower volumes through the year. In the Philippines, where GDP growth remained more robust, we saw relatively better performance. And there, we are satisfied with the progress we made through the year. We continue to benefit from lower dairy costs and an improved gross margin as a consequence. This helped partially offset the EBIT and EPS impact of foreign exchange and lower sales.
For full year 2015, constant-dollar net sales were 2% below prior year, largely due to our challenges in China and Hong Kong. Gross sales, however, were in line with 2014. This shows continued solid demand for our brands, though a challenging trading environment saw us report sales below prior-year level. 
The impact of a strengthening dollar was significant throughout the year, reducing reported sales by about 6% and earnings per share by $0.26. Where possible, we took price to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange. However, competitor strategies and abnormally low dairy costs made price increases more difficult than we've seen in recent years.
Price consequently contributed 1% -- percentage point of growth to the full year. As we progressed through the year, the carryover benefit of price increases taken in 2014 gradually disappeared and price promotional activity became more evident. Against the same quarter of prior year, this increased dynamic adversely affected fourth quarter growth by 1 percentage point. This was largely driven by increased trade promotional activity in China. Global volume was 3% lower than prior year, growth in North America and Europe didn't fully offset weaker performance in Asia and Latin America, and the impact of our decision to slow shipments into Venezuela was also significant.
Infant formula product sales for 2015 were in line with prior year on a constant-dollar basis. It follows that we were relatively more challenged within our children's category outside of North America. The children's category is more price-sensitive and, prior to reshaping our competitive stance in the third quarter, we suffered share losses due to competitors' price promotional activity. However, having addressed the price disadvantage, as the cohort of infants' age, that consumer brand, this should help sales of our children's franchise going forward.
We understand the recovery of momentum in China and select other emerging markets could take time, and we need to properly fund key growth initiatives. As a consequence, the company invests -- the company's investment in advertising and promotion remained strong in the fourth quarter at 15.6% of sales. This was 190 basis points above prior-year's fourth quarter level. 
To help fund these investments and offset the impact of foreign exchange, we accelerated the implementation of some of our operating expense reductions. We refer to this initiative as Fuel for Growth. As a direct result of this focus, our operating expenses came in approximately $20 million favorable versus the forecast that underpinned guidance issued in October. This favorability allowed us to offset the impact of unanticipated dollar strength in the final quarter of the year and still deliver earnings per share slightly above the high end of our guidance range.
We delivered $0.78 in non-GAAP earnings per share for the final quarter of 2015. As mentioned, this was slightly better than expected and allowed us to finish 2015 with $3.44 in non-GAAP earnings per share. Even as we grappled with adverse dynamics in many of our markets in 2015, I'm pleased that we avoided any temptation to pull back on investment. We know that continuous innovation is critical to our long-term growth prospects.
Here are some examples of new products we introduced around the world. In the United States, we introduced new and more convenient plastic packaging for our 32-ounce ready-to-feed liquid infant formula, building on the success of our 8-ounce launch a couple of years ago. We also responded quickly to competitive activity by introducing a new formulation of infant formula free from genetically-modified raw materials. Across North America, we became the first company to meet newly developed guidelines for premature infant formula. And in China, we introduced a fully imported range of Enfa-branded products to complement our locally manufactured range. These fully imported products now account for 35% of our sales within the mainland. 
In Southeast Asia, we upgraded our formulations and added increased levels of DHA to our children's products. We also introduced plastics packaging in several countries, and we added ready-to-drink versions to our lineup of Enfa products. In Latin America, we introduced liquid versions of our key infant formula products; and in Mexico, our Enfagrow Toddler product. For our powdered products, we began the introduction of upgraded plastics packaging. 
Further, over more than 70 years, we worked diligently to develop clinical evidence in support of our specialty portfolio, predominantly our Nutramigen allergy brand. Educating health care professionals about Nutramigen's benefits allowed us to grow constant-dollar sales double digits in 2015.
As I complete my comments on overall company performance, and before I move to discussing our reporting segments in more detail, I want to mention that, as promised, we executed an accelerated share repurchase program in the most recent quarter. This reflects our commitment to the creation of long-term shareholder value. Michel will revert to this topic later. Let me now briefly comment on the performance within each of our reporting segments, and I begin with Asia. 
Sequentially, Asia's sales were in line with third quarter, with improvements in China offset by lower sales in Thailand and Malaysia. For fourth quarter, constant-dollar sales were 10% below the prior-year quarter, and full year sales compared unfavorably to 2014 by 8%. As mentioned, sequentially, we grew sales in China/Hong Kong by 2% from the third quarter of 2015. A more aggressive trading stance allowed us to stabilize sales of our locally manufactured product line. Though we've had to increase our investment, we're encouraged that prices to consumers appear to have stabilized in the fourth quarter. 
At the same time, demand for our recently introduced fully imported range continued to grow. As mentioned earlier, sales of this product range now accounts for 35% of our sales in Mainland China and a full 22% of our combined China/Hong Kong business. As we expand direct shipments of fully imported products into Mainland China, we expect to see continued cannibalization of our Hong Kong business. Such channel shifts may obscure underlying business progress in the near term, but ultimately should be favorable to the company overall, as we build a stronger, more sustainable portfolio with greater reach inside Mainland China. 
As mentioned at our Investor Day in October, we are committed to make investments in support of our recent introductions. We're advancing digital marketing capabilities, expanding our channel coverage, and strengthening our retail chain relationships through focused investments. Beyond the early sales success with our imported product range, as a further sign our strategy is working, we are seeing market share gains in baby stores.
As you know, we've also focused on strengthening our presence in business-to-consumer e-commerce. This represents the fastest growing part of the e-commerce market in China, and the segment is growing at approximately 5x the rate of the rest of the e-commerce channel. In a sign of our commitment to strengthening our presence in web and app-based commerce, we recently signed joint business partnership agreements with Jingdong, owner of leading e-commerce site, JD.com; and Tencent, owner of WeChat, the leading social app in China. Under these agreements, we agreed to cooperate by sharing data and technology platforms to the mutual benefits of our separate businesses. These agreements recognize the expertise of each party, including Mead Johnson China, and we are thrilled to partner with such great companies. 
While our China business began to show progress, our businesses in Malaysia and Thailand experienced challenges, as mentioned earlier. Both economies are going through a challenging time due to political uncertainty and weak commodity prices. As a result, both consumer and business confidence is reduced. However, despite this backdrop, I want to acknowledge that we have not executed as well as expected in either country for much of 2015. Though we cannot control economic trends, we can and will control our execution, and we are taking steps to improve performance going forward. In the meantime, we continue to manage trade inventory builds carefully in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, we enhanced our products in Thailand with increased levels of DHA and introduced new packaging, including a plastic tub. Early signs are encouraging, with share increasing in the 3 months following our relaunch. However, it took longer than expected to deplete old inventory in the trade, and consequently, we chose to address this more aggressively in the most recent quarter.
Having discussed some areas of relative challenge, let me now point to our relatively stronger performance in the Philippines. The Philippines' business has delivered solid growth over the past 2 years. We've managed to offset foreign exchange impacts with improved pricing, and we've successfully extended our Lactum children's brand into the infant formula category. This move gives us exposure to a growing economy beyond our traditional premium price position. 
Turning now to Latin America. The region delivered constant-dollar sales growth of 3% for the full year compared to 2014. Regional currencies weakened substantially through 2015, with large adverse impacts on sales growth in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico. As a consequence, reported sales were 13% below prior-year level. For the fourth quarter, excluding Venezuela, to where we paused shipments for much of the quarter, sales grew 5% on a constant-dollar basis over the same quarter of prior year. Including Venezuela, the region sales for fourth quarter '15 were 4% lower in constant dollars than the same quarter of 2014. 
As you can tell, our decision to pause shipments to Venezuela was a significant driver of relatively weaker segment performance. As stated in previous calls, we are carefully managing risk associated with our intercompany payables within defined parameters. In the near term, this means matching new shipments to Venezuela to hard currency payments received. We are actually working with the Venezuelan government to address this challenge in order that we can once again help provide much needed nutrition to children in that country. 
Looking at the overall economy of Latin America, over the past decade, these commodity-driven economies benefited substantially from stronger prices. Since the collapse in commodity prices, Latin America's GDP growth has slowed dramatically. Countries, beyond the obvious example of Brazil that's in the recession, are grappling with sharp reductions in their growth rates for the first time since 2009. These macroeconomic conditions, coupled with the strengthening dollar, have resulted in sharp depreciation of local currencies.
I'd like to provide a little more detail in today's discussion. And for that purpose, I'll group the region into 3 sections. I've excluded Venezuela, which I've discussed separately already. I'll now discuss Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America as a distinct area from the Southern Cone area of Brazil and Argentina. And finally, touch briefly on the Andean region, in which we include Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.
In Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America, the Enfa family of premium products grew strongly in constant dollars, both sequentially over the third quarter and in full year 2015, and now represents about 2/3 of sales within the area. Outside of Mexico, much of our business in this area is conducted in U.S. dollars. This helped to partially offset the impact from a decline in the Mexican peso. That said, the Mexican business is our third-largest business globally. And many of you already know our Mexican portfolio augments our global Enfa-branded products with 2 very strong local brands of milk modifiers, Choco Milk and Cal-C-Tose. 
These 2 milk-modifier brands gave us a leading edge -- or a leading share, sorry, of the large Mexican milk-modifier market, a large category that's, however, characterized by strong competition from global and local players. With limited potential to expand consumer penetration, competition is tough and occasionally price-based. These dynamics, over the last several years, have caused our milk-modifier brands to grow more slowly than our Enfa-branded infant and children's business. In 2015, milk modifiers net sales declined as we expanded trade discounts to protect our competitive position. This impacted the overall Mexico result adversely.
Our performance in the South Cone area was adversely impacted by the economic recession and currency weakness in Brazil. In Argentina, price schemes more than covered the impact of currency depreciation. And across the area, we continue to grow our infant formula and toddler sales strongly in local currency. However, in Brazil, we also sell the Sustagen brand of milk modifiers. And in this category, we saw consumers move to cheaper competitive offerings, and we lost sales as a consequence. Within the Andean region, we saw Colombia deliver strong double-digit growth for both the latest quarter and the full year. The smaller market of Ecuador also performed well, but these encouraging results were offset by challenging retail conditions in Peru. 
To wrap up, the key drivers for the Latin America full year results are: volume, which was lower primarily from our intentional constraint of Venezuela shipments and Mexico milk-modifier sales reductions; price, that was predominantly from the high inflationary markets of Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela; and finally, foreign exchange that negatively impacted the region. 
I'll now turn to our performance in North America and Europe. In the full year 2015, the North America/Europe segment delivered 4% constant-dollar revenue growth over 2014. Volume improved 1%, with price and product mix contributing 3% to our annual growth rate. In the fourth quarter, this segment's sales were in line with the prior-year's quarter. Sequentially, as stated earlier, sales increased 5% over the third quarter. With little to no growth in the category in North America, our volume growth was realized through market share gains, and our Enfagrow children's business continued double-digit growth. Our premium price specialty and solutions offerings also grew double digits. And our Canadian business continued to execute extremely well and exited the year with record-high market shares.
Europe posted its strongest sales and EBIT performance in the last 5 years, though the sales impact was partially offset by our exit from the Russian market earlier in the year. Overall, 2015 was another strong year for this segment, a year in which we saw profit margins expand to approach historic levels. In many ways, this was proof that our decision to maintain investment levels through the 2009 to 2012 economic downturn was the right one. 
Turning now to our outlook for 2016. Our outlook is broadly similar to that provided at our Investor Day in October. We expect constant-dollar sales to continue to show gradual improvement sequentially through the coming quarters. But due to tough comparisons from the first half of 2015, we do not expect to report positive revenue growth over same quarter of prior year till the second half of 2016. For this reason, we expect full year 2016 constant-dollar sales growth to be modest, in the range of 0% to 2%. 
Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 600 basis points. As a result, reported sales may decrease by 4% to 6% this year. We now have a good fix on dairy costs, as this item will impact our profit and loss statement through the first 7 or 8 months of the year. Based on this, we are comfortable saying that, again, in 2016, dairy prices would have a favorable impact on our cost of goods.
At our Investor Day event last October, we characterized 2016 as a year of transition. In the context of headwinds from a strengthening dollar, we committed to reduce non-demand-creating operating expenses by $60 million in order to reinvest in select growth initiatives and protect earnings growth. As headwinds from currencies have grown stronger since our October gathering, this initiative has become even more central to our strategy, and I'm pleased to report we're making good progress and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cost-reduction ambition. 
As mentioned in our press release this morning, I believe it's important for us to give you a better picture of the expected evolution in underlying profitability without the polluting effect of currency impact. To this end, let me clarify that we expect to deliver 9% to 12% constant-dollar non-GAAP earnings per share growth. And based on our assumption around foreign exchange, we expect therefore non-GAAP earnings per share, when expressed in U.S. dollars, to be in the range of $3.48 to $3.60. Not included in our estimates of 2016 is any additional benefits that might accrue from a review of efficiency and productivity opportunities within our demand-generating investments. Such a review is currently scheduled for mid-2016.
I must point out that we remain highly focused on further strengthening -- sorry, we must -- we remain highly exposed to the further strengthening of the dollar or selected weakening in foreign currencies. Anticipating that we may continue to see some variability in exchange rates through the year, we've decided to provide you with a reconciliation to growth in non-GAAP constant-dollar earnings per share.
I'll now turn the call over to Michel, who will provide some more details on our fourth quarter and full year financials. Michel will also elaborate on our guidance for 2016. And upon the completion of his prepared remarks, I'll return with some summary remarks before we open the lines to questions. Michel, over to you."

Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. I will then briefly highlight segment results, and conclude with a summary of our 2016 guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my comme",2211,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. I will then briefly highlight segment results, and conclude with a summary of our 2016 guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statement into U.S. dollars. 
Let me start with sales. Kasper addressed constant-dollar sales growth. I will focus more on the foreign exchange impact. As you can see from Slide 3, fourth quarter sales on a reported basis were 12% below the prior-year quarter. Adverse foreign exchange rates contributed to a decline of 6%, a similar rate to that seen in the third quarter. For the full year, sales on a reported basis were 8% below last year. The adverse foreign exchange impact on sales was 6%, or $229 million.
On Slide 4, we have summarized the impact of foreign exchange for the quarter. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter and its effect on translation of local currency negatively impact all reporting segments. Over 1/3 of the negative currency impact in the fourth quarter were from the Mexican peso and the Chinese renminbi. The balance of the foreign exchange impact was widespread, especially from our large markets like Canada, Malaysia and Thailand. We expect to see additional adverse foreign exchange impact in 2016 based on the continued strengthening of the dollar across a very broad basket of currencies. I'll address this foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well. 
I will now move on to the factors that impacted our gross margin on Slide 5. Gross margin was 63.9% in the fourth quarter, up 200 basis points from the same quarter of 2014. Lower dairy costs drove the majority of the improvement. However, the benefit was cut in half by adverse foreign exchange impacts. Productivity improvements offset our commodity increases and higher manufacturing costs. In the last earnings call, we highlighted 3 factors that would result in a sequential gross margin decrease: less benefit from new price increases; increased trade investment, especially China; and our annual U.S. plant shutdown. These factors came in as expected during the fourth quarter. 
On a full year basis, gross margin was 64.6%, which is 270 basis points improvement versus the prior year, mainly due to lower dairy costs, which benefited all segments. Supply chain productivity delivered approximately 5% of savings in cost of goods sold, which mitigated other costs, as noted previously. 
Moving on to operating expenses on Slide #6. Our advertising and promotion spending was 15.6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 13.7% in the prior-year quarter. This was an increase of 7% on a constant-dollar basis. A&P investment in the fourth quarter includes support for China's fully imported products, TV media for the U.S. children business and support for new product launches, like the 32-ounce liquid and non-GMO product line that Kasper described earlier. 
SG&A, on a constant-dollar basis, was 6% or $14 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. Savings were a result of a lower incentive compensation and a reduction in corporate cost, partly driven by our Fuel for Growth initiatives. SG&A, on a full year basis, were flat compared to 2014 on a constant-dollar basis. As you can see from Slide 7, our cost-related research and development, marketing and G&A decreased by 3% in 2015 versus 2014 on a constant-dollar basis. When comparing the second half year 2015 to the first half year 2015, the corporate support function decreased 8%, mainly driven by the Fuel for Growth program.
In the fourth quarter, we made the first wave of employee reductions. Compared to June 2015, we reduced approximately 200 FTEs, mainly within the corporate support functions, where we reduced 18% of our headcount. We eliminated some outside services and initiated vendor negotiations for key services. The headcount and outside services actions to take -- to date have allowed us to secure most of our $60 million Fuel for Growth target for 2016. We are very comfortable to deliver this year's savings. 
Turning now to Slide 8. On a constant-dollar basis, the fourth quarter EBIT was 3% below the prior-year quarter, and the full year EBIT was aligned with 2014. Including currency impact, EBIT was down 13% in the fourth quarter and down 7% for the full year. The EBIT margin as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was slightly lower than the prior-year quarter, as continued investments were not fully offset by the higher gross margin. EBIT margin as a percentage of sales for the full year increased by 30 basis points. 
I will now discuss EBIT for each segment, starting with Asia on Slide 9. In Q4, Asia delivered EBIT of $140 million, a decrease of 24% on a constant-dollar basis. On a reported basis, EBIT was 28% lower, mainly due to impact of the Chinese renminbi. The EBIT margin at 30% was lower than the fourth quarter 2014 and the third quarter '15. As we continued to invest, especially in China, these investments included price promotions on the locally manufactured products to protect competitiveness, along with A&P support for the fully imported product line introduced earlier this year. As Kasper mentioned, Greater China sales improved sequentially as a result of these investments. For the full year, the Asia EBIT margin at 33% remains the highest of our 3 segments. However, the EBIT margin was lower than in 2014, as lower sales and high demand-generation investments were not fully offset by the dairy benefit.
Latin America, on Slide #10, delivered EBIT of $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 15% on a constant-dollar basis. On a reported basis, EBIT declined 26%, as the region continued to have a large negative impact from currencies, most notably the Mexican peso. If we exclude the impact of Venezuela, where we intentionally reduced shipments, the segment's reported EBIT dollars for 2015 would have been in line with 2014 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. For the full year, Latin America EBIT margin improved slightly to 23.1%. Lower dairy costs more than offset the impact of the higher investments. 
Let me address North America and Europe on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, EBIT was $97 million, an increase of 14% on a constant-dollar basis and 8% on a reported basis. In the midst of a tough top line comparison, gross margin continued to be strong. The team managed to maintain operating expense in line with the prior-year quarter, while increasing A&P by 9% on a constant-currency basis. For the full year, the North America/European EBIT margin was 28%, benefiting primarily from gross margin. I will now address our financial results from EBIT to net results on Slide #12.
The fourth quarter interest expense increased to approximately $22 million, reflecting the issuance of the new $1.5 billion notes to finance the share repurchase programs. During our October earnings call, we announced a new share repurchase program of $1.5 billion of the company's common stock, with $1 billion in the form an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR. The ASR was executed after the close of business on that same day. Under the accelerated share repurchase program, 10.7 million shares of stock were delivered in the quarter.
Following this portion of the ASR, the average number of shares in the fourth quarter were 189.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding shares were 186.4 million. It is expected that additional shares will be delivered in 2016 under the current ASR program. The ASR program was initially financed by a $1 billion term loan. Shortly thereafter, refinanced by the issuance notes, $750 million 5-year notes at a rate of 3% and $750 million 10-year notes at a rate of 4.125%. 
Taxes. For 2015, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 24.8% compared to 22.5% in 2014. The 2014 rate was unusually low as a result of a $0.05 per share nonrecurring tax benefit. Also, the 2015 ETR was also higher as a result of an unfavorable change in geographic earnings mix. 
Let me briefly address our EPS on Slide 13. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.78, a decline of $0.14 versus the prior-year quarter. Sales negatively impacted EPS by $0.16, offset by gross margin benefit. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EPS by $0.10. Full year non-GAAP EPS were $3.44, slightly above the high end of our guidance. Versus the prior year, EPS declined by $0.30, with foreign exchange alone negatively impacting EPS by $0.26. The sales decline impacted EPS by $0.26 as well. Gross margin benefit was offset by additional A&P investments to support our innovation, especially our investments in China. 
Specified items. For 2015, specified items were $45 million or $0.17. The largest charge was $25 million. This occurred in the fourth quarter and was related to a restructuring provision for our Fuel for Growth productivity program. This was in line with expectations we highlighted in our third quarter earnings call. Including these specified items, EPS on a non-GAAP basis was $3.27. 
Let me finish the 2015 discussion with a high-level overview of the cash flow and balance sheet. Despite the challenging operating environment, we generated strong cash flow, which further strengthened our balance sheet. As you can see from Slide 14, free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $726 million during 2015, up 20% from the prior year. For 2015, capital expenditures were $174 million, consistent with our long-term goal of about 4% of sales. The most significant capital investment were to expand capacity at our European plant to support demand for the new China fully imported product line; and in the U.S., to support new liquids manufacturing.
Depreciation and amortization expenses was $99 million for the full year. For the full year 2015, we increased our dividends by 10% to $1.65 per share, resulting in a total dividend payment of $326 million. The total payout ratio was close to 50% of our net results. Our cash balance as of December 31 was $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million compared to December 2014. Nearly 90% of our cash is held outside of the United States. Our net debt position as of December 31 was less than $1.3 billion. 
I will now wrap up with a summary of our 2016 guidance on a non-GAAP basis on Slide 15. We forecast constant-dollar sales in the range of 0% to 2% this year versus 2015. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, this would translate into 2016 sales 4% to 6% below the prior year on a reported basis. Please note that we expect tougher sales comparison in the first half of 2016 versus 2015. This is due in part to more favorable performance seen in China, and especially in the first quarter of 2015.
Constant-dollar sales in Q1 2016 are expected to be in line or slightly higher above the Q4 2015 performance. The company expects a positive trend in the second half of 2016 on a constant-dollar basis. We expect higher investments in A&P in the first half of 2016. As a result, we expect growth of non-GAAP EPS towards the second half of 2016. Please note that quarter 1 2016 non-GAAP EPS will have a tough comparison.
From an EPS guidance perspective, there are several key factors to consider. We expect that our gross margins will be around 64%, similar to the fourth quarter 2015 level. We entered into dairy contracts at attractive prices to secure more than 80% of our expected 2016 dairy needs. Nearly all of the expected $60 million Fuel for Growth savings will be reinvested in demand-generating activities to enable long-term market share improvement.
The benefit of all share repurchase in 2015, including the ASR program, net of interest expense, is expected to be an $0.11 benefit per share. EPS guidance includes an annual estimated adverse impact of currency rates as of January 2016, which is expected to be approximately $0.40 per share. Another 1% strengthening of the dollar against all currencies where we operate would lead to a further reduction in EPS of about $0.04 per share on a full year basis, just from translation.
Taking all of this into account, non-GAAP EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $3.48 to $3.60, excluding specified items. On a constant-dollar basis, non-GAAP EPS guidance is expected to grow 9% to 12%. This excludes $0.11 from the benefit of the share repurchase program in 2015. The company expects to incur charges of approximately $25 million to $30 million associated with the Fuel for Growth program in 2016. Specified items, including charges related to Fuel for Growth, are expected to be approximately $0.12 per share. Therefore, GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.36 to $3.48, excluding future costs related to mark-to-market pension adjustments which are not reflected in the guidance.
This concludes my discussion on our quarter 4 and full year 2015 financial results. Thanks again for your time this morning. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

Let me briefly provide some summary remarks before we open the lines to your questions. I'm proud of many of the operational adjustments we made in the second half of 2015, when we were faced with significant change. Likewise, I feel good that our key strategies are paying off. Our multi-year investment in the United States was made because we believe in the potential of that market. Sales and margins have now rebounded and are helping us overcome challenges abroad. Likewise, our decision to reshape our portfolio in China and focus on new growing sales channels is showing signs of paying off.
Faced with macroeconomic challenges, we're making adjustments in other markets, too. Change is inevitable, and in many ways, businesses should be judged by how well they adjust and adapt, and I'm confident that we'll look back at the end of this year able to acknowledge that we did this quite well. 
Through last year, I repeatedly pointed to 4 important factors that critically influenced company performance. To remind you all, I'm referring to currency movements, dairy cost evolution, our ability to evolve our strategy and portfolio in China, and our momentum in North America, particularly in the United States. All of these 4 variables remain as relevant in 2016 as they were to our performance in 2015, but I should add pricing to the list. Our ability to offset, partially or in full, foreign exchange weakness with price increases will be very important. I'd add that I see some encouraging signs that price increases will become easier as we move through the year.
I'll close with the message that we'll continue to provide clear visibility on the impact of foreign exchange as we move through 2016. We'll do so by providing updates on both sales and profit growth, net of foreign exchange, in addition to our traditional non-GAAP earnings per share numbers. We hope you'll find this informative.
Operator, I'd now like to open the lines to questions. And because our prepared remarks have taken longer than anticipated, we're prepared to go a few minutes over if the questions merit doing so. Operator, over to you. Thank you."

I think we introduced the fully imported line of products into China sort of towards the back half really of the second quarter. And the fact that this product line is now already making up 35% of our sales in the mainland and 22% of our sales in the combined China/Hong Kong business, I think it's fairly impressive progress. I want to remind you also that -- of the message we gave on our Investor Day that we have confirmed our intention to enter the super-high premium category sometime in 2016. I'm sure you can understand that for competitive reasons, I'm not prepared to tell you what our plan timing is, but it goes without saying that we obviously have one. So I feel quite good about that. We now -- if I add the Hong Kong business and our fully imported line together, we've now got more than half of our sales in the China/Hong Kong business coming out of our Netherlands facility, and therefore, meeting consumer desire for imported quality. So I think we're managing that transition quite well. I'm satisfied with the progress we are making in baby stores also. We -- through much of last year, we discussed the fact that we were under-indexing in baby stores, which is one of the faster-growing sales channels. But as of late, we've seen some fairly satisfactory improvements to our market shares in this channel, and I'm sure we'll continue to do so going forward."

I think, as you heard us talk about, we were quite some distance off managing to cover the impact of foreign exchange weakness through price in 2015. So that will be a continued challenge or task for us as we go through 2016. As I was trying to indicate, I think the pricing environment will become somewhat more friendly. What we saw in '15 was that there was still -- particularly, I would say, in Asia, there were still governments in Asia that were very resistant to price increases in our sector, as they still focused very much on kind of inflationary pressure or perceived inflationary pressure, which I think we all know was really a threat that evaporated sometime in 2014. And they would repeatedly point to the fact that we were seeing significant upside from dairy costs coming down as we discussed price increases. I think now that the dairy prices have stabilized, I believe that as both us and our competitors lap the low dairy costs, it will become a little bit more straightforward to raise prices. But we obviously have to do that in a responsible manner and we have to assess that in the context of general price inflation and wage inflation in the markets we operate in."

I don't want to speculate on whether those regulatory adjustments will address all of the imbalances that we are seeing currently in China, but I believe that they will begin to address some of them. At the moment, it's clear that, inadvertently, the China regulations have created a tilted playing field that is very much tilting in favor of imported products sold through e-commerce. I don't believe that, that was the intention of either the regulators or the China government at large, and I think they will find ways to address that. I also think that they remain concerned about the large number of smaller brands that have been created in China that really lack the expertise or the resources to guarantee consumer quality, and I think that would be addressed. So I think you're going to a whole slew of attempts, at least, by regulators to get at some of these issues through this year, but since you gave me a free pass on the timing, I'll probably take advantage of that, Amit."

It's not inconsistent with where we have been. And what we see in the North American business is that we get a lot of leverage on both sales and volume growth in that business. So put another way, our marginal costs are very low in that business, and hence, we see big swings in profitability as sales move up and down. So I'm quite comfortable. I feel good about where the margins are. And I think we've got other parts of our global portfolio where we are working in difficult trading environments, and that results in -- perhaps in margin pressure, so it's quite rewarding to see that this part of our portfolio has the opposite dynamic playing in its favor."

So we clearly looked into how we can mitigate that to still deliver mid-single-digit growth. On one hand side, like Kasper indicated, we clearly looked into pricing because that's an area where we think we need to be very cautious to see what can we do in certain markets, that's one. Two, I highlighted specifically, and referred also in an earlier question, on dairy benefits. We secured 80%, which is higher than we expected also in quarter 3. So that's one of the, whether you call it tactical or strategic initiatives, to secure the benefit to avoid volatility. And thirdly, like Kasper also indicated, we are clearly starting further assessments to see what can we do in terms of demand investments, and that will be leaning more towards mid of this year.

I'll begin by providing an overview focusing on revenue performance, our key strategic initiatives and business drivers and underlying business momentum. I'll then hand over to Michel, who'll give a further analysis of our financial metrics and provide an outlook for key cost drivers. After Michel completes his segment, I will return with a few summary remarks before we give you an opportunity to ask questions. Except when noted otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results. A full reconciliation to our GAAP results is available in our 10-Q that was filed alongside our earnings release earlier this morning. Both documents are available on our website. 
Let me start with a high-level overview of our fourth quarter 2015 results for the global business, before I move on to discuss full year results and then performance of each of our regions. As we exited the year, and I refer now to fourth quarter results specifically, I'm pleased to say we saw a sequential improvement versus the third quarter in our underlying sales performance. Net of withheld shipments to Venezuela, a topic I'll return to later, we saw sequential growth in constant dollars sales of 1%. This represented a modest reversal of the trend we've seen over the previous 3 quarters, despite sales performance being adversely affected by selective retailer inventory adjustments in Thailand and Malaysia.
Structural changes made to our investment profile in China and the recent launch of our fully imported line of Enfa products helped us deliver on the promise we made in July. At that time, we said we expected to see sequential improvement in China sales as we exited the year. And in the fourth quarter, our China/Hong Kong business grew 2% sequentially over the third quarter. Our North America/Europe segment also grew sequentially by nearly 5% on a constant dollar basis. 
Let me now address our full year results. 2015 was a challenging year for us. We were challenged by a strengthening dollar and the general weakness in many economies throughout Asia and Latin America. GDP growth across Asia and Latin America was lower than prior year, and this affected both consumer and retailer confidence. Additionally, in China, we saw increased price-based competition and channel shifts that adversely impacted sales growth and required us to boost investment to protect our competitiveness. 
In Southeast Asia, in particular, we saw slowing economic growth in Thailand and Malaysia. Combined with some company-specific executional issues, this resulted in lower volumes through the year. In the Philippines, where GDP growth remained more robust, we saw relatively better performance. And there, we are satisfied with the progress we made through the year. We continue to benefit from lower dairy costs and an improved gross margin as a consequence. This helped partially offset the EBIT and EPS impact of foreign exchange and lower sales.
For full year 2015, constant dollar net sales were 2% below prior year, largely due to our challenges in China and Hong Kong. Gross sales, however, were in line with 2014. This shows continued solid demand for our brands, though a challenging trading environment saw us report sales below prior year level. 
The impact of a strengthening dollar was significant throughout the year, reducing reported sales by about 6% and earnings per share by $0.26. Where possible, we took price to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange. However, competitor strategies and abnormally low dairy costs made price increases more difficult than we've seen in recent years.
Price consequently contributed 1% -- percentage point of growth to the full year. As we progressed through the year, the carryover benefit of price increases taken in 2014 gradually disappeared and price promotional activity became more evident. Against the same quarter of prior year, this increased dynamic adversely affected fourth quarter growth by 1 percentage point. This was largely driven by increased trade promotional activity in China. Global volume was 3% lower than prior year, growth in North America and Europe didn't fully offset weaker performance in Asia and Latin America, and the impact of our decision to slow shipments into Venezuela was also significant.
Infant formula product sales for 2015 were in line with prior year on a constant dollar basis. It follows that we were relatively more challenged within our children's category outside of North America. The children's category is more price-sensitive and, prior to reshaping our competitive stance in the third quarter, we suffered share losses due to competitors' price promotional activity. However, having addressed the price disadvantage, as the cohort of infants' age, that consumer brand, this should help sales of our children's franchise going forward.
We understand the recovery of momentum in China and select other emerging markets could take time, and we need to properly fund key growth initiatives. As a consequence, the company invests -- the company's investment in advertising and promotion remained strong in the fourth quarter at 15.6% of sales. This was 190 basis points above prior year 's fourth quarter level. 
To help fund these investments and offset the impact of foreign exchange, we accelerated the implementation of some of our operating expense reductions. We refer to this initiative as Fuel for Growth. As a direct result of this focus, our operating expenses came in approximately $20 million favorable versus the forecast that underpinned guidance issued in October. This favorability allowed us to offset the impact of unanticipated dollar strength in the final quarter of the year and still deliver earnings per share slightly above the high end of our guidance range.
We delivered $0.78 in non-GAAP earnings per share for the final quarter of 2015. As mentioned, this was slightly better than expected and allowed us to finish 2015 with $3.44 in non-GAAP earnings per share. Even as we grappled with adverse dynamics in many of our markets in 2015, I'm pleased that we avoided any temptation to pull back on investment. We know that continuous innovation is critical to our long-term growth prospects.
Here are some examples of new products we introduced around the world. In the United States, we introduced new and more convenient plastic packaging for our 32-ounce ready-to-feed liquid infant formula, building on the success of our 8-ounce launch a couple of years ago. We also responded quickly to competitive activity by introducing a new formulation of infant formula free from genetically-modified raw materials. Across North America, we became the first company to meet newly developed guidelines for premature infant formula. And in China, we introduced a fully imported range of Enfa-branded products to complement our locally manufactured range. These fully imported products now account for 35% of our sales within the mainland. 
In Southeast Asia, we upgraded our formulations and added increased levels of DHA to our children's products. We also introduced plastics packaging in several countries, and we added ready-to-drink versions to our lineup of Enfa products. In Latin America, we introduced liquid versions of our key infant formula products; and in Mexico, our Enfagrow Toddler product. For our powdered products, we began the introduction of upgraded plastics packaging. 
Further, over more than 70 years, we worked diligently to develop clinical evidence in support of our specialty portfolio, predominantly our Nutramigen allergy brand. Educating health care professionals about Nutramigen's benefits allowed us to grow constant dollar sales double digits in 2015.
As I complete my comments on overall company performance, and before I move to discussing our reporting segments in more detail, I want to mention that, as promised, we executed an accelerated share repurchase program in the most recent quarter. This reflects our commitment to the creation of long-term shareholder value. Michel will revert to this topic later. Let me now briefly comment on the performance within each of our reporting segments, and I begin with Asia. 
Sequentially, Asia's sales were in line with third quarter, with improvements in China offset by lower sales in Thailand and Malaysia. For fourth quarter, constant dollar sales were 10% below the prior year quarter, and full year sales compared unfavorably to 2014 by 8%. As mentioned, sequentially, we grew sales in China/Hong Kong by 2% from the third quarter of 2015. A more aggressive trading stance allowed us to stabilize sales of our locally manufactured product line. Though we've had to increase our investment, we're encouraged that prices to consumers appear to have stabilized in the fourth quarter. 
At the same time, demand for our recently introduced fully imported range continued to grow. As mentioned earlier, sales of this product range now accounts for 35% of our sales in Mainland China and a full 22% of our combined China/Hong Kong business. As we expand direct shipments of fully imported products into Mainland China, we expect to see continued cannibalization of our Hong Kong business. Such channel shifts may obscure underlying business progress in the near term, but ultimately should be favorable to the company overall, as we build a stronger, more sustainable portfolio with greater reach inside Mainland China. 
As mentioned at our Investor Day in October, we are committed to make investments in support of our recent introductions. We're advancing digital marketing capabilities, expanding our channel coverage, and strengthening our retail chain relationships through focused investments. Beyond the early sales success with our imported product range, as a further sign our strategy is working, we are seeing market share gains in baby stores.
As you know, we've also focused on strengthening our presence in business-to-consumer e-commerce. This represents the fastest growing part of the e-commerce market in China, and the segment is growing at approximately 5x the rate of the rest of the e-commerce channel. In a sign of our commitment to strengthening our presence in web and app-based commerce, we recently signed joint business partnership agreements with Jingdong, owner of leading e-commerce site, JD.com; and Tencent, owner of WeChat, the leading social app in China. Under these agreements, we agreed to cooperate by sharing data and technology platforms to the mutual benefits of our separate businesses. These agreements recognize the expertise of each party, including Mead Johnson China, and we are thrilled to partner with such great companies. 
While our China business began to show progress, our businesses in Malaysia and Thailand experienced challenges, as mentioned earlier. Both economies are going through a challenging time due to political uncertainty and weak commodity prices. As a result, both consumer and business confidence is reduced. However, despite this backdrop, I want to acknowledge that we have not executed as well as expected in either country for much of 2015. Though we cannot control economic trends, we can and will control our execution, and we are taking steps to improve performance going forward. In the meantime, we continue to manage trade inventory builds carefully in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, we enhanced our products in Thailand with increased levels of DHA and introduced new packaging, including a plastic tub. Early signs are encouraging, with share increasing in the 3 months following our relaunch. However, it took longer than expected to deplete old inventory in the trade, and consequently, we chose to address this more aggressively in the most recent quarter.
Having discussed some areas of relative challenge, let me now point to our relatively stronger performance in the Philippines. The Philippines' business has delivered solid growth over the past 2 years. We've managed to offset foreign exchange impacts with improved pricing, and we've successfully extended our Lactum children's brand into the infant formula category. This move gives us exposure to a growing economy beyond our traditional premium price position. 
Turning now to Latin America. The region delivered constant dollar sales growth of 3% for the full year compared to 2014. Regional currencies weakened substantially through 2015, with large adverse impacts on sales growth in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico. As a consequence, reported sales were 13% below prior year level. For the fourth quarter, excluding Venezuela, to where we paused shipments for much of the quarter, sales grew 5% on a constant dollar basis over the same quarter of prior year. Including Venezuela, the region sales for fourth quarter '15 were 4% lower in constant dollars than the same quarter of 2014. 
As you can tell, our decision to pause shipments to Venezuela was a significant driver of relatively weaker segment performance. As stated in previous calls, we are carefully managing risk associated with our intercompany payables within defined parameters. In the near term, this means matching new shipments to Venezuela to hard currency payments received. We are actually working with the Venezuelan government to address this challenge in order that we can once again help provide much needed nutrition to children in that country. 
Looking at the overall economy of Latin America, over the past decade, these commodity-driven economies benefited substantially from stronger prices. Since the collapse in commodity prices, Latin America's GDP growth has slowed dramatically. Countries, beyond the obvious example of Brazil that's in the recession, are grappling with sharp reductions in their growth rates for the first time since 2009. These macroeconomic conditions, coupled with the strengthening dollar, have resulted in sharp depreciation of local currencies.
I'd like to provide a little more detail in today's discussion. And for that purpose, I'll group the region into 3 sections. I've excluded Venezuela, which I've discussed separately already. I'll now discuss Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America as a distinct area from the Southern Cone area of Brazil and Argentina. And finally, touch briefly on the Andean region, in which we include Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.
In Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America, the Enfa family of premium products grew strongly in constant dollars, both sequentially over the third quarter and in full year 2015, and now represents about 2/3 of sales within the area. Outside of Mexico, much of our business in this area is conducted in U.S. dollars. This helped to partially offset the impact from a decline in the Mexican peso. That said, the Mexican business is our third largest business globally. And many of you already know our Mexican portfolio augments our global Enfa-branded products with 2 very strong local brands of milk modifiers, Choco Milk and Cal-C-Tose. 
These 2 milk modifier brands gave us a leading edge -- or a leading share, sorry, of the large Mexican milk modifier market, a large category that's, however, characterized by strong competition from global and local players. With limited potential to expand consumer penetration, competition is tough and occasionally price-based. These dynamics, over the last several years, have caused our milk modifier brands to grow more slowly than our Enfa-branded infant and children's business. In 2015, milk modifiers net sales declined as we expanded trade discounts to protect our competitive position. This impacted the overall Mexico result adversely.
Our performance in the South Cone area was adversely impacted by the economic recession and currency weakness in Brazil. In Argentina, price schemes more than covered the impact of currency depreciation. And across the area, we continue to grow our infant formula and toddler sales strongly in local currency. However, in Brazil, we also sell the Sustagen brand of milk modifiers. And in this category, we saw consumers move to cheaper competitive offerings, and we lost sales as a consequence. Within the Andean region, we saw Colombia deliver strong double-digit growth for both the latest quarter and the full year. The smaller market of Ecuador also performed well, but these encouraging results were offset by challenging retail conditions in Peru. 
To wrap up, the key drivers for the Latin America full year results are: volume, which was lower primarily from our intentional constraint of Venezuela shipments and Mexico milk modifier sales reductions; price, that was predominantly from the high inflationary markets of Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela; and finally, foreign exchange that negatively impacted the region. 
I'll now turn to our performance in North America and Europe. In the full year 2015, the North America/Europe segment delivered 4% constant dollar revenue growth over 2014. Volume improved 1%, with price and product mix contributing 3% to our annual growth rate. In the fourth quarter, this segment's sales were in line with the prior year 's quarter. Sequentially, as stated earlier, sales increased 5% over the third quarter. With little to no growth in the category in North America, our volume growth was realized through market share gains, and our Enfagrow children's business continued double-digit growth. Our premium price specialty and solutions offerings also grew double digits. And our Canadian business continued to execute extremely well and exited the year with record-high market shares.
Europe posted its strongest sales and EBIT performance in the last 5 years, though the sales impact was partially offset by our exit from the Russian market earlier in the year. Overall, 2015 was another strong year for this segment, a year in which we saw profit margins expand to approach historic levels. In many ways, this was proof that our decision to maintain investment levels through the 2009 to 2012 economic downturn was the right one. 
Turning now to our outlook for 2016. Our outlook is broadly similar to that provided at our Investor Day in October. We expect constant dollar sales to continue to show gradual improvement sequentially through the coming quarters. But due to tough comparisons from the first half of 2015, we do not expect to report positive revenue growth over same quarter of prior year till the second half of 2016. For this reason, we expect full year 2016 constant dollar sales growth to be modest, in the range of 0% to 2%. 
Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to reduce sales growth by approximately 600 basis points. As a result, reported sales may decrease by 4% to 6% this year. We now have a good fix on dairy costs, as this item will impact our profit and loss statement through the first 7 or 8 months of the year. Based on this, we are comfortable saying that, again, in 2016, dairy prices would have a favorable impact on our cost of goods.
At our Investor Day event last October, we characterized 2016 as a year of transition. In the context of headwinds from a strengthening dollar, we committed to reduce non-demand-creating operating expenses by $60 million in order to reinvest in select growth initiatives and protect earnings growth. As headwinds from currencies have grown stronger since our October gathering, this initiative has become even more central to our strategy, and I'm pleased to report we're making good progress and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our cost-reduction ambition. 
As mentioned in our press release this morning, I believe it's important for us to give you a better picture of the expected evolution in underlying profitability without the polluting effect of currency impact. To this end, let me clarify that we expect to deliver 9% to 12% constant dollar non-GAAP earnings per share growth. And based on our assumption around foreign exchange, we expect therefore non-GAAP earnings per share, when expressed in U.S. dollars, to be in the range of $3.48 to $3.60. Not included in our estimates of 2016 is any additional benefits that might accrue from a review of efficiency and productivity opportunities within our demand-generating investments. Such a review is currently scheduled for mid-2016.
I must point out that we remain highly focused on further strengthening -- sorry, we must -- we remain highly exposed to the further strengthening of the dollar or selected weakening in foreign currencies. Anticipating that we may continue to see some variability in exchange rates through the year, we've decided to provide you with a reconciliation to growth in non-GAAP constant dollar earnings per share.
I'll now turn the call over to Michel, who will provide some more details on our fourth quarter and full year financials. Michel will also elaborate on our guidance for 2016. And upon the completion of his prepared remarks, I'll return with some summary remarks before we open the lines to questions. Michel, over to you."

Let me start with sales. Kasper addressed constant dollar sales growth. I will focus more on the foreign exchange impact. As you can see from Slide 3, fourth quarter sales on a reported basis were 12% below the prior year quarter. Adverse foreign exchange rates contributed to a decline of 6%, a similar rate to that seen in the third quarter. For the full year, sales on a reported basis were 8% below last year. The adverse foreign exchange impact on sales was 6%, or $229 million.
On Slide 4, we have summarized the impact of foreign exchange for the quarter. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter and its effect on translation of local currency negatively impact all reporting segments. Over 1/3 of the negative currency impact in the fourth quarter were from the Mexican peso and the Chinese renminbi. The balance of the foreign exchange impact was widespread, especially from our large markets like Canada, Malaysia and Thailand. We expect to see additional adverse foreign exchange impact in 2016 based on the continued strengthening of the dollar across a very broad basket of currencies. I'll address this foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well. 
I will now move on to the factors that impacted our gross margin on Slide 5. Gross margin was 63.9% in the fourth quarter, up 200 basis points from the same quarter of 2014. Lower dairy costs drove the majority of the improvement. However, the benefit was cut in half by adverse foreign exchange impacts. Productivity improvements offset our commodity increases and higher manufacturing costs. In the last earnings call, we highlighted 3 factors that would result in a sequential gross margin decrease: less benefit from new price increases; increased trade investment, especially China; and our annual U.S. plant shutdown. These factors came in as expected during the fourth quarter. 
On a full year basis, gross margin was 64.6%, which is 270 basis points improvement versus the prior year, mainly due to lower dairy costs, which benefited all segments. Supply chain productivity delivered approximately 5% of savings in cost of goods sold, which mitigated other costs, as noted previously. 
Moving on to operating expenses on Slide #6. Our advertising and promotion spending was 15.6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 13.7% in the prior year quarter. This was an increase of 7% on a constant dollar basis. A&P investment in the fourth quarter includes support for China's fully imported products, TV media for the U.S. children business and support for new product launches, like the 32-ounce liquid and non-GMO product line that Kasper described earlier. 
SG&A, on a constant dollar basis, was 6% or $14 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. Savings were a result of a lower incentive compensation and a reduction in corporate cost, partly driven by our Fuel for Growth initiatives. SG&A, on a full year basis, were flat compared to 2014 on a constant dollar basis. As you can see from Slide 7, our cost-related research and development, marketing and G&A decreased by 3% in 2015 versus 2014 on a constant dollar basis. When comparing the second half year 2015 to the first half year 2015, the corporate support function decreased 8%, mainly driven by the Fuel for Growth program.
In the fourth quarter, we made the first wave of employee reductions. Compared to June 2015, we reduced approximately 200 FTEs, mainly within the corporate support functions, where we reduced 18% of our headcount. We eliminated some outside services and initiated vendor negotiations for key services. The headcount and outside services actions to take -- to date have allowed us to secure most of our $60 million Fuel for Growth target for 2016. We are very comfortable to deliver this year's savings. 
Turning now to Slide 8. On a constant dollar basis, the fourth quarter EBIT was 3% below the prior year quarter, and the full year EBIT was aligned with 2014. Including currency impact, EBIT was down 13% in the fourth quarter and down 7% for the full year. The EBIT margin as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was slightly lower than the prior year quarter, as continued investments were not fully offset by the higher gross margin. EBIT margin as a percentage of sales for the full year increased by 30 basis points. 
I will now discuss EBIT for each segment, starting with Asia on Slide 9. In Q4, Asia delivered EBIT of $140 million, a decrease of 24% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, EBIT was 28% lower, mainly due to impact of the Chinese renminbi. The EBIT margin at 30% was lower than the fourth quarter 2014 and the third quarter '15. As we continued to invest, especially in China, these investments included price promotions on the locally manufactured products to protect competitiveness, along with A&P support for the fully imported product line introduced earlier this year. As Kasper mentioned, Greater China sales improved sequentially as a result of these investments. For the full year, the Asia EBIT margin at 33% remains the highest of our 3 segments. However, the EBIT margin was lower than in 2014, as lower sales and high demand-generation investments were not fully offset by the dairy benefit.
Latin America, on Slide #10, delivered EBIT of $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 15% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, EBIT declined 26%, as the region continued to have a large negative impact from currencies, most notably the Mexican peso. If we exclude the impact of Venezuela, where we intentionally reduced shipments, the segment's reported EBIT dollars for 2015 would have been in line with 2014 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. For the full year, Latin America EBIT margin improved slightly to 23.1%. Lower dairy costs more than offset the impact of the higher investments. 
Let me address North America and Europe on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, EBIT was $97 million, an increase of 14% on a constant dollar basis and 8% on a reported basis. In the midst of a tough top line comparison, gross margin continued to be strong. The team managed to maintain operating expense in line with the prior year quarter, while increasing A&P by 9% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, the North America/European EBIT margin was 28%, benefiting primarily from gross margin. I will now address our financial results from EBIT to net results on Slide #12.
The fourth quarter interest expense increased to approximately $22 million, reflecting the issuance of the new $1.5 billion notes to finance the share repurchase programs. During our October earnings call, we announced a new share repurchase program of $1.5 billion of the company's common stock, with $1 billion in the form an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR. The ASR was executed after the close of business on that same day. Under the accelerated share repurchase program, 10.7 million shares of stock were delivered in the quarter.
Following this portion of the ASR, the average number of shares in the fourth quarter were 189.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding shares were 186.4 million. It is expected that additional shares will be delivered in 2016 under the current ASR program. The ASR program was initially financed by a $1 billion term loan. Shortly thereafter, refinanced by the issuance notes, $750 million 5-year notes at a rate of 3% and $750 million 10-year notes at a rate of 4.125%. 
Taxes. For 2015, our non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 24.8% compared to 22.5% in 2014. The 2014 rate was unusually low as a result of a $0.05 per share nonrecurring tax benefit. Also, the 2015 ETR was also higher as a result of an unfavorable change in geographic earnings mix. 
Let me briefly address our EPS on Slide 13. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.78, a decline of $0.14 versus the prior year quarter. Sales negatively impacted EPS by $0.16, offset by gross margin benefit. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EPS by $0.10. Full year non-GAAP EPS were $3.44, slightly above the high end of our guidance. Versus the prior year, EPS declined by $0.30, with foreign exchange alone negatively impacting EPS by $0.26. The sales decline impacted EPS by $0.26 as well. Gross margin benefit was offset by additional A&P investments to support our innovation, especially our investments in China. 
Specified items. For 2015, specified items were $45 million or $0.17. The largest charge was $25 million. This occurred in the fourth quarter and was related to a restructuring provision for our Fuel for Growth productivity program. This was in line with expectations we highlighted in our third quarter earnings call. Including these specified items, EPS on a non-GAAP basis was $3.27. 
Let me finish the 2015 discussion with a high-level overview of the cash flow and balance sheet. Despite the challenging operating environment, we generated strong cash flow, which further strengthened our balance sheet. As you can see from Slide 14, free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $726 million during 2015, up 20% from the prior year. For 2015, capital expenditures were $174 million, consistent with our long-term goal of about 4% of sales. The most significant capital investment were to expand capacity at our European plant to support demand for the new China fully imported product line; and in the U.S., to support new liquids manufacturing.
Depreciation and amortization expenses was $99 million for the full year. For the full year 2015, we increased our dividends by 10% to $1.65 per share, resulting in a total dividend payment of $326 million. The total payout ratio was close to 50% of our net results. Our cash balance as of December 31 was $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million compared to December 2014. Nearly 90% of our cash is held outside of the United States. Our net debt position as of December 31 was less than $1.3 billion. 
I will now wrap up with a summary of our 2016 guidance on a non-GAAP basis on Slide 15. We forecast constant dollar sales in the range of 0% to 2% this year versus 2015. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, this would translate into 2016 sales 4% to 6% below the prior year on a reported basis. Please note that we expect tougher sales comparison in the first half of 2016 versus 2015. This is due in part to more favorable performance seen in China, and especially in the first quarter of 2015.
Constant dollar sales in Q1 2016 are expected to be in line or slightly higher above the Q4 2015 performance. The company expects a positive trend in the second half of 2016 on a constant dollar basis. We expect higher investments in A&P in the first half of 2016. As a result, we expect growth of non-GAAP EPS towards the second half of 2016. Please note that quarter 1 2016 non-GAAP EPS will have a tough comparison.
From an EPS guidance perspective, there are several key factors to consider. We expect that our gross margins will be around 64%, similar to the fourth quarter 2015 level. We entered into dairy contracts at attractive prices to secure more than 80% of our expected 2016 dairy needs. Nearly all of the expected $60 million Fuel for Growth savings will be reinvested in demand-generating activities to enable long-term market share improvement.
The benefit of all share repurchase in 2015, including the ASR program, net of interest expense, is expected to be an $0.11 benefit per share. EPS guidance includes an annual estimated adverse impact of currency rates as of January 2016, which is expected to be approximately $0.40 per share. Another 1% strengthening of the dollar against all currencies where we operate would lead to a further reduction in EPS of about $0.04 per share on a full year basis, just from translation.
Taking all of this into account, non-GAAP EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $3.48 to $3.60, excluding specified items. On a constant dollar basis, non-GAAP EPS guidance is expected to grow 9% to 12%. This excludes $0.11 from the benefit of the share repurchase program in 2015. The company expects to incur charges of approximately $25 million to $30 million associated with the Fuel for Growth program in 2016. Specified items, including charges related to Fuel for Growth, are expected to be approximately $0.12 per share. Therefore, GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.36 to $3.48, excluding future costs related to mark-to-market pension adjustments which are not reflected in the guidance.
This concludes my discussion on our quarter 4 and full year 2015 financial results. Thanks again for your time this morning. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

Let me briefly provide some summary remarks before we open the lines to your questions. I'm proud of many of the operational adjustments we made in the second half of 2015, when we were faced with significant change. Likewise, I feel good that our key strategies are paying off. Our multi-year investment in the United States was made because we believe in the potential of that market. Sales and margins have now rebounded and are helping us overcome challenges abroad. Likewise, our decision to reshape our portfolio in China and focus on new growing sales channels is showing signs of paying off.
Faced with macroeconomic challenges, we're making adjustments in other markets, too. Change is inevitable, and in many ways, businesses should be judged by how well they adjust and adapt, and I'm confident that we'll look back at the end of this year able to acknowledge that we did this quite well. 
Through last year, I repeatedly pointed to 4 important factors that critically influenced company performance. To remind you all, I'm referring to currency movements, dairy cost evolution, our ability to evolve our strategy and portfolio in China, and our momentum in North America, particularly in the United States. All of these 4 variables remain as relevant in 2016 as they were to our performance in 2015, but I should add pricing to the list. Our ability to offset, partially or in full, foreign exchange weakness with price increases will be very important. I'd add that I see some encouraging signs that price increases will become easier as we move through the year.
I'll close with the message that we'll continue to provide clear visibility on the impact of foreign exchange as we move through 2016. We'll do so by providing updates on both sales and profit growth, net of foreign exchange, in addition to our traditional non-GAAP earnings per share numbers. We hope you'll find this informative.
Operator, I'd now like to open the lines to questions. And because our prepared remarks have taken longer than anticipated, we're prepared to go a few minutes over if the questions merit doing so. Operator, over to you. Thank you."

I think we introduced the fully imported line of products into China sort of towards the back half really of the second quarter. And the fact that this product line is now already making up 35% of our sales in the mainland and 22% of our sales in the combined China/Hong Kong business, I think it's fairly impressive progress. I want to remind you also that -- of the message we gave on our Investor Day that we have confirmed our intention to enter the super-high premium category sometime in 2016. I'm sure you can understand that for competitive reasons, I'm not prepared to tell you what our plan timing is, but it goes without saying that we obviously have one. So I feel quite good about that. We now -- if I add the Hong Kong business and our fully imported line together, we've now got more than half of our sales in the China/Hong Kong business coming out of our Netherlands facility, and therefore, meeting consumer desire for imported quality. So I think we're managing that transition quite well. I'm satisfied with the progress we are making in baby stores also. We -- through much of last year, we discussed the fact that we were under-indexing in baby stores, which is one of the faster growing sales channels. But as of late, we've seen some fairly satisfactory improvements to our market shares in this channel, and I'm sure we'll continue to do so going forward."

I think, as you heard us talk about, we were quite some distance off managing to cover the impact of foreign exchange weakness through price in 2015. So that will be a continued challenge or task for us as we go through 2016. As I was trying to indicate, I think the pricing environment will become somewhat more friendly. What we saw in '15 was that there was still -- particularly, I would say, in Asia, there were still governments in Asia that were very resistant to price increases in our sector, as they still focused very much on kind of inflationary pressure or perceived inflationary pressure, which I think we all know was really a threat that evaporated sometime in 2014. And they would repeatedly point to the fact that we were seeing significant upside from dairy costs coming down as we discussed price increases. I think now that the dairy prices have stabilized, I believe that as both us and our competitors lap the low dairy costs, it will become a little bit more straightforward to raise prices. But we obviously have to do that in a responsible manner and we have to assess that in the context of general price inflation and wage inflation in the markets we operate in."

I don't want to speculate on whether those regulatory adjustments will address all of the imbalances that we are seeing currently in China, but I believe that they will begin to address some of them. At the moment, it's clear that, inadvertently, the China regulations have created a tilted playing field that is very much tilting in favor of imported products sold through e-commerce. I don't believe that, that was the intention of either the regulators or the China government at large, and I think they will find ways to address that. I also think that they remain concerned about the large number of smaller brands that have been created in China that really lack the expertise or the resources to guarantee consumer quality, and I think that would be addressed. So I think you're going to a whole slew of attempts, at least, by regulators to get at some of these issues through this year, but since you gave me a free pass on the timing, I'll probably take advantage of that, Amit."

It's not inconsistent with where we have been. And what we see in the North American business is that we get a lot of leverage on both sales and volume growth in that business. So put another way, our marginal costs are very low in that business, and hence, we see big swings in profitability as sales move up and down. So I'm quite comfortable. I feel good about where the margins are. And I think we've got other parts of our global portfolio where we are working in difficult trading environments, and that results in -- perhaps in margin pressure, so it's quite rewarding to see that this part of our portfolio has the opposite dynamic playing in its favor."

We indicated at Investor Day mid-single digit, and that is in line on what we're confirming now, despite the fact that we will have a higher headwind from currencies. I indicated in Investors Day that at that point of time, foreign exchange impact would have been around $0.15. Right now, we are looking at -- based on current spot rates, we're looking at a $0.40 impact from currencies. So we clearly looked into how we can mitigate that to still deliver mid-single-digit growth. On one hand side, like Kasper indicated, we clearly looked into pricing because that's an area where we think we need to be very cautious to see what can we do in certain markets, that's one. Two, I highlighted specifically, and referred also in an earlier question, on dairy benefits. We secured 80%, which is higher than we expected also in quarter 3. So that's one of the, whether you call it tactical or strategic initiatives, to secure the benefit to avoid volatility. And thirdly, like Kasper also indicated, we are clearly starting further assessments to see what can we do in terms of demand investments, and that will be leaning more towards mid of this year.

Thanks for joining our call. Let me begin by summarizing our first quarter performance before I expand on the headlines with additional detail from each of our reporting segments.

Let me begin by summarizing our first quarter performance before I expand on the headlines with additional detail from each of our reporting segments. My comments will focus on strategy and top line performance. Michel will then follow-up with additional financial analysis and elaborate on profitability and cash flow. 
Except noted otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results. At our Investor Day at October of last year, we laid out a three-year plan for value creation. We know that at the time that 2016 would be a year of transition. During our year end earnings call, I identified 3 key milestones we've used to monitor our progress against this plan. 
Firstly, our return to constant dollar sales growth, with the first step being sequential sales growth from fourth quarter 2015 to first quarter 2016. Well today, we're announcing constant dollar sales in the first quarter rose 1.5% above the prior quarter. 
Secondly, we said we'll deliver on our first-year commitments to reduce our overall operating expense base. And in the first quarter, our Fuel for Growth initiative delivered $20 million in expense reductions versus the prior year's first quarter. And we're well on our way to achieve our annual savings target. 
Thirdly, and finally, we said we'd invest a portion of our operating expense savings to fund key growth initiatives, both above and below the net sales line. In the first quarter, we continued to make strong investments in support of our strategy, especially in China. I'll expand on this a little later this morning. 
Turning now to our first quarter 2016 results. First quarter sales came in as expected at $962 million. As anticipated, this represented a sequential improvement in constant dollars over our fourth quarter 2015 number. This was our second successive quarter of sequential improvement in our underlying business, following the difficult second and third quarters of '15. 
Also as anticipated, our financial results were adversely impacted by currency movements to the tune of 600 basis points. Compared to same quarter of prior year's, sales were 6% lower in constant dollars, driven by 8% lower volume while price contributed 2 percentage points of growth. The unfavorable year-over-year comparison was mainly driven by tough base comparisons in our two largest markets and affecting the quarter itself are significantly reduced shipments to Venezuela. 
Given the large adverse currency impact, I'm pleased with the company's continued earnings power. Gross margin for the quarter remained slightly better than 64% and our EBIT margin was above 25% as our cost reduction initiatives began to take hold. 
Investment in advertising and promotion represented 15.8% of sales for the quarter. This was similar to the level seen through the second half of 2015. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.87. Michel will discuss how the most recent devaluation in Venezuela impacted our GAAP earnings. 
Elaborating on the sequential improvement in sales against the prior quarter, improvements in Asia and Latin America were key drivers of growth. I know you're all watching our performance in China closely. So I want to let you know that sequentially, we saw high single-digit percentage improvement in constant dollar sales in the world's biggest market. 
Simultaneously, we saw weaker sequential performance in our North America/Europe segment. I will expand on this in just a moment. 
Let me now briefly discuss progress against some of our major value creating strategic initiatives and let me begin with our growth initiatives before I then address cost reductions and investment optimization. As you know, last year, we began the expansion and transformation of our China brand portfolio to allow us to better meet consumer needs and participate in growing market segments and channels. In late March, we announced the imminent introduction of [indiscernible], a best-in-class premium brand into the China market. I'll return to this topic later. 
In China, we also are making good progress with our Enfamil branded line of fully imported products. And as we closed the quarter, these accounted for fully 45% of our sales in mainland China. 
Outside of China, in Southeast Asia and Latin America, we continued investment in our Enfamil franchise, promoting the benefits of our new plastics packaging and refill system. This is the same system many of you will know from retailer sales here in the United States. 
And domestically, in the United States, we are continuing to invest in our liquids portfolio, a category segment where we've historically underperformed. Our objective is to secure our fair share of this highly profitable market segment. 
Our determination to establish a segment for nutritionally fortified toddler milks in North America is also undiminished. Enfagrow remains a critical part of our growth strategy and we remain excited about its potential. 
Still in the United States, we had begun a test to see how we can leverage big data analysis in our substantial database capability to more precisely target consumers with relevant products and messages. To test this, we've introduced Enfamil Inspire, a new product deploying the same signs used in our China Infinitest products into limited retail distribution. We anticipate learning a great deal from this test and the initiative demonstrates our commitment to innovating our business model over time. 
Let me now turn to our effort to optimize our expense base. Our Fuel for Growth initiative is essential to our ability to sustain investments in growth while generating shareholder value through EPS growth over time. In the first quarter, we began to see the impact. We aim to reduce non-A&P operating expenses by at least $120 million over a 3-year period. We are making good progress against this target. And in the first quarter, reported SG&A expenses alone was 16% lower than a year earlier. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate or enhance our cost reduction plan. During the coming quarter, we anticipate making progress in our review of advertising and promotion expenditure and other investments in demand creation. We believe new approaches to media and the ongoing conversion to digital will allow for greater efficiency of spend in the mid to long-term. 
But given our substantial investment in new product introductions, we do not expect this initiative to translate into lower A&P percentages towards the end of this year. I'll now discuss in more detail the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with the North America and Europe segment. 
Overall, sales in this segment were less strong in the first quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Measured against the same quarter of 2015, constant dollar sales were weaker by 1% from volume and foreign exchange represented an additional headwind of 2 percentage points. 
The start to the year in our U.S. business was affected by market share losses from the highs we saw on the middle of 2015. On a positive note, we believe the strengthening labor market and workforce participation rates have caused a rise in breastfeeding rates to level off over the last 4 months or so. We are, of course, very focused on what we can control and we are constructing remedial plans to strengthen our market share in the United States, including through pricing actions. 
In Europe and Canada, I'm delighted to report that we are already enjoying record high market shares. As a consequence, we are seeing strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year. In both geographies, we're executing our strategies extremely well, demonstrating that when we do so, we can grow our business even in relatively mature markets. 
Let me now turn to Latin America. In constant dollars and excluding the impact of Venezuela, Latin America growth over the prior quarter, it was 7% higher compared to a year ago. However, when including the impact of suspended shipments to Venezuela, constant dollar sales were lower by 6%. Foreign exchange represented an additional significant headwind of 16%. And improved pricing of 7% was insufficient to fully offset this impact on reported sales. Across the whole region, we are seeing economies impacted by weaker commodity prices and, in several cases, political uncertainty. 
Though both countries are still recovering from currency depreciations, stronger business performance in Mexico and Colombia helped somewhat mitigate the impact of economic recessions in Brazil and Venezuela. We've previously described how we've chosen to make only limited shipments to Venezuela as we are constrained by our limited access locally to hard currency. We are very keen to help alleviate the acute product shortage in Venezuela and restore supply and we're working with the government to find a solution. But until one is found, we expect very limited sales in Venezuela. 
Brazil is going through a well-prophesied economic recession. The impact on consumer and business confidence is manifesting itself in softer demand for discretionary items. And we are feeling the impact most acutely within our children's category. Our infant formula sales are holding up relatively better. We remain excited about the country's long-term potential but we do not anticipate a substantial improvement within this year. 
As mentioned, we enjoyed a strong start to the year in Mexico where our modifier brands recovered somewhat from the weakness in mid-2015. Our infant formula and toddler business gained market share in the first quarter as new packaging and revised messaging behind an improved formulation resonated to consumers. 
Though I recognize we can't quantify the extent to which Colombia may be benefiting from informal parallel exports to neighboring Venezuela, we believe increased market share is the main driver of very strong double-digit sales growth there. 
And finally, our business in the Caribbean and Central America grew by high single digits over the prior year same quarter. In most of these markets, we transacted dollars and, hence, the region remains a stabilizing factor in an inherently volatile segment. 
I'll turn now to our Asia segment. As mentioned in my global overview, we saw a strong single-digit sequential improvement in constant dollar sales in Asia. China grew faster than the segment as a whole, but Thailand and Malaysia also improved over the previous quarter. Despite our strong sequential improvement, year-over-year sales comparison was unfavorable. Volume was lower by 9%, mainly reflecting the fact that we've still not returned to the year ago sales levels in China and Hong Kong. Price was in line with the prior year with improved product mix offsetting the impact of [indiscernible] promotional activity. 
In Thailand and Malaysia, the sequential comparison was helped by nonrepeating retail inventory reductions referenced in our fourth quarter earnings call. Malaysian consumers appear to be adjusting spending habits in response to the VAT introduction and currency-related inflation of 2015. Consequently, we expect more stable performance from Malaysia going forward. The Thai economy remains relatively weaker and we are a little more cautious about a rapid turn around there. We're maintaining investment levels and, in fact, seeking to strengthen our position in anticipation of an eventual recovery in economic growth. Inherently, Thailand is a great market for us and we have a very experienced team on the grand. Longer-term, I'm confident in our prospects there. 
In Vietnam, we've seen opportunities to improve our execution. The market somewhat underperformed against our expectations in 2015 and in the most recent quarter. But our team is focused on the right issues and putting in place plans to strengthen performance in the second half of the year. 
Because our businesses in Indonesia is relatively small, we don't often talk about our performance in this large market. However, over the last 12 months, we've developed a more focused geographic strategy for the country and our improved focused appear to be helping. Sales grew strongly in the first quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. It's clear that we would like to build a bigger business in this high potential market, but we remain realistic about our scale and the challenges to realizing our ambition organically. 
Let me close on China. The China market continues to evolve quickly and we're still assessing the full impact of recent changes to duty structure and regulatory frameworks. Over the last year or so, I have repeatedly stated my belief that regulatory changes were put in China. And more evenhanded duty structure is in my mind likely to be just the first of several important changes being driven by the Chinese government. The focus remains on consumer safety. And the requirement that all infant formula and children's products, regardless of sales channel, be registered in China, is a key part of the government efforts to safeguard the consumer. We are supportive of these efforts to protect consumers by ensuring products and labels meet Chinese standards, regardless of how and from where they are sold. 
Before I discuss the performance of our China business, I want to remind you of the broad China strategy we laid out for you more than a year ago. We promised we would reshape our product portfolio to better satisfy consumers preference for imported premium products. And once we have the right portfolio, we will then commit the resources to strengthen our performance in higher growth sales channels. Since then, we've introduced a fully imported line of our Enfamil branded products. And after the close of the first quarter, we introduced a new product offering into the highest priced market segment. Enfinitas, as we'd likely call this new offer, contains our best science and was developed incorporating understanding gained from our extensive studies of breast milk, nutrition and metabolism. 
In addition to our long proven industry-leading levels of DHA and AHA, the products contain boosted levels of lactoferrin and milk fat globular membranes, ingredients closely associated with both neuro and immune system development. Though this new technology is costly, we believe Chinese parents would once again confirm that they're willing to invest in their child's future. We now have the right portfolio to win. With both consumers and retailers. Helped by our recent introductions, baby stores became our largest sales channel in the latest quarter and both this channel and the e-commerce channel grew in excess of 20% over the same quarter of last year. 
And despite cannibalization from our imported line, sales of our locally manufactured product line appeared to have stabilized in response to a stronger defensive stops and increased promotional competitiveness. 
I know you all share my interest in the price promotion on the environment in China. Let me give you my perspective. It's clear to us that some competitors push sales aggressively in the fourth quarter of 2015. And as a result, I'm now providing additional discounts to clear inventory overhang from distributors and retailers. Though we will, of course, act to protect our market share, we take a different approach. We simply do not believe Chinese consumers are significantly motivated by lower prices, even though retailers may well be. Rather, Chinese consumers are amongst the world's most discerning and they continue to show a willingness to pay for superior quality and nutrition. This is evidenced by the continued shift towards higher-priced segments. 
Our view is supported by the fact that sequentially, price in fact was a positive contributor to our growth in China in the latest quarter, the positive effect of product mix more than offsetting the effect of promotional spend. 
In response to the successful execution of our strategy, our performance in China improved substantially over the prior quarter with constant dollar sales, as mentioned, showing a high single-digit percentage improvement. 
Commenting now on our outlook for the full year 2016. I reiterate that company guidance for modest constant dollar sales growth between 0% and 2%. Based on current exchange rate assumptions, we expect this to translate into an unfavorable sales comparison in U.S. dollars of between 4% and 6%. 
As advised in our January call, we expect to deliver 9% to 12% growth in constant dollar EPS. Based on this, we also reiterate our guidance for full-year non-GAAP EPS between $3.48 and $3.60. 
I'll now hand over to Michel who will provide additional details on our financial performance. I will then return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."

Today I will discuss the company's first quarter 2016 financial results.

Today I will discuss the company's first quarter 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results by segment and wrap up with a cash flow analysis and summary of our full-year guidance. 
Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to their impact on the translation of local currency, financial statements into the United States dollars. 
Let me start with sales. As shown on Slide 3, on a sequential basis, from the fourth quarter of 2015, constant dollar sales grew by 1.5%. Nearly all of our large markets grew sequentially. And most notably, China. When you review the 5 quarter sequential trend, sales were strongest in the first quarter of 2015 and started to decline in the second quarter. As 2015 progressed, we invested to protect competitiveness, launched new products and we're able to stabilize sales in the fourth quarter. 
In the first quarter, we continued to invest. We rolled out new innovation and selectively increased prices in some markets to compensate for the continued currency devaluations. Consistent with my stated expectation last quarter, I would like to remind you that the second quarter 2016 year-over-year comparison will continue to be tough on a constant dollar basis. Although we should see an improvement in the second quarter performance. 
First quarter sales on a reported basis were 12% below and constant dollar sales were 6% below the prior year quarter. Adverse foreign exchange rate contributed a 600 basis point decline. 
Slide 4 summarizes the impact of foreign exchange on sales and EPS. The U.S. dollar continued to be strong in the first quarter of 2016 and has effect on translation of local currency, [indiscernible] impacted all reporting segments. The first quarter decline of 6% was the same percentage as both the third and fourth quarter of 2015. Half of the negative currency impact in the first quarter were from the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso and the Argentinian peso. The balance of the adverse foreign exchange impact was widespread across the regions. We continue to expect an approximately 6% adverse foreign exchange impact on sales for the full year 2016. 
I will address the foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well. I will now move to factors that impact our gross margins on Slide 5. Gross margins was 64.1% in the first quarter of 2016. This was a similar margin percentage to the first quarter of 2015 and in line with our expectations for the full year. 
Sales impacted from positive mix and pricing was affected by higher trade investments resulting in a slight gross margin decline. Manufacturing cost negatively impacted margin due to lower volume absorption and higher cost of innovation and inflation. 
Low dairy cost was the largest benefit to our gross margin in quarter 1, and more than offset higher conversion costs and of our commodities increases. We expect to see daily benefits in the second quarter. 
As you can see, we continued to deliver productivity savings within our cost of goods sold. Also [indiscernible] had already secured commitments for nearly 90% of our 2016 productivity goals. 
Moving to operating expenses, I will start with advertising and promotion investments on Slide 6. A&P was 15.8% of sales in the first quarter compared to 13.2% in the prior year quarter. This was an increase of 11% on a constant dollar basis. The incremental investments were mainly to support our key China initiatives. Historically, the company had a lower A&P spending in the first quarter of the year. Since our China fully imported product line was launched in the middle of last year, we continued strong investments in the first quarter of 2016, especially fertilization, digital and e-commerce media. In addition, we supported the investment of new innovation rollout in selected markets. 
With the April 2016 launch of our super high premium products, we expect A&P as a percentage of sales to be high in the second quarter  As you can see on this slide, when we launched the China fully import product in the second quarter of 2015, our total A&P as a percentage of sales went up significantly. We can expect that in the second quarter of 2016 as well. 
Turning to Slide 7. The increase in A&P was offset by a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. This is in line with the strategy we outlined at Investor Day, that 2016 will be a year of transition with a focus on investments. 
On a constant dollar basis, SG&A was 10% lower than the first quarter of 2015. Approximately $20 million of the SG&A reduction is attributed to our Fuel for Growth initiative, which I will address on the next slide. 
Slide 8 shows that our Fuel for Growth initiative had a strong start in the first quarter. On a constant dollar basis, we delivered cost reduction of 10% for the first quarter of 2015, especially in our support functions. While we have made some reductions in the regional offices, about 3 quarters of the reduction was from corporate headquarter functions, which decreased by approximately 30% on a like-for-like constant-currency basis. Of the corporate headquarter reductions, more than half was from outside services and the balance were personnel related. To date, we have secured over 90% of our planned 2016 reductions. And we are ahead of schedule. At the same time, we constrained sales forces and distribution spending to remain relatively flat to prior year on a constant dollar basis. 
Turning now to Slide 9 for a discussion of EBIT. Let me start this analysis per segment. In the first quarter, Asia delivered an EBIT of $169 million, a decrease of 22% on a constant dollar basis. An incremental 5% decrease came from the adverse foreign exchange impact, largely driven from the Chinese renminbi, Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit. The Asia EBIT margin at 33.8% improved 390 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, yet was 600 basis points lower than the first quarter 2015. The main year-over-year drivers were lower sales and increased channel investment and promotional activities. 
Investments continued throughout the Asian region to support our innovation launches. The most significant investments were in China, including competitive price promotions on the locally manufactured products and investments for the fully imported product line. 
Latin America delivered an EBIT of $41 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 11% on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT decline was due to lower sales mainly in Venezuela, yet the decline was somewhat offset by lower A&P investments. Excluding the impact of the Venezuelan business, the Latin America EBIT on a constant dollar basis increased 22% compared to prior year. 
For the segment, adverse foreign exchange impacted EBIT 18%, largely from the Mexican peso. On a reported basis, EBIT was 29% lower than prior year. The Latin America EBIT margin was 25.5% for the first quarter 2016 compared to 28% for the same quarter last year. The 250 basis point decline was from lower sales, mainly Venezuela, somewhat offset by lower A&P and sales force spending. 
For the first quarter, North America and Europe EBIT was $82 million, an increase of 9% on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 27.2% was 190 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Despite lower sales, gross margin remained strong from the dairy benefit, with an operating expenses reduction in the SG&A was selectively invested to support new product innovations while a portion of the savings drove higher EBIT margins. 
As mentioned on the Fuel for Growth slide, corporate and other delivered significant benefit to EBIT. For the total company, the first quarter EBIT of $244 million was 10% below the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. Adverse exchange nearly doubled the impact, resulting in a reported EBIT down 19%. The decline was due to lower sales, somewhat offset by improved operating expenses. The EBIT margin of 25.4% of sales was 200 basis points lower than prior year quarter. The first quarter 2015 EBIT of 27.4% was high due to under spending on A&P. As 2015 progressed, A&P increased and annual 2015 EBIT came in at 24.1%. 
I will now address our financial results from EBIT to net income on Slide 10. The increase in interest expense reflects the full quarterly impact of the November 2015 1.5 billion notes. The significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase program. As a reminder, 10.7 million shares of stock were received in the first quarter. The balance of shares will be delivered at the end of the agreement, which is scheduled to conclude in the second quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 23.2% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 22.5% in the prior year quarter. The first quarter 2015 rate was lower as a result of the more favorable geographic earnings mix that did not prevail for the full year. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.87. 
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the changes to EPS on Slide 11. In the first quarter, non-GAAP EPS declined $0.12 on a constant dollar basis versus prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit negatively impacted EPS by $0.16. The increase in A&P was offset by Fuel for Growth savings. The ASR delivered $0.03 benefit net of higher interest expense. Half of the $0.12 decline in non-GAAP EPS on a constant dollar was a result of the temporarily suspension of shipments to Venezuela in the first quarter of 2016. Foreign exchange adversely impact EPS by $0.10. 
Let me address specified items. Since we took a significant specified charge in the first quarter, let me briefly explain what drove the Venezuelan change noted on Slide 12. 
In March 2016, the Venezuelan government changed the exchange rate system from a 3 to a 2-tier structure. There were 2 significant impacts to our business. First, the SICAD rate was eliminated. This was the rate we previously used to translate our net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. As a result, we adopted the floating rate now called DCOM. For reference only, the most recent SICAD rate was 13.5 and the DCOM rate at the end of the quarter was approximately 273 and continued to devalue in April. The remeasurement impacts from adopting the DCOM rate was a $32 million loss impacting monetary assets. 
Second, as the DCOM rate also impacts the translation of our local earnings to U.S. dollar, our future results of Venezuela business are impacted. This triggered an impairment review of Venezuelan's long-lived assets. Following that process, we concluded there was $46 million impairment of our long-lived assets. Due to the Venezuelan change, Fuel for Growth and pension remeasurement charges specified items for the first quarter was $0.48 per share, including these specified items, GAAP EPS was $0.39. 
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movement. On Slide 13, the cash balance of $1.7 billion as of March was similar to the year-end balance. Cash from operating activities was lower than the prior-year period. Cash flows reflected lower sales and the negative impact from other working capital. And an unusual item on this chart is the sizable foreign exchange impact on cash. This was mainly due to the abduction of the new exchange rate and the remeasurement of our monetary assets in Venezuela. 
In summary, the cash generated from operations this quarter was used to pay dividends and capital commitments. For the full year, our capital spending goal remains about 4% of sales. 
To summarize, our annual guidance on Slide 14. We expect full year 2015 constant dollar growth in the range of 0% to 2%. We continue to anticipate tough comparisons for the first half year 2016. And we do not expect to report positive revenue growth in the same quarter of prior year until the second half in 2016. We reaffirm our 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance and the range of $3.48 to $3.60. Primarily due to the first quarter charges rate to Venezuela, fully specified items are now expected to be $0.57 per share. Therefore, our updated 2016 GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $2.91 to $3.03. GAAP EPS will change as a result of future mark-to-market pension adjustments, which we cannot estimate at this time. 
This concludes my discussion on our first quarter financial results. Thanks again for your time this morning and I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

Firstly, we are satisfied with the sequential improvement in constant dollar revenue. Secondly, we are pleased with the improvement we're seeing in China and we remain focused on the successful execution of our previously outlined China strategy. Thirdly, we do not underestimate the challenges we are facing in an uncertain global economic environment. Despite these challenges, we believe the balance within our global portfolio will allow us to complete 2016, which we've often referred to as a year of transition, as planned. We are therefore reiterating our prior guidance for modest full-year constant dollar sales growth between 0% and 2%. We are confident that sequential constant dollar sales for the first half of 2016 will be stronger than the second half of prior year. And within 2016, sales in the second 6-month period will be stronger than the first half of the year. For the year, we expect foreign exchange to adversely affect translation into our reporting currency by 600 basis points. We also are confirming unchanged non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.48 to $3.60.

So obviously, we feel like we are putting our best foot forward and we are optimistic about our prospects. In the U.S., it's a little bit different. And I think what we are doing in the U.S. is really experimenting with a different business model. We believe that based on our increased mastery of, sort of, big data analysis and our own database and our knowledge of the U.S. consumers, we are able to quite precisely target consumers in the market that might be more likely to be interested in a premium nutrition proposition and willing to pay the price that goes with that. So we've begun a test initially with very limited retail distribution. I think we'll assess how that test proceeds through the year and then we'll decide whether we will expand distribution from where we currently are. But the signs used in the two products is identical. There are some minor variations that are required by different regulations and different quality standards needed in the two markets. But the base signs is essentially the same."

We -- as you know, we have a large ongoing effort underway within the company to continually enhance our understanding of breastmilk in particular and how we can incorporate the latest signs associated with breastmilk in enhanced form, in some cases, into formulas. We've acted on some of that. We have raised the levels, as I mentioned, of lactoferrin, which is naturally present in very low levels in all, in most formulas, I shouldn't say all, but most. And we have incorporated elevated levels as well, significantly elevated levels of milk fat globular membranes, which is just what it says it is. Both of these ingredients are sort of closely associated with physiological development, either new or immune system development of -- for infants. The second ingredient is in somewhat scarce supply in the world and we believe that though people can talk about it, it will take some time for people to get to the levels we are at. But most importantly, I think, it's the understanding of how the ingredients work and then we've incorporated that into quite unique packaging in the marketplaces where we packed it with you advertising and digital capabilities.

The speed of implementation between the different ports in China have varied quite a bit at the moment as one would expect. But we're definitely seeing, what shall we say, unofficial flows of products becoming more difficult. Now that of course is an opportunity for the products that we bring into China in a more orderly fashion.

Let me begin by summarizing our first quarter performance before I then expand on the headlines with additional detail from each of our reporting segments. My comments will focus on strategy and top line performance. Michel will then follow-up with additional financial analysis and elaborate on profitability and cash flow.
Except noted otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results.
At our Investor Day in October of last year, we laid out a 3-year plan for value creation. We know that at the time that 2016 would be a year of transition.
During our year-end earnings call, I identified 3 key milestones we've used to monitor our progress against this plan. Firstly, a return to constant dollar sales growth, with the first step being sequential sales growth from fourth quarter 2015 to first quarter 2016. Well, today, we're announcing constant dollar sales in the first quarter rose 1.5% above the prior quarter.
Secondly, we said we'd deliver on our first year commitments to reduce our overall operating expense base. And in the first quarter, our Fuel for Growth initiative delivered $20 million in expense reductions versus the prior year's first quarter, and we are well on our way to achieve our annual savings targets.
Thirdly, and finally, we said we'd invest a portion of our operating expense savings to fund key growth initiatives, both above and below the net sales line. In the first quarter, we continued to make strong investments in support of our strategy, especially in China. I'll expand on this a little later this morning.
Turning now to our first quarter 2016 results. First quarter sales came in as expected at $962 million. As anticipated, this represented a sequential improvement in constant dollars over our fourth quarter 2015 number. This was our second successive quarter of sequential improvement in our underlying business following the difficult second and third quarters of '15.
Also, as anticipated, our financial results were adversely impacted by currency movements to the tune of 600 basis points. Compared to the same quarter of prior year's, sales were 6% lower in constant dollars, driven by 8% lower volume, while price contributed 2 percentage points of growth. The unfavorable year-over-year comparison was mainly driven by tough base comparisons in our 2 largest markets and affecting the quarter itself are significantly reduced shipments to Venezuela.
Given the large adverse currency impact, I'm pleased with the company's continued earnings power. Gross margin for the quarter remained slightly better than 64% and our EBIT margin was above 25% as our cost reduction initiatives began to take hold.
Investment in advertising and promotion represented 15.8% of sales for the quarter. This was similar to the level seen through the second half of 2015.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.87. Michel will discuss how the most recent devaluation in Venezuela impacted our GAAP earnings.
Elaborating on the sequential improvement in sales against the prior quarter, improvements in Asia and Latin America were key drivers of growth. I know you're all watching our performance in China closely. So I want to let you know that, sequentially, we saw high single-digit percentage improvement in constant dollar sales in the world's biggest market.
Simultaneously, we saw weaker sequential performance in our North America/Europe segment. I will expand on this in just a moment.
Let me now briefly discuss progress against some of our major value-creating strategic initiatives, and let me begin with our growth initiatives before I then address cost reductions and investment optimization.
As you know, last year, we began the expansion and transformation of our China brand portfolio to allow us to better meet consumer needs and participate in growing market segments and channels. In late March, we announced the immediate introduction of Enfinitas, a best-in-class premium brand, into the China market. I'll return to this topic later.
In China, we also are making good progress with our Enfamil branded line of fully-imported products. And as we closed the quarter, these accounted for fully 45% of our sales in mainland China.
Outside of China, in Southeast Asia and Latin America, we continued investment in our Enfamil franchise, promoting the benefits of our new plastics packaging and refill system. This is the same system many of you would know from retailer sales here in the United States.
And domestically, in the United States, we are continuing to invest in our liquids portfolio, a category segment where we've historically underperformed. Our objective is to secure our fair share of this highly-profitable market segment.
Our determination to establish a segment for nutritionally-fortified toddler milks in North America is also undiminished. Enfagrow remains a critical part of our growth strategy, and we remain excited about its potential.
Still in the United States, we had begun a test to see how we can leverage big data analysis and our substantial database capability to more precisely target consumers with relevant products and messages. To test this, we've introduced Enfamil Enspire, a new product deploying the same science used in our China Enfinitas products, into limited retail distribution. We anticipate learning a great deal from this test, and the initiative demonstrates our commitment to innovating our business model over time.
Let me now turn to our effort to optimize our expense base. Our Fuel for Growth initiative is essential to our ability to sustain investments in growth, while generating shareholder value through EPS growth over time.
In the first quarter, we began to see the impact. We aim to reduce non-A&P operating expenses by at least $120 million over a 3-year period. We are making good progress against this target. And in the first quarter, reported SG&A expenses alone was 16% lower than a year earlier.
We also continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate or enhance our cost reduction plan. During the coming quarter, we anticipate making progress in our review of advertising and promotion expenditure and other investments in demand creation. We believe new approaches to media and the ongoing conversion to digital will allow for greater efficiency of spend in the mid to long-term. But given our substantial investment in new product introductions, we do not expect this initiative to translate into lower A&P percentages towards the end of this year.
I'll now discuss in more detail the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with the North America/Europe segment. Overall, sales in this segment were less strong in the first quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Measured against the same quarter of 2015, constant dollar sales were weaker by 1% from volume and foreign exchange represented an additional headwind of 2 percentage points.
The start to the year in our U.S. business was affected by market share losses from the highs we saw in the middle of 2015. On a positive note, we believe the strengthening labor market and workforce participation rates have caused a rise in breastfeeding rates to level off over the last 4 months or so. We are, of course, very focused on what we can control and we are constructing remedial plans to strengthen our market share in the United States, including through pricing actions.
In Europe and Canada, I'm delighted to report that we are already enjoying record-high market shares. As a consequence, we are seeing strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year. In both geographies, we are executing our strategies extremely well, demonstrating that, when we do so, we can grow our business even in relatively mature markets.
Let me now turn to Latin America. In constant dollars and excluding the impact of Venezuela, Latin America grows over the prior quarter and was 7% higher compared to a year ago. However, when including the impact of suspended shipments to Venezuela, constant dollar sales were lower by 6%. Foreign exchange represented an additional significant headwind of 16%. An improved pricing of 7% was insufficient to fully offset this impact on reported sales. Across the whole region, we are seeing economies impacted by weaker commodity prices and, in several cases, political uncertainty.
Though both countries are still recovering from currency depreciations, stronger business performance in Mexico and Colombia helped somewhat mitigate the impact of economic recessions in Brazil and Venezuela. We've previously described how we've chosen to make only limited shipments to Venezuela as we are constrained by our limited access locally to hard currency. We are very keen to help alleviate the acute product shortage in Venezuela and restore supply, and we're working with the government to find a solution. But until one is found, we expect very limited sales in Venezuela.
Brazil is going through a well-prophesied economic recession. The impact on consumer and business confidence is manifesting itself in softer demand for discretionary items. And we are feeling the impact most acutely within our children's category. Our infant formula sales are holding up relatively better. We remain excited about the country's long-term potential, but we do not anticipate a substantial improvement within this year.
As mentioned, we enjoyed a strong start to the year in Mexico, where our milk modifier brands recovered somewhat from the weakness in mid-2015. Our infant formula and toddler business gained market share in the first quarter as new packaging and revised messaging behind an improved formulation resonated to consumers.
Though I recognize we can't quantify the extent to which Colombia may be benefiting from informal parallel exports to neighboring Venezuela, we believe increased market share is the main driver of very strong double-digit sales growth there.
And finally, our business in the Caribbean and Central America grew by high single-digits over the prior year's same quarter. In most of these markets, we transacted dollars and, hence, the region remains a stabilizing factor in an inherently volatile segment.
I'll turn now to our Asia segment. As mentioned in my global overview, we saw a strong single-digit sequential improvement in constant dollar sales in Asia. China grew faster than the segment as a whole, but Thailand and Malaysia also improved over the previous quarter.
Despite our strong sequential improvement, year-over-year sales comparison was unfavorable. Volume was lower by 9%, mainly reflecting the fact that we've still not returned to the year ago sales levels in China and Hong Kong. Price was in line with the prior year, with improved product mix offsetting the impact of added promotional activity.
In Thailand and Malaysia, the sequential comparison was helped by non-repeating retail inventory reductions referenced in our fourth quarter earnings call. 
Malaysian consumers appear to be adjusting spending habits in response to the VAT introduction and currency-related inflation of 2015. Consequently, we expect more stable performance from Malaysia going forward.
The Thai economy remains relatively weaker, and we're a little more cautious about a rapid turnaround there. We are maintaining investment levels and, in fact, seeking to strengthen our position in anticipation of an eventual recovery in economic growth. Inherently, Thailand is a great market for us and we have a very experienced team on the ground. Longer-term, I'm confident in our prospects there.
In Vietnam, we have seen opportunities to improve our execution. The market somewhat underperformed against our expectations in 2015 and in the most recent quarter, but our team is focused on the right issues and putting in place plans to strengthen performance in the second half of the year.
Because our businesses in Indonesia is relatively small, we don't often talk about our performance in this large market. However, over the last 12 months, we've developed a more focused geographic strategy for the country, and our improved focus appear to be helping. Sales grew strongly in the first quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. It's clear that we would like to build a bigger business in this high-potential market, but we remain realistic about our scale and the challenges to realizing our ambition organically.
Let me close on China. The China market continues to evolve quickly and we are still assessing the full impact of recent changes to duty structure and regulatory frameworks. Over the last year or so, I have repeatedly stated my belief that regulatory changes were put in China. And more evenhanded duty structure is, in my mind, likely to be just the first of several important changes being driven by the Chinese government. The focus remains on consumer safety. And the requirement that all infant formula and children's products, regardless of sales channel, be registered in China is a key part of the government's efforts to safeguard the consumer. We're supportive of these efforts to protect consumers by ensuring products and labels meet Chinese standards, regardless of how and from where they are sold.
Before I discuss the performance of our China business, I want to remind you of the broad China strategy we laid out for you more than a year ago. We promised we would reshape our product portfolio to better satisfy consumer's preference for imported premium products. And once we have the right portfolio, we will then commit the resources to strengthen our performance in higher growth sales channels.
Since then, we have introduced a fully-imported line of our Enfamil branded products. And after the close of the first quarter, we introduced a new product offering into the highest priced market segment. Enfinitas, as we have aptly called this new offering, contains our best science and was developed incorporating understanding gained from our extensive studies of breast milk, nutrition and metabolism.
In addition to our long-proven, industry-leading levels of DHA and ARA -- AHA, the products contained boosted levels of lactoferrin and milk fat globular membranes, ingredients closely associated with both neuro and immune system development. Though this new technology is costly, we believe Chinese parents would once again confirm that they're willing to invest in their child's future.
We now have the right portfolio to win with both consumers and retailers. Helped by our recent introductions, baby stores became our largest sales channel in the latest quarter, and both this channel and the e-commerce channel grew in excess of 20% over the same quarter of last year. And despite cannibalization from our imported line, sales of our locally-manufactured product line appeared to have stabilized in response to stronger defensive stops and increased promotional competitiveness.
I know you all share my interest in the price promotional environment in China. Let me give you my perspective. It's clear to us that some competitors push sales aggressively in the fourth quarter of 2015. And as a result, I'm now providing additional discounts to clear inventory overhang from distributors and retailers. Though we will, of course, act to protect our market share, we take a different approach. We simply do not believe Chinese consumers are significantly motivated by lower prices, even though retailers may well be. Rather, Chinese consumers are amongst the world's most discerning and they continue to show a willingness to pay for superior quality and nutrition. This is evidenced by the continued shift towards higher-priced segments.
Our view is supported by the fact that, sequentially, price, in fact, was a positive contributor to our growth in China in the latest quarter, the positive effect of product mix more than offsetting the effect of promotional spend.
In response to the successful execution of our strategy, our performance in China improved substantially over the prior quarter, with constant dollar sales, as mentioned, showing a high single-digit percentage improvement.
Commenting now on our outlook for the full year 2016. I reiterate that company guidance for modest constant dollar sales growth between 0% and 2%. Based on current exchange rate assumptions, we expect this to translate into an unfavorable sales comparison in U.S. dollars of between 4% and 6%.
As advised in our January call, we expect to deliver 9% to 12% growth in constant dollar EPS. Based on this, we also reiterate our guidance for full year non-GAAP EPS between $3.48 and $3.60.
I'll now hand over to Michel who will provide additional details on our financial performance. I will then return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."

I will then briefly highlight EBIT results by segment and wrap up with a cash flow analysis and summary of our full year guidance.Un",2102,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's first quarter 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results by segment and wrap up with a cash flow analysis and summary of our full year guidance.
Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to their impact on the translation of local currency, financial statement into the United States dollars.
Let me start with sales. As shown on Slide 3, on a sequential basis, from the fourth quarter of 2015, constant dollar sales grew by 1.5%. Nearly all of our large markets grew sequentially and, most notably, China. When you review the 5-quarter sequential trend, sales were strongest in the first quarter of 2015 and started to decline in the second quarter. As 2015 progressed, we invested to protect competitiveness, launched new products and were able to stabilize sales in the fourth quarter.
In the first quarter, we continued to invest. We rolled out new innovation and selectively increased prices in some markets to compensate for the continued currency devaluations. Consistent with my stated expectation last quarter, I would like to remind you that the second quarter of 2016 year-over-year comparison will continue to be tough on a constant dollar basis, although we should see an improvement in the second quarter performance.
First quarter sales on a reported basis were 12% below and constant dollar sales were 6% below the prior year quarter. Adverse foreign exchange rate contributed a 600 basis point decline.
Slide 4 summarizes the impact of foreign exchange on sales and EPS. The U.S. dollar continued to be strong in the first quarter of 2016 and its effect on the translation of local currency negatively impacted all reporting segments. The first quarter decline of 6% was the same percentage as both the third and the fourth quarter of 2015. Half of the negative currency impact in the first quarter were from the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso and the Argentinian peso. The balance of the adverse foreign exchange impact was widespread across the regions. We continue to expect an approximately 6% adverse foreign exchange impact on sales for the full year 2016. I will address the foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well.
I will now move to factors that impact our gross margins on Slide 5. Gross margins was 64.1% in the first quarter of 2016. This was a similar margin percentage to the first quarter of 2015 and in line with our expectations for the full year.
Sales impacted from positive mix and pricing was affected by higher trade investments resulting in a slight gross margin decline. Manufacturing conversion cost negatively impacted margin due to lower volume absorption and higher cost of innovation and inflation.
Low dairy cost was the largest benefit to our gross margin in quarter 1 and more than offset higher conversion cost and other commodities increases. We expect to see dairy benefits in the second quarter.
As you can see, we continued to deliver productivity savings within our cost of goods sold. Also [indiscernible] has already secured commitments for nearly 90% of our 2016 productivity goals.
Moving to operating expenses, I will start with advertising and promotion investments on Slide 6. A&P was 15.8% of sales in the first quarter compared to 13.2% in the prior year quarter. This was an increase of 11% on a constant dollar basis. The incremental investments were mainly to support our key China initiatives.
Historically, the company had a lower A&P spending in the first quarter of the year. Since our China fully-imported product line was launched in the middle of last year, we continued strong investments in the first quarter of 2016, especially fertilization, digital and e-commerce media. In addition, we supported the investment of new innovation rollout in selected markets.
With the April 2016 launch of our super high premium products, we expect A&P as a percentage of sales to be high in the second quarter. As you can see on this slide, when we launched the China fully-imported product in the second quarter of 2015, our total A&P as a percentage of sales went up significantly. We can expect that in the second quarter of 2016 as well.
Turning to Slide 7. The increase in A&P was offset by reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. This is in line with the strategy we outlined at Investor Day, that 2016 will be a year of transition with a focus on investments.
On a constant dollar basis, SG&A was 10% lower than the first quarter of 2015. Approximately $20 million of the SG&A reduction is attributed to our Fuel for Growth initiative, which I will address on the next slide.
Slide 8 shows that our Fuel for Growth initiative had a strong start in the first quarter. On a constant dollar basis, we delivered cost reduction of 10% for the first quarter of 2015, especially in our support functions. While we have made some reductions in the region offices, about 3/4 of the reduction was from corporate headquarter functions, which decreased by approximately 30% on a like-for-like constant currency basis. Of the corporate headquarter reductions, more than half was from outside services, and the balance were personnel-related. To-date, we have secured over 90% of our planned 2016 reductions, and we are ahead of schedule. At the same time, we constrained sales forces and distribution spending to remain relatively flat to prior year on a constant dollar basis.
Turning now to Slide 9 for a discussion of EBIT. Let me start this analysis per segment. In the first quarter, Asia delivered an EBIT of $169 million, a decrease of 22% on a constant dollar basis. An incremental 5% decrease came from the adverse foreign exchange impact, largely driven from the Chinese renminbi, Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit. The Asia EBIT margin, at 33.8%, improved 390 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, yet was 600 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2015. The main year-over-year drivers were lower sales and increased channel investment and promotional activities.
Investment continued throughout the Asian region to support our innovation launches. The most significant investment were in China, including competitive price promotions on the locally-manufactured products and investment for the fully-imported product line.
Latin America delivered an EBIT of $41 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 11% on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT decline was due to lower sales mainly in Venezuela, yet the decline was somewhat offset by lower A&P investments. Excluding the impact of the Venezuelan business, the Latin America EBIT on a constant dollar basis increased 22% compared to prior year.
For the segment, adverse foreign exchange impacted by EBIT 18%, largely from the Mexican peso. On a reported basis, EBIT was 29% lower than prior year.
The Latin America EBIT margin was 25.5% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 28% for the same quarter last year. The 250 basis points decline was from lower sales, mainly Venezuela, somewhat offset by lower A&P and sales force spending.
For the first quarter, North America and Europe EBIT was $82 million, an increase of 9% on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 27.2% was 190 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Despite lower sales, gross margin remained strong from the dairy benefit, with an operating expenses reduction in the SG&A was selectively invested to support new product innovations, while a portion of the savings drove higher EBIT margins.
As mentioned on the Fuel for Growth slide, corporate and other delivered significant benefit to EBIT. For the total company, the first quarter EBIT of $244 million was 10% below the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. Adverse exchange nearly doubled the impact, resulting in a reported EBIT down 19%. The decline was due to lower sales somewhat offset by improved operating expenses.
The EBIT margin of 25.4% of sales was 200 basis points lower than prior year quarter. The first quarter 2015 EBIT of 27.4% was high due to underspending on A&P. As 2015 progressed, A&P increased and annual 2015 EBIT came in at 24.1%.
I will now address our financial results from EBIT to net income on Slide 10. The increase in interest expense reflects the full quarterly impact of the November 2015 1.5 billion notes. The significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase program. As a reminder, 10.7 million of shares of stock were received in the fourth quarter. The balance of shares will be delivered at the end of the agreement, which is scheduled to conclude in the second quarter of 2016.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR was 23.2% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 22.5% in the prior year quarter. The first quarter 2015 rate was lower as a result of the more favorable geographic earnings mix that did not prevail for the full year. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.87.
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the changes to EPS on Slide 11. In the first quarter, non-GAAP EPS declined $0.12 on a constant dollar basis versus prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit negatively impacted EPS by $0.16. The increase in A&P was offset by Fuel for Growth savings. The ASR delivered $0.03 benefit net of higher interest expense. Half of the $0.12 decline in non-GAAP EPS on a constant dollar was a result of the temporary suspension of shipments to Venezuela in the first quarter of 2016. Foreign exchange adversely impact EPS by $0.10.
Let me address specified items. Since we took a significant specified charge in the first quarter, let me briefly explain what drove the Venezuelan change noted on Slide 12.
In March 2016, the Venezuelan government changed the exchange rate system from a 3 to a 2-tier structure. There were 2 significant impacts to our business. First, the SICAD rate was eliminated. This was the rate we previously used to translate our net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. As a result, we adopted the floating rate now called DICOM. For reference only, the most recent SICAD rate was 13.5 and the DICOM rate at the end of the quarter was approximately 273 and continued to devalue in April. The remeasurement impact from adopting the DICOM rate was a $32 million loss impacting monetary assets.
Second, as the DICOM rate also impacts the translation of our local earnings to U.S. dollar, our future results of Venezuela business are impacted. This triggered an impairment review of Venezuelan's long-lived assets. Following that process, we concluded there was $46 million impairment of our long-lived assets.
Due to the Venezuela change, Fuel for Growth and pension remeasurement charges specified item for the first quarter was $0.48 per share. Including these specified items, GAAP EPS was $0.39.
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movement. On Slide 13, the cash balance of $1.7 billion as of March was similar to the year-end balance. Cash from operating activities was lower than the prior year period. Cash flows reflected lower sales and the negative impact from other working capital. An unusual item on this chart is the sizable foreign exchange impact on cash. This was mainly due to the adoption of the new exchange rate and the remeasurement of our monetary assets in Venezuela.
In summary, the cash generated from operation this quarter was used to pay dividends and capital commitments. For the full year, our capital spending goal remains about 4% of sales.
To summarize our annual guidance on Slide 14, we expect full year 2015 constant dollar growth in the range of 0% to 2%. We continue to anticipate tough comparisons for the first half year 2016 and we do not expect to report positive revenue growth over the same quarter of prior year until the second half 2016.
We reaffirm our 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $3.48 to $3.60. Primarily due to the first quarter charges rate to Venezuela, full year specified items are now expected to be $0.57 per share. Therefore, our updated 2016 GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $2.91 to $3.03. GAAP EPS will change as a result of future mark-to-market pension adjustments, which we cannot estimate at this time.
This concludes my discussion on our first quarter financial results. Thanks, again, for your time this morning, and I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

Firstly, we are satisfied with the sequential improvement in constant dollar revenue. Secondly, we are pleased with the improvement we're seeing in China and we remain focused on the successful execution of our previously outlined China strategy. Thirdly, we do not underestimate the challenges we are facing in an uncertain global economic environment. Despite these challenges, we believe the balance within our global portfolio will allow us to complete 2016, which we've often referred to as a year of transition, as planned.
We are, therefore, reiterating our prior guidance for modest full year constant dollar sales growth between 0% and 2%. We are confident that sequential constant dollar sales for the first half of 2016 will be stronger than the second half of prior year. And within 2016, sales in the second 6-month period will be stronger than the first half of the year.
For the year, we expect foreign exchange to adversely affect translation into our reporting currency by 600 basis points. We also are confirming unchanged non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.48 to $3.60.

We -- our first initial shipments did not happen until the middle of this month, in fact. But reception from retailers has been very favorable and we've not had any issues getting the required additional shelf space, be that in baby stores or in other retail channels in China. So I would say we're encouraged by what we see and the engagement we are having. The early engagement we are having with consumers online is also favorable in China.
I don't know that we want to get into giving you forecast and expectations by product line. So I don't think I'm prepared to go there. But as you know, it's a project that we've been working on for quite some time. Many of you would probably say too long. So obviously, we feel like we are putting our best foot forward, and we are optimistic about the prospects.
In the U.S., it's a little bit different. I think what we are doing in the U.S. is really experimenting with a different business model. We believe that, based on our increased mastery of sort of big data analysis and our own database and our knowledge of the U.S. consumers, we are able to quite precisely target consumers in the market that might be more likely to be interested in a premium nutrition proposition and willing to pay the price that goes with that. So we've begun a test initially with very limited retail distribution. I think we'll assess how that test proceeds through the year and then we'll decide whether we will expand distribution from where we currently are. But the science used in the 2 products is identical. There are some minor variations that are required by different regulations and different quality standards needed in the 2 markets, but the base science is essentially the same."

I mean, I think the whole product bundle is quite unique. We -- as you know, we have a large ongoing effort underway within the company to continually enhance our understanding of breast milk in particular and how we can incorporate the latest science associated with breast milk in enhanced form, in some cases, into formulas. We've acted on some of that. We have raised the levels, as I mentioned, of lactoferrin, which is naturally present in very low levels in all -- in most formulas, I shouldn't say all, but most. And we have incorporated elevated levels as well, significantly elevated levels of milk fat globular membranes, which is just what it says it is. Both of these ingredients are sort of closely associated with physiological development, either neuro or immune system development of -- for infants. The second ingredient is in somewhat scarce supply in the world. And we believe that though people can talk about it, it will take some time for people to get to the levels we are at. But most importantly, I think it's the understanding of how the ingredients work, and then we've incorporated that into quite unique packaging in the marketplaces where we packed it with our advertising and digital capabilities. So we're excited about it and, I guess, we feel like we've got quite a unique package, which is one of the reasons we've delayed the entry. We wanted to make sure we have the right package.

I think you've seen that we, in Q1, we delivered our reported sales of decline of 6%, in line with our expectation.

Except where I note otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results.
At our Investor Day in October of last year, we laid out a 3-year plan for value creation. We know that at the time that 2016 would be a year of transition.
During our year-end earnings call, I identified 3 key milestones we've used to monitor our progress against this plan. Firstly, a return to constant dollar sales growth, with the first step being sequential sales growth from fourth quarter 2015 to first quarter 2016. Well, today, we're announcing constant dollar sales in the first quarter rose 1.5% above the prior quarter.
Secondly, we said we'd deliver on our first year commitments to reduce our overall operating expense base. And in the first quarter, our Fuel for Growth initiative delivered $20 million in expense reductions versus the prior year's first quarter, and we are well on our way to achieve our annual savings targets.
Thirdly, and finally, we said we'd invest a portion of our operating expense savings to fund key growth initiatives, both above and below the net sales line. In the first quarter, we continued to make strong investments in support of our strategy, especially in China. I'll expand on this a little later this morning.
Turning now to our first quarter 2016 results. First quarter sales came in as expected at $962 million. As anticipated, this represented a sequential improvement in constant dollars over our fourth quarter 2015 number. This was our second successive quarter of sequential improvement in our underlying business following the difficult second and third quarters of '15.
Also, as anticipated, our financial results were adversely impacted by currency movements to the tune of 600 basis points. Compared to the same quarter of prior year's, sales were 6% lower in constant dollars, driven by 8% lower volume, while price contributed 2 percentage points of growth. The unfavorable year-over-year comparison was mainly driven by tough base comparisons in our 2 largest markets and affecting the quarter itself are significantly reduced shipments to Venezuela.
Given the large adverse currency impact, I'm pleased with the company's continued earnings power. Gross margin for the quarter remained slightly better than 64% and our EBIT margin was above 25% as our cost reduction initiatives began to take hold.
Investment in advertising and promotion represented 15.8% of sales for the quarter. This was similar to the level seen through the second half of 2015.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.87. Michel will discuss how the most recent devaluation in Venezuela impacted our GAAP earnings.
Elaborating on the sequential improvement in sales against the prior quarter, improvements in Asia and Latin America were key drivers of growth. I know you're all watching our performance in China closely. So I want to let you know that, sequentially, we saw high single-digit percentage improvement in constant dollar sales in the world's biggest market.
Simultaneously, we saw weaker sequential performance in our North America/Europe segment. I will expand on this in just a moment.
Let me now briefly discuss progress against some of our major value-creating strategic initiatives, and let me begin with our growth initiatives before I then address cost reductions and investment optimization.
As you know, last year, we began the expansion and transformation of our China brand portfolio to allow us to better meet consumer needs and participate in growing market segments and channels. In late March, we announced the immediate introduction of Enfinitas, a best-in-class premium brand, into the China market. I'll return to this topic later.
In China, we are also making good progress with our Enfamil branded line of fully-imported products. And as we closed the quarter, these accounted for fully 45% of our sales in mainland China.
Outside of China, in Southeast Asia and Latin America, we continued investment in our Enfamil franchise, promoting the benefits of our new plastics packaging and refill system. This is the same system many of you would know from retailer sales here in the United States.
And domestically, in the United States, we are continuing to invest in our liquids portfolio, a category segment where we've historically underperformed. Our objective is to secure our fair share of this highly-profitable market segment.
Our determination to establish a segment for nutritionally-fortified toddler milks in North America is also undiminished. Enfagrow remains a critical part of our growth strategy, and we remain excited about its potential.
Still in the United States, we had begun a test to see how we can leverage big data analysis and our substantial database capability to more precisely target consumers with relevant products and messages. To test this, we've introduced Enfamil Enspire, a new product deploying the same science used in our China Enfinitas products, into limited retail distribution. We anticipate learning a great deal from this test, and the initiative demonstrates our commitment to innovating our business model over time.
Let me now turn to our effort to optimize our expense base. Our Fuel for Growth initiative is essential to our ability to sustain investments in growth, while generating shareholder value through EPS growth over time.
In the first quarter, we began to see the impact. We aim to reduce non-A&P operating expenses by at least $120 million over a 3-year period. We are making good progress against this target. And in the first quarter, reported SG&A expenses alone was 16% lower than a year earlier.
We also continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate or enhance our cost reduction plan. During the coming quarter, we anticipate making progress in our review of advertising and promotion expenditure and other investments in demand creation. We believe new approaches to media and the ongoing conversion to digital will allow for greater efficiency of spend in the mid to long-term. But given our substantial investment in new product introductions, we do not expect this initiative to translate into lower A&P percentages towards the end of this year.
I'll now discuss in more detail the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with the North America/Europe segment. Overall, sales in this segment were less strong in the first quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Measured against the same quarter of 2015, constant dollar sales were weaker by 1% from volume and foreign exchange represented an additional headwind of 2 percentage points.
The start to the year in our U.S. business was affected by market share losses from the highs we saw in the middle of 2015. On a positive note, we believe the strengthening labor market and workforce participation rates have caused a rise in breastfeeding rates to level off over the last 4 months or so. We are, of course, very focused on what we can control and we are constructing remedial plans to strengthen our market share in the United States, including through pricing actions.
In Europe and Canada, I'm delighted to report that we are already enjoying record-high market shares. As a consequence, we are seeing strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year. In both geographies, we are executing our strategies extremely well, demonstrating that, when we do so, we can grow our business even in relatively mature markets.
Let me now turn to Latin America. In constant dollars and excluding the impact of Venezuela, Latin America grows over the prior quarter and was 7% higher compared to a year ago. However, when including the impact of suspended shipments to Venezuela, constant dollar sales were lower by 6%. Foreign exchange represented an additional significant headwind of 16%. An improved pricing of 7% was insufficient to fully offset this impact on reported sales. Across the whole region, we are seeing economies impacted by weaker commodity prices and, in several cases, political uncertainty.
Though both countries are still recovering from currency depreciations, stronger business performance in Mexico and Colombia helped somewhat mitigate the impact of economic recessions in Brazil and Venezuela. We've previously described how we've chosen to make only limited shipments to Venezuela as we are constrained by our limited access locally to hard currency. We are very keen to help alleviate the acute product shortage in Venezuela and restore supply, and we're working with the government to find a solution. But until one is found, we expect very limited sales in Venezuela.
Brazil is going through a well-prophesied economic recession. The impact on consumer and business confidence is manifesting itself in softer demand for discretionary items. And we are feeling the impact most acutely within our children's category. Our infant formula sales are holding up relatively better. We remain excited about the country's long-term potential, but we do not anticipate a substantial improvement within this year.
As mentioned, we enjoyed a strong start to the year in Mexico, where our milk modifier brands recovered somewhat from the weakness in mid-2015. Our infant formula and toddler business gained market share in the first quarter as new packaging and revised messaging behind an improved formulation resonated to consumers.
Though I recognize we can't quantify the extent to which Colombia may be benefiting from informal parallel exports to neighboring Venezuela, we believe increased market share is the main driver of very strong double-digit sales growth there.
And finally, our business in the Caribbean and Central America grew by high single-digits over the prior year's same quarter. In most of these markets, we transacted dollars and, hence, the region remains a stabilizing factor in an inherently volatile segment.
I'll turn now to our Asia segment. As mentioned in my global overview, we saw a strong single-digit sequential improvement in constant dollar sales in Asia. China grew faster than the segment as a whole, but Thailand and Malaysia also improved over the previous quarter.
Despite our strong sequential improvement, year-over-year sales comparison was unfavorable. Volume was lower by 9%, mainly reflecting the fact that we've still not returned to the year ago sales levels in China and Hong Kong. Price was in line with the prior year, with improved product mix offsetting the impact of added promotional activity.
In Thailand and Malaysia, the sequential comparison was helped by non-repeating retail inventory reductions referenced in our fourth quarter earnings call. 
Malaysian consumers appear to be adjusting spending habits in response to the VAT introduction and currency-related inflation of 2015. Consequently, we expect more stable performance from Malaysia going forward.
The Thai economy remains relatively weaker, and we're a little more cautious about a rapid turnaround there. We are maintaining investment levels and, in fact, seeking to strengthen our position in anticipation of an eventual recovery in economic growth. Inherently, Thailand is a great market for us and we have a very experienced team on the ground. Longer-term, I'm confident in our prospects there.
In Vietnam, we have seen opportunities to improve our execution. The market somewhat underperformed against our expectations in 2015 and in the most recent quarter, but our team is focused on the right issues and putting in place plans to strengthen performance in the second half of the year.
Because our businesses in Indonesia is relatively small, we don't often talk about our performance in this large market. However, over the last 12 months, we've developed a more focused geographic strategy for the country, and our improved focus appear to be helping. Sales grew strongly in the first quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. It's clear that we would like to build a bigger business in this high-potential market, but we remain realistic about our scale and the challenges to realizing our ambition organically.
Let me close on China. The China market continues to evolve quickly and we are still assessing the full impact of recent changes to duty structure and regulatory frameworks. Over the last year or so, I have repeatedly stated my belief that regulatory changes were put in China. And more evenhanded duty structure is, in my mind, likely to be just the first of several important changes being driven by the Chinese government. The focus remains on consumer safety. And the requirement that all infant formula and children's products, regardless of sales channel, be registered in China is a key part of the government's efforts to safeguard the consumer. We're supportive of these efforts to protect consumers by ensuring products and labels meet Chinese standards, regardless of how and from where they are sold.
Before I discuss the performance of our China business, I want to remind you of the broad China strategy we laid out for you more than a year ago. We promised we would reshape our product portfolio to better satisfy consumer's preference for imported premium products. And once we have the right portfolio, we will then commit the resources to strengthen our performance in higher growth sales channels.
Since then, we have introduced a fully-imported line of our Enfamil branded products. And after the close of the first quarter, we introduced a new product offering into the highest priced market segment. Enfinitas, as we have aptly called this new offering, contains our best science and was developed incorporating understanding gained from our extensive studies of breast milk, nutrition and metabolism.
In addition to our long-proven, industry-leading levels of DHA and ARA -- AHA, the products contained boosted levels of lactoferrin and milk fat globular membranes, ingredients closely associated with both neuro and immune system development. Though this new technology is costly, we believe Chinese parents would once again confirm that they're willing to invest in their child's future.
We now have the right portfolio to win with both consumers and retailers. Helped by our recent introductions, baby stores became our largest sales channel in the latest quarter, and both this channel and the e-commerce channel grew in excess of 20% over the same quarter of last year. And despite cannibalization from our imported line, sales of our locally-manufactured product line appeared to have stabilized in response to stronger defensive stops and increased promotional competitiveness.
I know you all share my interest in the price promotional environment in China. Let me give you my perspective. It's clear to us that some competitors push sales aggressively in the fourth quarter of 2015. And as a result, I'm now providing additional discounts to clear inventory overhang from distributors and retailers. Though we will, of course, act to protect our market share, we take a different approach. We simply do not believe Chinese consumers are significantly motivated by lower prices, even though retailers may well be. Rather, Chinese consumers are amongst the world's most discerning and they continue to show a willingness to pay for superior quality and nutrition. This is evidenced by the continued shift towards higher-priced segments.
Our view is supported by the fact that, sequentially, price, in fact, was a positive contributor to our growth in China in the latest quarter, the positive effect of product mix more than offsetting the effect of promotional spend.
In response to the successful execution of our strategy, our performance in China improved substantially over the prior quarter, with constant dollar sales, as mentioned, showing a high single-digit percentage improvement.
Commenting now on our outlook for the full year 2016. I reiterate that company guidance for modest constant dollar sales growth between 0% and 2%. Based on current exchange rate assumptions, we expect this to translate into an unfavorable sales comparison in U.S. dollars of between 4% and 6%.
As advised in our January call, we expect to deliver 9% to 12% growth in constant dollar EPS. Based on this, we also reiterate our guidance for full year non-GAAP EPS between $3.48 and $3.60.
I'll now hand over to Michel who will provide additional details on our financial performance. I will then return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."

Today, I will discuss the company's first quarter 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results by segment and wrap up with a cash flow analysis and summary of our full year guidance.Un",2102,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's first quarter 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results by segment and wrap up with a cash flow analysis and summary of our full year guidance.
Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to their impact on the translation of local currency, financial statement into the United States dollars.
Let me start with sales. As shown on Slide 3, on a sequential basis, from the fourth quarter of 2015, constant dollar sales grew by 1.5%. Nearly all of our large markets grew sequentially and, most notably, China. When you review the 5-quarter sequential trend, sales were strongest in the first quarter of 2015 and started to decline in the second quarter. As 2015 progressed, we invested to protect competitiveness, launched new products and were able to stabilize sales in the fourth quarter.
In the first quarter, we continued to invest. We rolled out new innovation and selectively increased prices in some markets to compensate for the continued currency devaluations. Consistent with my stated expectation last quarter, I would like to remind you that the second quarter of 2016 year-over-year comparison will continue to be tough on a constant dollar basis, although we should see an improvement in the second quarter performance.
First quarter sales on a reported basis were 12% below and constant dollar sales were 6% below the prior year quarter. Adverse foreign exchange rate contributed a 600 basis point decline.
Slide 4 summarizes the impact of foreign exchange on sales and EPS. The U.S. dollar continued to be strong in the first quarter of 2016 and its effect on the translation of local currency negatively impacted all reporting segments. The first quarter decline of 6% was the same percentage as both the third and the fourth quarter of 2015. Half of the negative currency impact in the first quarter were from the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso and the Argentinian peso. The balance of the adverse foreign exchange impact was widespread across the regions. We continue to expect an approximately 6% adverse foreign exchange impact on sales for the full year 2016. I will address the foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well.
I will now move to factors that impact our gross margins on Slide 5. Gross margins was 64.1% in the first quarter of 2016. This was a similar margin percentage to the first quarter of 2015 and in line with our expectations for the full year.
Sales impacted from positive mix and pricing was affected by higher trade investments resulting in a slight gross margin decline. Manufacturing conversion cost negatively impacted margin due to lower volume absorption and higher cost of innovation and inflation.
Low dairy cost was the largest benefit to our gross margin in quarter 1 and more than offset higher conversion cost and other commodities increases. We expect to see dairy benefits in the second quarter.
As you can see, we continued to deliver productivity savings within our cost of goods sold. Also Biostime has already secured commitments for nearly 90% of our 2016 productivity goals.
Moving to operating expenses, I will start with advertising and promotion investments on Slide 6. A&P was 15.8% of sales in the first quarter compared to 13.2% in the prior year quarter. This was an increase of 11% on a constant dollar basis. The incremental investments were mainly to support our key China initiatives.
Historically, the company had a lower A&P spending in the first quarter of the year. Since our China fully-imported product line was launched in the middle of last year, we continued strong investments in the first quarter of 2016, especially fertilization, digital and e-commerce media. In addition, we supported the investment of new innovation rollout in selected markets.
With the April 2016 launch of our super high premium products, we expect A&P as a percentage of sales to be high in the second quarter. As you can see on this slide, when we launched the China fully-imported product in the second quarter of 2015, our total A&P as a percentage of sales went up significantly. We can expect that in the second quarter of 2016 as well.
Turning to Slide 7. The increase in A&P was offset by reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. This is in line with the strategy we outlined at Investor Day, that 2016 will be a year of transition with a focus on investments.
On a constant dollar basis, SG&A was 10% lower than the first quarter of 2015. Approximately $20 million of the SG&A reduction is attributed to our Fuel for Growth initiative, which I will address on the next slide.
Slide 8 shows that our Fuel for Growth initiative had a strong start in the first quarter. On a constant dollar basis, we delivered cost reduction of 10% for the first quarter of 2015, especially in our support functions. While we have made some reductions in the region offices, about 3/4 of the reduction was from corporate headquarter functions, which decreased by approximately 30% on a like-for-like constant currency basis. Of the corporate headquarter reductions, more than half was from outside services, and the balance were personnel-related. To-date, we have secured over 90% of our planned 2016 reductions, and we are ahead of schedule. At the same time, we constrained sales forces and distribution spending to remain relatively flat to prior year on a constant dollar basis.
Turning now to Slide 9 for a discussion of EBIT. Let me start this analysis per segment. In the first quarter, Asia delivered an EBIT of $169 million, a decrease of 22% on a constant dollar basis. An incremental 5% decrease came from the adverse foreign exchange impact, largely driven from the Chinese renminbi, Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit. The Asia EBIT margin, at 33.8%, improved 390 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, yet was 600 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2015. The main year-over-year drivers were lower sales and increased channel investment and promotional activities.
Investment continued throughout the Asian region to support our innovation launches. The most significant investment were in China, including competitive price promotions on the locally-manufactured products and investment for the fully-imported product line.
Latin America delivered an EBIT of $41 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 11% on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT decline was due to lower sales mainly in Venezuela, yet the decline was somewhat offset by lower A&P investments. Excluding the impact of the Venezuelan business, the Latin America EBIT on a constant dollar basis increased 22% compared to prior year.
For the segment, adverse foreign exchange impacted EBIT by 18%, largely from the Mexican peso. On a reported basis, EBIT was 29% lower than prior year.
The Latin America EBIT margin was 25.5% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 28% for the same quarter last year. The 250 basis points decline was from lower sales, mainly Venezuela, somewhat offset by lower A&P and sales force spending.
For the first quarter, North America and Europe EBIT was $82 million, an increase of 9% on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 27.2% was 190 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Despite lower sales, gross margin remained strong from the dairy benefit, with an operating expenses reduction in the SG&A was selectively invested to support new product innovations, while a portion of the savings drove higher EBIT margins.
As mentioned on the Fuel for Growth slide, corporate and other delivered significant benefit to EBIT. For the total company, the first quarter EBIT of $244 million was 10% below the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. Adverse exchange nearly doubled the impact, resulting in a reported EBIT down 19%. The decline was due to lower sales somewhat offset by improved operating expenses.
The EBIT margin of 25.4% of sales was 200 basis points lower than prior year quarter. The first quarter 2015 EBIT of 27.4% was high due to underspending on A&P. As 2015 progressed, A&P increased and annual 2015 EBIT came in at 24.1%.
I will now address our financial results from EBIT to net income on Slide 10. The increase in interest expense reflects the full quarterly impact of the November 2015 1.5 billion notes. The significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase program. As a reminder, 10.7 million of shares of stock were received in the fourth quarter. The balance of shares will be delivered at the end of the agreement, which is scheduled to conclude in the second quarter of 2016.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR was 23.2% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 22.5% in the prior year quarter. The first quarter 2015 rate was lower as a result of the more favorable geographic earnings mix that did not prevail for the full year. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $0.87.
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the changes to EPS on Slide 11. In the first quarter, non-GAAP EPS declined $0.12 on a constant dollar basis versus prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit negatively impacted EPS by $0.16. The increase in A&P was offset by Fuel for Growth savings. The ASR delivered $0.03 benefit net of higher interest expense. Half of the $0.12 decline in non-GAAP EPS on a constant dollar was a result of the temporary suspension of shipments to Venezuela in the first quarter of 2016. Foreign exchange adversely impact EPS by $0.10.
Let me address specified items. Since we took a significant specified charge in the first quarter, let me briefly explain what drove the Venezuelan change noted on Slide 12.
In March 2016, the Venezuelan government changed the exchange rate system from a 3 to a 2-tier structure. There were 2 significant impacts to our business. First, the SICAD rate was eliminated. This was the rate we previously used to translate our net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. As a result, we adopted the floating rate now called DICOM. For reference only, the most recent SICAD rate was 13.5 and the DICOM rate at the end of the quarter was approximately 273 and continued to devalue in April. The remeasurement impact from adopting the DICOM rate was a $32 million loss impacting monetary assets.
Second, as the DICOM rate also impacts the translation of our local earnings to U.S. dollar, our future results of Venezuela business are impacted. This triggered an impairment review of Venezuelan's long-lived assets. Following that process, we concluded there was $46 million impairment of our long-lived assets.
Due to the Venezuela change, Fuel for Growth and pension remeasurement charges specified item for the first quarter was $0.48 per share. Including these specified items, GAAP EPS was $0.39.
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movement. On Slide 13, the cash balance of $1.7 billion as of March was similar to the year-end balance. Cash from operating activities was lower than the prior year period. Cash flows reflected lower sales and the negative impact from other working capital. An unusual item on this chart is the sizable foreign exchange impact on cash. This was mainly due to the adoption of the new exchange rate and the remeasurement of our monetary assets in Venezuela.
In summary, the cash generated from operation this quarter was used to pay dividends and capital commitments. For the full year, our capital spending goal remains about 4% of sales.
To summarize our annual guidance on Slide 14, we expect full year 2015 constant dollar growth in the range of 0% to 2%. We continue to anticipate tough comparisons for the first half year 2016 and we do not expect to report positive revenue growth over the same quarter of prior year until the second half 2016.
We reaffirm our 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $3.48 to $3.60. Primarily due to the first quarter charges rate to Venezuela, full year specified items are now expected to be $0.57 per share. Therefore, our updated 2016 GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $2.91 to $3.03. GAAP EPS will change as a result of future mark-to-market pension adjustments, which we cannot estimate at this time.
This concludes my discussion on our first quarter financial results. Thanks, again, for your time this morning, and I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

Firstly, we are satisfied with the sequential improvement in constant dollar revenue. Secondly, we are pleased with the improvement we're seeing in China and we remain focused on the successful execution of our previously outlined China strategy. Thirdly, we do not underestimate the challenges we are facing in an uncertain global economic environment. Despite these challenges, we believe the balance within our global portfolio will allow us to complete 2016, which we've often referred to as a year of transition, as planned.
We are, therefore, reiterating our prior guidance for modest full year constant dollar sales growth between 0% and 2%. We are confident that sequential constant dollar sales for the first half of 2016 will be stronger than the second half of prior year. And within 2016, sales in the second 6-month period will be stronger than the first half of the year.
For the year, we expect foreign exchange to adversely affect translation into our reporting currency by 600 basis points. We also are confirming unchanged non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.48 to $3.60.

We -- our first initial shipments did not happen until the middle of this month, in fact. But reception from retailers has been very favorable and we've not had any issues getting the required additional shelf space, be that in baby stores or in other retail channels in China. So I would say we're encouraged by what we see and the engagement we are having. The early engagement we are having with consumers online is also favorable in China.
I don't know that we want to get into giving you forecast and expectations by product line. So I don't think I'm prepared to go there. But as you know, it's a project that we've been working on for quite some time. Many of you would probably say too long. So obviously, we feel like we are putting our best foot forward, and we are optimistic about the prospects.
In the U.S., it's a little bit different. I think what we are doing in the U.S. is really experimenting with a different business model. We believe that, based on our increased mastery of sort of big data analysis and our own database and our knowledge of the U.S. consumers, we are able to quite precisely target consumers in the market that might be more likely to be interested in a premium nutrition proposition and willing to pay the price that goes with that. So we've begun a test initially with very limited retail distribution. I think we'll assess how that test proceeds through the year and then we'll decide whether we will expand distribution from where we currently are. But the science used in the 2 products is identical. There are some minor variations that are required by different regulations and different quality standards needed in the 2 markets, but the base science is essentially the same."

I mean, I think the whole product bundle is quite unique. We -- as you know, we have a large ongoing effort underway within the company to continually enhance our understanding of breast milk in particular and how we can incorporate the latest science associated with breast milk in enhanced form, in some cases, into formulas. We've acted on some of that. We have raised the levels, as I mentioned, of lactoferrin, which is naturally present in very low levels in all -- in most formulas, I shouldn't say all, but most. And we have incorporated elevated levels as well, significantly elevated levels of milk fat globular membranes, which is just what it says it is. Both of these ingredients are sort of closely associated with physiological development, either neuro or immune system development of -- for infants. The second ingredient is in somewhat scarce supply in the world. And we believe that though people can talk about it, it will take some time for people to get to the levels we are at. But most importantly, I think it's the understanding of how the ingredients work, and then we've incorporated that into quite unique packaging in the marketplaces where we packed it with our advertising and digital capabilities. So we're excited about it and, I guess, we feel like we've got quite a unique package, which is one of the reasons we've delayed the entry. We wanted to make sure we have the right package.
And I don't know if Michel wants to comment on margins. Do you want to add something, Michel?"

The second point I would like to make is there is -- although there is an improvement, but you still see a significant fluctuation of some currencies. Just remind you on the Chinese renminbi, mid-April, where you saw a significant change again, and that is impacting our business as we speak. I think you know we've seen in Q1, we delivered our reported sales of decline of 6%, in line with our expectation.

Thank you for joining us on our earnings call. My comments will focus on our strategy and top line performance.

My comments will focus on our strategy and top line performance. And then Michel will follow up with some additional financial information and [indiscernible] on segment profitability and our company's cash flow. 
Let me begin by summarizing the company's second quarter performance before I provide additional details on each of our reporting segments. Except where I noted otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results. At the end of last year, we laid out a three-year plan for value creation, with this year being a year of transition. I also identified three key milestones we use to monitor our profits against this value creation plan. I referenced these plans in our last earnings call, so let me reference them again today. 
Of the three milestones we laid out, the first was to return the business to constant dollar sales growth. Today, you'll hear as we reiterate expectations for 2016 sales that anticipates that we'll return to growth in the coming quarters. Within the most recently completed quarter, demand in China for new products continued to grow. Actual shipments this quarter however were constrained by supply shortage caused by newly introduced additional import processes at Chinese border points. More about this later. 
Despite these constraints, the gross sales before trade support and discounts were in line with prior quarter. Net sales were lower than the quarter before as trade support for new product introductions increased. Michel will elaborate on this a little bit later. 
Our second milestone centered around our commitment to reduce our operating expense base. Year-to-date, we've delivered $47 million in expense reductions. We've already achieved nearly 80% of our annual target of $60 million. We are ahead of schedule. And in this call, we are announcing a revised, more ambitious target. 
We are both accelerating and expanding our cost initiatives by increasing our 2016 target to $75 million to $80 million in savings from the previously announced $60 million. We're also raising our three-year cumulative savings goals from $120 million to $180 million. 
Our third and final milestone we said will be to invest a portion of our expense savings to fund key growth initiatives. To date, we've invested substantially behind the introduction of a fully imported Enfamil into China and the building of a [indiscernible] franchise in North America. This latest quarter, we made strong investments in support of our Enfinitas launch in China and the expansion of distribution reach. Overtime, we'll demonstrate to you that these investments are central to us delivering on our commitment to shareholder value creation. 
Turning now to our second quarter 2016 results. We continue to manage through a challenging global operating environment. Economic growth in many emerging and developing economies of Asia and Latin America has slowed over the past 18 to 24 months. Simultaneously, political uncertainty affects many markets in both Asia and South America. These affects they present near-term headwinds for us. That said, we continue to find opportunities amidst the uncertainty. We continue to invest to put ourselves in the best possible position for when a turnaround and economic growth eventually materializes and come it will. 
For the second quarter, sales for the company was $942 million. Reported net sales were $9 million lower than the prior year quarter. Currency adversely impacted our results by 500 basis points. Consequently, constant dollar sales were below -- excuse me, consequently, constant dollar sales were 4% below those of the second quarter of 2015. Price was favorable by 1% despite added trade support in China, while volume was 5% unfavorable. 
Second quarter sales were impacted by significant investments to secure trade support and distribution of Enfinitas in China. Though costly in the near term, these investments will help establish the brand and drive long-term revenue growth. I'll return to the topic of Enfinitas a little later. 
In China, a requirement for additional product testing prior to implication to affect towards the end of the second quarter, causing delays to the importation process. I want to commend the Chinese government for its actions to enhance food safety standards and importation guidelines to ensure imported products can be safely used by Chinese parents and children. 
During the quarter, the government implemented new testing standards for imported products within our category. The effect of this change was a temporary delay in the importation of some of our fastest-growing products from our Netherlands facility. This drove some near-term volatility in our sales results. In the mid to long-term, we, however, believe these additional processes will benefit both Chinese children and responsible operators within the industry. 
Outside of China, the deteriorating circumstances in Venezuela that so tragically impacted the people and our colleagues there have resulted in significantly reduced shipments to the country. When comparing to the second quarter of last year, this adversely impacted the company sales by 130 basis points in the latest quarter. 
Despite the challenging operating environment, I'm pleased with the company's earnings power. Gross margin remained strong. Our strategy to drive growth of higher value product and product forms is working and helps offset the impact of increased investments above the net sales line. Investments in advertising and promotion represented 17.6% of net sales in the quarter. 
Our Fuel for Growth cost reduction initiative drove significant reduction in SG&A. Overall, these costs were down 9% from constant dollars in the second quarter compared to the same quarter of the prior year. 
While we made significant investments in key growth initiatives, our EBIT margin was 24.4% in the quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.88. Michel will expand on our earnings delivery a little later. 
I'll now discuss the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with the North America and Europe segment. 
Net sales in the North America and Europe segment were in line with the second quarter of 2015. On a constant dollar basis, and improved sequentially from the first quarter, a 1% benefit from price was offset by lower volumes. Additionally, we experienced additional headwind of 1% from foreign exchange. 
The Center for Disease Control recently issued their report on 2015 U.S. birth and birth rates. Reported annual birth was 0.3% below the 2014 level. Breastfeeding rates however, appeared to have stabilized. Our market share in the U.S. business stabilized in the second quarter but remained at a level lower than the prior year. In our outlook, we're recognizing it will likely take longer than [indiscernible] to recover market share. Much of our share loss was within the specialty and solution segment of the infant formula market. But we are confident we understand our challenges and we are addressing them. 
There are bright spots within this reporting segment also. Last October, we introduced a new 32-ounce liquids packaging. This product line is now growing double digits and we are gaining share in the high-value liquids category. 
It's still early days for our premium priced Inspire product but reception from retailers has been favorable and we expect to see distribution increase in the coming quarters as we build consumer demand. 
Our North American toddler business, defined as products targeting children more than 1 year of age, continues to grow at an annual rate in double digits. 
And turning to Canada. I continue to be pleased with our progress. Second quarter sales grew double digits based on strong market share gains in both the infant and children segments. We've executed extremely well over the past year or 2 and our Canadian team is deservingly receiving much internal recognition. 
Our European business remains strong based on a leading position in the growing [indiscernible] segment there. We are well-positioned to benefit from future increases in diagnosis ahead of strong innovation pipeline to support our growth in Europe. 
Let me now turn to Latin America. Constant dollar sales for the total region was 3% lower than the prior year same quarter. Pricing benefits of 9% was insufficient to fully offset foreign exchange impact of 13%. Excluding the impact of our sharply reduced business in Venezuela, Latin America sales grew 4% in constant dollars over the same quarter of 2015. 
Mexico and Colombia were the biggest contributors to growth. In Mexico, we're seeing improved momentum in both our premium pediatric nutrition business and our milk modifier business. We enjoy strong market shares in our milk modifier business and retain our #1 position in this category. In infant formulas, we recently rolled out a product containing milk fat globular membranes, the same key ingredient contained in Enfinitas and its by-products launched in China and the U.S. 
Trends in other parts of Latin America remain broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. In Brazil, the economic challenges continue to hurt demand for discretionary items by our midpriced children's products. The infant premium infant formula products are less discretionary and they continue to grow. We continue to benefit from strong sales in our Colombian unit which maintained strong market shares and in addition, is benefiting from cross-border demand from Venezuela. 
We are rolling out our new plastics packaging and refill systems across Latin America. And in some markets, we are testing ready-to-drink versions of our children's products. These initiatives would allow us to take advantage of segment growth opportunities and support selective increases in price. 
I'll turn now to the Asia segment. Constant dollar growth sales in Asia were in line with the second quarter of 2015. In support of the Enfinitas launch in China, trade investments however were significantly higher when compared to the prior year. Partly as a result of this, price was unfavorable by 2% as the increased trade investments in China more than offset the impact of price increases in Southeast Asia. 
Across the region, product mix continued to improve with sales of our premium priced products going faster than those of our lower-priced variants. Volume was unfavorable by 5% as we experienced delays to importation in China and dealt with some market share weakness in the Philippines. Despite improving momentum in China, the Asia region has not yet recovered to sales levels seen in the early part of 2015. 
In the Philippines, we've seen softer markets share in sales of Lactum, our midpriced children's brand. We feel we've identified the root causes behind our share loss and have a remedial plan that will allow us to get back on track. 
Our Malaysia business is growing both volume and price. We recently introduced a new formulation and improved packaging that will allow us to recover market share over time. 
Across South East Asia, we are rolling out new product formulations and promoting the benefits of our new plastics packaging. Supported by an improved value equation, we are raising prices behind this innovation. 
I will finish my discussion of the Asia segment with China. In my introductory headlines, I described the import delays caused by increased processes at all border points. In Mainland China, the government implemented a new requirement that every batch be extensively tested prior to release to Chinese consumers. Previously, a sampling approach has been applied. The increase in the number of test required caused temporary delays as testing and verification capacity was stretched. The effect of this was a temporary delay in the importation and shortage of supply of many of our fastest-growing imported line items, as I mentioned earlier. We nevertheless are pleased to see these measures implemented. 
Similarly, increased constant monitoring and reduced visitor numbers have adversely impacted our Hong Kong business. It's become more challenging for our Hong Kong business to compete for visiting Chinese tourists but now connects these imported products more easily from within the Mainland. These challenges confirm our China strategy, pursuing increased flexibilities through a broader product portfolio so through more diverse set of sales channels. 
Turning to our Mainland China where our fully imported products continues to gather momentum and we're seeing stronger demand from consumers. Through the second quarter, we continued to grow market share via the imported segment. In the baby store channel, we've increased our distributional supported by our most recent new product introductions. We are seeing both our ability to make progress and the substantial runway we have ahead of us. 
As of the second quarter, we are no longer under indexing versus the market in the fast-growing baby store channel. Our new Enfinitas product line is off to a solid start. 3 months after introductions, we're still building distribution and demand but we're encouraged by the early signs. 
In totality, I'm satisfied with the progress we've made with our portfolio and channel transformation in China. I also recognize we've got a long way to go and a lot of opportunities ahead of us. It's hard not to be excited about the immense potential of not only our China business but our global business. 
Before I hand over to Michel, I want to provide an updated outlook for full-year 2016, our year of transition, a year in which we're addressing several structural opportunities within both our brand portfolio, our product line-up and our cost structure. 
At the beginning of the year, we knew comparisons in the first half 2016 would be challenging. I'm satisfied that many of our critical initiatives have gone as planned and we are expecting growth over prior year in the second half of the year. However, we've seen three developments causing us to revisit our estimate for full year 2016 constant dollar sales growth. It's taking us longer-than-expected to recover the market share we lost in the U.S. towards the end of 2015. 
Secondly, the import-related challenges in China, Hong Kong in the second quarter caused us sales we won't fully recapture until next year. 
Thirdly, we're supporting our imported portfolio in China with additional trade support. In light of these factors, we now expect constant dollar sales in line with or not more than 2% below the 2015 level. 
Through the first half of the year, we've identified several opportunities within our cost structure. In doing so, we found additional opportunities to both reduce cost and increase efficiencies. In a moment, Michel will outline an expanded ambition and scope for our operating expense initiatives, the project we refer to as Fuel for Growth. Despite lower sales, a slightly improved outlook for gross margin, expense optimization and the benefit realized from a lower tax rate in the just completed quarter allows to reiterate our expectation for non-GAAP earnings per share of $3 -- of between $3.48 and $3.60 for the full year 2016. 
I'll now hand over to Michel, who will provide additional details on our second quarter and first half financial performance. I'll then return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."

Today I will discuss the company's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results for each segments, cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of full year guidance. 
Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency, financial statement into U.S. dollars. In addition, my comment about sales refer to net sales, unless I explicitly call out gross sales. 
Let me start with sales as shown on Slide 3. Kasper addressed the constant dollar change. I will focus on the reported sales and the foreign currency impact. For both the second quarter and first half year, adverse foreign exchange rates contributed to the 500 basis points decline compared to the same period of the prior year. Second quarter net sales on a reported dollar basis grew 9% below prior year quarter. Reduced shipments to Venezuela impacted net sales negatively by 1% in the second quarter versus the prior year quarter. 
Slide 4 summarizes the impact of foreign exchange on sales. U.S. dollar continues to be strong and effects of translation of local currencies negatively impacted all [ph] our reporting segments. However, the impact was slightly less significant in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the trend from the last 3 quarters. Nearly 2/3 of the second quarter negative currency impact on sales were from the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso and the Argentine peso. The balance of the adverse foreign exchange impact was widespread across regions. 
As a result of the year-to-date foreign exchange impact, our outstanding currency hedges for the remainder of the year and the current forward rate, we are revising our currency expectations from minus 6% to minus 5% adverse foreign exchange impact on sales for the full year 2016. I will address foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well. 
I'm introducing Slide 5 for better transparency of gross sales, which reflects sales to customers before trade investment and other items, which are recorded as gross to net sales adjustment. We reallocated some investments in the second quarter from advertising and promotion to trade investments, in support of the rollout of Enfinitas and build on our momentum of the fully imported premium products that were introduced in the second quarter of last year. Gross sales on a constant dollar basis were flat compared to the prior year quarter and down 2% for the first half year of 2016 versus the same period last year. The significant gross sales improvement in the second quarter has been realized. 
Slide 6. The second quarter EBIT of $230 million was 10% above the prior-year quarter on a constant dollar basis. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 6%, including currency impacts. EBIT increased 4% on a reported basis in the second quarter. 
If you would exclude Venezuela, our EBIT on constant dollar basis improved by 14% versus prior year quarter. The second quarter EBIT margin of 24.4% of sales was 290 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Despite macroeconomic and country-specific challenges which impacted our sales, we made excellent progress to reduce operating expenses as part of our Fuel for Growth program which allowed continued investments and, at the same time, improve the underlying profitability. Year-to-date EBIT was $474 million, a decline of 1% versus previous year on a constant dollar basis. Foreign exchange, an adverse impact of 8%. 
Excluding Venezuela, EBIT in the first half year improved by 3% versus previous year period on a constant dollar basis, mainly driven by a higher gross margin and our cost savings realized in the first half year, partly offset by the mine generating investments. 
I will now move to the factors that impact gross margin on Slide 7. Gross margin was 65.1% in the second quarter of 2016, or 66% on a constant dollar non-GAAP basis. Adverse foreign exchange impact the gross margin by 150 basis points in the second quarter. We were able to deliver a nearly flat gross margin on a reported basis in both the second quarter and the first half year compared to the previous year periods despite the significant currency headwind. 
Sales had a slightly negative impact on gross margin from higher trade investment, especially in China. Low dairy cost continued to be the large benefit to gross margin in the second quarter and first half of 2016. Our key dairy components have been secured through supply contracts for the remainder of the year and we expect some further benefits. Although the daily benefits for the remainder of the year will be smaller compared to the first half year. 
We continue to deliver productivity savings within cost of goods sold. Year-to-date, the supply chain team delivered productivity savings of around 3.5% of cost of goods sold, in line with our expectation. We're very secured for the full year. We expect full year gross margin to be slightly better than our prior year guidance of 64%. 
Moving to operating expenses. I will start with advertising and promotions expenses [ph] on Slide 8. Advertising and promotion was 17.6% of sales in the second quarter compared to 18.4% in the prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, in the second quarter, we reallocated a portion of investments from A&P to trade investments which are recognized in gross to net sales. Despite the year-over-year savings, the second quarter of both years marked noticeably higher investments. The incremental investments were mainly to support key China initiatives, last year for the launch of our fully imported products and for April of this year, the launch of the Enfinitas product line and the continued support of our greater China strategy. 
In the second quarter, we purposefully delayed some A&P investments due to delays in the importation of some of our China product impacting our sales. As such, we expect the third quarter may continue to be at elevated level before it normalizes in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 9 provides the combined spending of the mine generating investments, both as trade investments classified in gross to  net sales and advertising and promotion. Some of the key trade investment activities include trade support, customer programs and promotional pricing. For the second quarter, the combined investment increased above the prior-year quarter and was also higher than it was the last few quarters. 
Trade spending is focused closer to our consumer and to ensure our products are present with strong distribution in the key growing channels. In the past few quarters, we've increased these investments, especially in China, to be more competitive in the baby store and e-commerce channels. While we increased trade investments, we plan to reduce the A&P as a percentage of sales over the next few years. 
Last quarter, we committed to provide an update on our view of advertising and promotion expenditures. At Investor's Day last year, when I spoke about advertising and promotion, I stated that we should be able to optimize a lower A&P by 50 to 100 basis points over 3 years. We can now confirm that we expect to be at the top of that range and reduced our A&P by 100 basis points by 2018. We will realize this by prioritizing investment choices that maximize our return on investments of key influence drivers. 
We will continue to optimize our non media expenses and leverage our decision supporting tools better. In addition, we will strengthen our focus on digital marketing versus the traditional media. 
Slide 10, we reduced our SG&A cost by 9% on a constant dollar basis in the second quarter of 2016 versus the previous year quarter and by 10% year-to-date compared to the prior-year period. Like we indicated before, our Fuel for Growth program is focused on cost reduction within our support functions and marketing. 
Areas of focus were the reduction of key vendor contracts, eliminates discretionary spend and optimize organizational errors. As you can see from Slide 11, we are significantly ahead of schedule on the original 2016 Fuel for Growth target. Our Fuel for Growth target for this year was $60 million. By midyear, we've delivered 79% of this year's target savings, or $47 million already. Especially in the corporate overhead functions, we're able to reduce our cost by $30 million in the first half year of 2016 versus the first half year of 2015. Significant progress had been made by systematically renegotiating contracts with our largest vendors. 
Slide 12. Over the last few months, we performed a more extended deep dive review of our expenses as well as our organizational structure. We concluded, based also on the success of our results to date, to accelerate certain cost savings programs identified earlier and to expand the scope to all operating expenses functions, including sales force and distribution. We now expect to deliver $75 million to $80 million of savings in 2016. This is an increase of $15 million to $20 million versus our original 2016 target. Taking into account the savings realized in 2015 of $20 million, cumulative savings by the end of 2016 are expected to be around $95 million to $100 million. 
In addition to the original program of $120 million, we expect an incremental $60 million of cost savings opportunities by 2018. The combined Fuel for Growth program will deliver $180 million savings by 2018. 
The incremental Fuel for Growth savings will provide additional flexibility to invest in the company's future growth. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a discussion of EBIT by segment. Let me start with Asia. In the second quarter, Asia delivered an EBIT of $137 million, a decrease of 4% on a constant dollar basis compared to prior year quarter. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by additional 8%. Lastly from the Chinese renminbi, the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit. The Asia EBIT margin at 30% declined 50 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The main drivers were lower sales and an increase in trade investment in gross to net sales. The lower net sales impact was somewhat offset by a favorable dairy cost and some lower A&P expenses. 
For the first half-year of 2016, the Asian EBIT margin of 32% were 350 basis points lower than the prior year, as the lower sales and higher demand generation investments were not fully offset by the dairy benefit. A&P as a percentage of sales increased in the first half-year versus the previous period. 
Turning to Slide 14. Latin America delivered an EBIT of $36 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 7% on a constant dollar basis compared to the prior year quarter. For this segment, foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 12%, largely from the Mexican peso. Excluding our Venezuela business, EBIT on a constant dollar increased by 9% in the second quarter -- for the previous year quarter. And EBIT on a constant dollar increased 16% in the first half year of 2016 versus the previous year period. 
For the balance of the business, lower sales were somewhat offset by lower demand generating expenses. The year-to-date Latin America EBIT margin was 23.6% compared to 25.3% for the same period last year. Lower EBIT margin is mainly a result of lower gross margin from the deteriorating situation in Brazil and Venezuela, so when offset by cost reduction program. 
Slide 15 shows North America and Europe segment results. For the second quarter, North America and Europe EBIT was $99 million, an increase of 21% on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 31.1% was 450 basis points better than previous year quarter. Gross margin remained strong from the benefit of low dairy costs. With the operating expenses, reduction in A&P and SG&A cost savings helped fund the stack of investments and drove high EBIT margins. Year-to-date, EBIT margin was 29.2%, an improvement of 300 basis points versus the previous year period. Fuel for Growth savings programs and the dairy benefit contributed to improved EBIT margin. 
I will now address the financial results from EBIT to EPS on Slide 16. The interest expense of $26 million in the second quarter was similar to the first quarter of 2016 expense. When compared to the prior year quarter, the interest expense increase reflects the impact of the November 2015 $1.5 billion notes issuance. A significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. 
Since the ASR concluded on June 30, let me briefly provide you a summary of the transaction. During our Investor Day, we announced the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, of which $1 billion would be in the form of an ASR. 10.7 million shares of stock were received in the fourth quarter of 2015, an additional 2.1 million of shares of stock were received on June 30, 2016. In total, 12.8 million shares of stock were repurchased through the ASR program at an average price of $78.05 per share. Since the IPO, the company bought back 23.4 million of shares, with a total value of $1.8 billion. There are 184.7 million shares outstanding as of June 30. And in the last 12 months, this is a reduction of 18.5 million shares. 
The benefit from all share repurchase in 2015 and the full ASR program net of interest expense delivered almost $0.05 year-to-date and is in line with our full year guidance of $0.11 benefit per share in 2016. 
As part of the $1.5 billion share buyback program announced in 2015, we still have $500 million available for an additional repurchase program. We continue to focus on shareholder value creation. This includes EBIT margin accretion, sales and EPS growth, along with the return of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
Next, non-GAAP effective tax rate, or EPR was 18.3% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to 25.6% in the prior year quarter. In the second quarter of 2016, there was about $0.05 per share benefit as a result of utilizing foreign tax credits on dividends from our foreign operations. We expect the balance of the year to normalize. 
Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.88, an increase of 16% on a reported basis and 24% on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date non-GAAP EPS was $1.75, a decrease of 5% on a reported basis and an increase of 3% on a constant dollar basis. 
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the change to EPS on Slide 17. In the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.18 to $0.94 per share on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit negatively impacted EPS by $0.07. Our Fuel for Growth savings delivered $0.11 benefit. Advertising and promotions were $0.06 lower in the quarter. And the share repurchase program delivered a $0.02 benefit net of higher interest expense. Techs and other contributed the $0.06 benefit. Despite the negative impact of foreign currency of $0.06 per share, EPS increased by $0.12 versus second quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movements. On Slide 18, the cash balance of $1.7 billion as of June 30 was similar to the beginning of the year balance. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by $94 million as a result of timing of tax payments and other working capital movements. Our CapEx investments were $81 million, mainly in our U.S. and Europe manufacturing facility. For the full year ago, our capital spending goal remains about 4% of sales. Dividend payments were $155 million in the first half-year. The negative impact of foreign exchange impact of $32 million was related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela. 
To summarize our forward-looking annual guidance on Slide 19, our sales outlook for 2016 on a constant dollar basis expected to be 0 to 2% below the prior year. The foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 5%, reported sales are estimated to be 5% to 7% below 2015. 
We reaffirm our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance of $2.91 to $3.03. And our non-GAAP guidance of $3.48 to $3.60 per share for the following reasons: First, we expect the gross margin improvement from our previous guidance of 64%; second, our Fuel for Growth savings are well ahead of plan and will only partly be reinvested in our business; thirdly, we have an ETR benefit around $0.05 in the second quarter; and fourth, the foreign exchange impact is expected to be approximately $0.35 per share from our previous guidance of $0.40 per share. 
GAAP EPS guidance is slightly impacted by potentially significant future mark-to-market potential adjustments which cannot be estimated and classified as specified items. Specified items include charges related to Fuel for Growth and our Venezuela business. 
This concludes my discussion on the second quarter and first half year 2016 financial results. Thanks again for your time this morning. I'll now hand over the call back to Kasper."

However, the difficulty of getting product into China in this latest quarter did result in some selected out of stocks situations at retail as well as lower inventories in many of our distributors. So to the extent of the latter, we expect that we will gradually recover that over the second half of the year. A little bit hard to say whether we will recover it all in the third quarter because that involves speculating on how the importation process evolves. But we are quite encouraged and we are confident that some of these issues are sort of relatively short term in nature."

So you explicitly said in your slides in the Investor Day that you're looking for 300 basis points of margin improvement, not savings but margin improvement. And that implies your EBIT margin will get around 27% by 2018, all else equal. And that's an outlook that I think I've confirmed with the company in recent weeks. But you've also thought, including today, about how you're going to reinvest some of your savings back into your business which suggests that maybe that model of that $120 million, now $180 million is going to flow to the bottom-line. So I'm clearly just trying to figure out, Michel, how do I reconcile what seems to be some conflicting information out there? And I know it's not guidance. But from a rough outlook, is it long for us in the outside to think that margins are expected to go up by 300 basis points or more net of reinvestments over the next few [ph] years? I think that's a key question for people."

So at Investor Day, we said we will deliver $120 million of Fuel for Growth savings. And we also indicated that we will partly reinvest that and partly will be rolled through profitability. And in combination with a couple of other initiatives that we announced at Investor Day, we indicated that that will deliver a 300 basis points margin improvement from 24% to 27% indeed. So what we announced today is an incremental program of $60 million which should give us $180 million by 2018. From the $60 million, we indicate that we will use that to reinvest in our business to strengthen our future growth. So that will be not part of the growth to profitability."

Indeed, in many cases, it's an optimized station of discretionary spends that we have in the sales force that sit in the same line of the P&L.

There isn't anything we can really do to expedite it because, as I've said, it applies to the formal importation process into China. And the testing is handled by the Chinese, by Chinese government agencies outside of the control and involvement of the importing party. So you simply have to wait for your turn, so to speak, and for your individual import batch to be tested and then released through the importation process. It's clear that this created a very -- this was a very large undertaking by these responsible agencies in China. And there was some short-term backup. I'm absolutely confident that they are working day and night to resolve that. And sort of, as usual, I have great confidence in the fact that the Chinese government will resolve that and get back to more than normal importation flow as they refine these processes. So I do think that that part of it is sort of temporary. I think the part that will impact us is that of course, our financial year inevitably cuts off on the 31st of December. And there are two impacts in the near term from this. Firstly, there are the sales that we lost through supply shortages in the second quarter already. That -- an element of that, we will probably be able to recapture because we'll be able to replenish inventory in our distributors. But as I referenced, in response to David's question, at the outset of this Q&A session, there were out of stocks that occurred at the retail level which means that we did lose sales to consumers. And those are, if you wanted, permanently lost, so to speak. They're not going to be recovered. The second impact of it is that if you think about this, it effectively puts our kind of growth plans behind these products 2 months back because we have been in this constraint supply situation for the last couple of months, which means that the, given the rather steep growth curve that we have anticipated for these products, we'll be exiting the year, we'll be cutting off the year on the 31st of December at a point of lower sales than we would otherwise have done given the 2 months that we have sort of inevitably lost or partially lost."

I remain very, very optimistic about the way the Chinese government is going about this. It's natural that we would always wish that things could happen faster than they do. But what I see is a very clear determination by the Chinese government to ensure that products that are sold to China, for consumption by Chinese children, are all safe and in compliance with their standards. And that's a very reasonable goal. There are various initiatives that intersect as they pursue this latest one to try to get a handle on imported products, at least through the formal channels and making sure that those products comply with Chinese standards. I think it's a very positive one. I think there's still a significant amount of product going through sort of informal channels imported into China in small parcels, mainly through what we have previously called consumer-to-consumer e-commerce or what we can perhaps call unofficial exports out of say, Europe or Australia. I would expect the Chinese government, just looking at that. And overtime, they will determine a way to ensure that you can't have different quality standards applying to that sales channel than you had to the official sales channels. So overall, I'm very -- I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing, recognizing that is challenging us in the short-term but it's a good thing for the long-term development of the China market."

My comments will focus on our strategy and top line performance. And then Michel will follow up with some additional financial information on segment profitability and our company's cash flow. 
Let me begin by summarizing the company's second quarter performance before I provide additional details on each of our reporting segments. Except where I note otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results. At the end of last year, we laid out a 3-year plan for value creation, with this year being a year of transition. I also identified 3 key milestones we'd use to monitor our profits against this value-creation plan. I referenced these plans in our last earnings call, so let me reference them again today. 
Of the 3 milestones we laid out, the first was to return the business to constant-dollar sales-growth. Today, you'll hear us reiterate expectations for 2016 sales that anticipates that we'll return to growth in the coming quarters. Within the most recently completed quarter, demand in China for new products continued to grow. Actual shipments this quarter, however, were constrained by supply shortage caused by newly introduced, additional import processes at Chinese border points. More about this later. 
Despite these constraints, gross sales before trade support and discounts were in line with prior quarter. Net sales were lower than the quarter before, as trade support for new product introductions increased. Michel will elaborate on this a little bit later. 
Our second milestone is centered around our commitment to reduce our operating expense base. Year-to-date, we've delivered $47 million in expense reductions. We've already achieved nearly 80% of our annual target of $60 million. We are ahead of schedule. And in this call, we're announcing a revised, more ambitious target. 
We are both accelerating and expanding our cost initiatives by increasing our 2016 target to $75 million to $80 million in savings from the previously announced $60 million. We're also raising our 3-year cumulative savings goals from $120 million to $180 million. 
Our third and final milestone we said would be to invest a portion of our expense savings to fund key growth initiatives. To date, we've invested substantially behind the introduction of a fully imported Enfamil into China and the building of a toddler franchise in North America. This latest quarter, we made strong investments in support of our Enfinitas launch in China and the expansion of distribution reach. Over time, we'll demonstrate to you that these investments are essential to us delivering on our commitment to shareholder value creation. 
Turning now to our second quarter 2016 results. We continue to manage through a challenging global operating environment. Economic growth in many emerging and developing economies of Asia and Latin America has slowed over the past 18 to 24 months. Simultaneously, political uncertainty affects many markets in both Asia and South America. These effects present near-term headwinds for us. That said, we continue to find opportunity amidst the uncertainty. We continue to invest to put ourselves in the best possible position for when a turnaround and economic growth eventually materializes, and come, it will. 
For the second quarter, sales for the company was $942 million. Reported net sales were $9 million lower than the prior year quarter. Currency adversely impacted our results by 500 basis points. Consequently, constant-dollar sales were below -- excuse me, consequently, constant-dollar sales were 4% below those of the second quarter of 2015. Price was favorable by 1% despite added trade support in China, while volume was 5% unfavorable. 
Second quarter sales were impacted by significant investments to secure trade support and distribution of Enfinitas in China. Though costly in the near term, these investments will help establish the brand and drive long-term revenue growth. I'll return to the topics of Enfinitas a little later. 
In China, a requirement for additional product testing prior to importation took effect towards the end of the second quarter, causing delays to the importation process. I want to commend the Chinese government for its actions to enhance food safety standards and importation guidelines to ensure imported products can be safely used by Chinese parents and children. 
During the quarter, the government implemented new testing standards for imported products within our category. The effect of this change was a temporary delay in the importation of some of our fastest-growing products from our Netherlands facility. This drove some near-term volatility in our sales results. In the mid to long term, we, however, believe these additional processes will benefit both Chinese children and responsible operators within the industry. 
Outside of China, the deteriorating circumstances in Venezuela, that so tragically impacted the people and our colleagues there, have resulted in significantly reduced shipments to the country. When comparing to the second quarter of last year, this adversely impacted the company's sales by 130 basis points in the latest quarter. 
Despite the challenging operating environment, I'm pleased with the company's earnings power. Gross margin remained strong. Our strategy to drive growth of higher-value products and product forms is working and helps offset the impact of increased investments above the net sales line. Investments in advertising and promotion represented 17.6% of net sales in the quarter. 
Our Fuel for Growth cost-reduction initiative drove significant reduction in SG&A. Overall, these costs were down 9% in constant dollars in the second quarter compared to the same quarter of prior year. 
While we made significant investments in key growth initiatives, our EBIT margin was 24.4% in the quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.88. Michel will expand on our earnings delivery a little later. 
I'll now discuss the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with the North America/Europe segment. 
Net sales in the North America/Europe segment were in line with the second quarter of 2015 on a constant-dollar basis and improved sequentially from the first quarter. A 1% benefit from price was offset by lower volumes. Additionally, we experienced additional headwind of 1% from foreign exchange. 
The Center for Disease Control recently issued their report on 2015 U.S. birth and birth rates. Reported annual birth was 0.3% below the 2014 level. Breastfeeding rates, however, appeared to have stabilized. Our market share in the U.S. business stabilized in the second quarter but remained at a level lower than the prior year. In our outlook, we are recognizing it will likely take longer than hoped for to recover market share. Much of our share loss was within the specialty and solution segment of the infant formula market. But we are confident we understand our challenges and we're addressing them. 
There are bright spots within this reporting segment also. Last October, we introduced a new 32-ounce liquids packaging. This product line is now growing double digits, and we are gaining share in the high-value liquids category. 
It's still early days for our premium-priced Inspire products but reception from retailers has been favorable, and we expect to see distribution increase in the coming quarters as we build consumer demand. 
Our North American toddler business, defined as products targeting children more than 1 year of age, continues to grow at an annual rate in double digits. 
And turning to Canada. I continue to be pleased with our progress. Second quarter sales grew double digits based on strong market share gains in both the infant and children segments. We've executed extremely well over the past year or 2, and our Canadian team is deservedly receiving much internal recognition. 
Our European business remains strong based on a leading position in the growing allergy segment there. We are well positioned to benefit from future increases in diagnosis and have a strong innovation pipeline to support our growth in Europe. 
Let me now turn to Latin America. Constant-dollar sales for the total region was 3% lower than the prior year same quarter. Pricing benefits of 9% was insufficient to fully offset foreign exchange impacts of 13%. Excluding the impact of our sharply reduced business in Venezuela, Latin America sales grew 4% in constant dollars over the same quarter of 2015. 
Mexico and Colombia were the biggest contributors to growth. In Mexico, we are seeing improved momentum in both our premium pediatric nutrition business and our milk modifier business. We enjoy strong market shares in our milk modifier business and retain our #1 position in this category. In infant formulas, we recently rolled out a product containing Milk Fat Globular Membranes (sic) [Milk Fat Globule Membranes], the same key ingredient contained in Enfinitas and its by-products launched in China and the U.S. 
Trends in other parts of Latin America remain broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. In Brazil, the economic challenges continue to hurt demand for discretionary items by our mid-priced children's products. The infant premium formula products are less discretionary, and they continue to grow. We continue to benefit from strong sales in our Colombian unit, which maintained strong market shares, and in addition, is benefiting from cross-border demand from Venezuela. 
We are rolling out our new plastics packaging and refill systems across Latin America. And in some markets, we are testing ready-to-drink versions of our children's products. These initiatives will allow us to take advantage of segment growth opportunities and support selective increases in price. 
I'll turn now to the Asia segment. Constant-dollar-growth sales in Asia were in line with the second quarter of 2015. In support of the Enfinitas launch in China, trade investments, however, were significantly higher when compared to the prior year. Partly as a result of this, price was unfavorable by 2%, as the increased trade investments in China more than offset the impact of price increases in Southeast Asia. 
Across the region, product mix continued to improve with sales of our premium-priced products going faster than those of our lower-priced variants. Volume was unfavorable by 5%, as we experienced delays to importation in China and dealt with some market share weakness in the Philippines. Despite improving momentum in China, the Asia region has not yet recovered to sales levels seen in the early part of 2015. 
In the Philippines, we've seen softer market share in sales of Lactum, our mid-priced children's brand. We feel we've identified the root causes behind our share loss and have a remedial plan that will allow us to get back on track. 
Our Malaysia business is growing both volume and price. We recently introduced a new formulation and improved packaging that will allow us to recover market share over time. 
Across Southeast Asia, we are rolling out new product formulations and promoting the benefits of our new plastics packaging. Supported by an improved value equation, we are raising prices behind this innovation. 
I will finish my discussion of the Asia segment with China. In my introductory headlines, I described the import delays caused by increased processes at all border points. In Mainland China, the government implemented a new requirement that every batch be extensively tested prior to release to Chinese consumers. Previously, a sampling approach has been applied. The increase in the number of tests required caused temporary delays as testing and verification capacity was stretched. The effect of this was a temporary delay in the importation and shortage of supply of many of our fastest-growing imported line items, as I mentioned earlier. We, nevertheless, are pleased to see these measures implemented. 
Similarly, increased customs monitoring and reduced visitor numbers have adversely impacted our Hong Kong business. It's become more challenging for our Hong Kong business to compete for visiting Chinese tourists that now connects these imported products more easily from within the Mainland. These challenges confirm our China strategy pursuing increased flexibilities through a broader product portfolio sold through a more diverse set of sales channels. 
Turning now to Mainland China, where our fully imported products continues to gather momentum, and we're seeing stronger demand from consumers. Through the second quarter, we continued to grow market share of the imported segment. In the baby store channel, we've increased our distribution, supported by our most recent, new product introductions. We are seeing both our ability to make progress and the substantial runway we have ahead of us. 
As of the second quarter, we are no longer under indexing versus the market in the fast-growing baby store channel. Our new Enfinitas product line is off to a solid start. Three months after introductions, we are still building distribution and demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs. 
In totality, I'm satisfied with the progress we've made with our portfolio and channel transformation in China. I also recognize we've got a long way to go and a lot of opportunities ahead of us. It's hard not to be excited about the immense potential of not only our China business but our global business. 
Before I hand over to Michel, I want to provide an updated outlook for full year 2016,  our year of transition, a year in which we are addressing several structural opportunities within both our brand portfolio, our product lineup and our cost structure. 
At the beginning of the year, we knew comparisons in the first half 2016 would be challenging. I'm satisfied that many of our critical initiatives have gone as planned, and we are expecting growth over prior year in the second half of the year. However, we've seen 3 developments causing us to revisit our estimate for full year 2016 constant-dollar-sales growth. It's taking us longer than expected to recover the market share we lost in the U.S. towards the end of 2015. 
Secondly, the import-related challenges in China, Hong Kong in the second quarter cost of sales we won't fully recapture until next year. 
Thirdly, we are supporting our imported portfolio in China with additional trade support. In light of these factors, we now expect constant-dollar sales in line with or not more than 2% below the 2015 level. 
Through the first half of the year, we've identified several opportunities within our cost structure. In doing so, we found additional opportunities to both reduce cost and increase efficiencies. In a moment, Michel will outline an expanded ambition and scope for our operating expense initiative, the project we refer to as Fuel for Growth. Despite lower sales, a slightly improved outlook for gross margin, expense optimization and the benefit realized from a lower tax rate in the just completed quarter allow us to reiterate our expectation for non-GAAP earnings per share of $3 -- of between $3.48 and $3.60 for the full year 2016. 
I'll now hand over to Michel, who will provide additional details on our second quarter and first half financial performance. I'll then return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."

Today, I will discuss the company's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results for each segment, cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary",2809,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results for each segment, cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of full year guidance. 
Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statement into U.S. dollars. In addition, my comment about sales will refer to net sales, unless I explicitly call out gross sales. 
Let me start with sales as shown on Slide 3. Kasper addressed the constant-dollar change. I will focus on the reported sales and the foreign currency impact. For both the second quarter and first half year, adverse foreign exchange rates contributed to a 500 basis points decline compared to the same period of the prior year. Second quarter net sales on a reported dollar basis grew 9% below prior year quarter. Reduced shipments to Venezuela impacted net sales negatively by 1% in the second quarter versus the prior year quarter. 
Slide 4 summarizes the impact of foreign exchange on sales. U.S. dollar continued to be strong and effects of translation of local currencies negatively impacted all reporting segments. However, the impact was slightly less significant in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the trend from the last 3 quarters. Nearly 2/3 of the second quarter negative currency impact on sales were from the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso and the Argentine peso. The balance of the adverse foreign exchange impact was widespread across regions. 
As a result of the year-to-date foreign exchange impact, our outstanding currency hedges for the remaining of the year and the current forward rate, we are revising our currency expectations from minus 6% to minus 5% adverse foreign exchange impact on sales for the full year 2016. I will address foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well. 
I'm introducing Slide 5 for better transparency of gross sales, which reflects sales to customers before trade investment and other items, which are recorded as gross to net sales adjustments. We reallocated some investments in the second quarter from advertising and promotion to trade investments, in support of the rollout of Enfinitas and build on our momentum of the fully imported premium products that were introduced in the second quarter of last year. Gross sales on a constant-dollar basis were flat compared to the prior year quarter and down 2% for the first half year of 2016 versus the same period last year. The significant gross sales improvement in the second quarter has been realized. 
Slide 6. The second quarter EBIT of $230 million was 10% above the prior year quarter on a constant-dollar basis. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 6%, including currency impacts. EBIT increased 4% on a reported basis in the second quarter. 
If you would exclude Venezuela, our EBIT on constant-dollar basis improved by 14% versus prior year quarter. The second quarter EBIT margin of 24.4% of sales was 290 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Despite macroeconomic and country-specific challenges which impacted our sales, we made excellent progress to reduce operating expenses as part of our Fuel for Growth program which allowed continued investments and, at the same time, improve the underlying profitability. Year-to-date EBIT was $474 million, a decline of 1% versus previous year on a constant-dollar basis. Foreign exchange, an adverse impact of 8%. 
Excluding Venezuela, EBIT in the first half year improved by 3% versus previous year period on a constant-dollar basis, mainly driven by a higher gross margin and our cost savings realized in the first half year, partly offset by demand-generating investments. 
I will now move to the factors that impact gross margin on Slide 7. Gross margin was 65.1% in the second quarter of 2016, or 66% on a constant-dollar non-GAAP basis. Adverse foreign exchange impacted the gross margin by 150 basis points in the second quarter. We were able to deliver a nearly flat gross margin on a reported basis in both the second quarter and the first half year compared to the previous-year periods despite the significant currency headwind. 
Sales had a slightly negative impact on gross margin from higher-trade investment, especially in China. Low dairy cost continued to be the large benefit to gross margin in the second quarter and first half of 2016. Our key dairy components have been secured through supply contracts for the remainder of the year, and we expect some further benefits, although the dairy benefits for the remainder of the year will be smaller compared to the first half year. 
We continue to deliver productivity savings within cost of goods sold. Year-to-date, the supply chain team delivered productivity savings of around 3.5% of cost of goods sold, in line with our expectation. With dairy secured for the full year, we expect full year gross margin to be slightly better than our prior year guidance of 64%. 
Moving to operating expenses. I will start with advertising and promotion investments  on Slide 8. Advertising and promotion was 17.6% of sales in the second quarter compared to 18.4% in the prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, in the second quarter, we reallocated a portion of investments from A&P to trade investments, which are recognized in gross to net sales. Despite the year-over-year savings, the second quarter of both years marked noticeably higher investments. The incremental investments were mainly to support key China initiatives, last year for the launch of our fully imported products and in April of this year, the launch of the Enfinitas product line and the continued support of our greater China strategy. 
In the second quarter, we purposefully delayed some A&P investments due to delays in the importation of some of our China product impacting our sales. As such, we expect that third quarter may continue to be in elevated level before it normalizes in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 9 provides the combined spending of the mine-generating investments, both as trade investments classified in gross to net sales and advertising and promotion. Some of the key trade investment activities include trade support, customer programs and promotional pricing. For the second quarter, the combined investment increased above the prior year quarter and was also higher versus the last few quarters. 
Trade spending is focused close to our consumer and to ensure our products are present with strong distribution in the key growing channels. In the past few quarters, we've increased these investments, especially in China, to be more competitive in the baby store and e-commerce channels. While we increased trade investments, we plan to reduce the A&P as a percentage of sales over the next few years. 
Last quarter, we committed to provide an update on our review of advertising and promotion expenditures. At Investor's Day last year, when I spoke about advertising and promotion, I stated that we should be able to optimize a lower A&P by 50 to 100 basis points over 3 years. We can now confirm that we expect to be at the top of that range and reduce our A&P by 100 basis points by 2018. We will realize this by prioritizing investment choices that maximize our return on investments of key influence drivers. 
We will continue to optimize our nonmedia expenses and leverage our decision-supporting tools better. In addition, we will strengthen our focus on digital marketing versus the traditional media. 
Slide 10. We reduced our SG&A cost by 9% on a constant-dollar basis in the second quarter of 2016 versus the previous-year quarter and by 10% year-to-date compared to the prior year period. Like we indicated before, our Fuel for Growth program is focused on cost reduction within our support functions and marketing. 
Areas of focus were the reduction of key vendor contracts, eliminates discretionary spend and optimize organization layers. As you can see from Slide 11, we are significantly ahead of schedule on the original 2016 Fuel for Growth target. Our Fuel for Growth target for this year was $60 million. By mid-year, we've delivered 79% of this year's target savings, or $47 million already. Especially in the corporate overhead functions, we were able to reduce our cost by $30 million in the first half year of 2016 versus the first half year of 2015. Significant progress has been made by systematically renegotiating contracts with our largest vendors. 
Slide 12. Over the last few months, we performed a more extended, deep-dive review of our expenses as well as our organizational structure. We concluded, based also on the success of our results to-date, to accelerate certain cost-savings programs identified earlier and to expand the scope to all operating expenses functions, including sales force and distribution. We now expect to deliver $75 million to $80 million of savings in 2016. This is an increase of $15 million to $20 million versus our original 2016 target. Taking into account the savings realized in 2015 of $20 million, cumulative savings by the end of 2016 are expected to be around $95 million to $100 million. 
In addition to the original program of $120 million, we expect an incremental $60 million of cost-savings opportunities by 2018. The combined Fuel for Growth program will now deliver $180 million savings by 2018. 
The incremental Fuel for Growth savings will provide additional flexibility to invest in the company's future growth. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a discussion of EBIT by segment. Let me start with Asia. In the second quarter, Asia delivered an EBIT of $137 million, a decrease of 4% on a constant-dollar basis compared to prior year quarter. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by additional 8%. Lastly, from the Chinese renminbi, the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit. The Asia EBIT margin at 30% declined 50 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The main drivers were lower sales and an increase in trade investment in gross to net sales. The lower net sales impact was somewhat offset by a favorable dairy cost and some lower A&P expenses. 
For the first half year of 2016, the Asian EBIT margin of 32% were 350 basis points lower than the prior year, as lower sales and higher-demand-generation investments were not fully offset by the dairy benefit. A&P as a percentage of sales increased in the first half year versus the previous period. 
Turning to Slide 14. Latin America delivered EBIT of $36 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 7% on a constant-dollar basis compared to the prior year quarter. For this segment, foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 12%, largely from the Mexican peso. Excluding our Venezuela business, EBIT on a constant dollar increased by 9% in the second quarter -- for the previous year quarter. And EBIT on a constant dollar increased 16% in the first half year of 2016 versus the previous-year period. 
For the balance of the business, lower sales were somewhat offset by lower-demand-generating expenses. The year-to-date Latin America EBIT margin was 23.6% compared to 25.3% for the same period last year. Lower EBIT margin is mainly a result of lower gross margin from the deteriorating situation in Brazil and Venezuela, somewhat offset by cost-reduction programs. 
Slide 15 shows the North America/Europe segment results. For the second quarter, North America/Europe EBIT was $99 million, an increase of 21% on a constant-dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 31.1% was 450 basis points better than previous year quarter. Gross margin remained strong from the benefit of low dairy costs. Within operating expenses, reduction in A&P and SG&A cost savings helped fund selective investments and drove high EBIT margins. Year-to-date, EBIT margin was 29.2%, an improvement of 300 basis points versus previous-year period. Fuel for Growth savings programs and the dairy benefit contributed to the improved EBIT margin. 
I will now address the financial results from EBIT to EPS on Slide 16. The interest expense of $26 million in the second quarter was similar to the first quarter of 2016 expense. When compared to the prior year quarter, the interest expense increase reflects the impact of the November 2015 $1.5 billion notes issuance. A significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. 
Since the ASR concluded on June 30, let me briefly provide you a summary of the transaction. During our Investor Day, we announced the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, of which $1 billion would be in the form of an ASR. 10.7 million shares of stock were received in the fourth quarter of 2015, an additional 2.1 million of shares of stock were received on June 30, 2016. In total, 12.8 million shares of stock were repurchased through the ASR program at an average price of $78.05 per share. Since the IPO, the company bought back 23.4 million of shares, with a total value of $1.8 billion. There are 184.7 million shares outstanding as of June 30. And in the last 12 months, this is a reduction of 18.5 million shares. 
The benefit from all share repurchase in 2015 and the full ASR program, net of interest expense, delivered almost $0.05 year-to-date and is in line with our full year guidance of $0.11 benefit per share in 2016. 
As part of the $1.5 billion share buyback program announced in 2015, we still have $500 million available for an additional repurchase program. We continue to focus on shareholder value creation. This includes EBIT margin accretion, sales and EPS growth, along with the return of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
Next, non-GAAP effective tax rate, or EPR, was 18.3% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to 25.6% in the prior year quarter. In the second quarter of 2016, there was about $0.05 per share benefit as a result of utilizing foreign tax credits on dividends from our foreign operations. We expect the EPR for the balance of the year to normalize. 
Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.88, an increase of 16% on a reported basis and 24% on a constant-dollar basis. Year-to-date non-GAAP EPS was $1.75, a decrease of 5% on a reported basis and an increase of 3% on a constant-dollar basis. 
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the change to EPS on Slide 17. In the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.18 to $0.94 per share on a constant-dollar basis versus the prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit negatively impacted EPS by $0.07. Our Fuel for Growth savings delivered $0.11 benefit. Advertising and promotions were $0.06 lower in the quarter, and that share repurchase program delivered a $0.02 benefit, net of higher interest expense. Tax and other contributed a $0.06 benefit. Despite the negative impact of foreign currency of $0.06 per share, EPS increased by $0.12 versus second quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movements. On Slide 18, the cash balance of $1.7 billion as of June 30 was similar to the beginning-of-the-year balance. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by $94 million as a result of timing of tax payments and other working capital movements. Our CapEx investments were $81 million, mainly in our U.S. and Europe manufacturing facilities. For the full year ago, our capital spending goal remains about 4% of sales. Dividend payments were $155 million in the first half year. The negative impact of foreign exchange impact of $32 million was related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela. 
To summarize our forward-looking annual guidance on Slide 19, our sales outlook for 2016 on a constant-dollar basis is expected to be 0 to 2% below the prior year. With foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 5%, reported sales are estimated to be 5% to 7% below 2015. 
We reaffirm our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance of $2.91 to $3.03 and our non-GAAP guidance of $3.48 to $3.60 per share for the following reasons: First, we expect a gross margin improvement from our previous guidance of 64%; second, our Fuel for Growth savings are well ahead of plan and will only partly be reinvested in our business; thirdly, we have an ETR benefit around $0.05 in the second quarter; and fourth, the foreign exchange impact is expected to be approximately $0.35 per share from our previous guidance of $0.40 per share. 
GAAP EPS guidance is slightly to be impacted by potentially significant future market-to-market pension adjustments, which cannot be estimated and are classified as specified items. Specified items include charges related to Fuel for Growth and our Venezuela business. 
This concludes my discussion on the second quarter and first half year 2016 financial results. Thanks again for your time this morning. I will now hand over the call back to Kasper."

Before we open the lines for questions, let me briefly reiterate our expectations that our relative performance will improve as we move into the second half of 2016. We expect to see the company return to positive growth in the coming quarters and our guidance reflects that. Our efforts to reshape our product and brand portfolio in China are progressing well, so is our initiative to strengthen our presence in the fast-growing channels there. We're gaining momentum in Mexico, Canada and Malaysia while we are addressing our performance shortfalls in the U.S. and the Philippines. We are partaking our ability to invest to maximize our opportunities by improving our gross margins to improve product mix and by lowering our expense base. And finally, we remain as committed as ever to shareholder value creation. 
With that, Liz, could I ask you to open the lines for questions, please?"

So we feel that we are gaining share in the -- with our new products, both in our -- in the super high-premium segment where we obviously came from a standing start and in the imported product segment where we've now been at it for a little while. However, the difficulty of getting product into China in this latest quarter did result -- did some selective out-of-stocks situations at retail as well as lower inventories in many of our distributors. So to the extent of the latter, we expect that we will gradually recover that over the second half of the year. A little bit hard to say whether we will recover it all in the third quarter because that involves speculating on how the importation process evolves. But we are quite encouraged and we are confident that some of these issues are sort of relatively short term in nature."

So you explicitly said in your slides from the Investor Day that you're looking for 300 basis points of margin improvement, not savings but margin improvement. And that implies that your EBIT margin will get to around 27% by 2018, all else equal. And that's an outlook that I think I've confirmed with the company in recent weeks. But you've also talked, including today, about how you're going to reinvest some of your savings back into the business, which suggests that maybe model all of that $120 million, now $180 million, is going to flow to the bottom line. So I'm clearly just trying to figure out, Michel, how do I reconcile what seems to be some conflicting information out there? And I know it's not guidance, but from a rough outlook, is it wrong for us on the outside to think that margins are expected to go up by 300 basis points or more net of reinvestments over the next few years?

John, I think as fast it comes to the sales force, the organizations and reductions in spend, firstly, you should not necessarily infer that greater efficiency in our sales force expenses means a reduction in force. Indeed, in many cases, it's an optimization of discretionary spends that we have in the sales force that sit in the same line of the P&L. But it's also true to say that outside of the sort of frontline sales force, there are probably opportunities selectively across our global organizations to organize ourselves a bit differently. So I would say that. I think maybe the -- on the A&P side, I think we're simply recognizing that there are efficiencies available to us as the world is changing that we all have to put more energy into taking advantage of.

There isn't anything we can really do to expedite it because, as I've said, it applies to the formal importation process into China. And the testing is handled by the Chinese -- by Chinese government agencies outside of the control and involvement of the importing party. So you simply have to wait for your turn, so to speak, and for your individual import batch to be tested and then released through the importation process. It's clear that this created a very -- this was a very large undertaking by these responsible agencies in China. And there was some short-term backup. I'm absolutely confident that they are working day and night to resolve that. And sort of, as usual, I have great confidence in the fact that the Chinese government will resolve that and get back to more of a normal importation flow as they refine these processes. So I do think that, that part of it is sort of temporary. I think the part that will impact us is that, of course, our financial year inevitably cuts off on the 31st of December. And there are 2 impacts in the near term from this. Firstly, there are the sales that we lost through supply shortages in the second quarter already. That -- an element of that, we will probably be able to recapture because we'll be able to replenish inventory in our distributors. But as I referenced, in response to David's question at the outset of this Q&A session, there were out of stocks that occurred at the retail level, which means that we did lose sales to consumers. And those are, if you wanted, permanently lost, so to speak. They're not going to be recovered. The second impact of it is that if you think about this, it effectively puts our kind of growth plans behind these products 2 months back because we've been in this constrained supply situation for the last couple of months, which means that the -- given the rather steep growth curve that we had anticipated for these products, we'll be exiting the year, we'll be cutting off the year on the 31st of December at a point of lower sales than we would otherwise have done, given the 2 months that we have sort of inevitably [ph]  Lost or partially lost."

I remain very, very optimistic about the way the Chinese government is going about this. It's natural that we would always wish that things could happen faster than they do. But what I see is a very clear determination by the Chinese government to ensure that products that are sold to China -- for consumption by Chinese children are all safe and in compliance with their standards. And that's a very reasonable goal. There are various initiatives that intersect as they pursue this latest one to try to get a handle on imported products, at least through the formal channels and making sure that those products comply with Chinese standards. I think it's a very positive one. I think there's still a significant amount of product going through sort of informal channels imported into China in small parcels, mainly through what we have previously called consumer-to-consumer e-commerce or what we can perhaps call unofficial exports out of say, Europe or Australia. I would expect the Chinese government just looking at that. And over time,  they will determine a way to ensure that you can't have different quality standards applying to that sales channel than you have to the official sales channels. So overall, I'm very -- I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing, recognizing that is challenging us in the short-term but it's a good thing for the long-term development of the China market."

My comments will focus on our strategy and top line performance. And then Michel will follow up with some additional financial information and elaborate on segment profitability and our company's cash flow. 
Let me begin by summarizing the company's second quarter performance before I provide additional details on each of our reporting segments. Except where I note otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results. At the end of last year, we laid out a 3-year plan for value creation, with this year being a year of transition. I also identified 3 key milestones we'd use to monitor our profits against this value-creation plan. I referenced these plans in our last earnings call, so let me reference them again today. 
Of the 3 milestones we laid out, the first was to return the business to constant-dollar sales-growth. Today, you'll hear us reiterate expectations for 2016 sales that anticipates that we'll return to growth in the coming quarters. Within the most recently completed quarter, demand in China for new products continued to grow. Actual shipments this quarter, however, were constrained by supply shortage caused by newly introduced, additional import processes at Chinese border points. More about this later. 
Despite these constraints, gross sales before trade support and discounts were in line with prior quarter. Net sales were lower than the quarter before, as trade support for new product introductions increased. Michel will elaborate on this a little bit later. 
Our second milestone is centered around our commitment to reduce our operating expense base. Year-to-date, we've delivered $47 million in expense reductions. We've already achieved nearly 80% of our annual target of $60 million. We are ahead of schedule. And in this call, we're announcing a revised, more ambitious target. 
We are both accelerating and expanding our cost initiatives by increasing our 2016 target to $75 million to $80 million in savings from the previously announced $60 million. We're also raising our 3-year cumulative savings goals from $120 million to $180 million. 
Our third and final milestone we said would be to invest a portion of our expense savings to fund key growth initiatives. To date, we've invested substantially behind the introduction of a fully imported Enfamil into China and the building of a toddler franchise in North America. This latest quarter, we made strong investments in support of our Enfinitas launch in China and the expansion of distribution reach. Over time, we'll demonstrate to you that these investments are essential to us delivering on our commitment to shareholder value creation. 
Turning now to our second quarter 2016 results. We continue to manage through a challenging global operating environment. Economic growth in many emerging and developing economies of Asia and Latin America has slowed over the past 18 to 24 months. Simultaneously, political uncertainty affects many markets in both Asia and South America. These effects present near-term headwinds for us. That said, we continue to find opportunity amidst the uncertainty. We continue to invest to put ourselves in the best possible position for when a turnaround and economic growth eventually materializes, and come, it will. 
For the second quarter, sales for the company was $942 million. Reported net sales were $9 million lower than the prior year quarter. Currency adversely impacted our results by 500 basis points. Consequently, constant-dollar sales were below -- excuse me, consequently, constant-dollar sales were 4% below those of the second quarter of 2015. Price was favorable by 1% despite added trade support in China, while volume was 5% unfavorable. 
Second quarter sales were impacted by significant investments to secure trade support and distribution of Enfinitas in China. Though costly in the near term, these investments will help establish the brand and drive long-term revenue growth. I'll return to the topics of Enfinitas a little later. 
In China, a requirement for additional product testing prior to importation took effect towards the end of the second quarter, causing delays to the importation process. I want to commend the Chinese government for its actions to enhance food safety standards and importation guidelines to ensure imported products can be safely used by Chinese parents and children. 
During the quarter, the government implemented new testing standards for imported products within our category. The effect of this change was a temporary delay in the importation of some of our fastest-growing products from our Netherlands facility. This drove some near-term volatility in our sales results. In the mid to long term, we, however, believe these additional processes will benefit both Chinese children and responsible operators within the industry. 
Outside of China, the deteriorating circumstances in Venezuela, that so tragically impact the people and our colleagues there, have resulted in significantly reduced shipments to the country. When comparing to the second quarter of last year, this adversely impacted the company's sales by 130 basis points in the latest quarter. 
Despite the challenging operating environment, I'm pleased with the company's earnings power. Gross margin remained strong. Our strategy to drive growth of higher-value products and product forms is working and helps offset the impact of increased investments above the net sales line. Investments in advertising and promotion represented 17.6% of net sales in the quarter. 
Our Fuel for Growth cost-reduction initiative drove significant reduction in SG&A. Overall, these costs were down 9% in constant dollars in the second quarter compared to the same quarter of prior year. 
While we made significant investments in key growth initiatives, our EBIT margin was 24.4% in the quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.88. Michel will expand on our earnings delivery a little later. 
I'll now discuss the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with the North America/Europe segment. 
Net sales in the North America/Europe segment were in-line with the second quarter of 2015 on a constant-dollar basis and improved sequentially from the first quarter. A 1% benefit from price was offset by lower volumes. Additionally, we experienced additional headwind of 1% from foreign exchange. 
The Center for Disease Control recently issued their report on 2015 U.S. birth and birth rates. Reported annual birth was 0.3% below the 2014 level. Breastfeeding rates, however, appeared to have stabilized. Our market share in the U.S. business stabilized in the second quarter but remained at a level lower than the prior year. In our outlook, we are recognizing it will likely take longer than hoped for to recover market share. Much of our share loss was within the specialty and solution segment of the infant formula market. But we are confident we understand our challenges and we're addressing them. 
There are bright spots within this reporting segment also. Last October, we introduced a new 32-ounce liquids packaging. This product line is now growing double digits, and we are gaining share in the high-value liquids category. 
It's still the early days for our premium-priced Enspire products but reception from retailers has been favorable, and we expect to see distribution increase in the coming quarters as we build consumer demand. 
Our North American toddler business, defined as products targeting children more than 1 year of age, continues to grow at an annual rate in double digits. 
And turning to Canada. I continue to be pleased with our progress. Second quarter sales grew double digits based on strong market share gains in both the infant and children segments. We've executed extremely well over the past year or 2, and our Canadian team is deservedly receiving much internal recognition. 
Our European business remains strong based on a leading position in the growing allergy segment there. We are well-positioned to benefit from future increases in diagnosis and have a strong innovation pipeline to support our growth in Europe. 
Let me now turn to Latin America. Constant-dollar sales for the total region was 3% lower than the prior year same quarter. Pricing benefits of 9% was insufficient to fully offset foreign exchange impacts of 13%. Excluding the impact of our sharply reduced business in Venezuela, Latin America sales grew 4% in constant dollars over the same quarter of 2015. 
Mexico and Colombia were the biggest contributors to growth. In Mexico, we are seeing improved momentum in both our premium pediatric nutrition business and our milk modifier business. We enjoy strong market shares in our milk modifier business and retain our #1 position in this category. In infant formulas, we recently rolled out a product containing Milk Fat Globular Membranes (sic) [Milk Fat Globule Membranes], the same key ingredient contained in Enfinitas and Enspire products launched in China and the U.S. 
Trends in other parts of Latin America remain broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. In Brazil, economic challenges continue to hurt demand for discretionary items like our mid-priced children's products. The premium infant formula products are less discretionary, and they continue to grow. We continue to benefit from strong sales in our Colombian unit, which maintains strong market shares, and in addition, is benefiting from cross-border demand from Venezuela. 
We are rolling out our new plastics packaging and refill systems across Latin America. And in some markets, we are testing ready-to-drink versions of our children's products. These initiatives will allow us to take advantage of segment growth opportunities and support selective increases in price. 
I'll turn now to the Asia segment. Constant-dollar-growth sales in Asia were in-line with the second quarter of 2015. In support of the Enfinitas launch in China, trade investments, however, were significantly higher when compared to the prior year. Partly as a result of this, price was unfavorable by 2%, as the increased trade investments in China more than offset the impact of price increases in Southeast Asia. 
Across the region, product mix continued to improve with sales of our premium-priced products going faster than those of our lower-priced variants. Volume was unfavorable by 5%, as we experienced delays to importation in China and dealt with some market share weakness in the Philippines. Despite improving momentum in China, the Asia region has not yet recovered to sales levels seen in the early part of 2015. 
In the Philippines, we've seen softer market share in sales of Lactum, our mid-priced children's brand. We feel we've identified the root causes behind our share loss and have a remedial plan that will allow us to get back on track. 
Our Malaysia business is growing both volume and price. We recently introduced a new formulation and improved packaging that will allow us to recover market share over time. 
Across Southeast Asia, we are rolling out new product formulations and promoting the benefits of our new plastics packaging. Supported by an improved value equation, we are raising prices behind this innovation. 
I will finish my discussion of the Asia segment with China. In my introductory headlines, I described the import delays caused by increased processes at all border points. In Mainland China, the government implemented a new requirement that every batch be extensively tested prior to release to Chinese consumers. Previously, a sampling approach has been applied. The increase in the number of tests required caused temporary delays as testing and verification capacity was stretched. The effect of this was a temporary delay in the importation and shortage of supply of many of our fastest-growing imported line items, as I mentioned earlier. We, nevertheless, are pleased to see these measures implemented. 
Similarly, increased customs monitoring and reduced visitor numbers have adversely impacted our Hong Kong business. It's become more challenging for our Hong Kong business to compete for visiting Chinese tourists that now connects these imported products more easily from within the Mainland. These challenges confirm our China strategy pursuing increased flexibilities through a broader product portfolio sold through a more diverse set of sales channels. 
Turning now to Mainland China, where our fully imported products continues to gather momentum, and we're seeing strong demand from consumers. Through the second quarter, we continued to grow market share of the imported segment. In the baby store channel, we've increased our distribution, supported by our most recent, new product introductions. We are seeing both our ability to make progress and the substantial runway we have ahead of us. 
As of the second quarter, we are no longer under indexing versus the market in the fast-growing baby store channel. Our new Enfinitas product line is off to a solid start. Three months after introductions, we are still building distribution and demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs. 
In totality, I'm satisfied with the progress we've made with our portfolio and channel transformation in China. I also recognize we've got a long way to go and a lot of opportunities ahead of us. It's hard not to be excited about the immense potential of not only our China business but our global business. 
Before I hand over to Michel, I want to provide an updated outlook for full year 2016,  our year of transition, a year in which we are addressing several structural opportunities within both our brand portfolio, our product lineup and our cost structure. 
At the beginning of the year, we knew comparisons in the first half 2016 would be challenging. I'm satisfied that many of our critical initiatives have gone as planned, and we are expecting growth over prior year in the second half of the year. However, we've seen 3 developments causing us to revisit our estimate for full year 2016 constant-dollar-sales growth. It's taking us longer than expected to recover the market share we lost in the U.S. towards the end of 2015. 
Secondly, the import-related challenges in China, Hong Kong in the second quarter cost of sales we won't fully recapture until next year. 
Thirdly, we are supporting our imported portfolio in China with additional trade support. In light of these factors, we now expect constant-dollar sales in-line with or not more than 2% below the 2015 level. 
Through the first half of the year, we've identified several opportunities within our cost structure. In doing so, we found additional opportunities to both reduce cost and increase efficiencies. In a moment, Michel will outline an expanded ambition and scope for our operating expense initiative, the project we refer to as Fuel for Growth. Despite lower sales, a slightly improved outlook for gross margin, expense optimization and the benefit realized from a lower tax rate in the just completed quarter allow us to reiterate our expectation for non-GAAP earnings per share of $3 -- of between $3.48 and $3.60 for the full year 2016. 
I'll now hand over to Michel, who will provide additional details on our second quarter and first half financial performance. I'll then return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."

Today, I will discuss the company's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results for each segment, cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary",2807,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results for each segment, cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of full year guidance. 
Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statement into U.S. dollars. In addition, my comments about sales will refer to net sales, unless I explicitly call out gross sales. 
Let me start with sales as shown on Slide 3. Kasper addressed the constant-dollar change. I will focus on the reported sales and the foreign currency impact. For both the second quarter and first half year, adverse foreign exchange rates contributed to a 500 basis points decline compared to the same period of the prior year. Second quarter net sales on a reported dollar basis grew 9% below prior year quarter. Reduced shipments to Venezuela impacted net sales negatively by 1% in the second quarter versus the prior year quarter. 
Slide 4 summarizes the impact of foreign exchange on sales. U.S. dollar continued to be strong and effects of translation of local currencies negatively impacted all reporting segments. However, the impact was slightly less significant in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the trend from the last 3 quarters. Nearly 2/3 of the second quarter negative currency impact on sales were from the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso and the Argentine peso. The balance of the adverse foreign exchange impact was widespread across regions. 
As a result of the year-to-date foreign exchange impact, our outstanding currency hedges for the remaining of the year and the current forward rate, we are revising our currency expectations from minus 6% to minus 5% adverse foreign exchange impact on sales for the full year 2016. I will address foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well. 
I'm introducing Slide 5 for better transparency of gross sales, which reflects sales to customers before trade investment and other items, which are recorded as gross to net sales adjustments. We reallocated some investments in the second quarter from advertising and promotion to trade investments, in support of the rollout of Enfinitas and build on our momentum of the fully imported premium products which were introduced in the second quarter of last year. Gross sales on a constant-dollar basis were flat compared to the prior year quarter and down 2% for the first half year of 2016 versus the same period last year. The significant gross sales improvement in the second quarter has been realized. 
Slide 6. The second quarter EBIT of $230 million was 10% above the prior year quarter on a constant-dollar basis. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 6%, including currency impacts. EBIT increased 4% on a reported basis in the second quarter. 
If you would exclude Venezuela, our EBIT on constant-dollar basis improved by 14% versus prior year quarter. The second quarter EBIT margin of 24.4% of sales was 290 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Despite macroeconomic and country-specific challenges which impacted our sales, we made excellent progress to reduce operating expenses as part of our Fuel for Growth program which allowed continued investments and, at the same time, improve the underlying profitability. Year-to-date EBIT was $474 million, a decline of 1% versus previous year on a constant-dollar basis. Foreign exchange, an adverse impact of 8%. 
Excluding Venezuela, EBIT in the first half year improved by 3% versus previous year period on a constant-dollar basis, mainly driven by a higher gross margin and our cost savings realized in the first half year, partly offset by demand-generating investments. 
I will now move to the factors that impact gross margin on Slide 7. Gross margin was 65.1% in the second quarter of 2016, or 66% on a constant-dollar non-GAAP basis. Adverse foreign exchange impacted the gross margin by 150 basis points in the second quarter. We were able to deliver a nearly flat gross margin on a reported basis in both the second quarter and the first half year compared to the previous-year periods despite the significant currency headwind. 
Sales had a slightly negative impact on gross margin from higher-trade investment, especially in China. Low dairy cost continued to be the large benefit to gross margin in the second quarter and first half of 2016. Our key dairy components have been secured through supply contracts for the remainder of the year, and we expect some further benefits, although the dairy benefits for the remainder of the year will be smaller compared to the first half year. 
We continue to deliver productivity savings within cost of goods sold. Year-to-date, the supply chain team delivered productivity savings of around 3.5% of cost of goods sold, in-line with our expectation. With dairy secured for the full year, we expect full year gross margin to be slightly better than our prior year guidance of 64%. 
Moving to operating expenses. I will start with advertising and promotion investments  on Slide 8. Advertising and promotion was 17.6% of sales in the second quarter compared to 18.4% in the prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, in the second quarter, we reallocated a portion of investments from A&P to trade investments, which are recognized in gross to net sales. Despite the year-over-year savings, the second quarter of both years marked noticeably higher investments. The incremental investments were mainly to support key China initiatives, last year for the launch of our fully imported products and in April of this year, the launch of the Enfinitas product line and the continued support of our greater China strategy. 
In the second quarter, we purposefully delayed some A&P investments due to delays in the importation of some of our China product impacting our sales. As such, we expect the third quarter may continue to be in elevated level before it normalizes in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 9 provides the combined spending of the mine-generating investments, both as trade investments classified in gross to net sales and advertising and promotion. Some of the key trade investment activities include trade support, customer programs and promotional pricing. For the second quarter, the combined investment increased above the prior year quarter and was also higher for the last few quarters. 
Trade spending is focused close to our consumer and to ensure our products are present with strong distribution in the key growing channels. In the past few quarters, we've increased these investments, especially in China, to be more competitive in the baby store and e-commerce channels. While we increased trade investments, we plan to reduce the A&P as a percentage of sales over the next few years. 
Last quarter, we committed to provide an update on our review of advertising and promotion expenditures. At Investor's Day last year, when I spoke about advertising and promotion, I stated that we should be able to optimize a lower A&P by 50 to 100 basis points over 3 years. We can now confirm that we expect to be at the top of that range and reduce our A&P by 100 basis points by 2018. We will realize this by prioritizing investment choices that maximize our return on investments of key influence drivers. 
We will continue to optimize our non-media expenses and leverage our decision-supporting tools better. In addition, we will strengthen our focus on digital marketing versus the traditional media. 
Slide 10. We reduced our SG&A cost by 9% on a constant-dollar basis in the second quarter of 2016 versus the previous-year quarter and by 10% year-to-date compared to the prior year period. Like we indicated before, our Fuel for Growth program is focused on cost reduction within our support functions and marketing. 
Areas of focus were the reduction of key vendor contracts, eliminates discretionary spend and optimize organization layers. As you can see from Slide 11, we are significantly ahead of schedule on the original 2016 Fuel for Growth target. Our Fuel for Growth target for this year was $60 million. By mid-year, we've delivered 79% of this year's target savings, or $47 million already. Especially in the corporate overhead functions, we were able to reduce our cost by $30 million in the first half year of 2016 versus the first half year of 2015. Significant progress has been made by systematically renegotiating contracts with our largest vendors. 
Slide 12. Over the last few months, we performed a more extended, deep-dive review of our expenses as well as our organizational structure. We concluded, based also on the success of our results to-date, to accelerate certain cost-savings programs identified earlier and to expand the scope to all operating expenses functions, including sales force and distribution. We now expect to deliver $75 million to $80 million of savings in 2016. This is an increase of $15 million to $20 million versus our original 2016 target. Taking into account the savings realized in 2015 of $20 million, cumulative savings by the end of 2016 are expected to be around $95 million to $100 million. 
In addition to the original program of $120 million, we expect an incremental $60 million of cost-savings opportunities by 2018. The combined Fuel for Growth program will now deliver $180 million savings by 2018. 
The incremental Fuel for Growth savings will provide additional flexibility to invest in the company's future growth. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a discussion of EBIT by segment. Let me start with Asia. In the second quarter, Asia delivered an EBIT of $137 million, a decrease of 4% on a constant-dollar basis compared to prior year quarter. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by additional 8%. Lastly, from the Chinese renminbi, the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit. The Asia EBIT margin at 30% declined 50 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The main drivers were lower sales and an increase in trade investment in gross to net sales. The lower net sales impact was somewhat offset by a favorable dairy cost and some lower A&P expenses. 
For the first half year of 2016, the Asian EBIT margin of 32% were 350 basis points lower than the prior year, as lower sales and higher-demand-generation investments were not fully offset by the dairy benefit. A&P as a percentage of sales increased in the first half year versus the previous period. 
Turning to Slide 14. Latin America delivered EBIT of $36 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 7% on a constant-dollar basis compared to the prior year quarter. For this segment, foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 12%, largely from the Mexican peso. Excluding our Venezuela business, EBIT on a constant dollar increased by 9% in the second quarter -- for the previous year quarter. And EBIT on a constant dollar increased 16% in the first half year of 2016 versus the previous-year period. 
For the balance of the business, lower sales were somewhat offset by lower-demand-generating expenses. The year-to-date Latin America EBIT margin was 23.6% compared to 25.3% for the same period last year. Lower EBIT margin is mainly a result of lower gross margin from the deteriorating situation in Brazil and Venezuela, somewhat offset by cost-reduction programs. 
Slide 15 shows the North America/Europe segment results. For the second quarter, North America/Europe EBIT was $99 million, an increase of 21% on a constant-dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 31.1% was 450 basis points better than previous year quarter. Gross margin remained strong from the benefit of low dairy costs. Within operating expenses, reduction in A&P and SG&A cost savings helped fund selective investments and drove high EBIT margins. Year-to-date, EBIT margin was 29.2%, an improvement of 300 basis points versus previous-year period. Fuel for Growth savings programs and the dairy benefit contributed to the improved EBIT margin. 
I will now address the financial results from EBIT to EPS on Slide 16. The interest expense of $26 million in the second quarter was similar to the first quarter of 2016 expense. When compared to the prior year quarter, the interest expense increase reflects the impact of the November 2015 $1.5 billion notes issuance. A significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. 
Since the ASR concluded on June 30, let me briefly provide you a summary of the transaction. During our Investor Day, we announced the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, of which $1 billion would be in the form of an ASR. 10.7 million shares of stock were received in the fourth quarter of 2015, an additional 2.1 million of shares of stock were received on June 30, 2016. In total, 12.8 million shares of stock were repurchased through the ASR program at an average price of $78.05 per share. Since the IPO, the company bought back 23.4 million of shares, with a total value of $1.8 billion. There are 184.7 million shares outstanding as of June 30. And in the last 12 months, this is a reduction of 18.5 million shares. 
The benefit from all share repurchase in 2015 and the full ASR program, net of interest expense, delivered almost $0.05 year-to-date and is in-line with our full year guidance of $0.11 benefit per share in 2016. 
As part of the $1.5 billion share buyback program announced in 2015, we still have $500 million available for an additional repurchase program. We continue to focus on shareholder value creation. This includes EBIT margin accretion, sales and EPS growth, along with the return of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
Next, non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 18.3% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to 25.6% in the prior year quarter. In the second quarter of 2016, there was about $0.05 per share benefit as a result of utilizing foreign tax credits on dividends from our foreign operations. We expect the ETR for the balance of the year to normalize. 
Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.88, an increase of 16% on a reported basis and 24% on a constant-dollar basis. Year-to-date non-GAAP EPS was $1.75, a decrease of 5% on a reported basis and an increase of 3% on a constant-dollar basis. 
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the change to EPS on Slide 17. In the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.18 to $0.94 per share on a constant-dollar basis versus the prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit negatively impacted EPS by $0.07. Our Fuel for Growth savings delivered $0.11 benefit. Advertising and promotions were $0.06 lower in the quarter, and that share repurchase program delivered a $0.02 benefit, net of higher interest expense. Tax and other contributed a $0.06 benefit. Despite the negative impact of foreign currency of $0.06 per share, EPS increased by $0.12 versus second quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movements. On Slide 18, the cash balance of $1.7 billion as of June 30 was similar to the beginning-of-the-year balance. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by $94 million as a result of timing of tax payments and other working capital movements. Our CapEx investments were $81 million, mainly in our U.S. and Europe manufacturing facilities. For the full year ago, our capital spending goal remains about 4% of sales. Dividend payments were $155 million in the first half year. The negative impact of foreign exchange impact of $32 million was related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela. 
To summarize our forward-looking annual guidance on Slide 19, our sales outlook for 2016 on a constant-dollar basis is expected to be 0 to 2% below the prior year. With foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 5%, reported sales are estimated to be 5% to 7% below 2015. 
We reaffirm our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance of $2.91 to $3.03 and our non-GAAP guidance of $3.48 to $3.60 per share for the following reasons: First, we expect a gross margin improvement from our previous guidance of 64%; second, our Fuel for Growth savings are well ahead of plan and will only partly be reinvested in our business; thirdly, we have an ETR benefit around $0.05 in the second quarter; and fourth, the foreign exchange impact is expected to be approximately $0.35 per share from our previous guidance of $0.40 per share. 
GAAP EPS guidance is likely to be impacted by potentially significant future market-to-market pension adjustments, which cannot be estimated and are classified as specified items. Specified items include charges related to Fuel for Growth and our Venezuela business. 
This concludes my discussion on the second quarter and first half year 2016 financial results. Thanks again for your time this morning. I will now hand over the call back to Kasper."

In Indonesia, we typically don't mention it very often in our earnings call, that's not because it's not a great market, it's simply because we have a very small business there and our market participation is relatively low. So I suspect there are other people that are far more qualified than I  to discuss the market trends in Indonesia."

I guess, Kasper, the question is just,  was that in reaction to some of your competitors promoting more? Was it a reaction? Is it really a mix, channel mix issue, that you're increasing your sales in the baby store and that just tends to need more trade promotion? I guess the reason why I ask is just -- it seems sort of inconsistent that you've got a bottleneck at the border, so you're not getting product across, yet you're promoting more, which would seem to increase the incidence of out of stock. So if you can just kind of tie those things together, I think that would  be helpful."

Forgive my -- the length of my question here. But from my perspective, the guidance on Fuel for Growth is a bit confusing. And maybe I'm wrong. But I'm just hoping you can clear it up for me. So you explicitly said in your slides from the Investor Day that you're looking for 300 basis points of margin improvement, not savings but margin improvement. And that implies that your EBIT margin will get to around 27% by 2018, all else equal. And that's an outlook that I think I've confirmed with the company in recent weeks. But you've also talked, including today, about how you're going to reinvest some of your savings back into the business, which suggests that maybe model all of that $120 million, now $180 million, is going to flow to the bottom line. So I'm clearly just trying to figure out, Michel, how do I reconcile what seems to be some conflicting information out there? And I know it's not guidance, but from a rough outlook, is it wrong for us on the outside to think that margins are expected to go up by 300 basis points or more net of reinvestments over the next few years?

There isn't anything we can really do to expedite it because, as I've said, it applies to the formal importation process into China. And the testing is handled by the Chinese -- by Chinese government agencies outside of the control and involvement of the importing party. So you simply have to wait for your turn, so to speak, and for your individual import batch to be tested and then released through the importation process. It's clear that this created a very -- this was a very large undertaking by these responsible agencies in China. And there was some short-term backup. I'm absolutely confident that they are working day and night to resolve that. And sort of, as usual, I have great confidence in the fact that the Chinese government will resolve that and get back to more of a normal importation flow as they refine these processes. So I do think that, that part of it is sort of temporary. I think the part that will impact us is that, of course, our financial year inevitably cuts off on the 31st of December. And there are 2 impacts in the near term from this. Firstly, there are the sales that we lost through supply shortages in the second quarter already. That -- an element of that, we will probably be able to recapture because we'll be able to replenish inventory in our distributors. But as I referenced, in response to David's question at the outset of this Q&A session, there were out of stocks that occurred at the retail level, which means that we did lose sales to consumers. And those are, if you wanted, permanently lost, so to speak. They're not going to be recovered. The second impact of it is that if you think about this, it effectively puts our kind of growth plans behind these products 2 months back because we've been in this constrained supply situation for the last couple of months, which means that the -- given the rather steep growth curve that we had anticipated for these products, we'll be exiting the year, we'll be cutting off the year on the 31st of December at a point of lower sales than we would otherwise have done, given the 2 months that we have sort of inadvertently lost or partially lost."

I remain very, very optimistic about the way the Chinese government is going about this. It's natural that we would always wish that things could happen faster than they do. But what I see is a very clear determination by the Chinese government to ensure that products that are sold to China -- for consumption by Chinese children are all safe and in compliance with their standards. And that's a very reasonable goal. There are various initiatives that intersect as they pursue this latest one to try and get a handle on imported products, at least through the formal channels and making sure that those products comply with Chinese standards. I think it's a very positive one. I think there's still a significant amount of product going through sort of informal channels imported into China in small parcels, mainly through what we have previously called consumer-to-consumer e-commerce or what we can perhaps call unofficial exports out of say, Europe or Australia. I would expect the Chinese government just looking at that. And over time,  they will determine a way to ensure that you can't have different quality standards applying to that sales channel than you have to the official sales channels. So overall, I'm very -- I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing, recognizing that it is challenging us in the short-term but it's a good thing for the long-term development of the China market."

My comments will focus on our strategy and top line performance. And then Michel will follow up with some additional financial information and elaborate on segment profitability and our company's cash flow. 
Let me begin by summarizing the company's second quarter performance before I provide additional details on each of our reporting segments. Except where I note otherwise, I'll be referring to non-GAAP results. At the end of last year, we laid out a 3-year plan for value creation, with this year being a year of transition. I also identified 3 key milestones we'd use to monitor our profits against this value-creation plan. I referenced these plans in our last earnings call, so let me reference them again today. 
Of the 3 milestones we laid out, the first was to return the business to constant-dollar sales-growth. Today, you'll hear us reiterate expectations for 2016 sales that anticipates that we'll return to growth in the coming quarters. Within the most recently completed quarter, demand in China for new products continued to grow. Actual shipments this quarter, however, were constrained by supply shortage caused by newly introduced, additional import processes at Chinese border points. More about this later. 
Despite these constraints, gross sales before trade support and discounts were in line with prior quarter. Net sales were lower than the quarter before, as trade support for new product introductions increased. Michel will elaborate on this a little bit later. 
Our second milestone is centered around our commitment to reduce our operating expense base. Year-to-date, we've delivered $47 million in expense reductions. We've already achieved nearly 80% of our annual target of $60 million. We are ahead of schedule. And in this call, we're announcing a revised, more ambitious target. 
We are both accelerating and expanding our cost initiatives by increasing our 2016 target to $75 million to $80 million in savings from the previously announced $60 million. We're also raising our 3-year cumulative savings goals from $120 million to $180 million. 
Our third and final milestone we said would be to invest a portion of our expense savings to fund key growth initiatives. To date, we've invested substantially behind the introduction of a fully imported Enfamil into China and the building of a toddler franchise in North America. This latest quarter, we made strong investments in support of our Enfinitas launch in China and the expansion of distribution reach. Over time, we'll demonstrate to you that these investments are essential to us delivering on our commitment to shareholder value creation. 
Turning now to our second quarter 2016 results. We continue to manage through a challenging global operating environment. Economic growth in many emerging and developing economies of Asia and Latin America has slowed over the past 18 to 24 months. Simultaneously, political uncertainty affects many markets in both Asia and South America. These effects present near-term headwinds for us. That said, we continue to find opportunity amidst the uncertainty. We continue to invest to put ourselves in the best possible position for when a turnaround and economic growth eventually materializes, and come, it will. 
For the second quarter, sales for the company was $942 million. Reported net sales were $9 million lower than the prior year quarter. Currency adversely impacted our results by 500 basis points. Consequently, constant-dollar sales were below -- excuse me, consequently, constant-dollar sales were 4% below those of the second quarter of 2015. Price was favorable by 1% despite added trade support in China, while volume was 5% unfavorable. 
Second quarter sales were impacted by significant investments to secure trade support and distribution of Enfinitas in China. Though costly in the near term, these investments will help establish the brand and drive long-term revenue growth. I'll return to the topics of Enfinitas a little later. 
In China, a requirement for additional product testing prior to importation took effect towards the end of the second quarter, causing delays to the importation process. I want to commend the Chinese government for its actions to enhance food safety standards and importation guidelines to ensure imported products can be safely used by Chinese parents and children. 
During the quarter, the government implemented new testing standards for imported products within our category. The effect of this change was a temporary delay in the importation of some of our fastest-growing products from our Netherlands facility. This drove some near-term volatility in our sales results. In the mid to long term, we, however, believe these additional processes will benefit both Chinese children and responsible operators within the industry. 
Outside of China, the deteriorating circumstances in Venezuela, that so tragically impact the people and our colleagues there, have resulted in significantly reduced shipments to the country. When comparing to the second quarter of last year, this adversely impacted the company's sales by 130 basis points in the latest quarter. 
Despite the challenging operating environment, I'm pleased with the company's earnings power. Gross margin remained strong. Our strategy to drive growth of higher-value products and product forms is working and helps offset the impact of increased investments above the net sales line. Investments in advertising and promotion represented 17.6% of net sales in the quarter. 
Our Fuel for Growth cost-reduction initiative drove significant reduction in SG&A. Overall, these costs were down 9% in constant dollars in the second quarter compared to the same quarter of prior year. 
While we made significant investments in key growth initiatives, our EBIT margin was 24.4% in the quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.88. Michel will expand on our earnings delivery a little later. 
I'll now discuss the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with the North America/Europe segment. 
Net sales in the North America/Europe segment were in-line with the second quarter of 2015 on a constant-dollar basis and improved sequentially from the first quarter. A 1% benefit from price was offset by lower volumes. Additionally, we experienced additional headwind of 1% from foreign exchange. 
The Center for Disease Control recently issued their report on 2015 U.S. birth and birth rates. Reported annual birth was 0.3% below the 2014 level. Breastfeeding rates, however, appeared to have stabilized. Our market share in the U.S. business stabilized in the second quarter but remained at a level lower than the prior year. In our outlook, we are recognizing it will likely take longer than hoped for to recover market share. Much of our share loss was within the specialty and solution segment of the infant formula market. But we are confident we understand our challenges and we're addressing them. 
There are bright spots within this reporting segment also. Last October, we introduced a new 32-ounce liquids packaging. This product line is now growing double digits, and we are gaining share in the high-value liquids category. 
It's still the early days for our premium-priced Enspire products but reception from retailers has been favorable, and we expect to see distribution increase in the coming quarters as we build consumer demand. 
Our North American toddler business, defined as products targeting children more than 1 year of age, continues to grow at an annual rate in double digits. 
And turning to Canada. I continue to be pleased with our progress. Second quarter sales grew double digits based on strong market share gains in both the infant and children segments. We've executed extremely well over the past year or 2, and our Canadian team is deservedly receiving much internal recognition. 
Our European business remains strong based on a leading position in the growing allergy segment there. We are well-positioned to benefit from future increases in diagnosis and have a strong innovation pipeline to support our growth in Europe. 
Let me now turn to Latin America. Constant-dollar sales for the total region was 3% lower than the prior year same quarter. Pricing benefits of 9% was insufficient to fully offset foreign exchange impacts of 13%. Excluding the impact of our sharply reduced business in Venezuela, Latin America sales grew 4% in constant dollars over the same quarter of 2015. 
Mexico and Colombia were the biggest contributors to growth. In Mexico, we are seeing improved momentum in both our premium pediatric nutrition business and our milk modifier business. We enjoy strong market shares in our milk modifier business and retain our #1 position in this category. In infant formulas, we recently rolled out a product containing Milk Fat Globular Membranes (sic) [ Milk Fat Globule Membranes ], the same key ingredient contained in Enfinitas and Enspire products launched in China and the U.S. 
Trends in other parts of Latin America remain broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. In Brazil, economic challenges continue to hurt demand for discretionary items like our mid-priced children's products. The premium infant formula products are less discretionary, and they continue to grow. We continue to benefit from strong sales in our Colombian unit, which maintains strong market shares, and in addition, is benefiting from cross-border demand from Venezuela. 
We are rolling out our new plastics packaging and refill systems across Latin America. And in some markets, we are testing ready-to-drink versions of our children's products. These initiatives will allow us to take advantage of segment growth opportunities and support selective increases in price. 
I'll turn now to the Asia segment. Constant-dollar-growth sales in Asia were in-line with the second quarter of 2015. In support of the Enfinitas launch in China, trade investments, however, were significantly higher when compared to the prior year. Partly as a result of this, price was unfavorable by 2%, as the increased trade investments in China more than offset the impact of price increases in Southeast Asia. 
Across the region, product mix continued to improve with sales of our premium-priced products going faster than those of our lower-priced variants. Volume was unfavorable by 5%, as we experienced delays to importation in China and dealt with some market share weakness in the Philippines. Despite improving momentum in China, the Asia region has not yet recovered to sales levels seen in the early part of 2015. 
In the Philippines, we've seen softer market share in sales of Lactum, our mid-priced children's brand. We feel we've identified the root causes behind our share loss and have a remedial plan that will allow us to get back on track. 
Our Malaysia business is growing both volume and price. We recently introduced a new formulation and improved packaging that will allow us to recover market share over time. 
Across Southeast Asia, we are rolling out new product formulations and promoting the benefits of our new plastics packaging. Supported by an improved value equation, we are raising prices behind this innovation. 
I will finish my discussion of the Asia segment with China. In my introductory headlines, I described the import delays caused by increased processes at all border points. In Mainland China, the government implemented a new requirement that every batch be extensively tested prior to release to Chinese consumers. Previously, a sampling approach has been applied. The increase in the number of tests required caused temporary delays as testing and verification capacity was stretched. The effect of this was a temporary delay in the importation and shortage of supply of many of our fastest-growing imported line items, as I mentioned earlier. We, nevertheless, are pleased to see these measures implemented. 
Similarly, increased customs monitoring and reduced visitor numbers have adversely impacted our Hong Kong business. It's become more challenging for our Hong Kong business to compete for visiting Chinese tourists that now connects these imported products more easily from within the Mainland. These challenges confirm our China strategy pursuing increased flexibilities through a broader product portfolio sold through a more diverse set of sales channels. 
Turning now to Mainland China, where our fully imported products continues to gather momentum, and we're seeing strong demand from consumers. Through the second quarter, we continued to grow market share of the imported segment. In the baby store channel, we've increased our distribution, supported by our most recent, new product introductions. We are seeing both our ability to make progress and the substantial runway we have ahead of us. 
As of the second quarter, we are no longer under indexing versus the market in the fast-growing baby store channel. Our new Enfinitas product line is off to a solid start. Three months after introductions, we are still building distribution and demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs. 
In totality, I'm satisfied with the progress we've made with our portfolio and channel transformation in China. I also recognize we've got a long way to go and a lot of opportunities ahead of us. It's hard not to be excited about the immense potential of not only our China business but our global business. 
Before I hand over to Michel, I want to provide an updated outlook for full year 2016, our year of transition, a year in which we are addressing several structural opportunities within both our brand portfolio, our product lineup and our cost structure. 
At the beginning of the year, we knew comparisons in the first half 2016 would be challenging. I'm satisfied that many of our critical initiatives have gone as planned, and we are expecting growth over prior year in the second half of the year. However, we've seen 3 developments causing us to revisit our estimate for full year 2016 constant-dollar-sales growth. It's taking us longer than expected to recover the market share we lost in the U.S. towards the end of 2015. 
Secondly, the import-related challenges in China, Hong Kong in the second quarter cost of sales we won't fully recapture until next year. 
Thirdly, we are supporting our imported portfolio in China with additional trade support. In light of these factors, we now expect constant-dollar sales in-line with or not more than 2% below the 2015 level. 
Through the first half of the year, we've identified several opportunities within our cost structure. In doing so, we found additional opportunities to both reduce cost and increase efficiencies. In a moment, Michel will outline an expanded ambition and scope for our operating expense initiative, the project we refer to as Fuel for Growth. Despite lower sales, a slightly improved outlook for gross margin, expense optimization and the benefit realized from a lower tax rate in the just completed quarter allow us to reiterate our expectation for non-GAAP earnings per share of $3 -- of between $3.48 and $3.60 for the full year 2016. 
I'll now hand over to Michel, who will provide additional details on our second quarter and first half financial performance. I'll then return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."

Today, I will discuss the company's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight EBIT results for each segment, cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of full year guidance. 
Unless otherwise noted, my comments will be on the non-GAAP financial results. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statement into U.S. dollars. In addition, my comments about sales will refer to net sales, unless I explicitly call out gross sales. 
Let me start with sales as shown on Slide 3. Kasper addressed the constant-dollar change. I will focus on the reported sales and the foreign currency impact. For both the second quarter and first half year, adverse foreign exchange rates contributed to a 500 basis points decline compared to the same period of the prior year. Second quarter net sales on a reported dollar basis grew 9% below prior year quarter. Reduced shipments to Venezuela impacted net sales negatively by 1% in the second quarter versus the prior year quarter. 
Slide 4 summarizes the impact of foreign exchange on sales. U.S. dollar continued to be strong and effects of translation of local currencies negatively impacted all reporting segments. However, the impact was slightly less significant in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the trend from the last 3 quarters. Nearly 2/3 of the second quarter negative currency impact on sales were from the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso and the Argentine peso. The balance of the adverse foreign exchange impact was widespread across regions. 
As a result of the year-to-date foreign exchange impact, our outstanding currency hedges for the remaining of the year and the current forward rate, we are revising our currency expectations from minus 6% to minus 5% adverse foreign exchange impact on sales for the full year 2016. I will address foreign exchange impact in the EPS guidance section as well. 
I'm introducing Slide 5 for better transparency of gross sales, which reflects sales to customers before trade investment and other items, which are recorded as gross to net sales adjustments. We reallocated some investments in the second quarter from advertising and promotion to trade investments, in support of the rollout of Enfinitas and build on our momentum of the fully imported premium products which were introduced in the second quarter of last year. Gross sales on a constant-dollar basis were flat compared to the prior year quarter and down 2% for the first half year of 2016 versus the same period last year. The significant gross sales improvement in the second quarter has been realized. 
Slide 6. The second quarter EBIT of $230 million was 10% above the prior year quarter on a constant-dollar basis. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 6%, including currency impacts. EBIT increased 4% on a reported basis in the second quarter. 
If you would exclude Venezuela, our EBIT on constant-dollar basis improved by 14% versus prior year quarter. The second quarter EBIT margin of 24.4% of sales was 290 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Despite macroeconomic and country-specific challenges which impacted our sales, we made excellent progress to reduce operating expenses as part of our Fuel for Growth program which allowed continued investments and, at the same time, improve the underlying profitability. Year-to-date EBIT was $474 million, a decline of 1% versus previous year on a constant-dollar basis. Foreign exchange, an adverse impact of 8%. 
Excluding Venezuela, EBIT in the first half year improved by 3% versus previous year period on a constant-dollar basis, mainly driven by a higher gross margin and our cost savings realized in the first half year, partly offset by demand-generating investments. 
I will now move to the factors that impact gross margin on Slide 7. Gross margin was 65.1% in the second quarter of 2016, or 66% on a constant-dollar non-GAAP basis. Adverse foreign exchange impacted the gross margin by 150 basis points in the second quarter. We were able to deliver a nearly flat gross margin on a reported basis in both the second quarter and the first half year compared to the previous-year periods despite the significant currency headwind. 
Sales had a slightly negative impact on gross margin from higher-trade investment, especially in China. Low dairy cost continued to be the large benefit to gross margin in the second quarter and first half of 2016. Our key dairy components have been secured through supply contracts for the remainder of the year, and we expect some further benefits, although the dairy benefits for the remainder of the year will be smaller compared to the first half year. 
We continue to deliver productivity savings within cost of goods sold. Year-to-date, the supply chain team delivered productivity savings of around 3.5% of cost of goods sold, in-line with our expectation. With dairy secured for the full year, we expect full year gross margin to be slightly better than our prior year guidance of 64%. 
Moving to operating expenses. I will start with advertising and promotion investments on Slide 8. Advertising and promotion was 17.6% of sales in the second quarter compared to 18.4% in the prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, in the second quarter, we reallocated a portion of investments from A&P to trade investments, which are recognized in gross to net sales. Despite the year-over-year savings, the second quarter of both years marked noticeably higher investments. The incremental investments were mainly to support key China initiatives, last year for the launch of our fully imported products and in April of this year, the launch of the Enfinitas product line and the continued support of our greater China strategy. 
In the second quarter, we purposefully delayed some A&P investments due to delays in the importation of some of our China product impacting our sales. As such, we expect the third quarter may continue to be in elevated level before it normalizes in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 9 provides the combined spending of the mine-generating investments, both as trade investments classified in gross to net sales and advertising and promotion. Some of the key trade investment activities include trade support, customer programs and promotional pricing. For the second quarter, the combined investment increased above the prior year quarter and was also higher for the last few quarters. 
Trade spending is focused close to our consumer and to ensure our products are present with strong distribution in the key growing channels. In the past few quarters, we've increased these investments, especially in China, to be more competitive in the baby store and e-commerce channels. While we increased trade investments, we plan to reduce the A&P as a percentage of sales over the next few years. 
Last quarter, we committed to provide an update on our review of advertising and promotion expenditures. At Investor's Day last year, when I spoke about advertising and promotion, I stated that we should be able to optimize a lower A&P by 50 to 100 basis points over 3 years. We can now confirm that we expect to be at the top of that range and reduce our A&P by 100 basis points by 2018. We will realize this by prioritizing investment choices that maximize our return on investments of key influence drivers. 
We will continue to optimize our non-media expenses and leverage our decision-supporting tools better. In addition, we will strengthen our focus on digital marketing versus the traditional media. 
Slide 10. We reduced our SG&A cost by 9% on a constant-dollar basis in the second quarter of 2016 versus the previous-year quarter and by 10% year-to-date compared to the prior year period. Like we indicated before, our Fuel for Growth program is focused on cost reduction within our support functions and marketing. 
Areas of focus were the reduction of key vendor contracts, eliminates discretionary spend and optimize organization layers. As you can see from Slide 11, we are significantly ahead of schedule on the original 2016 Fuel for Growth target. Our Fuel for Growth target for this year was $60 million. By mid-year, we've delivered 79% of this year's target savings, or $47 million already. Especially in the corporate overhead functions, we were able to reduce our cost by $30 million in the first half year of 2016 versus the first half year of 2015. Significant progress has been made by systematically renegotiating contracts with our largest vendors. 
Slide 12. Over the last few months, we performed a more extended, deep-dive review of our expenses as well as our organizational structure. We concluded, based also on the success of our results to-date, to accelerate certain cost-savings programs identified earlier and to expand the scope to all operating expenses functions, including sales force and distribution. We now expect to deliver $75 million to $80 million of savings in 2016. This is an increase of $15 million to $20 million versus our original 2016 target. Taking into account the savings realized in 2015 of $20 million, cumulative savings by the end of 2016 are expected to be around $95 million to $100 million. 
In addition to the original program of $120 million, we expect an incremental $60 million of cost-savings opportunities by 2018. The combined Fuel for Growth program will now deliver $180 million savings by 2018. 
The incremental Fuel for Growth savings will provide additional flexibility to invest in the company's future growth. 
Turning to Slide 13 for a discussion of EBIT by segment. Let me start with Asia. In the second quarter, Asia delivered an EBIT of $137 million, a decrease of 4% on a constant-dollar basis compared to prior year quarter. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by additional 8%. Lastly, from the Chinese renminbi, the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit. The Asia EBIT margin at 30% declined 50 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The main drivers were lower sales and an increase in trade investment in gross to net sales. The lower net sales impact was somewhat offset by a favorable dairy cost and some lower A&P expenses. 
For the first half year of 2016, the Asian EBIT margin of 32% were 350 basis points lower than the prior year, as lower sales and higher-demand-generation investments were not fully offset by the dairy benefit. A&P as a percentage of sales increased in the first half year versus the previous period. 
Turning to Slide 14. Latin America delivered EBIT of $36 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 7% on a constant-dollar basis compared to the prior year quarter. For this segment, foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 12%, largely from the Mexican peso. Excluding our Venezuela business, EBIT on a constant dollar increased by 9% in the second quarter -- for the previous year quarter. And EBIT on a constant dollar increased 16% in the first half year of 2016 versus the previous-year period. 
For the balance of the business, lower sales were somewhat offset by lower-demand-generating expenses. The year-to-date Latin America EBIT margin was 23.6% compared to 25.3% for the same period last year. Lower EBIT margin is mainly a result of lower gross margin from the deteriorating situation in Brazil and Venezuela, somewhat offset by cost-reduction programs. 
Slide 15 shows the North America/Europe segment results. For the second quarter, North America/Europe EBIT was $99 million, an increase of 21% on a constant-dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 31.1% was 450 basis points better than previous year quarter. Gross margin remained strong from the benefit of low dairy costs. Within operating expenses, reduction in A&P and SG&A cost savings helped fund selective investments and drove high EBIT margins. Year-to-date, EBIT margin was 29.2%, an improvement of 300 basis points versus previous-year period. Fuel for Growth savings programs and the dairy benefit contributed to the improved EBIT margin. 
I will now address the financial results from EBIT to EPS on Slide 16. The interest expense of $26 million in the second quarter was similar to the first quarter of 2016 expense. When compared to the prior year quarter, the interest expense increase reflects the impact of the November 2015 $1.5 billion notes issuance. A significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. 
Since the ASR concluded on June 30, let me briefly provide you a summary of the transaction. During our Investor Day, we announced the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, of which $1 billion would be in the form of an ASR. 10.7 million shares of stock were received in the fourth quarter of 2015, an additional 2.1 million of shares of stock were received on June 30, 2016. In total, 12.8 million shares of stock were repurchased through the ASR program at an average price of $78.05 per share. Since the IPO, the company bought back 23.4 million of shares, with a total value of $1.8 billion. There are 184.7 million shares outstanding as of June 30. And in the last 12 months, this is a reduction of 18.5 million shares. 
The benefit from all share repurchase in 2015 and the full ASR program, net of interest expense, delivered almost $0.05 year-to-date and is in-line with our full year guidance of $0.11 benefit per share in 2016. 
As part of the $1.5 billion share buyback program announced in 2015, we still have $500 million available for an additional repurchase program. We continue to focus on shareholder value creation. This includes EBIT margin accretion, sales and EPS growth, along with the return of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
Next, non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 18.3% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to 25.6% in the prior year quarter. In the second quarter of 2016, there was about $0.05 per share benefit as a result of utilizing foreign tax credits on dividends from our foreign operations. We expect the ETR for the balance of the year to normalize. 
Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $0.88, an increase of 16% on a reported basis and 24% on a constant-dollar basis. Year-to-date non-GAAP EPS was $1.75, a decrease of 5% on a reported basis and an increase of 3% on a constant-dollar basis. 
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the change to EPS on Slide 17. In the second quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.18 to $0.94 per share on a constant-dollar basis versus the prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit negatively impacted EPS by $0.07. Our Fuel for Growth savings delivered $0.11 benefit. Advertising and promotions were $0.06 lower in the quarter, and that share repurchase program delivered a $0.02 benefit, net of higher interest expense. Tax and other contributed a $0.06 benefit. Despite the negative impact of foreign currency of $0.06 per share, EPS increased by $0.12 versus second quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movements. On Slide 18, the cash balance of $1.7 billion as of June 30 was similar to the beginning-of-the-year balance. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by $94 million as a result of timing of tax payments and other working capital movements. Our CapEx investments were $81 million, mainly in our U.S. and Europe manufacturing facilities. For the full year ago, our capital spending goal remains about 4% of sales. Dividend payments were $155 million in the first half year. The negative impact of foreign exchange impact of $32 million was related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela. 
To summarize our forward-looking annual guidance on Slide 19, our sales outlook for 2016 on a constant-dollar basis is expected to be 0 to 2% below the prior year. With foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 5%, reported sales are estimated to be 5% to 7% below 2015. 
We reaffirm our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance of $2.91 to $3.03 and our non-GAAP guidance of $3.48 to $3.60 per share for the following reasons: First, we expect a gross margin improvement from our previous guidance of 64%; second, our Fuel for Growth savings are well ahead of plan and will only partly be reinvested in our business; thirdly, we have an ETR benefit around $0.05 in the second quarter; and fourth, the foreign exchange impact is expected to be approximately $0.35 per share from our previous guidance of $0.40 per share. 
GAAP EPS guidance is likely to be impacted by potentially significant future market-to-market pension adjustments, which cannot be estimated and are classified as specified items. Specified items include charges related to Fuel for Growth and our Venezuela business. 
This concludes my discussion on the second quarter and first half year 2016 financial results. Thanks again for your time this morning. I will now hand over the call back to Kasper."

However, the difficulty of getting product into China in this latest quarter did result -- with some selective out-of-stocks situations at retail as well as lower inventories in many of our distributors. So to the extent of the latter, we expect that we will gradually recover that over the second half of the year. A little bit hard to say whether we will recover it all in the third quarter because that involves speculating on how the importation process evolves. But we are quite encouraged and we are confident that some of these issues are sort of relatively short term in nature."

But you've also talked, including today, about how you're going to reinvest some of your savings back into the business, which suggests that maybe model all of that $120 million, now $180 million, is going to flow to the bottom line. So I'm clearly just trying to figure out, Michel, how do I reconcile what seems to be some conflicting information out there? And I know it's not guidance, but from a rough outlook, is it wrong for us on the outside to think that margins are expected to go up by 300 basis points or more net of reinvestments over the next few years? I think that's a key question for people."

So at Investor's Day, we said we will deliver $120 million of Fuel for Growth savings. And we also indicated that we will partly reinvest that and partly will be rolled through profitability. And in combination with a couple of other initiatives that we announced at Investor Day, we indicated that, that will deliver a 300 basis points margin improvement from 24% to 27% indeed. So what we announced today is an incremental program of $60 million, which should give us $180 million by 2018. From the $60 million, we indicate that we will use that to reinvest in our business to strengthen our future growth. So that will be not part of the growth through profitability."

Indeed, in many cases, it's an optimization of discretionary spends that we have in the sales force that sit in the same line of the P&L. But it's also true to say that outside of the sort of frontline sales force, there are probably opportunities selectively across our global organizations to organize ourselves a bit differently.

There isn't anything we can really do to expedite it because, as I've said, it applies to the formal importation process into China. And the testing is handled by the Chinese -- by Chinese government agencies outside of the control and involvement of the importing party. So you simply have to wait for your turn, so to speak, and for your individual import batch to be tested and then released through the importation process. It's clear that this created a very -- this was a very large undertaking by these responsible agencies in China. And there was some short-term backup. I'm absolutely confident that they are working day and night to resolve that. And sort of, as usual, I have great confidence in the fact that the Chinese government will resolve that and get back to more of a normal importation flow as they refine these processes. So I do think that, that part of it is sort of temporary. I think the part that will impact us is that, of course, our financial year inevitably cuts off on the 31st of December. And there are 2 impacts in the near term from this. Firstly, there are the sales that we lost through supply shortages in the second quarter already. That -- an element of that, we will probably be able to recapture because we'll be able to replenish inventory in our distributors. But as I referenced, in response to David's question at the outset of this Q&A session, there were out of stocks that occurred at the retail level, which means that we did lose sales to consumers. And those are, if you wanted, permanently lost, so to speak. They're not going to be recovered. The second impact of it is that if you think about this, it effectively puts our kind of growth plans behind these products 2 months back because we've been in this constrained supply situation for the last couple of months, which means that the -- given the rather steep growth curve that we had anticipated for these products, we'll be exiting the year, we'll be cutting off the year on the 31st of December at a point of lower sales than we would otherwise have done, given the 2 months that we have sort of inadvertently lost or partially lost."

I remain very, very optimistic about the way the Chinese government is going about this. It's natural that we would always wish that things could happen faster than they do. But what I see is a very clear determination by the Chinese government to ensure that products that are sold to China -- for consumption by Chinese children are all safe and in compliance with their standards. And that's a very reasonable goal. There are various initiatives that intersect as they pursue this latest one to try and get a handle on imported products, at least through the formal channels and making sure that those products comply with Chinese standards. I think it's a very positive one. I think there's still a significant amount of product going through sort of informal channels imported into China in small parcels, mainly through what we have previously called consumer-to-consumer e-commerce or what we can perhaps call unofficial exports out of say, Europe or Australia. I would expect the Chinese government just looking at that. And over time, they will determine a way to ensure that you can't have different quality standards applying to that sales channel than you have to the official sales channels. So overall, I'm very -- I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing, recognizing that it is challenging us in the short-term but it's a good thing for the long-term development of the China market."

I want to start today's discussion by revisiting our 3-year value creation plan. We laid out this plan at our Investor Day in October of 2015. And at that time, we explained how 2016 would be a year of transition.
We committed to 3 key metrics: a return to growth; a set of expense reductions; and a partial reinvestment of savings in growth initiatives and margin accretion. We said we'd measure our progress against these through the period. I've [ph] since revisited these metrics in every earnings call. So let me now briefly summarize our third quarter results in that context.
Firstly, in the third quarter, we delivered growth at the gross sales level of 1%. On a net sales basis, all 3 geographic segments delivered sales in line with prior year's quarter. This is an improvement over the previous 2 quarters. Excluding the effect of suspended shipments to Venezuela, net sales grew 1% in the third quarter over the prior year quarter.
Our second milestone relates to our targeted operating expense reductions. In our second quarter call, we revised our 2016 estimate from $60 million in reductions to $75 million to $80 million. Year-to-date, we've delivered $67 million in savings, and we've achieved approximately 85% of our annual target. SG&A expenses in the latest quarter were almost $20 million lower than a year earlier.
Our third milestone was to invest a portion of the expense savings to fund key growth initiatives while increasing our EBIT margin. Our investments have largely been supportive of our portfolio reshape and strategic channel shift in China. These initiatives are helping us report strong growth in China this quarter while simultaneously raising our EBIT margin.
Before I go into detail on our third quarter results, let me put these in context. The macroeconomic climate in North America and Europe appear stable. But in many emerging markets, we see consumers pressured by slowing economic growth. This applies broadly across Latin America and Asia and is consistent with what you have heard from other companies this earnings season.
So my view of China, backed by recent economic downturn, is a little more positive than that of some others. There's little doubt that a pickup in economic activity in emerging markets will be linked to a recovery in demand for the exports in North America and Europe.
We also believe that the long-term category fundamentals are intact and remain supportive of our growth ambition. We believe that making the necessary and strategic investments now is critical to delivering on our 3-year road map of value creation.
Let me now expand on our third quarter results. For the third year running, we're experiencing foreign exchange headwinds. And for the second year in a row, economic challenges have combined with low dairy costs to produce a challenging pricing environment. Competitively, our results in the latest quarter were frankly [ph] mixed. We are facing a stiff challenge from competition in the United States. Conversely, we have good evidence that our China strategy is working. And there, [ph] we are strengthening our competitive position in growing channels. In aggregate, third quarter sales for the company were $938 million.
Currency adversely impacted our results by 4%. Constant dollar sales were in line with the third quarter of 2015, while reported sales were 4% lower than the prior year's quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of our intentionally reduced business in Venezuela, the company's [ph] net sales grew 1% in constant dollars over prior year.
While volume was 5% unfavorable, we saw a fully offsetting benefit from price and product mix of 5%. This, despite continued competitive pressure on low dairy costs.
Gross margin was strong and remains above our historical average, and we continued to invest against our priority initiatives, including the establishment of Enfinitas in China.
Total [ph] investment in advertising and promotion represented 17.3% of net sales in the quarter.
Our Fuel for Growth cost reductions initiative drove significant savings in SG&A costs. Overall, these costs, on a reported basis, were down 12% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of the prior year.
Our EBIT margin rose to 26.1% in the quarter as EBIT grew 9% in constant dollars.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.87 and similar to results in the proceeding 2 quarters.
I'll now discuss the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with our North America and Europe segment. Overall, results in this segment were mixed in the quarter. Market share gains in Canada and Europe resulting in strong sales growth there [ph] offset a disappointing quarter for our U.S. business. Net sales in the segment were in line with the third quarter of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. In aggregate, the segment benefited from a 5% pricing benefit, but this was fully offset by lower volumes in the United States. And foreign exchange adversely impacted sales for this segment by 1%.
Competitive pressure -- competitive activity put pressure on market share and resulted in a disappointing sales performance in our U.S. business. While we are actively addressing these challenges, we recognize that [ph] category dynamics of such that it'll take time to stabilize and recover lost market share.
Unconscious [ph] that we've been referencing weakness in U.S. market share for a few quarters now. Unfortunately, we know the category is quite sticky, and to gain new consumers take time. We have a concrete action plan in place, but we must expect share to remain relatively weak through the next couple of quarters.
In the rest of the segment, I'm pleased with our progress. And we reported our highest market share in many years in Canada, as both Canada and Europe grew strongly in the quarter.
The Canadian business experienced strong growth in both its core infant formula business and the chocolate [ph] category. And European sales of our energy products continued to grow on the back of a strengthened competitive position in a growing segment.
Let me now turn to Latin America. Segment performance continues to be heavily impacted by the suspension of sales to Venezuela. These shipments all but ceased at the end of 2015. Excluding this impact, sales in Latin America grew 5% in constant dollars over the same quarter of 2015. However, including the impact of Venezuela, constant dollar sales for the region were in line with the prior year's quarter. Pricing benefits of 10% did not fully offset foreign exchange impacts of negative 13%. And given the weakness in so many of the region's economies, we saw a [ph] volume lower by 10%. Excluding Venezuela, volume was unfavorable by 5%.
With regard to Venezuela, there's been no significant change in circumstances. This situation will again negatively impact results in the coming quarter. But after that, the distorting effect should be neglectable [ph].
In Mexico, our infant and children's businesses delivered growth, and trends in other parts of Latin America remained broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. In much of South America, economic fundamentals remained weak, and we are seeing this reflected in consumer demand. Colombia and Peru provide isolated spots of relative economic stability.
I turn now to the Asia segment. Constant dollar sales in Asia were in line with the third quarter of 2015. Despite increased trade investments, price was favorable compared to the prior year quarter. Price increases in Southeast Asia, along with positive product mix in China, resulted in a 4% improvement in price within the segment. Volume was unfavorable by 4% driven by market share weakness and adjustment to channel inventories in the Philippines. Again, we have implemented a solid remediation plan there, and it's beginning to work. That said, it will take time to rebuild market share. And in the meantime, we'd have [ph] to reduce channel inventory.
In Asia, price inflation remains low in a historical context.
I'll complete my discussion of our Asia segment with a few comments on China. In a sentence, [ph] our strategy to reshape our portfolio and strength and performance in high-growth channels is working. Despite the decline in Hong Kong, sales within our greater China business grew strongly in the latest quarter. We saw improvements in both volume and product mix. Higher-priced new products are replacing sales on legacy lines. Consumers continue to adopt our fully imported product lines of Enfamil and Enfinitas at rapid rates, more than offsetting slowing demand for our locally manufactured products and shrinking exports from Hong Kong. Like many of our competitors, we are seeing the rapid shift in sales channels continue. But with the reshaped product portfolio, we've been able to adapt to this.
A few facts may help illustrate my point and put our results in context. The mainland supermarket channel declined double digits in the quarter. Our sales to our Hong Kong channel continued to decline and was down double digits within the quarter, but our sales into baby stores in and Mainland China were up more than 20% on a year earlier. And our e-commerce sales were up more than 60%.
Our market share of company-controlled e-commerce channels increased by 3 [ph] percentage point over prior year. And our recently launched imported product lines continue to grow market share each month. Imported products now account for 60% of total sales in Mainland China, up from 45% in March.
I think you can understand from this exactly how dynamic the trade environment is and how critical agility and flexibility are as core elements of our China strategy.
In conclusion, let me mention that our third quarter sales did benefit from replenishment of orders we were able -- we were unable to fulfill in the prior quarter due to tightened import processes. You'll remember that I mentioned this in our last call. However, underlying growth, excluding this benefit, was nevertheless healthy in China. China's results this quarter reflect the strategy we put in place 2 to 3 years ago to increase flexibilities through a broader product portfolio, sold to a more diverse set of channels.
This quarter, you can see that our strong organization and infrastructure in China has the ability to flex and adapt than challenged. Much work remains to be done, but I feel good about the latest quarter. I deliberately not devoted any time to a description of our year-to-date sales. Though we've clearly hoped for a faster rebound in sales, we've seen a gradual, progressive improvement in our growth rate from quarter-to-quarter.
I now want to transition to talk about our global outlook for the balance of the year and beyond. While we saw strong growth in China, it's become clear that any sustained recovery in the broader emerging markets will take longer to occur than expected earlier. Additionally, market share losses in the Philippines and the United States are weighing on our current performance, and we do not expect to see these losses reversed until well into 2017.
In recognition of these challenges, we are revising our expectations for both sales and earnings per share. We now expect constant dollar sales for the full year 2016 to come in 2% to 3% below prior year, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in between $3.43 and $3.50. These numbers imply we continue to make progress in China in the fourth quarter and gradually improve sales in other geographies. We expect that the recent volatility and changing market dynamics will continue to impact our business in the midterm.
As we look beyond the next quarter to 2017, we expect to see continued but only modest improvement in constant dollar sales and to EPS. Our Fuel for Growth program will continue to help fund growth initiatives and mitigate known headwinds.
I'll now hand the call over to Michel who'll provide additional details on our third quarter financial performance. After that, I'll return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."
1002291,367328587,1063038,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of the full year guidance. My com",1775,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of the full year guidance. My comments about sales will refer to net sales, unless I explicitly state gross sales. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statement into U.S. dollars.
Kathy already covered Slide 2, so let me start with sales on Slide 3. Slide 3 shows the improving trend of net sales on a constant dollar basis when compared to prior year periods. As Kasper already indicated, excluding the impact of reduced shipments to Venezuela, the company's net sales were 1% above the prior year quarter. The adverse impact of Venezuela will be less in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we significantly slowed shipments in the fourth quarter of 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela on our net sales is over 1% on a constant dollar basis.
Turning to Slide 4. Gross sales reflects sales to customers before trade investment on our [ph] items, which are recorded as gross to net sales adjustments. For the third quarter, gross sales were 1% above the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. A significant portion of this quarter gross [ph] came from China. This is the first time our gross sales returned to positive growth since the first quarter of 2015.
Net sales on a reported basis were 4% below the prior year quarter and 8% below on a year-to-date basis. The adverse impact of foreign exchange on sales was 4%. The U.S. dollar continued to be strong, and the effect on the translation of local currencies negatively impacted all reporting segments.
On Slide 5, the third quarter EBIT of $244 million was 9% above the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 7%. Including currency impacts, EBIT increased 2% on a reported basis in the third quarter. The third quarter EBIT margin of 26.1% of sales was 160 basis points better than the prior year quarter. This sales [ph] nearly in line with the prior year, the benefit of lower dairy cost rolled through for a positive gross profit.
We continue to make strong progress to reduce operating expenses as part of our Fuel for Growth program, which allows continued investments while improving the underlying profitability. Year-to-date EBIT was $719 million, and we delivered positive growth of 2% above the previous year period on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 25.3% of sales was 80 basis points better than the prior year period. Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of 8%. Despite macroeconomic and country-specific challenges, which negatively impacted our sales, we benefited from low dairy cost and made excellent progress on realizing Fuel for Growth savings.
I will now move to factors that impacted gross margin on Slide 6. Gross margin was 64.6% in the third quarter of 2016. Adverse foreign currency impacted gross margin by 150 basis points in the quarter. We continued to deliver nearly flat gross margin on a reported basis despite the significantly currency headwinds we had. On a constant dollar basis, the gross margin percentage improved 120 basis points. Price/mix and gross to net adjustment had a slightly negative impact on gross margin, mainly from higher trade investments. Low dairy was the large benefit to gross margin in the third quarter of 2016.
Within cost of goods sold, productivity savings continued to be strong. Projects for the full year have been identified, and we expect savings to be above our earlier estimate of 3.5% of cost of goods sold. When you compare the 3 months and the 9 months charts, you can see the key drivers are the same. As this year progressed, the dairy benefit is lower as we lap towards the lowest 2015 dairy cost comparison. The adverse foreign currency impact on gross margin in the third quarter is higher, mainly due to hedges. If dairy is secured for the full year and larger productivity savings, we expect full year gross margin to be up to 64.5%, better than our previous guidance of 64%.
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. The chart [ph] provides the combined spending of demand-generating investments, both as trade investment classified in gross to net sales adjustments and as advertising and promotion in operating expense category. The combined investments in the third quarter were above the prior year quarter. As a percentage of gross sales, the third quarter was similar to the second quarter as a result of increased investments to support our China strategy to become more competitive in the baby store and e-commerce channels with our Enfa imported and Enfinitas product lines.
Slide 8. We reduced our SG&A cost by 9% on a constant dollar basis in the third quarter of 2016 versus the previous year quarter and by 10% year-to-date compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we delivered $20 million savings in the fourth quarter of 2015. So in the fourth quarter of 2016, the year-over-year percentage reduction is likely to be smaller.
As you can see on Slide 9, year-to-date, we have achieved nearly 85% of this year's target. We now expect to realize savings toward the higher end of the $75 million to $80 million target range. In the corporate and other functions, we reduced our cost by $50 million year-to-date compared to prior year period. This is 3/4 of the year-to-date savings.
Turning to Slide 10 for a discussion of EBIT. Positive price/mix was offset by volume decline in all segments. The positive price/mix was mainly driven by a mix benefit as a result of the rollout of imported premium products in China, new innovations in several [ph] markets as well as price increases in markets to partly compensate of currency devaluations. All segments benefited from lower dairy and cost -- and crops [ph] productivity.
EBIT at Asia was lower due to higher trade investments. Promotional activities and advertising, which resulted in lower EBITDA loss and margin percentage in the third quarter. Our EBIT in both Latin America and North America improved. For Latin America, this was due to lower advertising and promotion expenses when compared to the prior year where we had higher expenses related to product launches.
On [ph] North America and Europe, SG&A cost savings helped fund investments and drove higher EBIT margins. Lower corporate and other expenses were most notably attributable to Fuel for Growth savings.
I will now address the financial results from EBIT to EPS on Slide 11. The interest expense of $26 million in the third quarter was in line with 2016 run rate. When compared to the prior year quarter, interest expense increase reflects the impact of the November 2015 $1.5 billion notes issuance. A significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated repurchase program, or the ASR. The benefit of the ASR is reflected in the third quarter 2016 share count. There was no significant share repurchase in the third quarter.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 26% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 28.1% in the prior year quarter. In the third quarter of 2016, the ETR decrease was driven by tax credits from repatriation of foreign earnings, somewhat offset by change in allowances against tax assets. The prior year quarter was adversely impacted by an unfavorable geographic mix.
Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $0.87, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, non-GAAP EPS was $2.63, a 1% decrease from the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 7% on a constant dollar basis.
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the change to EPS on Slide 12. In the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.13 to $0.93 per share on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit delivered a $0.03 benefit to EPS. The adverse impact of higher advertising and promotion was $0.04. Fuel for Growth savings delivered $0.07 benefit. The share repurchase programs delivered a $0.03 benefit, net of higher interest expense. And tax and other contributed a $0.03 benefit. Despite the negative impact of foreign exchange of $0.06 per share, EPS increased $0.07 versus third quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movements on Slide 13. The cash balance of $1.8 billion as of September 30 was $142 million higher than in the beginning of the year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by operating working capital. Our year-to-date CapEx investments were [ph] $110 million, mainly in our U.S. and operating in Europe manufacturing facilities, along with ongoing quality and planned enhancements globally. For the full year, our capital spending goal remains at 4% of sales. Dividend payments were $232 million in the 9 months of 2016. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange of $33 million was mainly related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
To summarize our forward-looking annual guidance on Slide 14, our sales outlook for 2016 on a constant dollar basis is expected to be 2% to 3% below the prior year. With foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 4%, reported sales are estimated to be 6% to 7% below 2015. The 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.87. And our non-GAAP guidance is $3.43 to $3.50 per share.
The guidance changed for the following reasons: sales on a constant currency basis may be lower due to the market share weakness in several markets, especially in the U.S., along with continued macroeconomic challenges in several emerging markets. Partially offsetting the sales impact, we expect gross margin to be up 64.5%, while Fuel for Growth savings is expected to be at the high end of the $75 million to $80 million range. And finally, the foreign exchange impact is expected to be approximately $0.30 per share from our previous guidance of $0.35 per share.
GAAP EPS guidance is likely to be impacted by potentially significant future market-to-market pension adjustments, which cannot be estimated and are classified as specified items. Specified items include charges related to our Venezuela business, Fuel for Growth and year-to-date pension adjustments.
This concludes my discussion on the third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. Thank you again for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

In today's prepared remarks, we've discussed both the positive news from China as well the number of headwinds we will continue to tackle as we move into next year.
I want to acknowledge the difficulty we've had in accurately projecting our top line trajectory over the past 18 months in what is perhaps the most uncertain environment I've seen in nearly 20 years in the industry. The global economy has been weaker than we'd expect, and we are facing a strong challenge in the United States.
But before we open the lines to your questions, I want to take you back 3 years. 3 years ago, when it first became obvious that our trajectory in China was changing, many of you, I'm sure, had doubts we could successfully navigate our way through the adaptations we needed to make. Today, I feel very proud of the way our people embraced the challenge and worked hard on implementation. We certainly have much work left in China and elsewhere, but we also have many more opportunities from which we can benefit. We've taken the first important steps, and we're on our way forward.
As was the case when we discussed our challenges in China, I feel confident that we can overcome the current challenges in Southeast Asia and the United States. Our organizations have proven that they can adjust and reverse trajectories and focus on identified issues.
Overall, the shape of our recovery remains broadly as outlined at our Investor Day in October 2015. Yes, the rate of improvement has been slower than we'd hoped for, but we are doing the right thing in [ph] focusing on innovation and execution, and we're on a positive path.

I think, in some cases, as I have acknowledged over the last couple of years, in some cases, we were slower than competitors to enter the super-high premium segment. So I mean, I'm very encouraged with the progress we are making in that business and how we are building share from month to month with quite substantial opportunities ahead of us to continue to grow, both through increased distribution and share gains. In other areas, I think we have probably been somewhat ahead of our competitors in focusing on the former or company-organized e-commerce trade where some other competitors have relied quite heavily on kind of informal trade out of either Australia or Europe which clearly is now being quite challenged by the changes to the regulatory environment, which I think we anticipated would happen. So our focus has always been on kind of the trade, the amount of the e-commerce trade that we feel we can control ourselves.

And I fear, and I have really very little doubt that we can do that. But I understand that the category is ultimately a very sticky category as a mentioned in my prepared remarks. We have to regain our share of stocks in the category and we have to do that kind of 1 child at a time as they enter the category. So it's going to take time.

It's clear that over the last 12, 18 months, we perhaps had not a strong a program that, at least, the evidence would suggest that. But I think it's more about kind of operational excellence on some of our more basic initiatives. We just let our standards slip a little bit. I suppose I don't want to go to too much detail on it, if you forgive me for that. But I think we have 2 or 3 things that we have clearly identified that we could and should have done better in the United States in the last 12 months or so. And we are clearly facing them quickly.

So I think the key dynamic that will be influenced by all of this price discounting that we are seeing right now and that I suspect people are saying will continue to see through '17, it's mainly influencing retail dynamics. In other words, the amount of inventory that people are pushing into the retail channel. And I suspect that we are going to see a lot of people being caught with very big fluctuations in sales as they need to adjust for inventory swings at some point in the economic cycle. Single influence, different companies at different times, I think to some degree, already within this quarter, you've seen relatively big fluctuations in the financial results announced by many of the companies in the industry. We've sort of prided ourselves on trying to keep our inventory relatively tight at the retail level. And we feel we've got very good visibility on what it is and we are happy with the level of inventory we have in the channels. Some -- there are some quarters when that hurts our relative competitive performance as you look at it versus others. And there are some quarters where it perhaps helps us.

And I think let's start by going back to Ken's -- Ken Goldman's question about what should we expect in terms of EBIT accretion in 2017. And Michel's response was that while we don't see EBIT accretion as we do get, as we look at 2017 and that, of course, is really reflective of the comments I made about our expectations for both sales and EPS growth. And implicitly in that is the fact that there won't -- there's very unlikely to be EBIT margin accretion. So the question is in the face of some fairly significant progress against cost-saving initiatives, why is that? And it really relates to -- it relates simply to the fact that we believe that it is in the long-term interest of our shareholders to continue to drive strong growth in China and that requires continued investment. You will understand implicitly that some of the important initiatives that we have implemented in China were launched only approximately halfway through the year, 2016. So we'll have a full year impact of that higher level of spend in 2017. And then we believe we need to make additional investments in turning around market share in the U.S. which we also believe is in the long-term interest of the business. I do want to say that on the topic of margin accretion, it is -- it's an objective that is subservient to our primary objective which is to turn around the growth trajectory of the business. So that's important to understand. It's also important to understand that where you will see that significant margin accretion occur is at the point in time that our growth rate picks up from the sort of very modest level that we are currently discussing. We clearly, at that point in time, have put our cost structure in place that will allow the company to get a great amount of EBIT leverage on any kind of growth in sales. Does that help?"

It's a question I ask our operators almost on a daily basis. And I'm quite sure that we can -- we will continue to identify small pockets of suboptimal expenditure. But we also have opportunities to spend more on things that we know will work for us. So it will be a balancing act. Obviously, we will continue to look for efficiencies. Great question, David. We can talk more about it when we get together next."

So that also will have an effect on our U.S. business as such. In addition, like Kasper just said, we made a deliberate choice to step up additional investment in the U.S. from a demand generating investment point of view. Whether that's through A&P or the level that's gross to net initiatives and we could be one of them as one of demand generating investment. So we will see some pressure on EBIT margin.

Let me address your question on competitiveness first and then I'll talk about -- then I'll reiterate what I said earlier about inventory. I see absolutely no reason why we should not be able to compete with either of the 2 companies that you mentioned in China. And indeed, we've done so successfully for many years. The China market is somewhat different from many of the other markets in the world that we compete in in the sense that, frankly speaking, healthcare professional endorsement of your brand is far less influential in China than it is elsewhere in our -- in the world we operate in. So any potential disadvantage, which I'm not sure it exists to begin with, vis-à-vis our U.S. competitor there, certainly, is never being used as a reason for shortfalls by our local team in China and nor would it be accepted. You referenced our larger and more broad-based consumer products competitor. And I would only say to that, that again, the primary sales channel for these very high-priced products or high-quality products in China is really the baby store channel in China and that's not a channel where your muscle and product range from other parts of the grocery industry can necessarily be leveraged very effectively. So again, I don't think we are at a significant disadvantage. Apart from what you would generally say is that obviously, we are smaller company than either of those two and that means we can't leverage our cost base, our general infrastructure cost over a broader sales base. But despite that, it appears to me that we have got best-in-class EBIT margins. And I think we can maintain that while growing at the same time. On the inventory side, in China, I just want to refer to what I said earlier. We are very comfortable with our inventory levels in the sales channels in China. We pride ourselves on not building up those inventories artificially from quarter-to-quarter. And hence, I don't expect, assuming that offtake develops the way we expect them, anticipate, I don't expect that we're going to be seeing any changes to our sales trajectory that will not reflect underlying consumer demand."

Michel will then follow me by providing some additional and financial information, including comments on our cash flow related items.
I want to start today's discussion by revisiting our 3-year value creation plan. We laid out this plan at our Investor Day in October of 2015. And at that time, we explained how 2016 would be a year of transition.
We committed to 3 key metrics: a return to growth; a set of expense reductions; and a partial reinvestment of savings in growth initiatives and margin accretion. We said we'd measure our progress against these through the period. I've since revisited these metrics in every earnings call. So let me now briefly summarize our third quarter results in that context.
Firstly, in the third quarter, we delivered growth at the gross sales level of 1%. On a net sales basis, all 3 geographic segments delivered sales in line with prior year's quarter. This is an improvement over the previous 2 quarters. Excluding the effect of suspended shipments to Venezuela, net sales grew 1% in the third quarter over the prior year quarter.
Our second milestone relates to our targeted operating expense reductions. In our second quarter call, we revised our 2016 estimate from $60 million in reductions to $75 million to $80 million. Year-to-date, we've delivered $67 million in savings, and we've achieved approximately 85% of our annual target. SG&A expenses in the latest quarter were almost $20 million lower than a year earlier.
Our third milestone was to invest a portion of the expense savings to fund key growth initiatives while increasing our EBIT margin. Our investments have largely been supportive of our portfolio reshape and strategic channel shift in China. These initiatives are helping us report strong growth in China this quarter while simultaneously raising our EBIT margin.
Before I go into detail on our third quarter results, let me put these in context. The macroeconomic climate in North America and Europe appear stable. But in many emerging markets, we see consumers pressured by slowing economic growth. This applies broadly across Latin America and Asia and is consistent with what you have heard from other companies this earnings season.
So my view of China, backed by recent economic downturn, is a little more positive than that of some others. There's little doubt that a pickup in economic activity in emerging markets will be linked to a recovery in demand for the exports in North America and Europe.
We also believe that the long-term category fundamentals are intact and remain supportive of our growth ambition. We believe that making the necessary and strategic investments now is critical to delivering on our 3-year road map of value creation.
Let me now expand on our third quarter results. For the third year running, we're experiencing foreign exchange headwinds. And for the second year in a row, economic challenges have combined with low dairy costs to produce a challenging pricing environment. Competitively, our results in the latest quarter were frankly mixed. We are facing a stiff challenge from competition in the United States. Conversely, we have good evidence that our China strategy is working. And there, we are strengthening our competitive position in growing channels. In aggregate, third quarter sales for the company were $938 million.
Currency adversely impacted our results by 4%. Constant dollar sales were in line with the third quarter of 2015, while reported sales were 4% lower than the prior year's quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of our intentionally reduced business in Venezuela, the company's net sales grew 1% in constant dollars over prior year.
While volume was 5% unfavorable, we saw a fully offsetting benefit from price and product mix of 5%. This, despite continued competitive pressure on low dairy costs.
Gross margin was strong and remains above our historical average, and we continued to invest against our priority initiatives, including the establishment of Enfinitas in China.
Total investment in advertising and promotion represented 17.3% of net sales in the quarter.
Our Fuel for Growth cost reductions initiative drove significant savings in SG&A costs. Overall, these costs, on a reported basis, were down 12% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of the prior year.
Our EBIT margin rose to 26.1% in the quarter as EBIT grew 9% in constant dollars.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.87 and similar to results in the proceeding 2 quarters.
I'll now discuss the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with our North America and Europe segment. Overall, results in this segment were mixed in the quarter. Market share gains in Canada and Europe resulting in strong sales growth there offset a disappointing quarter for our U.S. business. Net sales in the segment were in line with the third quarter of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. In aggregate, the segment benefited from a 5% pricing benefit, but this was fully offset by lower volumes in the United States. And foreign exchange adversely impacted sales for this segment by 1%.
Competitive pressure -- competitive activity put pressure on market share and resulted in a disappointing sales performance in our U.S. business. While we are actively addressing these challenges, we recognize that category dynamics of such that it'll take time to stabilize and recover lost market share.
Unconscious that we've been referencing weakness in U.S. market share for a few quarters now. Unfortunately, we know the category is quite sticky, and to gain new consumers take time. We have a concrete action plan in place, but we must expect share to remain relatively weak through the next couple of quarters.
In the rest of the segment, I'm pleased with our progress. And we reported our highest market share in many years in Canada, as both Canada and Europe grew strongly in the quarter.
The Canadian business experienced strong growth in both its core infant formula business and the toddler category. And European sales of our energy products continued to grow on the back of a strengthened competitive position in a growing segment.
Let me now turn to Latin America. Segment performance continues to be heavily impacted by the suspension of sales to Venezuela. These shipments all but ceased at the end of 2015. Excluding this impact, sales in Latin America grew 5% in constant dollars over the same quarter of 2015. However, including the impact of Venezuela, constant dollar sales for the region were in line with the prior year's quarter. Pricing benefits of 10% did not fully offset foreign exchange impacts of negative 13%. And given the weakness in so many of the region's economies, we saw a volume lower by 10%. Excluding Venezuela, volume was unfavorable by 5%.
With regard to Venezuela, there's been no significant change in circumstances. This situation will again negatively impact results in the coming quarter. But after that, the distorting effect should be negligible.
In Mexico, our infant and children's businesses delivered growth, and trends in other parts of Latin America remained broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. In much of South America, economic fundamentals remained weak, and we are seeing this reflected in consumer demand. Colombia and Peru provide isolated spots of relative economic stability.
I turn now to the Asia segment. Constant dollar sales in Asia were in line with the third quarter of 2015. Despite increased trade investments, price was favorable compared to the prior year quarter. Price increases in Southeast Asia, along with positive product mix in China, resulted in a 4% improvement in price within the segment. Volume was unfavorable by 4% driven by market share weakness and adjustment to channel inventories in the Philippines. Again, we have implemented a solid remediation plan there, and it's beginning to work. That said, it will take time to rebuild market share. And in the meantime, we'd have to reduce channel inventory.
In Asia, price inflation remains low in a historical context.
I'll complete my discussion of our Asia segment with a few comments on China. In a sentence, our strategy to reshape our portfolio and strengthen performance in high-growth channels is working. Despite the decline in Hong Kong, sales within our greater China business grew strongly in the latest quarter. We saw improvements in both volume and product mix. Higher-priced new products are replacing sales on legacy lines. Consumers continue to adopt our fully imported product lines of Enfamil and Enfinitas at rapid rates, more than offsetting slowing demand for our locally manufactured products and shrinking exports from Hong Kong. Like many of our competitors, we are seeing the rapid shift in sales channels continue. But with the reshaped product portfolio, we've been able to adapt to this.
A few facts may help illustrate my point and put our results in context. The mainland supermarket channel declined double digits in the quarter. Our sales to our Hong Kong channel continued to decline and was down double digits within the quarter, but our sales into baby stores in and Mainland China were up more than 20% on a year earlier. And our e-commerce sales were up more than 60%.
Our market share of company-controlled e-commerce channels increased by 3 percentage point over prior year. And our recently launched imported product lines continue to grow market share each month. Imported products now account for 60% of total sales in Mainland China, up from 45% in March.
I think you can understand from this exactly how dynamic the trade environment is and how critical agility and flexibility are as core elements of our China strategy.
In conclusion, let me mention that our third quarter sales did benefit from replenishment of orders we were able -- we were unable to fulfill in the prior quarter due to tightened import processes. You'll remember that I mentioned this in our last call. However, underlying growth, excluding this benefit, was nevertheless healthy in China. China's results this quarter reflect the strategy we put in place 2 to 3 years ago to increase flexibilities through a broader product portfolio, sold to a more diverse set of channels.
This quarter, you can see that our strong organization and infrastructure in China has the ability to flex and adapt than challenged. Much work remains to be done, but I feel good about the latest quarter. I deliberately not devoted any time to a description of our year-to-date sales. Though we've clearly hoped for a faster rebound in sales, we've seen a gradual, progressive improvement in our growth rate from quarter-to-quarter.
I now want to transition to talk about our global outlook for the balance of the year and beyond. While we saw strong growth in China, it's become clear that any sustained recovery in the broader emerging markets will take longer to occur than expected earlier. Additionally, market share losses in the Philippines and the United States are weighing on our current performance, and we do not expect to see these losses reversed until well into 2017.
In recognition of these challenges, we are revising our expectations for both sales and earnings per share. We now expect constant dollar sales for the full year 2016 to come in 2% to 3% below prior year, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in between $3.43 and $3.50. These numbers imply we continue to make progress in China in the fourth quarter and gradually improve sales in other geographies. We expect that the recent volatility and changing market dynamics will continue to impact our business in the midterm.
As we look beyond the next quarter to 2017, we expect to see continued but only modest improvement in constant dollar sales and to EPS. Our Fuel for Growth program will continue to help fund growth initiatives and mitigate known headwinds.
I'll now hand the call over to Michel who'll provide additional details on our third quarter financial performance. After that, I'll return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."
1002291,367328587,1063335,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of the full year guidance. My com",1766,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of the full year guidance. My comments about sales will refer to net sales, unless I explicitly state gross sales. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statement into U.S. dollars.
Kathy already covered Slide 2, so let me start with sales on Slide 3. Slide 3 shows the improving trend of net sales on a constant dollar basis when compared to prior year periods. As Kasper already indicated, excluding the impact of reduced shipments to Venezuela, the company's net sales were 1% above the prior year quarter. The adverse impact of Venezuela will be less in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we significantly slowed shipments in the fourth quarter of 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela on our net sales is over 1% on a constant dollar basis.
Turning to Slide 4. Gross sales reflects sales to customers before trade investment and other items, which are recorded as gross to net sales adjustments. For the third quarter, gross sales were 1% above the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. A significant portion of this quarter growth came from China. This is the first time our gross sales returned to positive growth since the first quarter of 2015.
Net sales on a reported basis were 4% below the prior year quarter and 8% below on a year-to-date basis. The adverse impact of foreign exchange on sales was 4%. The U.S. dollar continued to be strong, and the effect on the translation of local currencies negatively impacted all reporting segments.
On Slide 5, the third quarter EBIT of $244 million was 9% above the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 7%. Including currency impacts, EBIT increased 2% on a reported basis in the third quarter. The third quarter EBIT margin of 26.1% of sales was 160 basis points better than the prior year quarter. With sales nearly in line with the prior year, the benefit of lower dairy cost rolled through for a positive gross profit.
We continue to make strong progress to reduce operating expenses as part of our Fuel for Growth program, which allows continued investments while improving the underlying profitability. Year-to-date EBIT was $719 million, and we delivered positive growth of 2% above the previous year period on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 25.3% of sales was 80 basis points better than the prior year period. Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of 8%. Despite macroeconomic and country-specific challenges, which negatively impacted our sales, we benefited from low dairy cost and made excellent progress on realizing Fuel for Growth savings.
I will now move to factors that impacted gross margin on Slide 6. Gross margin was 64.6% in the third quarter of 2016. Adverse foreign currency impacted gross margin by 150 basis points in the quarter. We continued to deliver nearly flat gross margin on a reported basis despite the significantly currency headwinds we had. On a constant dollar basis, the gross margin percentage improved 120 basis points. Price/mix and gross to net adjustment had a slightly negative impact on gross margin, mainly from higher trade investments. Low dairy was the large benefit to gross margin in the third quarter of 2016.
Within cost of goods sold, productivity savings continued to be strong. Projects for the full year have been identified, and we expect savings to be above our earlier estimate of 3.5% of cost of goods sold. When you compare the 3 months and the 9 months charts, you can see the key drivers are the same. As this year progressed, the dairy benefit is lower as we lap towards the lowest 2015 dairy cost comparison. The adverse foreign currency impact on gross margin in the third quarter is higher, mainly due to hedges. If dairy is secured for the full year and larger productivity savings, we expect full year gross margin to be up to 64.5%, better than our previous guidance of 64%.
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. The chart provides the combined spending of demand-generating investments, both as trade investment classified in gross to net sales adjustments and as advertising and promotion in operating expense category. The combined investments in the third quarter were above the prior year quarter. As a percentage of gross sales, the third quarter was similar to the second quarter as a result of increased investments to support our China strategy to become more competitive in the baby store and e-commerce channels with our Enfa imported and Enfinitas product lines.
Slide 8. We reduced our SG&A cost by 9% on a constant dollar basis in the third quarter of 2016 versus the previous year quarter and by 10% year-to-date compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we delivered $20 million savings in the fourth quarter of 2015. So in the fourth quarter of 2016, the year-over-year percentage reduction is likely to be smaller.
As you can see on Slide 9, year-to-date, we have achieved nearly 85% of this year's target. We now expect to realize savings toward the higher end of the $75 million to $80 million target range. In the corporate and other functions, we reduced our cost by $50 million year-to-date compared to prior year period. This is 3/4 of the year-to-date savings.
Turning to Slide 10 for a discussion of EBIT. Positive price/mix was offset by volume decline in all segments. The positive price/mix was mainly driven by a mix benefit as a result of the rollout of imported premium products in China, new innovations in several markets as well as price increases in markets to partly compensate currency devaluations. All segments benefited from lower dairy and cost -- and crops productivity.
EBIT at Asia was lower due to higher trade investments. Promotional activities and advertising, which resulted in lower EBITDA loss and margin percentage in the third quarter. Our EBIT in both Latin America and North America improved. For Latin America, this was due to lower advertising and promotion expenses when compared to the prior year where we had higher expenses related to product launches.
For North America and Europe, SG&A cost savings helped fund investments and drove higher EBIT margins. Lower corporate and other expenses were most notably attributable to Fuel for Growth savings.
I will now address the financial results from EBIT to EPS on Slide 11. The interest expense of $26 million in the third quarter was in line with 2016 run rate. When compared to the prior year quarter, interest expense increase reflects the impact of the November 2015 $1.5 billion notes issuance. A significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated repurchase program, or the ASR. The benefit of the ASR is reflected in the third quarter 2016 share count. There was no significant share repurchase in the third quarter.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 26% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 28.1% in the prior year quarter. In the third quarter of 2016, the ETR decrease was driven by tax credits from repatriation of foreign earnings, somewhat offset by change in allowances against tax assets. The prior year quarter was adversely impacted by an unfavorable geographic mix.
Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $0.87, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, non-GAAP EPS was $2.63, a 1% decrease from the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 7% on a constant dollar basis.
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the change to EPS on Slide 12. In the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.13 to $0.93 per share on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit delivered a $0.03 benefit to EPS. The adverse impact of higher advertising and promotion was $0.04. Fuel for Growth savings delivered $0.07 benefit. The share repurchase programs delivered a $0.03 benefit, net of higher interest expense. And tax and other contributed a $0.03 benefit. Despite the negative impact of foreign exchange of $0.06 per share, EPS increased $0.07 versus third quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movements on Slide 13. The cash balance of $1.8 billion as of September 30 was $142 million higher than in the beginning of the year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by operating working capital. Our year-to-date CapEx investments were $110 million, mainly in our U.S. and operating in Europe manufacturing facilities, along with ongoing quality and planned enhancements globally. For the full year, our capital spending goal remains at 4% of sales. Dividend payments were $232 million in the 9 months of 2016. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange of $33 million was mainly related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
To summarize our forward-looking annual guidance on Slide 14, our sales outlook for 2016 on a constant dollar basis is expected to be 2% to 3% below the prior year. With foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 4%, reported sales are estimated to be 6% to 7% below 2015. The 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.87. And our non-GAAP guidance is $3.43 to $3.50 per share.
The guidance changed for the following reasons: sales on a constant currency basis may be lower due to the market share weakness in several markets, especially in the U.S., along with continued macroeconomic challenges in several emerging markets. Partially offsetting the sales impact, we expect gross margin to be up 64.5%, while Fuel for Growth savings is expected to be at the high end of the $75 million to $80 million range. And finally, the foreign exchange impact is expected to be approximately $0.30 per share from our previous guidance of $0.35 per share.
GAAP EPS guidance is likely to be impacted by potentially significant future market-to-market pension adjustments, which cannot be estimated and are classified as specified items. Specified items include charges related to our Venezuela business, Fuel for Growth and year-to-date pension adjustments.
This concludes my discussion on the third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. Thank you again for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

In today's prepared remarks, we've discussed both the positive news from China as well the number of headwinds we will continue to tackle as we move into next year.
I want to acknowledge the difficulty we've had in accurately projecting our top line trajectory over the past 18 months in what is perhaps the most uncertain environment I've seen in nearly 20 years in the industry. The global economy has been weaker than we'd expect, and we are facing a strong challenge in the United States.
But before we open the lines to your questions, I want to take you back 3 years. 3 years ago, when it first became obvious that our trajectory in China was changing, many of you, I'm sure, had doubts we could successfully navigate our way through the adaptations we needed to make. Today, I feel very proud of the way our people embraced the challenge and worked hard on implementation. We certainly have much work left in China and elsewhere, but we also have many more opportunities from which we can benefit. We've taken the first important steps, and we're on our way forward.
As was the case when we discussed our challenges in China, I feel confident that we can overcome the current challenges in Southeast Asia and the United States. Our organizations have proven that they can adjust and reverse trajectories and focus on identified issues.
Overall, the shape of our recovery remains broadly as outlined at our Investor Day in October 2015. Yes, the rate of improvement has been slower than we'd hoped for, but we are doing the right thing in focusing on innovation and execution, and we're on a positive path.
I'll now hand the call back to the operator, Liz, and ask her to open the lines to your questions. Liz, back to you."

It allows us to play much more effectively in the faster-growing channels, particularly the baby stores and the e-commerce channel. I think, in some cases, as I have acknowledged over the last couple of years, in some cases, we were slower than competitors to enter the super-high premium segment. So I mean, I'm very encouraged with the progress we are making in that business and how we are building share from month to month with quite substantial opportunities ahead of us to continue to grow, both through increased distribution and share gains. In other areas, I think we have probably been somewhat ahead of our competitors in focusing on the former or company-organized e-commerce trade where some other competitors have relied quite heavily on kind of informal trade out of either Australia or Europe, which clearly is now being quite challenged by the changes to the regulatory environment, which I think we anticipated would happen. So our focus has always been on kind of the trade that -- the amount of the e-commerce trade that we feel we can control ourselves. And I referenced in my comments, prepared remarks that in that part of the e-commerce channel, our sales are up 60% on a year ago, which outstrips the growth of the channel in general. And I think I said that we had increased our share of that channel by just over 100 basis points.
So I think that answers your question. If not..."

It's clear that over the last 12, 18 months, we perhaps had not a strong a program that, at least, the evidence would suggest that. But I think it's more about kind of operational excellence on some of our more basic initiatives. We just let our standards slip a little bit. I suppose I don't want to go into too much detail on it, if you'll forgive me for that. But I think we have 2 or 3 things that we have clearly identified that we could and should have done better in the United States in the last 12 months or so, and we are clearly facing them quickly.

So I think the key dynamic that will be influenced by all of this price discounting that we are seeing right now, and that I suspect people are right in saying we'll continue to see through '17, it's mainly influencing retail dynamics; in other words, the amount of inventory that people are pushing into the retail channel. And I suspect that we are going to see a lot of people being caught with very big fluctuations in sales as they need to adjust for inventory swings at some point in the economic cycle. Single influence, different companies at different times, I think, to some degree, already within this quarter, you've seen relatively big fluctuations in the financial results announced by many of the companies in the industry. We've sort of prided ourselves on trying to keep our inventory relatively tight at the retail level. And we feel we've got very good visibility on what it is, and we are happy with the level of inventory we have in the channels. Some -- there are some quarters when that hurts our relative competitive performance as you look at it versus others, and there are some quarters where it perhaps helps us.

As you might imagine, nobody is, what shall we say, more sensitive around us referencing market share losses than I am. And certainly, it's not what we want to see. Having said that, we have a portfolio that is heavily exposed to, let's call it, 10 global businesses or 10 businesses around the world. It's inevitable that amongst those 10, you're going to have ups and downs. We've gained a lot of market share in Canada. We've gained a lot of market share in Europe. And I would argue, at the moment, we are gaining market share in China. Now unfortunately, if you have problems, market share-wise, and you have them in a couple of your really big markets, we both know that the U.S. and China, between the 2 of them, account for more than half our sales, our global sales. So it's very hard for us to offset any significant loss of market share in 1 of those 2 markets with performance in other markets. I'm certainly disappointed that we have not been able to proactively address some of these challenges as opposed to finding ourselves in the mode where we are, so to speak, reacting in state and adapting.

It's a great question, and obviously, one we had anticipated. And I think let's start by going back to Ken's -- to Ken Goldman's question about so what should we expect in terms of EBIT accretion in 2017. And Michel's response that while we don't see EBIT accretion as we look at 2017 and that, of course, is really reflective of the comments I made about our expectations for both sales and EPS growth. And implicitly in that is the fact that there won't -- there's very unlikely to be EBIT margin accretion. So the question is in the face of some fairly significant progress against cost saving initiatives, why is that? And it really relates into -- it relates simply to the fact that we believe that it is in the long-term interest of our shareholders to continue to drive strong growth in China, and that requires continued investment. You will understand implicitly that some of the important initiatives that we have implemented in China were launched only approximately halfway through the year, 2016. So we'll have a full year impact of that higher level of spend in 2017. And then we believe we need to make additional investments in turning around market share in the U.S., which we also believe is in the long-term interest of the business. I do want to say that on the topic of margin accretion, it is -- it's an objective that is subservient to our primary objective, which is to turn around the growth trajectory of the business. So that's important to understand. It's also important to understand that where you will see that significant margin accretion occur is at the point in time that our growth rate picks up from the sort of very modest level that we are currently discussing. We clearly, at that point in time, have put our cost structure in place that will allow the company to get a great amount of EBIT leverage on any kind of growth in sales.

In general, we'll see, as a total company, more gross margin pressure also on '17 as a result of dairy prices where we see some slightly increases that are coming in. So that also will have an effect on our U.S. business as such. In addition, like Kasper just said, we made a deliberate choice to step up additional investment in the U.S. from a demand-generating investment point of view, whether that's through A&P or whether that's from gross to net initiatives, and we could be one of them as one of demand-generating investments. So we will see some pressure on EBIT margin. I think we won't see a level that we have currently. But I also don't expect that it will go to the levels that we have seen historically. I would say that we would see a midpoint between those EBIT margins."

Let me address your question on competitiveness first, and then I'll talk about -- then I'll reiterate what I said earlier about inventory. I see absolutely no reason why we should not be able to compete with either of the 2 companies that you mentioned in China. And indeed, we've done so successfully for many years. The China market is somewhat different from many of the other markets in the world that we compete in, in the sense that, frankly speaking, health care professional endorsement of your brand is far less influential in China than it is elsewhere in our -- in the world we operate in. So any potential disadvantage, which I'm not sure exists to begin with, vis-à-vis our U.S. competitor there, certainly is never being used as a reason for shortfalls by our local team in China and nor would it be accepted. You referenced our larger and more broad-based consumer products competitor, and I would only say to that, that again, the primary sales channel for these very high-priced products, high-quality products in China is really the baby store channel in China, and that's not a channel where your muscle and product range from other parts of the grocery industry can necessarily be leveraged very effectively. So again, I don't think we are at a significant disadvantage. Apart from what you would generally say is that obviously, we are a smaller company than either of those 2, and that means we can't leverage our cost base, our general infrastructure cost over a broader sales base. But despite that, it appears to me that we have got best-in-class EBIT margins. And I think we can maintain that while growing at the same time. On the inventory side in China, I just want to refer to what I said earlier. We are very comfortable with our inventory levels in the sales channels in China. We pride ourselves on not building up those inventories artificially from quarter-to-quarter. And hence, I don't expect, assuming that offtake develops the way we expect and anticipate, I don't expect that we're going to be seeing any changes to our sales trajectory that will not reflect underlying consumer demand."

I want to start today's discussion by revisiting our 3-year value creation plan. We laid out this plan at our Investor Day in October of 2015. And at that time, we explained how 2016 would be a year of transition.
We committed to 3 key metrics: a return to growth; a set of expense reductions; and a partial reinvestment of savings in growth initiatives and margin accretion. We said we'd measure our progress against these through the period. I've since revisited these metrics in every earnings call. So let me now briefly summarize our third quarter results in that context.
Firstly, in the third quarter, we delivered growth at the gross sales level of 1%. On a net sales basis, all 3 geographic segments delivered sales in line with prior year's quarter. This is an improvement over the previous 2 quarters. Excluding the effect of suspended shipments to Venezuela, net sales grew 1% in the third quarter over the prior year quarter.
Our second milestone relates to our targeted operating expense reductions. In our second quarter call, we revised our 2016 estimate from $60 million in reductions to $75 million to $80 million. Year-to-date, we've delivered $67 million in savings, and we've achieved approximately 85% of our annual target. SG&A expenses in the latest quarter were almost $20 million lower than a year earlier.
Our third milestone was to invest a portion of the expense savings to fund key growth initiatives while increasing our EBIT margin. Our investments have largely been supportive of our portfolio reshape and strategic channel shift in China. These initiatives are helping us report strong growth in China this quarter while simultaneously raising our EBIT margin.
Before I go into detail on our third quarter results, let me put these in context. The macroeconomic climate in North America and Europe appears stable. But in many emerging markets, we see consumers pressured by slowing economic growth. This applies broadly across Latin America and Asia and is consistent with what you have heard from other companies this earnings season.
Though my view of China, backed by recent economic data, is a little more positive than that of some others, there's little doubt that a pickup in economic activity in emerging markets will be linked to a recovery in demand for the exports in North America and Europe.
We also believe that the long-term category fundamentals are intact and remain supportive of our growth ambition. We believe that making the necessary and strategic investments now is critical to delivering on our 3-year road map of value creation.
Let me now expand on our third quarter results. For the third year running, we're experiencing foreign exchange headwinds. And for the second year in a row, economic challenges have combined with low dairy costs to produce a challenging pricing environment. Competitively, our results in the latest quarter were frankly mixed. We are facing a stiff challenge from competition in the United States. Conversely, we have good evidence that our China strategy is working. And there, we are strengthening our competitive position in growing channels. In aggregate, third quarter sales for the company were $938 million.
Currency adversely impacted our results by 4%. Constant dollar sales were in line with the third quarter of 2015, while reported sales were 4% lower than the prior year's quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of our intentionally reduced business in Venezuela, the company's net sales grew 1% in constant dollars over prior year.
While volume was 5% unfavorable, we saw a fully offsetting benefit from price and product mix of 5%. This, despite continued competitive pressure and low dairy costs.
Gross margin was strong and remains above our historical average, and we continued to invest against our priority initiatives, including the establishment of Enfinitas in China.
Total investment in advertising and promotion represented 17.3% of net sales in the quarter.
Our Fuel for Growth cost reductions initiative drove significant savings in SG&A costs. Overall, these costs, on a reported basis, were down 12% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of the prior year.
Our EBIT margin rose to 26.1% in the quarter as EBIT grew 9% in constant dollars.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.87 and similar to results in the proceeding 2 quarters.
I'll now discuss the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with our North America and Europe segment. Overall, results in this segment were mixed in the quarter. Market share gains in Canada and Europe resulting in strong sales growth there offset a disappointing quarter for our U.S. business. Net sales in the segment were in line with the third quarter of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. In aggregate, the segment benefited from a 5% pricing benefit, but this was fully offset by lower volumes in the United States. And foreign exchange adversely impacted sales for this segment by 1%.
Competitive pressure -- competitive activity put pressure on market share and resulted in a disappointing sales performance in our U.S. business. While we are actively addressing these challenges, we recognize that category dynamics are such that it'll take time to stabilize and recover lost market share.
I'm conscious that we've been referencing weakness in U.S. market share for a few quarters now. Unfortunately, we know the category is quite sticky, and to gain new consumers take time. We have a concrete action plan in place, but we must expect share to remain relatively weak through the next couple of quarters.
In the rest of the segment, I'm pleased with our progress. And we reported our highest market share in many years in Canada, as both Canada and Europe grew strongly in the quarter.
The Canadian business experienced strong growth in both its core infant formula business and the toddler category. And European sales of our energy products continued to grow on the back of a strengthened competitive position in a growing segment.
Let me now turn to Latin America. Segment performance continues to be heavily impacted by the suspension of sales to Venezuela. These shipments all but ceased at the end of 2015. Excluding this impact, sales in Latin America grew 5% in constant dollars over the same quarter of 2015. However, including the impact of Venezuela, constant dollar sales for the region were in line with the prior year's quarter. Pricing benefits of 10% did not fully offset foreign exchange impacts of negative 13%. And given the weakness in so many of the region's economies, we saw volume lower by 10%. Excluding Venezuela, volume was unfavorable by 5%.
With regard to Venezuela, there's been no significant change in circumstances. This situation will again negatively impact results in the coming quarter. But after that, the distorting effect should be negligible.
In Mexico, our infant and children's businesses delivered growth, and trends in other parts of Latin America remained broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. In much of South America, economic fundamentals remained weak, and we are seeing this reflected in consumer demand. Colombia and Peru provide isolated spots of relative economic stability.
I turn now to the Asia segment. Constant dollar sales in Asia were in line with the third quarter of 2015. Despite increased trade investments, price was favorable compared to the prior year quarter. Price increases in Southeast Asia, along with positive product mix in China, resulted in a 4% improvement in price within the segment. Volume was unfavorable by 4% driven by market share weakness and adjustment to channel inventories in the Philippines. Again, we have implemented a solid remediation plan there, and it's beginning to work. That said, it will take time to rebuild market share. And in the meantime, we've had to reduce channel inventory.
In Asia, price inflation remains low in a historical context.
I'll complete my discussion of our Asia segment with a few comments on China. In a sentence, our strategy to reshape our portfolio and strengthen performance in high-growth channels is working. Despite the decline in Hong Kong, sales within our greater China business grew strongly in the latest quarter. We saw improvements in both volume and product mix. Higher-priced new products are replacing sales of legacy lines. Consumers continue to adopt our fully imported product lines of Enfamil and Enfinitas at rapid rates, more than offsetting slowing demand for our locally manufactured products and shrinking exports from Hong Kong. Like many of our competitors, we are seeing the rapid shift in sales channels continue. But with the reshaped product portfolio, we've been able to adapt to this.
A few facts may help illustrate my point and put our results in context. The mainland supermarket channel declined double digits in the quarter. Our sales through our Hong Kong channel continued to decline and was down double digits within the quarter, but our sales into baby stores in Mainland China were up more than 20% on a year earlier. And our e-commerce sales were up more than 60%.
Our market share of company-controlled e-commerce channels increased by a full percentage point over prior year. And our recently launched imported product lines continue to grow market share each month. Imported products now account for 60% of total sales in Mainland China, up from 45% in March.
I think you can understand from this exactly how dynamic the trade environment is and how critical agility and flexibility are as core elements of our China strategy.
In conclusion, let me mention that our third quarter sales did benefit from replenishment of orders we were able -- we were unable to fulfill in the prior quarter due to tightened import processes. You'll remember that I mentioned this in our last call. However, underlying growth, excluding this benefit, was nevertheless healthy in China. China's results this quarter reflect the strategy we put in place 2 to 3 years ago to increase flexibilities through a broader product portfolio, sold through a more diverse set of channels.
This quarter, you can see that our strong organization and infrastructure in China has the ability to flex and adapt when challenged. Much work remains to be done, but I feel good about the latest quarter. I've deliberately not devoted any time to a description of our year-to-date sales. Though we've clearly hoped for a faster rebound in sales, we've seen a gradual, progressive improvement in our growth rate from quarter-to-quarter.
I now want to transition to talk about our global outlook for the balance of the year and beyond. While we saw strong growth in China, it's become clear that any sustained recovery in the broader emerging markets will take longer to occur than expected earlier. Additionally, market share losses in the Philippines and the United States are weighing on our current performance, and we do not expect to see these losses reversed until well into 2017.
In recognition of these challenges, we are revising our expectations for both sales and earnings per share. We now expect constant dollar sales for the full year 2016 to come in 2% to 3% below prior year, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in between $3.43 and $3.50. These numbers imply we continue to make progress in China in the fourth quarter and gradually improve sales in other geographies. We expect that the recent volatility and changing market dynamics will continue to impact our business in the midterm.
As we look beyond the next quarter to 2017, we expect to see continued but only modest improvement in constant dollar sales and to EPS. Our Fuel for Growth program will continue to help fund growth initiatives and mitigate known headwinds.
I'll now hand the call over to Michel who'll provide additional details on our third quarter financial performance. After that, I'll return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."

Today, I will discuss the company's third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of the full year guidance. My comments about sales will refer to net sales, unless I explicitly state gross sales. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statement into U.S. dollars.
Kathy already covered Slide 2, so let me start with sales on Slide 3. Slide 3 shows the improving trend of net sales on a constant dollar basis when compared to prior year periods. As Kasper already indicated, excluding the impact of reduced shipments to Venezuela, the company's net sales were 1% above the prior year quarter. The adverse impact of Venezuela will be less in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we significantly slowed shipments in the fourth quarter of 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela on our net sales is over 1% on a constant dollar basis.
Turning to Slide 4. Gross sales reflects sales to customers before trade investment and other items, which are recorded as gross to net sales adjustments. For the third quarter, gross sales were 1% above the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. A significant portion of this quarter growth came from China. This is the first time our gross sales returned to positive growth since the first quarter of 2015.
Net sales on a reported basis were 4% below the prior year quarter and 8% below on a year-to-date basis. The adverse impact of foreign exchange on sales was 4%. The U.S. dollar continued to be strong, and the effect on the translation of local currencies negatively impacted all reporting segments.
On Slide 5, the third quarter EBIT of $244 million was 9% above the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 7%. Including currency impacts, EBIT increased 2% on a reported basis in the third quarter. The third quarter EBIT margin of 26.1% of sales was 160 basis points better than the prior year quarter. With sales nearly in line with the prior year, the benefit of lower dairy cost rolled through for a positive gross profit.
We continue to make strong progress to reduce operating expenses as part of our Fuel for Growth program, which allows continued investments while improving the underlying profitability. Year-to-date EBIT was $719 million, and we delivered positive growth of 2% above the previous year period on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 25.3% of sales was 80 basis points better than the prior year period. Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of 8%. Despite macroeconomic and country-specific challenges, which negatively impacted our sales, we benefited from low dairy cost and made excellent progress on realizing Fuel for Growth savings.
I will now move to factors that impacted gross margin on Slide 6. Gross margin was 64.6% in the third quarter of 2016. Adverse foreign currency impacted gross margin by 150 basis points in the quarter. We continued to deliver nearly flat gross margin on a reported basis despite the significantly currency headwinds we had. On a constant dollar basis, the gross margin percentage improved 120 basis points. Price/mix and gross to net adjustment had a slightly negative impact on gross margin, mainly from higher trade investments. Low dairy was the largest benefit to gross margin in the third quarter of 2016.
Within cost of goods sold, productivity savings continued to be strong. Projects for the full year have been identified, and we expect savings to be above our earlier estimate of 3.5% of cost of goods sold. When you compare the 3 months and the 9 months charts, you can see the key drivers are the same. As this year progressed, the dairy benefit is lower as we lap towards the lowest 2015 dairy cost comparison. The adverse foreign currency impact on gross margin in the third quarter is higher, mainly due to hedges. With dairy secured for the full year and larger productivity savings, we expect full year gross margin to be up to 64.5%, better than our previous guidance of 64%.
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. The chart provides the combined spending of demand-generating investments, both as trade investment classified in gross to net sales adjustments and as advertising and promotion in operating expense category. The combined investments in the third quarter were above the prior year quarter. As a percentage of gross sales, the third quarter was similar to the second quarter as a result of increased investments to support our China strategy to become more competitive in the baby store and e-commerce channels with our Enfa imported and Enfinitas product lines.
Slide 8. We reduced our SG&A cost by 9% on a constant dollar basis in the third quarter of 2016 versus the previous year quarter and by 10% year-to-date compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we delivered $20 million savings in the fourth quarter of 2015. So in the fourth quarter of 2016, the year-over-year percentage reduction is likely to be smaller.
As you can see on Slide 9, year-to-date, we have achieved nearly 85% of this year's target. We now expect to realize savings toward the higher end of the $75 million to $80 million target range. In the corporate and other functions, we reduced our cost by $50 million year-to-date compared to prior year period. This is 3/4 of the year-to-date savings.
Turning to Slide 10 for a discussion of EBIT. Positive price/mix was offset by volume decline in all segments. The positive price/mix was mainly driven by a mix benefit as a result of the rollout of imported premium products in China, new innovations in several markets as well as price increases in markets to partly compensate for currency devaluations. All segments benefited from lower dairy and cost -- and cost productivity.
EBIT in Asia was lower due to higher trade investments. Promotional activities and advertising, which resulted in lower EBITDA loss and margin percentage in the third quarter. Our EBIT in both Latin America and North America improved. For Latin America, this was due to lower advertising and promotion expenses when compared to the prior year when we had higher expenses related to product launches.
For North America/Europe, SG&A cost savings helped fund investments and drove higher EBIT margins. Lower corporate and other expenses were most notably attributable to Fuel for Growth savings.
I will now address the financial results from EBIT to EPS on Slide 11. The interest expense of $26 million in the third quarter was in line with 2016 run rate. When compared to the prior year quarter, interest expense increase reflects the impact of the November 2015 $1.5 billion notes issuance. A significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated repurchase program, or the ASR. The benefit of the ASR is reflected in the third quarter 2016 share count. There was no significant share repurchase in the third quarter.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 26% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 28.1% in the prior year quarter. In the third quarter of 2016, the ETR decrease was driven by tax credits from repatriation of foreign earnings, somewhat offset by change in allowances against tax assets. The prior year quarter was adversely impacted by an unfavorable geographic mix.
Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $0.87, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, non-GAAP EPS was $2.63, a 1% decrease from the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 7% on a constant dollar basis.
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the change to EPS on Slide 12. In the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.13 to $0.93 per share on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit delivered a $0.03 benefit to EPS. The adverse impact of higher advertising and promotion was $0.04. Fuel for Growth savings delivered $0.07 benefit. The share repurchase programs delivered a $0.03 benefit, net of higher interest expense. And tax and other contributed a $0.03 benefit. Despite the negative impact of foreign exchange of $0.06 per share, EPS increased $0.07 versus third quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movements on Slide 13. The cash balance of $1.8 billion as of September 30 was $142 million higher than in the beginning of the year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by operating working capital. Our year-to-date CapEx investments were $110 million, mainly in our U.S. and operating in Europe manufacturing facilities, along with ongoing quality and planned enhancements globally. For the full year, our capital spending goal remains at 4% of sales. Dividend payments were $232 million in the 9 months of 2016. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange of $33 million was mainly related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
To summarize our forward-looking annual guidance on Slide 14, our sales outlook for 2016 on a constant dollar basis is expected to be 2% to 3% below the prior year. With foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 4%, reported sales are estimated to be 6% to 7% below 2015. The 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.87. And our non-GAAP guidance is $3.43 to $3.50 per share.
The guidance changed for the following reasons: sales on a constant currency basis may be lower due to the market share weakness in several markets, especially in the U.S., along with continued macroeconomic challenges in several emerging markets. Partially offsetting the sales impact, we expect gross margin to be up 64.5%, while Fuel for Growth savings is expected to be at the high end of the $75 million to $80 million range. And finally, the foreign exchange impact is expected to be approximately $0.30 per share from our previous guidance of $0.35 per share.
GAAP EPS guidance is likely to be impacted by potentially significant future mark-to-market pension adjustments, which cannot be estimated and are classified as specified items. Specified items include charges related to our Venezuela business, Fuel for Growth and year-to-date pension adjustments.
This concludes my discussion on the third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. Thank you again for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

In today's prepared remarks, we've discussed both the positive news from China as well a number of headwinds we will continue to tackle as we move into next year.
I want to acknowledge the difficulty we've had in accurately projecting our top line trajectory over the past 18 months in what is perhaps the most uncertain environment I've seen in nearly 20 years in the industry. The global economy has been weaker than we'd expected, and we are facing a strong challenge in the United States.
But before we open the lines to your questions, I want to take you back 3 years. Three years ago, when it first became obvious that our trajectory in China was changing, many of you, I'm sure, had doubts we could successfully navigate our way through the adaptations we needed to make. Today, I feel very proud of the way our people embraced the challenge and worked hard on implementation. We certainly have much work left in China and elsewhere, but we also have many more opportunities from which we can benefit. We've taken the first important steps, and we're on our way forward.
As was the case when we discussed our challenges in China, I feel confident that we can overcome the current challenges in Southeast Asia and the United States. Our organizations have proven that they can adjust and reverse trajectories and focus on identified issues.
Overall, the shape of our recovery remains broadly as outlined at our Investor Day in October 2015. Yes, the rate of improvement has been slower than we'd hoped for, but we are doing the right thing in focusing on innovation and execution, and we're on a positive path.

It allows us to play much more effectively in the faster-growing channels, particularly the baby stores and the e-commerce channel. I think, in some cases, as I have acknowledged over the last couple of years, in some cases, we were slower than competitors to enter the super-high premium segment. So I mean, I'm very encouraged with the progress we are making in that business and how we are building share from month to month with quite substantial opportunities ahead of us to continue to grow, both through increased distribution and share gains. In other areas, I think we have probably been somewhat ahead of our competitors in focusing on the formal or company-organized e-commerce trade where some other competitors have relied quite heavily on kind of informal trade out of either Australia or Europe, which clearly is now being quite challenged by the changes to the regulatory environment, which I think we anticipated would happen. So our focus has always been on kind of the trade that -- the amount of the e-commerce trade that we feel we can control ourselves. And I referenced in my comments, prepared remarks that in that part of the e-commerce channel, our sales are up 60% on a year ago, which outstrips the growth of the channel in general. And I think I said that we had increased our share of that channel by just over 100 basis points.
So I think that answers your question. If not..."

It's clear that over the last 12, 18 months, we perhaps had not as strong a program that, at least, the evidence would suggest that. But I think it's more about kind of operational excellence on some of our more basic initiatives. We just let our standards slip a little bit. I suppose I don't want to go into too much detail on it, if you'll forgive me for that.

So I think the key dynamic that will be influenced by all of this price discounting that we are seeing right now, and that I suspect people are right in saying we'll continue to see through '17, it's mainly influencing retail dynamics; in other words, the amount of inventory that people are pushing into the retail channel. And I suspect that we are going to see a lot of people being caught with very big fluctuations in sales as they need to adjust for inventory swings at some point in the economic cycle. I think it will influence different companies at different times. I think, to some degree, already within this quarter, you've seen relatively big fluctuations in the financial results announced by many of the companies in the industry. We've sort of prided ourselves on trying to keep our inventory relatively tight at the retail level. And we feel we've got very good visibility on what it is, and we are happy with the level of inventory we have in the channels. Some -- there are some quarters when that hurts our relative competitive performance as you look at it versus others, and there are some quarters where it perhaps helps us.

It's a great question, and obviously, one we had anticipated. And I think let's start by going back to Ken's -- to Ken Goldman's question about, so what should we expect in terms of EBIT accretion in 2017? And Michel's response that while we don't see EBIT accretion as we look at 2017 and that, of course, is really reflective of the comments I made about our expectations for both sales and EPS growth. And implicitly in that is the fact that there won't -- there's very unlikely to be EBIT margin accretion. So the question is in the face of some fairly significant progress against cost saving initiatives, why is that? And it really relates into -- it relates simply to the fact that we believe that it is in the long-term interest of our shareholders to continue to drive strong growth in China, and that requires continued investment. You will understand implicitly that some of the important initiatives that we have implemented in China were launched only approximately halfway through the year, 2016. So we'll have a full year impact of that higher level of spend in 2017. And then we believe we need to make additional investments in turning around market share in the U.S., which we also believe is in the long-term interest of the business. I do want to say that on the topic of margin accretion, it is -- it's an objective that is subservient to our primary objective, which is to turn around the growth trajectory of the business. So that's important to understand. It's also important to understand that where you will see that significant margin accretion occur is at the point in time that our growth rate picks up from the sort of very modest level that we are currently discussing. We clearly, at that point in time, have put a cost structure in place that will allow the company to get a great amount of EBIT leverage on any kind of growth in sales.

It's a question I ask our operators almost on a daily basis.

The increase of the EBIT margin in the U.S., we had a significant benefit from dairy, which gives a significant pressure on uplifting gross margin. So that's one area why we had an improved margin. In general, we'll see, as a total company, more gross margin pressure also in '17 as a result of dairy prices where we see some slightly increases that are coming in. So that also will have an effect on our U.S. business as such. In addition, like Kasper just said, we made a deliberate choice to step up additional investment in the U.S. from a demand-generating investment point of view, whether that's through A&P or whether that's from gross to net initiatives, and WIC could be one of them as one of the demand-generating investments. So we will see some pressure on EBIT margin. I think we won't see a level that we have currently. But I also don't expect that it will go to the levels that we have seen historically. I would say that we would see a midpoint between those EBIT margins."

So I think over time, we would expect to see gross margin come down to sort of normal levels. That's not all going to happen in 1 year. It's not all going to happen in '17.

Let me address your question on competitiveness first, and then I'll talk about -- then I'll reiterate what I said earlier about inventory. I see absolutely no reason why we should not be able to compete with either of the 2 companies that you mentioned in China. And indeed, we've done so successfully for many years. The China market is somewhat different from many of the other markets in the world that we compete in, in the sense that, frankly speaking, health care professional endorsement of your brand is far less influential in China than it is elsewhere in our -- in the world we operate in. So any potential disadvantage, which I'm not sure exists to begin with, vis-à-vis our U.S. competitor there, certainly is never being used as a reason for shortfalls by our local team in China and nor would it be accepted. You referenced our larger and more broad-based consumer products competitor, and I would only say to that, that again, the primary sales channel for these very high-priced products, high-quality products in China is really the baby store channel in China, and that's not a channel where your muscle and product range from other parts of the grocery industry can necessarily be leveraged very effectively. So again, I don't think we are at a significant disadvantage. Apart from what you would generally say is that obviously, we are a smaller company than either of those 2, and that means we can't leverage our cost base, our general infrastructure cost over a broader sales base. But despite that, it appears to me that we have got best-in-class EBIT margins. And I think we can maintain that while growing at the same time. On the inventory side in China, I just want to refer to what I said earlier. We are very comfortable with our inventory levels in the sales channels in China. We pride ourselves on not building up those inventories artificially from quarter-to-quarter. And hence, I don't expect, assuming that offtake develops the way we expect and anticipate, I don't expect that we're going to be seeing any changes to our sales trajectory that do not reflect underlying consumer demand."

Michel will then follow me by providing some additional and financial information, including comments on our cash flow related items.
I want to start today's discussion by revisiting our 3-year value creation plan. We laid out this plan at our Investor Day in October of 2015. And at that time, we explained how 2016 would be a year of transition.
We committed to 3 key metrics: a return to growth; a set of expense reductions; and a partial reinvestment of savings in growth initiatives and margin accretion. We said we'd measure our progress against these through the period. I've since revisited these metrics in every earnings call. So let me now briefly summarize our third quarter results in that context.
Firstly, in the third quarter, we delivered growth at the gross sales level of 1%. On a net sales basis, all 3 geographic segments delivered sales in line with prior year's quarter. This is an improvement over the previous 2 quarters. Excluding the effect of suspended shipments to Venezuela, net sales grew 1% in the third quarter over the prior year quarter.
Our second milestone relates to our targeted operating expense reductions. In our second quarter call, we revised our 2016 estimate from $60 million in reductions to $75 million to $80 million. Year-to-date, we've delivered $67 million in savings, and we've achieved approximately 85% of our annual target. SG&A expenses in the latest quarter were almost $20 million lower than a year earlier.
Our third milestone was to invest a portion of the expense savings to fund key growth initiatives while increasing our EBIT margin. Our investments have largely been supportive of our portfolio reshape and strategic channel shift in China. These initiatives are helping us report strong growth in China this quarter while simultaneously raising our EBIT margin.
Before I go into detail on our third quarter results, let me put these in context. The macroeconomic climate in North America and Europe appears stable. But in many emerging markets, we see consumers pressured by slowing economic growth. This applies broadly across Latin America and Asia and is consistent with what you have heard from other companies this earnings season.
Though my view of China, backed by recent economic data, is a little more positive than that of some others, there's little doubt that a pickup in economic activity in emerging markets will be linked to a recovery in demand for the exports in North America and Europe.
We also believe that the long-term category fundamentals are intact and remain supportive of our growth ambition. We believe that making the necessary and strategic investments now is critical to delivering on our 3-year road map of value creation.
Let me now expand on our third quarter results. For the third year running, we're experiencing foreign exchange headwinds. And for the second year in a row, economic challenges have combined with low dairy costs to produce a challenging pricing environment. Competitively, our results in the latest quarter were frankly mixed. We are facing a stiff challenge from competition in the United States. Conversely, we have good evidence that our China strategy is working. And there, we are strengthening our competitive position in growing channels. In aggregate, third quarter sales for the company were $938 million.
Currency adversely impacted our results by 4%. Constant dollar sales were in line with the third quarter of 2015, while reported sales were 4% lower than the prior year's quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of our intentionally reduced business in Venezuela, the company's net sales grew 1% in constant dollars over prior year.
While volume was 5% unfavorable, we saw a fully offsetting benefit from price and product mix of 5%. This, despite continued competitive pressure and low dairy costs.
Gross margin was strong and remains above our historical average, and we continued to invest against our priority initiatives, including the establishment of Enfinitas in China.
Total investment in advertising and promotion represented 17.3% of net sales in the quarter.
Our Fuel for Growth cost reductions initiative drove significant savings in SG&A costs. Overall, these costs, on a reported basis, were down 12% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of the prior year.
Our EBIT margin rose to 26.1% in the quarter as EBIT grew 9% in constant dollars.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.87 and similar to results in the proceeding 2 quarters.
I'll now discuss the performance of each of our reporting segments, beginning with our North America and Europe segment. Overall, results in this segment were mixed in the quarter. Market share gains in Canada and Europe resulting in strong sales growth there offset a disappointing quarter for our U.S. business. Net sales in the segment were in line with the third quarter of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. In aggregate, the segment benefited from a 5% pricing benefit, but this was fully offset by lower volumes in the United States. And foreign exchange adversely impacted sales for this segment by 1%.
Competitive pressure -- competitive activity put pressure on market share and resulted in a disappointing sales performance in our U.S. business. While we are actively addressing these challenges, we recognize that category dynamics are such that it'll take time to stabilize and recover lost market share.
I'm conscious that we've been referencing weakness in U.S. market share for a few quarters now. Unfortunately, we know the category is quite sticky, and to gain new consumers take time. We have a concrete action plan in place, but we must expect share to remain relatively weak through the next couple of quarters.
In the rest of the segment, I'm pleased with our progress. And we reported our highest market share in many years in Canada, as both Canada and Europe grew strongly in the quarter.
The Canadian business experienced strong growth in both its core infant formula business and the toddler category. And European sales of our energy products continued to grow on the back of a strengthened competitive position in a growing segment.
Let me now turn to Latin America. Segment performance continues to be heavily impacted by the suspension of sales to Venezuela. These shipments all but ceased at the end of 2015. Excluding this impact, sales in Latin America grew 5% in constant dollars over the same quarter of 2015. However, including the impact of Venezuela, constant dollar sales for the region were in line with the prior year's quarter. Pricing benefits of 10% did not fully offset foreign exchange impacts of negative 13%. And given the weakness in so many of the region's economies, we saw volume lower by 10%. Excluding Venezuela, volume was unfavorable by 5%.
With regard to Venezuela, there's been no significant change in circumstances. This situation will again negatively impact results in the coming quarter. But after that, the distorting effect should be negligible.
In Mexico, our infant and children's businesses delivered growth, and trends in other parts of Latin America remained broadly unchanged from the prior quarter. In much of South America, economic fundamentals remained weak, and we are seeing this reflected in consumer demand. Colombia and Peru provide isolated spots of relative economic stability.
I turn now to the Asia segment. Constant dollar sales in Asia were in line with the third quarter of 2015. Despite increased trade investments, price was favorable compared to the prior year quarter. Price increases in Southeast Asia, along with positive product mix in China, resulted in a 4% improvement in price within the segment. Volume was unfavorable by 4% driven by market share weakness and adjustment to channel inventories in the Philippines. Again, we have implemented a solid remediation plan there, and it's beginning to work. That said, it will take time to rebuild market share. And in the meantime, we've had to reduce channel inventory.
In Asia, price inflation remains low in a historical context.
I'll complete my discussion of our Asia segment with a few comments on China. In a sentence, our strategy to reshape our portfolio and strengthen performance in high-growth channels is working. Despite the decline in Hong Kong, sales within our greater China business grew strongly in the latest quarter. We saw improvements in both volume and product mix. Higher-priced new products are replacing sales of legacy lines. Consumers continue to adopt our fully imported product lines of Enfamil and Enfinitas at rapid rates, more than offsetting slowing demand for our locally manufactured products and shrinking exports from Hong Kong. Like many of our competitors, we are seeing the rapid shift in sales channels continue. But with the reshaped product portfolio, we've been able to adapt to this.
A few facts may help illustrate my point and put our results in context. The mainland supermarket channel declined double digits in the quarter. Our sales through our Hong Kong channel continued to decline and was down double digits within the quarter, but our sales into baby stores in Mainland China were up more than 20% on a year earlier. And our e-commerce sales were up more than 60%.
Our market share of company-controlled e-commerce channels increased by a full percentage point over prior year. And our recently launched imported product lines continue to grow market share each month. Imported products now account for 60% of total sales in Mainland China, up from 45% in March.
I think you can understand from this exactly how dynamic the trade environment is and how critical agility and flexibility are as core elements of our China strategy.
In conclusion, let me mention that our third quarter sales did benefit from replenishment of orders we were able -- we were unable to fulfill in the prior quarter due to tightened import processes. You'll remember that I mentioned this in our last call. However, underlying growth, excluding this benefit, was nevertheless healthy in China. China's results this quarter reflect the strategy we put in place 2 to 3 years ago to increase flexibilities through a broader product portfolio, sold through a more diverse set of channels.
This quarter, you can see that our strong organization and infrastructure in China has the ability to flex and adapt when challenged. Much work remains to be done, but I feel good about the latest quarter. I've deliberately not devoted any time to a description of our year-to-date sales. Though we've clearly hoped for a faster rebound in sales, we've seen a gradual, progressive improvement in our growth rate from quarter-to-quarter.
I now want to transition to talk about our global outlook for the balance of the year and beyond. While we saw strong growth in China, it's become clear that any sustained recovery in the broader emerging markets will take longer to occur than expected earlier. Additionally, market share losses in the Philippines and the United States are weighing on our current performance, and we do not expect to see these losses reversed until well into 2017.
In recognition of these challenges, we are revising our expectations for both sales and earnings per share. We now expect constant dollar sales for the full year 2016 to come in 2% to 3% below prior year, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in between $3.43 and $3.50. These numbers imply we continue to make progress in China in the fourth quarter and gradually improve sales in other geographies. We expect that the recent volatility and changing market dynamics will continue to impact our business in the midterm.
As we look beyond the next quarter to 2017, we expect to see continued but only modest improvement in constant dollar sales and to EPS. Our Fuel for Growth program will continue to help fund growth initiatives and mitigate known headwinds.
I'll now hand the call over to Michel who'll provide additional details on our third quarter financial performance. After that, I'll return with a few summary remarks before we take your questions. Michel, over to you."
1002291,367328587,1064769,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of the full year guidance. My com",1764,"Thank you, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss the company's third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. I will then briefly highlight cash flow and liquidity items and conclude with a summary of the full year guidance. My comments about sales will refer to net sales, unless I explicitly state gross sales. References to currency impacts or the effects of currency fluctuations generally refer to the impact on the translation of local currency financial statement into U.S. dollars.
Kathy already covered Slide 2, so let me start with sales on Slide 3. Slide 3 shows the improving trend of net sales on a constant dollar basis when compared to prior year periods. As Kasper already indicated, excluding the impact of reduced shipments to Venezuela, the company's net sales were 1% above the prior year quarter. The adverse impact of Venezuela will be less in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we significantly slowed shipments in the fourth quarter of 2015. The negative impact of Venezuela on our net sales is over 1% on a constant dollar basis.
Turning to Slide 4. Gross sales reflects sales to customers before trade investment and other items, which are recorded as gross to net sales adjustments. For the third quarter, gross sales were 1% above the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. A significant portion of this quarter growth came from China. This is the first time our gross sales returned to positive growth since the first quarter of 2015.
Net sales on a reported basis were 4% below the prior year quarter and 8% below on a year-to-date basis. The adverse impact of foreign exchange on sales was 4%. The U.S. dollar continued to be strong, and the effect on the translation of local currencies negatively impacted all reporting segments.
On Slide 5, the third quarter EBIT of $244 million was 9% above the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. Foreign exchange adversely impacted EBIT by 7%. Including currency impacts, EBIT increased 2% on a reported basis in the third quarter. The third quarter EBIT margin of 26.1% of sales was 160 basis points better than the prior year quarter. With sales nearly in line with the prior year, the benefit of lower dairy cost rolled through for a positive gross profit.
We continue to make strong progress to reduce operating expenses as part of our Fuel for Growth program, which allows continued investments while improving the underlying profitability. Year-to-date EBIT was $719 million, and we delivered positive growth of 2% above the previous year period on a constant dollar basis. The EBIT margin of 25.3% of sales was 80 basis points better than the prior year period. Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of 8%. Despite macroeconomic and country-specific challenges, which negatively impacted our sales, we benefited from low dairy cost and made excellent progress on realizing Fuel for Growth savings.
I will now move to factors that impacted gross margin on Slide 6. Gross margin was 64.6% in the third quarter of 2016. Adverse foreign currency impacted gross margin by 150 basis points in the quarter. We continued to deliver nearly flat gross margin on a reported basis despite the significantly currency headwinds we had. On a constant dollar basis, the gross margin percentage improved 120 basis points. Price/mix and gross to net adjustment had a slightly negative impact on gross margin, mainly from higher trade investments. Low dairy was the largest benefit to gross margin in the third quarter of 2016.
Within cost of goods sold, productivity savings continued to be strong. Projects for the full year have been identified, and we expect savings to be above our earlier estimate of 3.5% of cost of goods sold. When you compare the 3 months and the 9 months charts, you can see the key drivers are the same. As this year progressed, the dairy benefit is lower as we lap towards the lowest 2015 dairy cost comparison. The adverse foreign currency impact on gross margin in the third quarter is higher, mainly due to hedges. With dairy secured for the full year and larger productivity savings, we expect full year gross margin to be up to 64.5%, better than our previous guidance of 64%.
Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. The chart provides the combined spending of demand-generating investments, both as trade investment classified in gross to net sales adjustments and as advertising and promotion in operating expense category. The combined investments in the third quarter were above the prior year quarter. As a percentage of gross sales, the third quarter was similar to the second quarter as a result of increased investments to support our China strategy to become more competitive in the baby store and e-commerce channels with our Enfa imported and Enfinitas product lines.
Slide 8. We reduced our SG&A cost by 9% on a constant dollar basis in the third quarter of 2016 versus the previous year quarter and by 10% year-to-date compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we delivered $20 million savings in the fourth quarter of 2015. So in the fourth quarter of 2016, the year-over-year percentage reduction is likely to be smaller.
As you can see on Slide 9, year-to-date, we have achieved nearly 85% of this year's target. We now expect to realize savings toward the higher end of the $75 million to $80 million target range. In the corporate and other functions, we reduced our cost by $50 million year-to-date compared to prior year period. This is 3/4 of the year-to-date savings.
Turning to Slide 10 for a discussion of EBIT. Positive price/mix was offset by volume decline in all segments. The positive price/mix was mainly driven by a mix benefit as a result of the rollout of imported premium products in China, new innovations in several markets as well as price increases in markets to partly compensate for currency devaluations. All segments benefited from lower dairy and cost -- and cost productivity.
EBIT in Asia was lower due to higher trade investments. Promotional activities and advertising, which resulted in lower EBITDA loss and margin percentage in the third quarter. Our EBIT in both Latin America and North America improved. For Latin America, this was due to lower advertising and promotion expenses when compared to the prior year when we had higher expenses related to product launches.
For North America/Europe, SG&A cost savings helped fund investments and drove higher EBIT margins. Lower corporate and other expenses were most notably attributable to Fuel for Growth savings.
I will now address the financial results from EBIT to EPS on Slide 11. The interest expense of $26 million in the third quarter was in line with 2016 run rate. When compared to the prior year quarter, interest expense increase reflects the impact of the November 2015 $1.5 billion notes issuance. A significant portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to finance the accelerated repurchase program, or the ASR. The benefit of the ASR is reflected in the third quarter 2016 share count. There was no significant share repurchase in the third quarter.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 26% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 28.1% in the prior year quarter. In the third quarter of 2016, the ETR decrease was driven by tax credits from repatriation of foreign earnings, somewhat offset by change in allowances against tax assets. The prior year quarter was adversely impacted by an unfavorable geographic mix.
Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $0.87, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, non-GAAP EPS was $2.63, a 1% decrease from the prior year on a reported basis and an increase of 7% on a constant dollar basis.
Let me summarize our financial results by addressing the change to EPS on Slide 12. In the third quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.13 to $0.93 per share on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year quarter. Sales and related gross profit delivered a $0.03 benefit to EPS. The adverse impact of higher advertising and promotion was $0.04. Fuel for Growth savings delivered $0.07 benefit. The share repurchase programs delivered a $0.03 benefit, net of higher interest expense. And tax and other contributed a $0.03 benefit. Despite the negative impact of foreign exchange of $0.06 per share, EPS increased $0.07 versus third quarter last year on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning to a high-level overview of cash movements on Slide 13. The cash balance of $1.8 billion as of September 30 was $142 million higher than in the beginning of the year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by operating working capital. Our year-to-date CapEx investments were $110 million, mainly in our U.S. and operating in Europe manufacturing facilities, along with ongoing quality and planned enhancements globally. For the full year, our capital spending goal remains at 4% of sales. Dividend payments were $232 million in the 9 months of 2016. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange of $33 million was mainly related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
To summarize our forward-looking annual guidance on Slide 14, our sales outlook for 2016 on a constant dollar basis is expected to be 2% to 3% below the prior year. With foreign currency reducing sales growth by about 4%, reported sales are estimated to be 6% to 7% below 2015. The 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.87. And our non-GAAP guidance is $3.43 to $3.50 per share.
The guidance changed for the following reasons: sales on a constant currency basis may be lower due to the market share weakness in several markets, especially in the U.S., along with continued macroeconomic challenges in several emerging markets. Partially offsetting the sales impact, we expect gross margin to be up 64.5%, while Fuel for Growth savings is expected to be at the high end of the $75 million to $80 million range. And finally, the foreign exchange impact is expected to be approximately $0.30 per share from our previous guidance of $0.35 per share.
GAAP EPS guidance is likely to be impacted by potentially significant future mark-to-market pension adjustments, which cannot be estimated and are classified as specified items. Specified items include charges related to our Venezuela business, Fuel for Growth and year-to-date pension adjustments.
This concludes my discussion on the third quarter and 9 months 2016 financial results. Thank you again for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kasper."

In today's prepared remarks, we've discussed both the positive news from China as well a number of headwinds we will continue to tackle as we move into next year.
I want to acknowledge the difficulty we've had in accurately projecting our top line trajectory over the past 18 months in what is perhaps the most uncertain environment I've seen in nearly 20 years in the industry. The global economy has been weaker than we'd expected, and we are facing a strong challenge in the United States.
But before we open the lines to your questions, I want to take you back 3 years. Three years ago, when it first became obvious that our trajectory in China was changing, many of you, I'm sure, had doubts we could successfully navigate our way through the adaptations we needed to make. Today, I feel very proud of the way our people embraced the challenge and worked hard on implementation. We certainly have much work left in China and elsewhere, but we also have many more opportunities from which we can benefit. We've taken the first important steps, and we're on our way forward.
As was the case when we discussed our challenges in China, I feel confident that we can overcome the current challenges in Southeast Asia and the United States. Our organizations have proven that they can adjust and reverse trajectories and focus on identified issues.
Overall, the shape of our recovery remains broadly as outlined at our Investor Day in October 2015. Yes, the rate of improvement has been slower than we'd hoped for, but we are doing the right thing in focusing on innovation and execution, and we're on a positive path.
I'll now hand the call back to the operator, Liz, and ask her to open the lines to your questions. Liz, back to you."

It allows us to play much more effectively in the faster-growing channels, particularly the baby stores and the e-commerce channel. I think, in some cases, as I have acknowledged over the last couple of years, in some cases, we were slower than competitors to enter the super-high premium segment. So I mean, I'm very encouraged with the progress we are making in that business and how we are building share from month to month with quite substantial opportunities ahead of us to continue to grow, both through increased distribution and share gains. In other areas, I think we have probably been somewhat ahead of our competitors in focusing on the formal or company-organized e-commerce trade where some other competitors have relied quite heavily on kind of informal trade out of either Australia or Europe, which clearly is now being quite challenged by the changes to the regulatory environment, which I think we anticipated would happen. So our focus has always been on kind of the trade that -- the amount of the e-commerce trade that we feel we can control ourselves. And I referenced in my comments, prepared remarks that in that part of the e-commerce channel, our sales are up 60% on a year ago, which outstrips the growth of the channel in general. And I think I said that we had increased our share of that channel by just over 100 basis points.

It's clear that over the last 12, 18 months, we perhaps had not as strong a program that, at least, the evidence would suggest that. But I think it's more about kind of operational excellence on some of our more basic initiatives. We just let our standards slip a little bit. I suppose I don't want to go into too much detail on it, if you'll forgive me for that. But I think we have 2 or 3 things that we have clearly identified that we could and should have done better in the United States in the last 12 months or so, and we are clearly fixing them quickly.

So I think the key dynamic that will be influenced by all of this price discounting that we are seeing right now, and that I suspect people are right in saying we'll continue to see through '17, it's mainly influencing retail dynamics; in other words, the amount of inventory that people are pushing into the retail channel. And I suspect that we are going to see a lot of people being caught with very big fluctuations in sales as they need to adjust for inventory swings at some point in the economic cycle. I think it will influence different companies at different times. I think, to some degree, already within this quarter, you've seen relatively big fluctuations in the financial results announced by many of the companies in the industry. We've sort of prided ourselves on trying to keep our inventory relatively tight at the retail level. And we feel we've got very good visibility on what it is, and we are happy with the level of inventory we have in the channels. Some -- there are some quarters when that hurts our relative competitive performance as you look at it versus others, and there are some quarters where it perhaps helps us.

As you might imagine, nobody is, what shall we say, more sensitive around us referencing market share losses than I am. And certainly, it's not what we want to see. Having said that, we have a portfolio that is heavily exposed to, let's call it, 10 global businesses or 10 businesses around the world. It's inevitable that amongst those 10, you're going to have ups and downs. We've gained a lot of market share in Canada. We've gained a lot of market share in Europe. And I would argue, at the moment, we are gaining market share in China. Now unfortunately, if you have problems, market share-wise, and you have them in a couple of your really big markets, we both know that the U.S. and China, between the 2 of them, account for more than half our sales, our global sales. So it's very hard for us to offset any significant loss of market share in 1 of those 2 markets with performance in other markets. I'm certainly disappointed that we have not been able to proactively address some of these challenges as opposed to finding ourselves in the mode where we are, so to speak, reacting instead and adapting. I would obviously much rather be driving the change proactively. So your implied criticism is well taken. I don't think it's structural.

It's a great question, and obviously, one we had anticipated. And I think let's start by going back to Ken's -- to Ken Goldman's question about, so what should we expect in terms of EBIT accretion in 2017? And Michel's response that while we don't see EBIT accretion as we look at 2017 and that, of course, is really reflective of the comments I made about our expectations for both sales and EPS growth. And implicitly in that is the fact that there won't -- there's very unlikely to be EBIT margin accretion. So the question is in the face of some fairly significant progress against cost saving initiatives, why is that? And it really relates into -- it relates simply to the fact that we believe that it is in the long-term interest of our shareholders to continue to drive strong growth in China, and that requires continued investment. You will understand implicitly that some of the important initiatives that we have implemented in China were launched only approximately halfway through the year, 2016. So we'll have a full year impact of that higher level of spend in 2017. And then we believe we need to make additional investments in turning around market share in the U.S., which we also believe is in the long-term interest of the business. I do want to say that on the topic of margin accretion, it is -- it's an objective that is subservient to our primary objective, which is to turn around the growth trajectory of the business. So that's important to understand. It's also important to understand that where you will see that significant margin accretion occur is at the point in time that our growth rate picks up from the sort of very modest level that we are currently discussing. We clearly, at that point in time, have put a cost structure in place that will allow the company to get a great amount of EBIT leverage on any kind of growth in sales.

In general, we'll see, as a total company, more gross margin pressure also in '17 as a result of dairy prices where we see some slightly increases that are coming in. So that also will have an effect on our U.S. business as such. In addition, like Kasper just said, we made a deliberate choice to step up additional investment in the U.S. from a demand-generating investment point of view, whether that's through A&P or whether that's from gross to net initiatives, and WIC could be one of them as one of the demand-generating investments. So we will see some pressure on EBIT margin. I think we won't see a level that we have currently. But I also don't expect that it will go to the levels that we have seen historically. I would say that we would see a midpoint between those EBIT margins."

Let me address your question on competitiveness first, and then I'll talk about -- then I'll reiterate what I said earlier about inventory. I see absolutely no reason why we should not be able to compete with either of the 2 companies that you mentioned in China. And indeed, we've done so successfully for many years. The China market is somewhat different from many of the other markets in the world that we compete in, in the sense that, frankly speaking, health care professional endorsement of your brand is far less influential in China than it is elsewhere in our -- in the world we operate in. So any potential disadvantage, which I'm not sure exists to begin with, vis-à-vis our U.S. competitor there, certainly is never being used as a reason for shortfalls by our local team in China and nor would it be accepted. You referenced our larger and more broad-based consumer products competitor, and I would only say to that, that again, the primary sales channel for these very high-priced products, high-quality products in China is really the baby store channel in China, and that's not a channel where your muscle and product range from other parts of the grocery industry can necessarily be leveraged very effectively. So again, I don't think we are at a significant disadvantage. Apart from what you would generally say is that obviously, we are a smaller company than either of those 2, and that means we can't leverage our cost base, our general infrastructure cost over a broader sales base. But despite that, it appears to me that we have got best-in-class EBIT margins. And I think we can maintain that while growing at the same time. On the inventory side in China, I just want to refer to what I said earlier. We are very comfortable with our inventory levels in the sales channels in China. We pride ourselves on not building up those inventories artificially from quarter-to-quarter. And hence, I don't expect, assuming that offtake develops the way we expect and anticipate, I don't expect that we're going to be seeing any changes to our sales trajectory that do not reflect underlying consumer demand."
