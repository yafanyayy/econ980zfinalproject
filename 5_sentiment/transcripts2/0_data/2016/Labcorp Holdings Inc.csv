We delivered a strong operating performance and created the world's leading health care diagnostics company through the acquisition of Covance. We now have employees in approximately 60 countries, generate nearly 20% of our revenue from outside the United States and are well positioned to compete in a number of attractive global markets. Specifically, our addressable market now extends beyond roughly $70 billion North American clinical lab industry and includes global opportunities in our core laboratory business, drug development, food safety and market access. With the Covance acquisition, our company now competes worldwide in the growing addressable market of approximately $200 billion.
Our financial performance in 2015 reflects our larger footprint and broader capabilities. The combined organization delivered strong revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015 with nearly $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income, double-digit earnings growth and over $720 million in free cash flow. In 2016, we expect our free cash flow to exceed $900 million, with attractive opportunities to enhance our market position and create shareholder value through capital deployment. Our guidance reflects our confidence that LabCorp Diagnostics will deliver another strong year and that Covance Drug Development will continue its solid momentum into 2016. 
Our success is due to execution of our strategy to improve health and improve lives. Our execution on 3 key strategic objectives delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and changing the way care is provided led to these impressive results, reinforcing our conviction of our transformation that we undertook a year ago with the Covance acquisition. I will discuss these objectives and how we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace.
First is deliver world-class diagnostics, we focus on organic growth through introducing new tests to our existing customers as well as reaching new customers channels and markets. We also focused on integrating diagnostic information and content and continuing our industry leadership in scientific innovation. Finally, through disciplined capital deployment, we acquired complementary businesses that enhance our offerings. 
Last year, we expanded our test menu with the introduction of 75 new assays and accelerated Next Generation Sequencing capabilities. We experienced strong demand for our innovative decision-support tools, delivering over 5 million enhanced reports to help customers manage health and important conditions such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. We also added complementary capabilities through targeted tuck-in acquisition such as Safe Foods, a premier food safety laboratory that expands our size and reach in the fast-growing global food safety arena. In addition, we progressed on a number of important consumer-facing initiatives, including our Patient Portal, lab and envelope offering and consumer-initiated testing and remain enthusiastic about their long-term impact on our business. Our strength in science is highlighted by our differentiated capabilities and unparalleled experience in companion diagnostics, which provides a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the last 6 months, 3 very important oncology companion diagnostics received FDA approval. For each one, we were the exclusive laboratory to partner on the clinical trials and support the regulatory submissions. In addition, we are among the first labs to launch these tests for commercial distribution. Our ability to collaborate with sponsors at all stages of companion diagnostic developments for Covance and commercialization through LabCorp gives us the preferred offering that is improving the lives and health of patients and translate it into robust financial growth. Our companion diagnostics franchise achieved double-digit growth in 2015, and we remain confident that we will deliver $100 billion incremental revenue in companion diagnostics through 2018. 
For our second objective, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster, we are focused on commercialization of novel technology, helping partners rethink their global R&D decisions and disciplined capital deployment to build and acquire complementary capabilities. We collaborated on 87% of the 45 new drugs that were approved by FDA last year. Within oncology, we collaborated on 100% of the new drugs that were approved. It is noteworthy that these collaborations included all aspects of our full spectrum of drug development services from early development central lab to clinical. These outstanding results demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities and the power of our combined company to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions designed to improve the success of clinical trials, reduce development time lines and consistently deliver the highest quality services at a competitive price point.
Our differentiation extends to our combined central lab, which is recognized as the industry leader in revenue, scale, service, quality and breadth of test menu. During the quarter, this business grew double digits and secured a multiyear sole-source relationship with a large new customer, bringing great momentum as we move into 2016.
We continue to lead the industry in using patient data to improve trial recruitment. Through the end of 2015, we attribute over $130 million in new orders to our backlog due to the combination of LabCorp patient data and Covance's capabilities. Our success spans multiple indications including oncology and infectious disease and includes wins from both new and existing customers. In the fourth quarter, we began soliciting patient consent to be contacted about potential trials through our Patient Portal. The initial response to our outreach has been excellent as tens of thousands of patients have already consented, and we expect this database of patients to rapidly grow. This capability is unique and allows us to build a large cohort of potential candidates for clinical trials, Phase IV studies observational trials and a host of other real-world applications. It plainly highlights the power of our data and our combined entity. 
For our third objective, to change the way care is provided, we are focused on commercializing our innovative technology enabled solutions. We are pleased with the initial successes of BeaconLBS and accelerate monitoring. BeaconLBS uses technology to improve decision-making about laboratory test ordering at the point of care and began generating revenue in 2015. Accelerate monitoring leverages the power of actionable data to better manage clinical trials. And in 2015, we announced the landmark multi-year agreement to deploy this product as an exclusive central monitoring solution for our customers' worldwide trials. These solutions delivered great value to our partners in 2015, and we expect to expand our capabilities and utilization in 2016.
LabCorp looks very different from a year ago, and we have taken profound steps to transform our company and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. I am deeply appreciative and gratified by the focus, performance and enthusiasm that my 50,000 colleagues around the globe brought to our work throughout the past year. The acquisition of Covance created a unique business with extraordinary capabilities and significant global growth opportunities. Our execution has resulted in impressive and financially measurable progress on our strategy, and I expect this progress to continue in 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance drug development segments and conclude with our 2016 guidance.Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 bil",1578,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance drug development segments and conclude with our 2016 guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 48% over last year. The acquisition of Covance contributed $670 million during the quarter, driving 44% year-over-year revenue growth. The remainder of the increase was driven by organic volume growth across both core and esoteric testing as well as benefits from BeaconLBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions that were partially offset by currency.
Gross profit for the quarter was $741 million or 33% of revenue compared to $547 million or 36.1% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to the acquisition of Covance as well as price mix, organic volume and the benefits of Project LaunchPad, partially offset by personnel cost and currency. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact of Covance. Excluding Covance, gross margin would've increased 10 basis points over last year. 
SG&A for the quarter was $405 million or 18% of revenue compared to $310 million or 20.5% last year. Excluding special charges of $32 million primarily related to the acquisition of Covance and legal costs, SG&A in the quarter was $373 million or 16.6% of revenue, a 300 basis point reduction versus last year's suggested SG&A. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to Covance, personnel cost and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by Project LaunchPad savings. The reduction in SG&A as a percent of revenue benefited from Covance's lower SG&A rate. Excluding Covance, SG&A would've improved 20 basis points over last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $54 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to Covance. Amortization expense for the quarter was $38 million, up from $15 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions. Operating income for the quarter was $244 million or 10.8% of revenue compared to $219 million or 14.5% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $125 million, adjusted operating income was $368 million or 16.4% of revenue compared to $250 million or 16.5% last year.
Excluding the mix impact from Covance, adjusted operating margin would have increased 20 basis points over last year.
Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $32 million last year. The increase was due to higher debt balances due to the acquisition of Covance. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.5%, higher than last year's 36.1% rate due to the taxable nature of certain restructuring charges. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1% compared to 36.5% last year as we benefited from Covance, which has a higher percentage of its earnings generated in lower tax rate foreign jurisdictions. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 35.3%, and we expect the rate in 2016 to be comparable. As a result, net earnings for the quarter were $114 million or $1.11 per diluted share compared to $120 million or 1.39% per share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $1.98 in the quarter, up 20% from $1.65 last year.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $385 million compared to $214 million last year with the increase due to the acquisition of Covance as well as favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $85 million, up from $46 million last year, primarily due to Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $300 million compared to $167 million last year, bringing our full year free cash flow to $727 million. Excluding net nonrecurring acquisition items of approximately $110 million, our full year free cash flow would've been $837 million.
Our cash balance at year-end was $716 million compared to $713 million at the end of the third quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. During the quarter, we invested $43 million in acquisitions and paid down $250 million of debt, reducing the company's leverage to 3.6x debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are presented on a pro forma basis for all periods as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2014 and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses.
During the quarter, we our methodology for the calculation of unallocated corporate expenses, which impacts our LabCorp Diagnostics segments results and has been applied to prior periods for comparative purposes. As a result, LabCorp Diagnostics operating expenses increased by $8.5 million in the quarter and would've increased $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Conversely, unallocated corporate expenses were reduced by $8.5 million in the quarter and would've been reduced by $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reconciliations of segments results historically reported segment results are included in today's press release in the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review our performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 4.3% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, BeaconLBS price mix and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. The increase in revenue of 4.3% includes the benefit from BeaconLBS of 1.1% and an unfavorable currency translation of 0.8%. Revenue per acquisition increased 2.2%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing revenue grew at a faster rate than core testing revenue. Total volume increased by 1.8%, of which organic volume was 1.6% and acquisition volume was 0.2%. LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $293 million or 18.9% of revenue compared to $273 million or 18.4% last year. The increase was primarily due to volume, price mix and productivity, partially offset by personnel costs. Improvement in productivity was driven by Project LaunchPad, which delivered approximately $20 million of net savings during the quarter, bringing our full year total to $65 million. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million goal and estimate that the remaining LaunchPad savings will be achieved equally over the next 2 years.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $691 million, an increase of 4.7% over last year. The stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 230 basis points. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7% over last year. In addition, the anticipated expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement on October 31 impacted revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Excluding this item, constant currency revenue would've increased 9% over last year.
Covance Drug Development had strong revenue growth across all of its businesses, led by central lab. In addition to revenue growth rate in the clinical business improved from the third quarter as did the rate in early development when excluding the impact from the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement. Adjusted operating income was $110 million or 16.0% of revenue compared to $90 million or 13.6% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to increased demand as well as productivity and cost synergies, partially offset by personnel costs. We captured approximately $15 million of cost synergies during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $45 million. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $100 million: goal and estimate that the remaining cost synergies will be achieved equally over the next 2 years.
Net orders during the quarter were $816 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.18 while backlog at year-end was $6.7 billion. The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill was 1.23.
Now I'll review our 2016 guidance, which assumes January 31 foreign exchange rates for all of 2016. On a consolidated reported basis, we expect net revenue growth of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2015 net revenue of $8.5 billion after the impact from approximately 100 basis points of negative currency. We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 3.5% to 5.5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $6.2 billion after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 2% to 5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $2.6 billion after the impact from approximately 200 basis points in negative currency. The expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement will negatively Covance's 2016 growth rate by approximately 260 basis points. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, net revenue is expected to increase 6.6% to 9.6%.
Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is $8.45 to $8.85, an increase of 7% to 12% over 2015. We expect the distribution of earnings in 2016 to be similar to 2015 as our results in the first and fourth quarters are typically impacted by inclement weather and holidays. Our adjusted EPS guidance includes the impact of currency and an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. We expect free cash flow to be between $900 million and $950 million, up from $727 million in 2015 and expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of net revenue, consistent with 2015. In summary, we are enthusiastic about our prospects for 2016 and expect strong top line growth and margin improvement to drive strong year-over-year earnings per share growth and robust free cash flow.

As we mentioned, tens of thousands of patients have already agreed to be recontacted. It gives us a deep base of patients to -- that we can contact for potential trials will be a differentiator in terms of winning -- winning revenue over time, winning commitments from sponsors over time. Obviously, central lab is very, very strong in the quarter and very pleased with the growth and the momentum that we have going into the year, and we saw nice improvement in revenue in the clinical business. We saw -- I think we're seeing very good success in our early development solutions. And I would highlight again the companion diagnostics and our success in companion diagnostics. Nobody else can say that they had -- that they were the exclusive lab on the 3 key oncology -- immuno-oncology drugs that were approved in the market over the last 6 months. Nobody else can say they worked on 87% of the drugs that were approved or 100% of the oncology drugs. It's just something that completely sets us apart from the market. So what gets us to the high end -- what gets us to the high end would be stronger performance in the clinical business. And obviously, the mix of business wins, because longer, more complex trials that pay us a longer stream of revenue with a better mix will lead to more profit, and that will get us to the higher end of the revenue range and, obviously, help us also towards the higher end of the EPS range. So I said a lot there but Deb, if you have anything to add, happy to have you add as well."

So let me start by saying that monetizing the data in itself has never been an aspiration for LabCorp. We don't view data sales as -- it's not going to generate enough revenue to materially help us, and it's not what we want to do strategically. What we want to do is we want to use some data to further the strategy, and the strategy, obviously, is to execute on our 3 core goals, which is delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing innovative fast and moving technology-enabled solutions to change the way the carriers deliver it. What I see in getting patient consent through the Patient Portal is we have patients who come to us for lab testing. They come to the patient to get the results. When they come to the portal, we are now addressing the patient population in a place that we've never before and no one else is adjusting them to say. Given your diagnosis, given what you know about you would you be interested in being contacted in the event there was a study that could potentially improve your own health or could improve the health of the population as a whole, and the response is been very positive. And as I said, we launched it in 4Q, tens of thousands of patients have encountered the prompt. A lot have said yes. Some said no. We're working on figuring out how we can improve the yes rate. But again, this is not as simple as when you go to download an update to your Apple phone and you either say yes and you get it or no, you don't. There's been a rigorous compliance review, there is -- there are protections around how we present this to the patient, and we ask them and we've gone through a very thorough review to make sure were doing this in a way that is going to be protective of the patient's privacy and our responsibility to honor that. Now again, what does that lead to? It leads to a large database of patients, which can be accessed from a variety of things: clinical studies, Phase IV, observational studies, reaching out to patients to ask them questions about medication use or medication adherence, so just a whole variety of areas in which we think this becomes a differentiating factor because we have the patient's consent to recontact that. So I would contrast that with an anecdote that was told to me recently, which is a patient got a letter in the mail from a pharmacy saying since you're taking this drug, would you like to be in this trial. The patient was taking the drug for a completely different reason and was annoyed by the letter because the patient had never given the pharmacy permission to write them letters and ask them about what they want to do because of their use of drug. We get the patient's consent beforehand before we have a recontact and we ask for it. And as a result, I think we're going to have a very a cohort that's going to be very interested and how they might participate and sure in the long run the goal is that would lead us to more bookings and that lead us to more opportunity to show sponsors that we have a good patient cohort available when they start recruiting and would lead to more revenue and growth."

So now we're competing in the core lab business but on a global basis, we're competing in drug development, we're competing in market access, we're competing in food safety. So we should think about our appetite for acquisitions as spanning all of those businesses potentially. Now a couple of caveats, the likelihood of us doing a sizable ex- U.S. clinical laboratory acquisition is relatively small just because we're much more likely to think about doing that, doing ex U.S. clinical laboratory now that we have a global footprint by building as opposed to acquiring. So we certainly are looking at global expansion opportunities in the clinical lab business but they wouldn't put that at the top of a list from an M&A perspective. What I would put at the top of the list is tuck-in acquisitions in the lab -- the clinical lab business, acquisitions in the food business, acquisitions in drug development, acquisitions in market access, all of which we'll look at through the lens of what's our return on invested capital, how does it strategically contribute to our key priorities and what are the valuations relative to other opportunities for deployment of capital."

And realistically, we're at the end of February. The rule has not been finalized. It's hard for me to imagine how this could be implemented in January of 2017 in the way that would be fair to our industry. So that's the view on PAMA. On FDA, we continue to work closely with Congress and attempting to work with the FDA as well on a solution that would be legislative solution that would bring clarity to the whatever regulation there's going to be of lab developed test, and it would not be dependent on some regulatory guidance as a proposed long-term solution. And we feel -- again, we've been very clear about this. We feel very strongly that guidance is the wrong way to go about this, and we will continue to oppose that path."

We delivered a strong operating performance and created the world's leading healthcare diagnostics company through the acquisition of Covance. We now have employees in approximately 60 countries, generate nearly 20% of our revenue from outside the United States and are well positioned to compete in a number of attractive global markets. Specifically, our addressable market now extends beyond the roughly $70 billion North American clinical lab industry and includes global opportunities in our core laboratory business, drug development, food safety and market access. With the Covance acquisition, our company now competes worldwide in the growing addressable market of approximately $200 billion.
Our financial performance in 2015 reflects our larger footprint and broader capabilities. The combined organization delivered strong revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015 with nearly $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income, double-digit earnings growth and over $720 million in free cash flow. In 2016, we expect our free cash flow to exceed $900 million, with attractive opportunities to enhance our market position and create shareholder value through capital deployment. Our guidance reflects our confidence that LabCorp Diagnostics will deliver another strong year and that Covance Drug Development will continue its solid momentum into 2016. 
Our success is due to execution of our strategy to improve health and improve lives. Our execution on 3 key strategic objectives delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and changing the way care is provided led to these impressive results, reinforcing our conviction in the transformation that we undertook a year ago with the Covance acquisition. I will discuss these objectives and how we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace.
First, to deliver world-class diagnostics, we focused on organic growth through introducing new tests to our existing customers as well as to reaching new customers, channels and markets. We also focused on integrating diagnostic information and content, and continuing our industry leadership in scientific innovation. Finally, through disciplined capital deployment, we acquired complementary businesses that enhance our offerings. 
Last year, we expanded our test menu with the introduction of 75 new assays and accelerated Next-Generation Sequencing capabilities. We experienced strong demand for our innovative decision support tools, delivering over 5 million enhanced reports to help customers manage health and important conditions such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. We also added complementary capabilities through targeted tuck-in acquisitions such as Safe Foods, a premier food safety laboratory that expands our size and reach in the fast-growing global food safety arena. In addition, we progressed on a number of important consumer-facing initiatives, including our Patient Portal, lab and envelope offering and consumer-initiated testing, and we remain enthusiastic about their long-term impact on our business. 
Our strength in science is highlighted by our differentiated capabilities and unparalleled experience in companion diagnostics, which provides a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the last 6 months, 3 very important oncology companion diagnostics received FDA approval. For each one, we were the exclusive laboratory to partner on the clinical trials and support the regulatory submissions. In addition, we are among the first labs to launch these tests for commercial distribution. Our ability to collaborate with sponsors at all stages of companion diagnostic developments through Covance and commercialization through LabCorp gives us the preferred offering that is improving the lives and health of patients and translating to robust financial growth. Our companion diagnostics franchise achieved double-digit growth in 2015, and we remain confident that we will deliver $100 billion in incremental revenue in companion diagnostics through 2018. 
For our second objective, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster, we are focused on commercialization of novel technology, helping partners rethink their global R&D decisions and disciplined capital deployment to build and acquire complementary capabilities. We collaborated on 87% of the 45 new drugs that were approved by FDA last year. Within oncology, we collaborated on 100% of the new drugs that were approved. It is noteworthy that these collaborations included all aspects of our full spectrum of drug development services from early development to central lab to clinical. These outstanding results demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities and the power of our combined company to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions designed to improve the success of clinical trials, reduce development timelines and consistently deliver the highest quality services at a competitive price point.
Our differentiation extends to our combined central lab, which is recognized as the industry leader in revenue, scale, service, quality and breadth of test menu. During the quarter, this business grew double digits and secured a multi-year sole-source relationship with a large new customer, bringing great momentum as we move into 2016.
We continue to lead the industry in using patient data to improve trial recruitment. Through the end of 2015, we attribute over $130 million in new orders to our backlog due to the combination of LabCorp patient data and Covance's capabilities. Our success spans multiple indications including oncology and infectious disease and includes wins from both new and existing customers. 
In the fourth quarter, we began soliciting patient consent to be contacted about potential trials through our Patient Portal. The initial response to our outreach has been excellent as tens of thousands of patients have already consented, and we expect this database of patients to rapidly grow. This capability is unique and allows us to build a large cohort of potential candidates for clinical trials, Phase IV studies, observational trials and a host of other real-world applications. It plainly highlights the power of our data and our combined entity. 
For our third objective, to change the way care is provided, we are focused on commercializing our innovative technology-enabled solutions. We are pleased with the initial successes of BeaconLBS and accelerate monitoring. BeaconLBS uses technology to improve decision-making about laboratory test ordering at the point of care and began generating revenue in 2015. Accelerate monitoring leverages the power of actionable data to better manage clinical trials. And in 2015, we announced the landmark multi-year agreement to deploy this product as an exclusive central monitoring solution for our customers' worldwide trials. These solutions delivered great value to our partners in 2015, and we expect to expand their capabilities and utilization in 2016.
LabCorp looks very different from a year ago, and we have taken profound steps to transform our company and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. I am deeply appreciative and gratified by the focus, performance and enthusiasm that my 50,000 colleagues around the globe brought to our work throughout the past year. The acquisition of Covance created a unique business with extraordinary capabilities and significant global growth opportunities. Our execution has resulted in impressive and financially measurable progress on our strategy, and I expect this progress to continue in 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."
30643,323601651,935811,"Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Labcorp Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with our 2016 guidance.Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 b",1588,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with our 2016 guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 48% over last year. The acquisition of Covance contributed $670 million during the quarter, driving 44% year-over-year revenue growth. The remainder of the increase was driven by organic volume growth across both core and esoteric testing as well as benefits from BeaconLBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions that were partially offset by currency.
Gross profit for the quarter was $741 million or 33% of revenue compared to $547 million or 36.1% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to the acquisition of Covance as well as price mix, organic volume and the benefits of Project LaunchPad, partially offset by personnel costs and currency. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact of Covance. Excluding Covance, gross margin would have increased 10 basis points over last year. 
SG&A for the quarter was $405 million or 18% of revenue compared to $310 million or 20.5% last year. Excluding special charges of $32 million primarily related to the acquisition of Covance and legal costs, SG&A in the quarter was $373 million or 16.6% of revenue, a 300 basis point reduction versus last year's adjusted SG&A. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to Covance, personnel costs and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by Project LaunchPad savings. The reduction in SG&A as a percent of revenue benefited from Covance's lower SG&A rate. Excluding Covance, SG&A would have improved 20 basis points over last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $54 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to Covance. Amortization expense for the quarter was $38 million, up from $15 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions. Operating income for the quarter was $244 million or 10.8% of revenue compared to $219 million or 14.5% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $125 million, adjusted operating income was $368 million or 16.4% of revenue compared to $250 million or 16.5% last year. Excluding the mix impact from Covance, adjusted operating margin would have increased 20 basis points over last year.
Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $32 million last year. The increase was due to higher debt balances due to the acquisition of Covance. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.5%, higher than last year's 36.1% rate due to the taxable nature of certain restructuring charges. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1% compared to 36.5% last year as we benefited from Covance, which has a higher percentage of its earnings generated in lower tax rate foreign jurisdictions. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 35.3%, and we expect the rate in 2016 to be comparable. As a result, net earnings for the quarter were $114 million or $1.11 per diluted share compared to $120 million or 1.39% per share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $1.98 in the quarter, up 20% from $1.65 last year.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $385 million compared to $214 million last year with the increase due to the acquisition of Covance as well as favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $85 million, up from $46 million last year, primarily due to Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $300 million compared to $167 million last year, bringing our full year free cash flow to $727 million. Excluding net nonrecurring acquisition items of approximately $110 million, our full year free cash flow would have been $837 million.
Our cash balance at year-end was $716 million compared to $713 million at the end of the third quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. During the quarter, we invested $43 million in acquisitions and paid down $250 million of debt, reducing the company's leverage to 3.6x debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are presented on a pro forma basis for all periods as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2014 and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses.
During the quarter, we refined our methodology for the calculation of unallocated corporate expenses, which impacts our LabCorp Diagnostics segment results and has been applied to prior periods for comparative purposes. As a result, LabCorp Diagnostics operating expenses increased by $8.5 million in the quarter and would have increased $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Conversely, unallocated corporate expenses were reduced by $8.5 million in the quarter and would have been reduced by $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 4.3% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, BeaconLBS price mix and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. The increase in revenue of 4.3% includes the benefit from BeaconLBS of 1.1% and an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.8%. Revenue per acquisition increased 2.2%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing revenue grew at a faster rate than core testing revenue. Total volume increased by 1.8%, of which organic volume was 1.6% and acquisition volume was 0.2%. LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $293 million or 18.9% of revenue compared to $273 million or 18.4% last year. The increase was primarily due to volume, price mix and productivity, partially offset by personnel costs. Improvement in productivity was driven by Project LaunchPad, which delivered approximately $20 million of net savings during the quarter, bringing our full year total to $65 million. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million goal and estimate that the remaining LaunchPad savings will be achieved equally over the next 2 years.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $691 million, an increase of 4.7% over last year. The stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 230 basis points. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7% over last year. In addition, the anticipated expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement on October 31 impacted revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Excluding this item, constant currency revenue would have increased 9% over last year.
Covance Drug Development had strong revenue growth across all of its businesses, led by central lab. In addition to revenue growth rate in the clinical business improved from the third quarter as did the rate in early development when excluding the impact from the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement. Adjusted operating income was $110 million or 16.0% of revenue compared to $90 million or 13.6% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to increased demand as well as productivity and cost synergies, partially offset by personnel costs. We captured approximately $15 million of cost synergies during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $45 million. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $100 million: goal and estimate that the remaining cost synergies will be achieved equally over the next 2 years.
Net orders during the quarter were $816 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.18 while backlog at year-end was $6.7 billion. The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill was 1.23.
Now I'll review our 2016 guidance, which assumes January 31 foreign exchange rates for all of 2016. On a consolidated reported basis, we expect net revenue growth of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2015 net revenue of $8.5 billion after the impact from approximately 100 basis points of negative currency. We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 3.5% to 5.5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $6.2 billion after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 2% to 5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $2.6 billion after the impact from approximately 200 basis points of negative currency. The expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement will negatively impact Covance's 2016 growth rate by approximately 260 basis points. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, net revenue is expected to increase 6.6% to 9.6%.
Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is $8.45 to $8.85, an increase of 7% to 12% over 2015. We expect the distribution of earnings in 2016 to be similar to 2015 as our results in the first and fourth quarters are typically impacted by inclement weather and holidays. Our adjusted EPS guidance includes the impact of currency and an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. We expect free cash flow to be between $900 million and $950 million, up from $727 million in 2015 and expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of net revenue, consistent with 2015. In summary, we are enthusiastic about our prospects for 2016 and expect strong top line growth and margin improvement to drive strong year-over-year earnings per share growth and robust free cash flow.
This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll now take questions. Operator?"

We saw nice revenue per requisition improvement year-over-year in the quarter and for the third quarter in a row. And as Glenn identified in his remarks, that's a combination of test mix and core -- esoteric growing faster than core and the benefit of some tuck-in acquisitions that brought us some higher pricing. So generally pleased with the overall pricing and reimbursement environment and pleased with obviously the improvement in revenue per requisition in the quarter."

So with respect to the revenue synergies, as we indicated on the call, now over $130 million and what we described as category 1, which is the use of the patient data, and I continue to be quite optimistic about that given the success that we've had with the patient recruitment through the Patient Portal. As we mentioned, tens of thousands of patients have already agreed to be recontacted. It gives us a deep base of patients to -- that we can contact for potential trials, which I think will be a differentiator in terms of winning revenue over time, winning commitments from sponsors over time. Obviously, central lab is very, very strong in the quarter and very pleased with the growth and the momentum that we have going into the year, and we saw a nice improvement in revenue in the clinical business. We saw -- I think we're seeing very good success in our early development solutions. And I would highlight again the companion diagnostics and our success in companion diagnostics. Nobody else can say that they had -- that they were the exclusive lab on the 3 key oncology -- immuno-oncology drugs that were approved in the market over the last 6 months. Nobody else can say they worked on 87% of the drugs that were approved or on 100% of the oncology drugs. It's just something that completely sets us apart from the market. So what gets us to the high end -- what gets us to the high end would be stronger performance in the clinical business. And obviously, the mix of business wins, because longer, more complex trials that pay us a longer stream of revenue with a better mix will lead to more profit, and that will get us to the higher end of the revenue range and, obviously, help us also towards the higher end of the EPS range. So I said a lot there but, Deb, if you have anything to add, happy to have you add as well."

It hasn't been a secret, and that's been the case. I think if you look sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, taking into account the differential and the number of days in the quarter, that volume per day was actually quite consistent. And so we're pleased with the volume, and we're pleased with the organic volume growth that we delivered throughout 2015. For 2016, I think our volume projections and obviously, we've seen some things coming out of hospitals that suggest that hospital volumes have been bouncing around. But I think our volume projections for 2016 suggest that we would expect to see a continuation of what we've kind of seen here in 3Q and 4Q, absent some large contract win or some shift in the marketplace. You're going to see volume, organic volume continue to grow at kind of this 1.5% to 2% rate, depending on ups and downs and ins and outs. So I think we've been obviously delivering very, very solid volume growth, and we expect to continue to do so. And in particular, proud of the fact that the great majority of that volume growth is coming from organic growth, which means the introduction of new tests, our sales efforts and our organizational leadership is extremely effective.

Margins overall were up around 110 basis points year-over-year. 47% leverage on the incremental revenues is pretty strong on a pro forma basis. That improvement in margins was across both gross profit and SG&A. So when we talked about the margin improvement that we had, excluding Covance to show that it was a mix impact when you look at both segments on a pro forma basis, you actually see both segments seeing a very strong margin growth. So we characterize it as the pretty strong year, benefiting from the strong demand, benefiting from price mix, if you will, benefiting from the tuck-ins, benefiting from our LaunchPad initiative, our synergy initiative on the Covance side.

On capital allocation, we have said many times that our target leverage is 2.5x. That is only a target. We are always going to be flexible in terms of looking at how we allocate capital. We do expect that by the second half of the year, we will certainly be in a position to consider returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase.

So let me start by saying that monetizing the data in and of itself has never been something that's been an aspiration for LabCorp. We don't view data sales as -- it's not going to generate enough revenue to materially help us, and it's not what we want to do strategically. What we want to do is we want to use the data to further the strategy. And the strategy, obviously, is to execute on our 3 core goals, which is delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using technology-enabled solutions to change the way the carriers deliver. What I see in getting patient consent through the Patient Portal is we have patients who come to us for lab testing. They come to the Patient Portal to get their results. When they come to the portal, we are now addressing the patient population in a place that we have never addressed them before and that no one else is addressing them to say, ""Given your diagnosis, given what we know about you, would you be interested in being contacted in the event there was a study that could potentially improve your own health or could improve the health of the population as a whole?"" And the response has been very positive. And as I say, we launched it in 4Q, tens of thousands of patients have encountered the prompt. A lot have said yes. Some have said no. We're working on figuring out how we can improve the yes rate. And again, this is not as simple as when you go to download an update to your Apple phone and you either say yes and you get it or no, you don't. There's been a rigorous compliance review. There's a -- there are protections around how we present this to the patient and what we ask them and we've gone through a very thorough review to make sure that we're doing this in the way that is going to be protective of the patient's privacy and our responsibility to honor that. Now again, what does that lead to? It leads to a large database of patients, which can be accessed from a variety of things: clinical studies, Phase IV, observational studies, reaching out to patients to ask them questions about medication use or medication adherence, so just a whole variety of areas in which we think this becomes a differentiating factor because we have the patient's consent to recontact them. So I would contrast that with an anecdote that was told to me recently, which is a patient got a letter in the mail from a pharmacy saying ""since you're taking this drug, would you like to be in this trial?"" So the patient was taking the drug for a completely different reason and was annoyed by the letter because the patient had never given the pharmacy permission to write them letters and ask them about what they want to do because of their use of drugs. We get the patient's consent beforehand before we have to recontact them and we ask for it. And as a result, I think we're going to have a very a cohort that's going to be very interested in how they might participate and sure in the long run, it's -- the goal is that would lead us to more bookings, it would lead us to more opportunity to show sponsors that we have a good patient cohort available when they start recruiting and would lead to more revenue and growth."

I think, Dave, in the past, you said that the period of time for trial startups was extended by around 6 to 12 months. So can you just give us an update on where you're at now and have we kind of like -- have you normalized kind of like your book of new starts? And is this going to be sort of a headwind to revenue conversion in '16 and beyond, or are we now at a steady state?"

So on PAMA, we have not heard anything further. Obviously, there were some very positive developments from our perspective in terms of strong letters going from the House, from the Senate and from the chair and ranking member of the Finance Committee, encouraging both the inclusion of at least the selection of key hospital labs as well as a delay in the implementation of PAMA. We continue to believe that the inclusion of key hospital labs is absolutely vital to accomplish the congressional purpose, which was a market-based price for Medicare. And realistically, we're at the end of February. The rule has not been finalized. It's hard for me to imagine how this could be implemented in January of 2017 in a way that would be fair to our industry. So that's the view on PAMA. On FDA, we continue to work closely with Congress and attempting to work with the FDA as well on a solution that would be a legislative solution that would bring clarity to the whatever regulation there's going to be of lab developed test and that would not be dependent on sub-regulatory guidance as a proposed long-term solution. And we feel, again, we've been very clear about this. We feel very strongly that guidance is the wrong way to go about this, and that we will continue to oppose that path."

It just stops us getting paid for it. So I don't think that has a significant impact on volume. We've always faced competition from hospitals. I actually think that it's been really about 3 years since we saw the huge shift in hospitals buying up physician practices and in-sourcing them.

I think we're outperforming the other healthcare services providers in terms of organic volume growth.

We delivered a strong operating performance and created the world's leading healthcare diagnostics company through the acquisition of Covance. We now have employees in approximately 60 countries, generate nearly 20% of our revenue from outside the United States and are well positioned to compete in a number of attractive global markets. Specifically, our addressable market now extends beyond the roughly $70 billion North American clinical lab industry and includes global opportunities in our core laboratory business, drug development, food safety and market access. With the Covance acquisition, our company now competes worldwide in the growing addressable market of approximately $200 billion.
Our financial performance in 2015 reflects our larger footprint and broader capabilities. The combined organization delivered strong revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015 with nearly $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income, double-digit earnings growth and over $720 million in free cash flow. In 2016, we expect our free cash flow to exceed $900 million, with attractive opportunities to enhance our market position and create shareholder value through capital deployment. Our guidance reflects our confidence that LabCorp Diagnostics will deliver another strong year and that Covance Drug Development will continue its solid momentum into 2016. 
Our success is due to execution of our strategy to improve health and improve lives. Our execution on 3 key strategic objectives delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and changing the way care is provided led to these impressive results, reinforcing our conviction in the transformation that we undertook a year ago with the Covance acquisition. I will discuss these objectives and how we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace.
First, to deliver world-class diagnostics, we focused on organic growth through introducing new tests to our existing customers as well as to reaching new customers, channels and markets. We also focused on integrating diagnostic information and content, and continuing our industry leadership in scientific innovation. Finally, through disciplined capital deployment, we acquired complementary businesses that enhance our offerings. 
Last year, we expanded our test menu with the introduction of 75 new assays and accelerated Next-Generation Sequencing capabilities. We experienced strong demand for our innovative decision support tools, delivering over 5 million enhanced reports to help customers manage health and important conditions such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. We also added complementary capabilities through targeted tuck-in acquisitions such as Safe Foods, a premier food safety laboratory that expands our size and reach in the fast-growing global food safety arena. In addition, we progressed on a number of important consumer-facing initiatives, including our Patient Portal, lab and envelope offering and consumer-initiated testing, and we remain enthusiastic about their long-term impact on our business. 
Our strength in science is highlighted by our differentiated capabilities and unparalleled experience in companion diagnostics, which provides a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the last 6 months, 3 very important oncology companion diagnostics received FDA approval. For each one, we were the exclusive laboratory to partner on the clinical trials and support the regulatory submissions. In addition, we are among the first labs to launch these tests for commercial distribution. Our ability to collaborate with sponsors at all stages of companion diagnostic developments through Covance and commercialization through LabCorp gives us the preferred offering that is improving the lives and health of patients and translating to robust financial growth. Our companion diagnostics franchise achieved double-digit growth in 2015, and we remain confident that we will deliver $100 billion in incremental revenue in companion diagnostics through 2018. 
For our second objective, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster, we are focused on commercialization of novel technology, helping partners rethink their global R&D decisions and disciplined capital deployment to build and acquire complementary capabilities. We collaborated on 87% of the 45 new drugs that were approved by FDA last year. Within oncology, we collaborated on 100% of the new drugs that were approved. It is noteworthy that these collaborations included all aspects of our full spectrum of drug development services from early development to central lab to clinical. These outstanding results demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities and the power of our combined company to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions designed to improve the success of clinical trials, reduce development timelines and consistently deliver the highest quality services at a competitive price point.
Our differentiation extends to our combined central lab, which is recognized as the industry leader in revenue, scale, service, quality and breadth of test menu. During the quarter, this business grew double digits and secured a multi-year sole-source relationship with a large new customer, bringing great momentum as we move into 2016.
We continue to lead the industry in using patient data to improve trial recruitment. Through the end of 2015, we attribute over $130 million in new orders to our backlog due to the combination of LabCorp patient data and Covance's capabilities. Our success spans multiple indications including oncology and infectious disease and includes wins from both new and existing customers. 
In the fourth quarter, we began soliciting patient consent to be contacted about potential trials through our Patient Portal. The initial response to our outreach has been excellent as tens of thousands of patients have already consented, and we expect this database of patients to rapidly grow. This capability is unique and allows us to build a large cohort of potential candidates for clinical trials, Phase IV studies, observational trials and a host of other real-world applications. It plainly highlights the power of our data and our combined entity. 
For our third objective, to change the way care is provided, we are focused on commercializing our innovative technology-enabled solutions. We are pleased with the initial successes of BeaconLBS and accelerate monitoring. BeaconLBS uses technology to improve decision-making about laboratory test ordering at the point of care and began generating revenue in 2015. Accelerate monitoring leverages the power of actionable data to better manage clinical trials. And in 2015, we announced the landmark multi-year agreement to deploy this product as an exclusive central monitoring solution for our customers' worldwide trials. These solutions delivered great value to our partners in 2015, and we expect to expand their capabilities and utilization in 2016.
LabCorp looks very different from a year ago, and we have taken profound steps to transform our company and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. I am deeply appreciative and gratified by the focus, performance and enthusiasm that my 50,000 colleagues around the globe brought to our work throughout the past year. The acquisition of Covance created a unique business with extraordinary capabilities and significant global growth opportunities. Our execution has resulted in impressive and financially measurable progress on our strategy, and I expect this progress to continue in 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with our 2016 guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 48% over last year. The acquisition of Covance contributed $670 million during the quarter, driving 44% year-over-year revenue growth. The remainder of the increase was driven by organic volume growth across both core and esoteric testing as well as benefits from BeaconLBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions that were partially offset by currency.
Gross profit for the quarter was $741 million or 33% of revenue compared to $547 million or 36.1% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to the acquisition of Covance as well as price mix, organic volume and the benefits of Project LaunchPad, partially offset by personnel costs and currency. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact of Covance. Excluding Covance, gross margin would have increased 10 basis points over last year. 
SG&A for the quarter was $405 million or 18% of revenue compared to $310 million or 20.5% last year. Excluding special charges of $32 million primarily related to the acquisition of Covance and legal costs, SG&A in the quarter was $373 million or 16.6% of revenue, a 300 basis point reduction versus last year's adjusted SG&A. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to Covance, personnel costs and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by Project LaunchPad savings. The reduction in SG&A as a percent of revenue benefited from Covance's lower SG&A rate. Excluding Covance, SG&A would have improved 20 basis points over last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $54 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to Covance. Amortization expense for the quarter was $38 million, up from $15 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions. Operating income for the quarter was $244 million or 10.8% of revenue compared to $219 million or 14.5% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $125 million, adjusted operating income was $368 million or 16.4% of revenue compared to $250 million or 16.5% last year. Excluding the mix impact from Covance, adjusted operating margin would have increased 20 basis points over last year.
Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $32 million last year. The increase was due to higher debt balances due to the acquisition of Covance. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.5%, higher than last year's 36.1% rate due to the taxable nature of certain restructuring charges. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1% compared to 36.5% last year as we benefited from Covance, which has a higher percentage of its earnings generated in lower tax rate foreign jurisdictions. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 35.3%, and we expect the rate in 2016 to be comparable. As a result, net earnings for the quarter were $114 million or $1.11 per diluted share compared to $120 million or 1.39% per share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $1.98 in the quarter, up 20% from $1.65 last year.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $385 million compared to $214 million last year with the increase due to the acquisition of Covance as well as favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $85 million, up from $46 million last year, primarily due to Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $300 million compared to $167 million last year, bringing our full year free cash flow to $727 million. Excluding net nonrecurring acquisition items of approximately $110 million, our full year free cash flow would have been $837 million.
Our cash balance at year-end was $716 million compared to $713 million at the end of the third quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. During the quarter, we invested $43 million in acquisitions and paid down $250 million of debt, reducing the company's leverage to 3.6x debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are presented on a pro forma basis for all periods as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2014 and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses.
During the quarter, we refined our methodology for the calculation of unallocated corporate expenses, which impacts our LabCorp Diagnostics segment results and has been applied to prior periods for comparative purposes. As a result, LabCorp Diagnostics operating expenses increased by $8.5 million in the quarter and would have increased $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Conversely, unallocated corporate expenses were reduced by $8.5 million in the quarter and would have been reduced by $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 4.3% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, BeaconLBS price mix and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. The increase in revenue of 4.3% includes the benefit from BeaconLBS of 1.1% and an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.8%. Revenue per acquisition increased 2.2%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing revenue grew at a faster rate than core testing revenue. Total volume increased by 1.8%, of which organic volume was 1.6% and acquisition volume was 0.2%. LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $293 million or 18.9% of revenue compared to $273 million or 18.4% last year. The increase was primarily due to volume, price mix and productivity, partially offset by personnel costs. Improvement in productivity was driven by Project LaunchPad, which delivered approximately $20 million of net savings during the quarter, bringing our full year total to $65 million. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million goal and estimate that the remaining LaunchPad savings will be achieved equally over the next 2 years.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $691 million, an increase of 4.7% over last year. The stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 230 basis points. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7% over last year. In addition, the anticipated expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement on October 31 impacted revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Excluding this item, constant currency revenue would have increased 9% over last year.
Covance Drug Development had strong revenue growth across all of its businesses, led by central lab. In addition to revenue growth rate in the clinical business improved from the third quarter as did the rate in early development when excluding the impact from the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement. Adjusted operating income was $110 million or 16.0% of revenue compared to $90 million or 13.6% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to increased demand as well as productivity and cost synergies, partially offset by personnel costs. We captured approximately $15 million of cost synergies during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $45 million. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $100 million: goal and estimate that the remaining cost synergies will be achieved equally over the next 2 years.
Net orders during the quarter were $816 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.18 while backlog at year-end was $6.7 billion. The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill was 1.23.
Now I'll review our 2016 guidance, which assumes January 31 foreign exchange rates for all of 2016. On a consolidated reported basis, we expect net revenue growth of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2015 net revenue of $8.5 billion after the impact from approximately 100 basis points of negative currency. We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 3.5% to 5.5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $6.2 billion after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 2% to 5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $2.6 billion after the impact from approximately 200 basis points of negative currency. The expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement will negatively impact Covance's 2016 growth rate by approximately 260 basis points. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, net revenue is expected to increase 6.6% to 9.6%.
Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is $8.45 to $8.85, an increase of 7% to 12% over 2015. We expect the distribution of earnings in 2016 to be similar to 2015 as our results in the first and fourth quarters are typically impacted by inclement weather and holidays. Our adjusted EPS guidance includes the impact of currency and an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. We expect free cash flow to be between $900 million and $950 million, up from $727 million in 2015 and expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of net revenue, consistent with 2015. In summary, we are enthusiastic about our prospects for 2016 and expect strong top line growth and margin improvement to drive strong year-over-year earnings per share growth and robust free cash flow.

So with respect to the revenue synergies, as we indicated on the call, now over $130 million and what we described as category 1, which is the use of the patient data, and I continue to be quite optimistic about that given the success that we've had with the patient recruitment through the Patient Portal. As we mentioned, tens of thousands of patients have already agreed to be recontacted. It gives us a deep base of patients to -- that we can contact for potential trials, which I think will be a differentiator in terms of winning revenue over time, winning commitments from sponsors over time. Obviously, central lab is very, very strong in the quarter and very pleased with the growth and the momentum that we have going into the year, and we saw a nice improvement in revenue in the clinical business. We saw -- I think we're seeing very good success in our early development solutions. And I would highlight again the companion diagnostics and our success in companion diagnostics. Nobody else can say that they had -- that they were the exclusive lab on the 3 key oncology -- immuno-oncology drugs that were approved in the market over the last 6 months. Nobody else can say they worked on 87% of the drugs that were approved or on 100% of the oncology drugs. It's just something that completely sets us apart from the market. So what gets us to the high end -- what gets us to the high end would be stronger performance in the clinical business. And obviously, the mix of business wins, because longer, more complex trials that pay us a longer stream of revenue with a better mix will lead to more profit, and that will get us to the higher end of the revenue range and, obviously, help us also towards the higher end of the EPS range. So I said a lot there but, Deb, if you have anything to add, happy to have you add as well."

You're going to see volume, organic volume continue to grow at kind of this 1.5% to 2% rate, depending on ups and downs and ins and outs.

So when we talked about the margin improvement that we had, excluding Covance to show that it was a mix impact when you look at both segments on a pro forma basis, you actually see both segments seeing a very strong margin growth. So we characterize it as the pretty strong year, benefiting from the strong demand, benefiting from price mix, if you will, benefiting from the tuck-ins, benefiting from our LaunchPad initiative, our synergy initiative on the Covance side. So overall, we would characterize it as very good leverage."

And it's been a -- this is a service that the BeaconLBS team within LabCorp has really invented, created, designed and implemented, and I'm really proud of them, and they should be really proud of themselves about what they have accomplished because it's terrific, and it's generating a fairly significant amount of revenue now, and we see the opportunity for great growth there. On capital allocation, we have said many times that our target leverage is 2.5x. That is only a target. We are always going to be flexible in terms of looking at how we allocate capital. We do expect that by the second half of the year, we will certainly be in a position to consider returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase. And again, it depends in the M&A pipeline, it depends on how the cash flow stacks up, but we'll always be evaluating that opportunity. As you know, I think we've had a pretty consistent history of share repurchase as a way of returning capital and creating value for shareholders."

So let me start by saying that monetizing the data in and of itself has never been something that's been an aspiration for LabCorp. We don't view data sales as -- it's not going to generate enough revenue to materially help us, and it's not what we want to do strategically. What we want to do is we want to use the data to further the strategy. And the strategy, obviously, is to execute on our 3 core goals, which is delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using technology-enabled solutions to change the way the carriers deliver. What I see in getting patient consent through the Patient Portal is we have patients who come to us for lab testing. They come to the Patient Portal to get their results. When they come to the portal, we are now addressing the patient population in a place that we have never addressed them before and that no one else is addressing them to say, ""Given your diagnosis, given what we know about you, would you be interested in being contacted in the event there was a study that could potentially improve your own health or could improve the health of the population as a whole?"" And the response has been very positive. And as I say, we launched it in 4Q, tens of thousands of patients have encountered the prompt. A lot have said yes. Some have said no. We're working on figuring out how we can improve the yes rate. And again, this is not as simple as when you go to download an update to your Apple phone and you either say yes and you get it or no, you don't. There's been a rigorous compliance review. There's a -- there are protections around how we present this to the patient and what we ask them and we've gone through a very thorough review to make sure that we're doing this in the way that is going to be protective of the patient's privacy and our responsibility to honor that. Now again, what does that lead to? It leads to a large database of patients, which can be accessed from a variety of things: clinical studies, Phase IV, observational studies, reaching out to patients to ask them questions about medication use or medication adherence, so just a whole variety of areas in which we think this becomes a differentiating factor because we have the patient's consent to recontact them. So I would contrast that with an anecdote that was told to me recently, which is a patient got a letter in the mail from a pharmacy saying ""since you're taking this drug, would you like to be in this trial?"" So the patient was taking the drug for a completely different reason and was annoyed by the letter because the patient had never given the pharmacy permission to write them letters and ask them about what they want to do because of their use of drugs. We get the patient's consent beforehand before we have to recontact them and we ask for it. And as a result, I think we're going to have a very a cohort that's going to be very interested in how they might participate and sure in the long run, it's -- the goal is that would lead us to more bookings, it would lead us to more opportunity to show sponsors that we have a good patient cohort available when they start recruiting and would lead to more revenue and growth."

The issue on self-pay is we're seeing -- as you see more patients come through exchanges, exchanges do have -- do tend to have higher deductibles and higher self-pays. And now we're experiencing something, although in a limited way that you've heard other providers talk about, which is people who are on and off the exchange, and so they're on the exchange and they're off the exchange, and they signed back up again. There are 29 different reasons right now why people can get on an exchange even outside the enrollment period. And so we're seeing some of that, and it does mean that more bills go to patient. So for now, we feel like we had a situation well in hand, but it is something that we're keeping a close eye on."

So on PAMA, we have not heard anything further. Obviously, there were some very positive developments from our perspective in terms of strong letters going from the House, from the Senate and from the chair and ranking member of the Finance Committee, encouraging both the inclusion of at least the selection of key hospital labs as well as a delay in the implementation of PAMA. We continue to believe that the inclusion of key hospital labs is absolutely vital to accomplish the congressional purpose, which was a market-based price for Medicare. And realistically, we're at the end of February. The rule has not been finalized. It's hard for me to imagine how this could be implemented in January of 2017 in a way that would be fair to our industry. So that's the view on PAMA. On FDA, we continue to work closely with Congress and attempting to work with the FDA as well on a solution that would be a legislative solution that would bring clarity to the whatever regulation there's going to be of lab developed test and that would not be dependent on sub-regulatory guidance as a proposed long-term solution. And we feel, again, we've been very clear about this. We feel very strongly that guidance is the wrong way to go about this, and that we will continue to oppose that path."

It just stops us getting paid for it. So I don't think that has a significant impact on volume. We've always faced competition from hospitals. I actually think that it's been really about 3 years since we saw the huge shift in hospitals buying up physician practices and in-sourcing them.

We delivered a strong operating performance and created the world's leading healthcare diagnostics company through the acquisition of Covance. We now have employees in approximately 60 countries, generate nearly 20% of our revenue from outside the United States and are well positioned to compete in a number of attractive global markets. Specifically, our addressable market now extends beyond the roughly $70 billion North American clinical lab industry and includes global opportunities in our core laboratory business, drug development, food safety and market access. With the Covance acquisition, our company now competes worldwide in a growing addressable market of approximately $200 billion.
Our financial performance in 2015 reflects our larger footprint and broader capabilities. The combined organization delivered strong revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015 with nearly $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income, double-digit earnings growth and over $720 million in free cash flow. In 2016, we expect our free cash flow to exceed $900 million, with attractive opportunities to enhance our market position and create shareholder value through capital deployment. Our guidance reflects our confidence that LabCorp Diagnostics will deliver another strong year and that Covance Drug Development will continue its solid momentum into 2016. 
Our success is due to execution of our strategy to improve health and improve lives. Our execution on 3 key strategic objectives delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and changing the way care is provided led to these impressive results, reinforcing our conviction in the transformation that we undertook a year ago with the Covance acquisition. I will discuss each objective and how we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace.
First, to deliver world-class diagnostics, we focused on organic growth through introducing new tests to our existing customers as well as to reaching new customers, channels and markets. We also focused on integrating diagnostic information and content, and continuing our industry leadership in scientific innovation. Finally, through disciplined capital deployment, we acquired complementary businesses that enhance our offerings. 
Last year, we expanded our test menu with the introduction of 75 new assays and accelerated Next-Generation Sequencing capabilities. We experienced strong demand for our innovative decision support tools, delivering over 5 million enhanced reports to help customers manage health in important conditions such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. We also added complementary capabilities through targeted tuck-in acquisitions such as Safe Foods, a premier food safety laboratory that expands our size and reach in the fast-growing global food safety arena. In addition, we progressed on a number of important consumer-facing initiatives, including our Patient Portal, lab in an envelope offering and consumer-initiated testing, and we remain enthusiastic about their long-term impact on our business. 
Our strength in science is highlighted by our differentiated capabilities and unparalleled experience in companion diagnostics, which provides a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the last 6 months, 3 very important oncology companion diagnostics received FDA approval. For each one, we were the exclusive laboratory to partner on the clinical trials and support the regulatory submissions. In addition, we are among the first labs to launch these tests for commercial distribution. Our ability to collaborate with sponsors at all stages of companion diagnostic developments through Covance and commercialization through LabCorp gives us a preferred offering that is improving the lives and health of patients and translating to robust financial growth. Our companion diagnostics franchise achieved double-digit growth in 2015, and we remain confident that we will deliver $100 billion in incremental revenue in companion diagnostics through 2018. 
For our second objective, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster, we are focused on commercialization of novel technology, helping partners rethink their global R&D decisions and disciplined capital deployment to build and acquire complementary capabilities. We collaborated on 87% of the 45 new drugs that were approved by FDA last year. Within oncology, we collaborated on 100% of the new drugs that were approved. It is noteworthy that these collaborations included all aspects of our full spectrum of drug development services from early development to central lab to clinical. These outstanding results demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities and the power of our combined company to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions designed to improve the success of clinical trials, reduce development timelines and consistently deliver the highest quality services at a competitive price point.
Our differentiation extends to our combined central lab, which is recognized as the industry leader in revenue, scale, service, quality and breadth of test menu. During the quarter, this business grew double digits and secured a multi-year sole-source relationship with a large new customer, bringing great momentum as we move into 2016.
We continue to lead the industry in using patient data to improve trial recruitment. Through the end of 2015, we attribute over $130 million in new orders to our backlog due to the combination of LabCorp patient data and Covance's capabilities. Our success spans multiple indications including oncology and infectious disease and includes wins from both new and existing customers. 
In the fourth quarter, we began soliciting patient consent to be contacted about potential trials through our Patient Portal. The initial response to our outreach has been excellent as tens of thousands of patients have already consented, and we expect this database of patients to rapidly grow. This capability is unique and allows us to build a large cohort of potential candidates for clinical trials, Phase IV studies, observational trials and a host of other real-world applications. It plainly highlights the power of our data and our combined entity. 
For our third objective, to change the way care is provided, we are focused on commercializing our innovative technology-enabled solutions. We are pleased with the initial successes of BeaconLBS and accelerate monitoring. BeaconLBS uses technology to improve decision-making about laboratory test ordering at the point of care and began generating revenue in 2015. Accelerate monitoring leverages the power of actionable data to better manage clinical trials. And in 2015, we announced a landmark multi-year agreement to deploy this product as an exclusive central monitoring solution for our customers' worldwide trials. These solutions delivered great value to our partners in 2015, and we expect to expand their capabilities and utilization in 2016.
LabCorp looks very different from a year ago, and we have taken profound steps to transform our company and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. I am deeply appreciative and gratified by the focus, performance and enthusiasm that my 50,000 colleagues around the globe brought to our work throughout the past year. The acquisition of Covance created a unique business with extraordinary capabilities and significant global growth opportunities. Our execution has resulted in impressive and financially measurable progress on our strategy, and I expect this progress to continue in 2016.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with our 2016 guidance.Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 b",1588,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with our 2016 guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 48% over last year. The acquisition of Covance contributed $670 million during the quarter, driving 44% year-over-year revenue growth. The remainder of the increase was driven by organic volume growth across both core and esoteric testing as well as benefits from BeaconLBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions that were partially offset by currency.
Gross profit for the quarter was $741 million or 33% of revenue compared to $547 million or 36.1% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to the acquisition of Covance as well as price mix, organic volume and the benefits of Project LaunchPad, partially offset by personnel costs and currency. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact of Covance. Excluding Covance, gross margin would have increased 10 basis points over last year. 
SG&A for the quarter was $405 million or 18% of revenue compared to $310 million or 20.5% last year. Excluding special charges of $32 million primarily related to the acquisition of Covance and legal costs, SG&A in the quarter was $373 million or 16.6% of revenue, a 300 basis point reduction versus last year's adjusted SG&A. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to Covance, personnel costs and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by Project LaunchPad savings. The reduction in SG&A as a percent of revenue benefited from Covance's lower SG&A rate. Excluding Covance, SG&A would have improved 20 basis points over last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $54 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to Covance. Amortization expense for the quarter was $38 million, up from $15 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions. Operating income for the quarter was $244 million or 10.8% of revenue compared to $219 million or 14.5% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $125 million, adjusted operating income was $368 million or 16.4% of revenue compared to $250 million or 16.5% last year. Excluding the mix impact from Covance, adjusted operating margin would have increased 20 basis points over last year.
Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $32 million last year. The increase was due to higher debt balances due to the acquisition of Covance. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.5%, higher than last year's 36.1% rate due to the taxable nature of certain restructuring charges. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1% compared to 36.5% last year as we benefited from Covance, which has a higher percentage of its earnings generated in lower tax rate foreign jurisdictions. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 35.3%, and we expect the rate in 2016 to be comparable. As a result, net earnings for the quarter were $114 million or $1.11 per diluted share compared to $120 million or 1.39% per share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $1.98 in the quarter, up 20% from $1.65 last year.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $385 million compared to $214 million last year with the increase due to the acquisition of Covance as well as favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $85 million, up from $46 million last year, primarily due to Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $300 million compared to $167 million last year, bringing our full year free cash flow to $727 million. Excluding net nonrecurring acquisition items of approximately $110 million, our full year free cash flow would have been $837 million.
Our cash balance at year-end was $716 million compared to $713 million at the end of the third quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. During the quarter, we invested $43 million in acquisitions and paid down $250 million of debt, reducing the company's leverage to 3.6x debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are presented on a pro forma basis for all periods as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2014 and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses.
During the quarter, we refined our methodology for the calculation of unallocated corporate expenses, which impacts our LabCorp Diagnostics segment results and has been applied to prior periods for comparative purposes. As a result, LabCorp Diagnostics operating expenses increased by $8.5 million in the quarter and would have increased $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Conversely, unallocated corporate expenses were reduced by $8.5 million in the quarter and would have been reduced by $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 4.3% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, BeaconLBS price mix and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. The increase in revenue of 4.3% includes a benefit from BeaconLBS of 1.1% and an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.8%. Revenue per acquisition increased 2.2%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing revenue grew at a faster rate than core testing revenue. Total volume increased by 1.8%, of which organic volume was 1.6% and acquisition volume was 0.2%. LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $293 million or 18.9% of revenue compared to $273 million or 18.4% last year. The increase was primarily due to volume, price mix and productivity, partially offset by personnel costs. Improvement in productivity was driven by Project LaunchPad, which delivered approximately $20 million of net savings during the quarter, bringing our full year total to $65 million. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million goal and estimate that the remaining LaunchPad savings will be achieved equally over the next 2 years.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $691 million, an increase of 4.7% over last year. The stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 230 basis points. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7% over last year. In addition, the anticipated expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement on October 31 impacted revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Excluding this item, constant currency revenue would have increased 9% over last year.
Covance Drug Development had strong revenue growth across all of its businesses, led by central lab. In addition, the revenue growth rate in the clinical business improved from the third quarter as did the rate in early development when excluding the impact from the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement. Adjusted operating income was $110 million or 16.0% of revenue compared to $90 million or 13.6% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to increased demand as well as productivity and cost synergies, partially offset by personnel costs. We captured approximately $15 million of cost synergies during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $45 million. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $100 million goal and estimate that the remaining cost synergies will be achieved equally over the next 2 years.
Net orders during the quarter were $816 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.18 while backlog at year-end was $6.7 billion. The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill was 1.23.
Now I'll review our 2016 guidance, which assumes January 31 foreign exchange rates for all of 2016. On a consolidated reported basis, we expect net revenue growth of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2015 net revenue of $8.5 billion after the impact from approximately 100 basis points of negative currency. We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 3.5% to 5.5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $6.2 billion after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 2% to 5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $2.6 billion after the impact from approximately 200 basis points of negative currency. The expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement will negatively impact Covance's 2016 growth rate by approximately 260 basis points. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, net revenue is expected to increase 6.6% to 9.6%.
Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is $8.45 to $8.85, an increase of 7% to 12% over 2015. We expect the distribution of earnings in 2016 to be similar to 2015 as our results in the first and fourth quarters are typically impacted by inclement weather and holidays. Our adjusted EPS guidance includes the impact of currency and an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. We expect free cash flow to be between $900 million and $950 million, up from $727 million in 2015 and expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of net revenue, consistent with 2015. In summary, we are enthusiastic about our prospects for 2016 and expect strong top line growth and margin improvement to drive strong year-over-year earnings per share growth and robust free cash flow.
This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll now take questions. Operator?"

So with respect to the revenue synergies, as we indicated on the call, now over $130 million and what we described as category 1, which is the use of the patient data, and I continue to be quite optimistic about that given the success that we've had with the patient recruitment through the Patient Portal. As we mentioned, tens of thousands of patients have already agreed to be recontacted. It gives us a deep base of patients to -- that we can contact for potential trials, which I think will be a differentiator in terms of winning revenue over time, winning commitments from sponsors over time. Obviously, central lab is very, very strong in the quarter and very pleased with the growth and the momentum that we have going into the year, and we saw a nice improvement in revenue in the clinical business. We saw -- I think we're seeing very good success in our early development solutions. And I would highlight again the companion diagnostics and our success in companion diagnostics. Nobody else can say that they had -- that they were the exclusive lab on the 3 key oncology -- immuno-oncology drugs that were approved in the market over the last 6 months. Nobody else can say they worked on 87% of the drugs that were approved or on 100% of the oncology drugs. It's just something that completely sets us apart from the market. So what gets us to the high end -- what gets us to the high end would be stronger performance in the clinical business. And obviously, the mix of business wins, because longer, more complex trials that pay us a longer stream of revenue with a better mix will lead to more profit, and that will get us to the higher end of the revenue range and, obviously, help us also towards the higher end of the EPS range. So I said a lot there but, Deb, if you have anything to add, happy to have you add as well."

So we feel great about the M&A pipeline, and we have certainly have plans of -- as we've said frequently in the past, our guidance always assumes that we're going to acquire about 1% of -- that we're going to do tuck-in acquisitions that will account for about 1% revenue growth, and that's certainly in the plan for the year, and I think there's ample opportunity to execute on that."

But I think our volume projections for 2016 suggest that we would expect to see a continuation of what we've kind of seen here in 3Q and 4Q, absent some large contract win or some shift in the marketplace. You're going to see volume, organic volume continue to grow at kind of this 1.5% to 2% rate, depending on ups and downs and ins and outs. So I think we've been obviously delivering very, very solid volume growth, and we expect to continue to do so.

On capital allocation, we have said many times that our target leverage is 2.5x. That is only a target. We are always going to be flexible in terms of looking at how we allocate capital. We do expect that by the second half of the year, we will certainly be in a position to consider returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase.

So let me start by saying that monetizing the data in and of itself has never been something that's been an aspiration for LabCorp. We don't view data sales as -- it's not going to generate enough revenue to materially help us, and it's not what we want to do strategically. What we want to do is we want to use the data to further the strategy. And the strategy, obviously, is to execute on our 3 core goals, which is delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using technology-enabled solutions to change the way the carriers deliver. What I see in getting patient consent through the Patient Portal is we have patients who come to us for lab testing. They come to the Patient Portal to get their results. When they come to the portal, we are now addressing the patient population in a place that we have never addressed them before and that no one else is addressing them to say, ""Given your diagnosis, given what we know about you, would you be interested in being contacted in the event there was a study that could potentially improve your own health or could improve the health of the population as a whole?"" And the response has been very positive. And as I say, we launched it in 4Q, tens of thousands of patients have encountered the prompt. A lot have said yes. Some have said no. We're working on figuring out how we can improve the yes rate. And again, this is not as simple as when you go to download an update to your Apple phone and you either say yes and you get it or no, you don't. There's been a rigorous compliance review. There's a -- there are protections around how we present this to the patient and what we ask them and we've gone through a very thorough review to make sure that we're doing this in a way that is going to be protective of the patient's privacy and our responsibility to honor that. Now again, what does that lead to? It leads to a large database of patients, which can be accessed from a variety of things: clinical studies, Phase IV, observational studies, reaching out to patients to ask them questions about medication use or medication adherence, so just a whole variety of areas in which we think this becomes a differentiating factor because we have the patient's consent to recontact them. So I would contrast that with an anecdote that was told to me recently, which is a patient got a letter in the mail from a pharmacy saying ""since you're taking this drug, would you like to be in this trial?"" So the patient was taking the drug for a completely different reason and was annoyed by the letter because the patient had never given the pharmacy permission to write them letters and ask them about what they want to do because of their use of drugs. We get the patient's consent beforehand before we ever recontact them and we ask for it. And as a result, I think we're going to have a very -- a cohort that's going to be very interested in how they might participate and sure, in the long run, it's -- the goal is that would lead us to more bookings, it would lead us to more opportunity to show sponsors that we have a good patient cohort available when they start recruiting and would lead to more revenue and growth."

On FDA, we continue to work closely with Congress and attempting to work with the FDA as well on a solution that would be a legislative solution that would bring clarity to the -- whatever regulation there's going to be of lab developed test and that would not be dependent on sub-regulatory guidance as a proposed long-term solution. And we feel, again, we've been very clear about this. We feel very strongly that guidance is the wrong way to go about this, and that we will continue to oppose that path."

So we follow that path for years. We've been very disciplined about it, and we'll continue to follow that. And again, our exposure to the LDT -- the potential of at least the initial stage of what FDA has proposed from an LDT perspective is relatively low as a percentage of revenue, but this is important as an industry matter and it's important from an overall perspective in terms of innovation and development in the diagnostic industry.

I think the reality is that the high-deductible plans and high co-pays have more of an impact on bad debt and collections. It doesn't stop the patient from coming to get the testing done. It just stops us getting paid for it. So I don't think that has a significant impact on volume. We've always faced competition from hospitals. I actually think that it's been really about 3 years since we saw the huge shift in hospitals buying up physician practices and in-sourcing them. And I think we're doing a terrific job on organic volume. I think the diagnostics team has done a great job. We're clearly outperforming, from my perspective, the competitive market with organic volume growth. I think we're outperforming the other healthcare services providers in terms of organic volume growth. And so in spite of -- and again, if you look at that, what you've characterized as a slight deceleration on a per day basis 3Q over 4Q, it's actually essentially flat from an organic volume perspective.

We have an impressive quarter in which we continue to demonstrate the power of our transformed company through our operating performance and progress on key strategic priorities. First quarter pro forma revenue growth was nearly 9%, with strong organic growth in both LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development. This growth, coupled with reengineering our business process through Project LaunchPad and capturing additional cost synergies with the Covance acquisition, drove another quarter of margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our excellent first quarter operational performance and business momentum gives us confidence to increase our 2016 revenue and EPS outlook. 
Our ongoing success is due to sustained focus on our mission to improve health and improve lives and execution on our 3 key strategic initiatives: being the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using information to change the way care is delivered. I will now update you on our progress on these strategic guideposts.
First, we are delivering diagnostic solutions through a combination of enhanced offerings, complementary acquisitions and technological innovations. We continue to lead in offering cutting-edge testing, introducing over 75 new tests to market during the past year. We are increasingly developed deploying our integrated testing capabilities, industry-leading science and innovative technology offerings to establish strategic partnerships with providers. Hospitals, health systems and large position networks seek us out for our comprehensive capabilities in reference testing, supply chain management, IT and informatics, decision support and clinical trials. We are also focused on our relationship with managed care organizations, a backbone of our business. We have the strongest managed care portfolio in the industry and our proud of our deep partnerships with these plans. In addition, we are increasing our focus on partnering with government and quasi-government payers as they take on broader roles in developing new payment structures and care models. 
Underpinning our core diagnostic strategy is our innovation in data integration and in tools to support enhanced connectivity, reporting and decision support. We differentiate from our competitors by providing these tools as well as the highest quality most cost-efficient laboratory services to help a wide array of partners as they move to more extensive management of patient health and broader sharing of risk.
We complement our organic growth initiatives with carefully considered acquisitions and partnerships that drive long-term profitable growth. During the quarter, we invested approximately $100 million in strategic tuck-in deals predominantly focused on esoteric testing, such as anatomic pathology, which provides critical diagnostic information in the determination of the appropriate course of cancer treatment. 
Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we see attractive opportunities to enhance our test menu and expand our geographic footprint. 
In addition to our revenue growth initiatives, we are committed to increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience. Project LaunchPad is introducing new tools and systems to reengineer our processes as well as enhance the patient, employee and customer experience. With identified projects underway such as improving our billing system and patient service center workflow, LaunchPad will sustainably reduce cost, benefiting the long-term margins of LabCorp Diagnostics. We remain on track to deliver $150 million net savings to the 3-year period ending in 2017. Although LaunchPad is a finite program aimed at process reengineering, we will always have opportunities to drive shareholder value through further productivity and efficiency programs. Our culture of continuous improvement began long before LaunchPad and will remain after we achieve our stated LaunchPad goals. In its second year, LaunchPad has transitioned from shorter-duration initiatives to system engineering, which entails longer time lines for execution and longer-term savings impact.
Our second core objective is bringing innovative medicines to patients faster. We execute that objective by offering unique capabilities and solutions to solve problems for our customers. Inefficiency in the clinical trial recruitment and startup process persists as the most significant pain point for our biopharma customers. We are introducing solutions that no other company can replicate to address this challenge. 
We are commercializing the combination of LabCorp's proprietary patient data and Covance's proprietary informatics and investigative database in support of financed study planning as well as informed clinical -- improved clinical trial placement and recruitment. During the quarter, the use of LabCorp data played a key role in winning a large Phase III oncology study, which increased our cumulative orders from use of LabCorp data to over $190 million. We have begun to convert this backlog into revenue and remain on track to deliver $150 million in incremental revenue through 2018. 
In addition, the number of patients that provide consent to our Patient Portal to be contacted about clinical trials steadily increased throughout the quarter. We believe patients will want to be part of a process that improves the speed at which cutting-edge therapeutics are delivered to the market, and we are exploring partnerships to expand our reach with this initiative. Over time, we believe that this database will further differentiate our study start-up and recruitment capabilities in support of better drug development.
We continue to develop comprehensive solutions in key therapeutic areas, capitalizing on our unique end-to-end capabilities across all aspects of drug development. The scientific and clinical expertise that Covance Drug Development and LabCorp Diagnostics offer in combination, our combined laboratory expertise and our ability to deliver all of our services with the highest quality and at scale put us significantly ahead of our competitors. To give you a couple of specifics, our industry-leading Central Lab, a product of our combined capabilities, reported another outstanding quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. We recently introduced automation to our Geneva central lab to improve productivity and expanded it to double capacity, allowing us to better serve the growing demand for our enhanced menu of lab testing in Europe, Africa and around the globe. Our companion diagnostics franchise continues to thrive and is another excellent example of the power of our combined offering. Companion diagnostics are growing in importance to our customers to help them secure regulatory approval, reimbursement and market adoption for their medicines in an increasingly demanding health care system. LabCorp and Covance uniquely offer companion diagnostic capabilities from discovery through commercialization. These capabilities include development, validation, support for in vitro diagnostic kits, ability to responsibly launch laboratory-developed diagnostics, market analysis, reimbursement support, life cycle management and timely commercialization of drugs and their companion diagnostics to our sizable base of providers and their patients. We see strong revenue growth in companion diagnostic services across many therapeutic areas, including oncology, information and central nervous system disorders. We remain confident that we will deliver $100 million in incremental revenue in this area through 2018 and highlight our differentiated capabilities from our competitors.
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is delivered through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions. In diagnostics, as noted, we are expanding our menu of decision-support tools and integrated content to assist payers, physicians, health systems and patients in better understanding and managing medical conditions. We also recently marked the one-year anniversary of BeaconLBS' commercial launch, and we are pleased with the technology's clear financial and clinical benefits. In addition, we are seeing increased provider satisfaction with BeaconLBS' test and lab selection functionality as well as its ease-of-use. We intend to add new capabilities to BeaconLBS this year and remain optimistic about its introduction in new markets. 
In drug development, we are enhancing Covance's accelerated suite of services to enable faster patient enrollment, more efficient site monitoring an improved study planning. Accelerate helps reduce the time and cost of trials by providing an easy-to-use replicable tool to improve insight into trial site performance and trial success. We will also implement new approaches to lower the patient burden and improve the patient journey through clinical trials. We recently launched a suite of mobile capabilities designed to help biopharmaceutical and technology companies navigate the rapidly evolving global health landscape.  Through this novel offering, we will provide regulatory consulting and validation services to help companies certify the accuracy and consistency of mobile devices and applications for use in clinical trials. Through all of this activity, we have been and will be excellent stewards of capital. We have made steady progress in our commitment to deliver the balance sheet, and we are now at approximately 3.5x leverage approaching our target. We continue to deploy capital towards strategic acquisitions and expect to be in a position to return capital to shareholders in the second half of the year.
By virtue of our investments in innovation, talent, science, quality, operational excellence and distinctive technology, LabCorp is increasingly well positioned to profit from global opportunities across our $200 billion addressable market. I am proud of my colleagues who everyday reflect our core values of excellence, integrity, teamwork, courage, inspiration and ownership as they work tirelessly to improve the health and lives of patients around the globe. Our team's efforts are the reason for our success this quarter, and they will continue to be LabCorp's greatest competitive advantage. I thank them for their great work and the results they continue to deliver.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance.Revenue for the quarter",1497,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 30% over last year. Covance contributed 24% year-over-year growth due to strong demand as well as the inclusion of a full quarter of results compared to a partial quarter last year. The remainder of the increase of 6% was driven by LabCorp Diagnostics' strong organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. Gross profit for the quarter was $777 million or 33.9% of revenue compared to $625 million or 35.3% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to strong demand, productivity and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to the mix impact from a full quarter of Covance results. On a pro forma basis, gross margin would've increased 50 basis points over last year.
SG&A for the quarter was $412 million or 17.9% of revenue compared to $442 million or 25% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $10 million, primarily related to the integration of Covance and executive transition expenses compared to $119 million a year ago, which were primarily related to the acquisition of Covance. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $402 million or 17.5% of revenue compared to $322 million or 18.2%. The increase in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to acquisitions, personnel costs and bad debt, while the percentage of our SG&A benefited from a full quarter of Covance's lower rate. On a pro forma basis, adjusted SG&A would've improved 10 basis points over last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $19 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to the closure of redundant facilities and general integration initiatives. Amortization expense for the quarter was $44 million, up from $31 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions.
Operating income for the quarter was $302 million or 13.2% of revenue compared to $132 million or 7.5% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $74 million, adjusted operating income was $376 million or 16.4% of revenue compared to $302 million or 17.1% last year. The decline in margin was primarily due to the mix impact from a full quarter of Covance results. On a pro forma basis, adjusted operating margin would've improved 60 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter was $55 million compared to $104 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was due to nonrecurring acquisition-related items of $53 million recorded last year, partially offset by higher debt balances following the acquisition of Covance. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 37.3%. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 36.5%, up from 35.4% last year, primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be comparable to last year's rate of 35.3%.
Net earnings for the quarter were $160 million or $1.55 per diluted share. Excluding amortization restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.02 in the quarter, up 15% from $1.76 last year. These results included a net gain in the quarter of $0.05 per diluted share on the sale of investment securities from our venture fund. 
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $123 million compared to negative $87 million in the first quarter of 2015. Last year, cash flow was negatively impacted by $154 million of onetime charges relating to the acquisition of Covance. Excluding these charges, operating cash flow was up $57 million over last year, due primarily to improved earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $71 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from $34 million or 1.9% last year. Capital expenditures in the quarter were in line with typical spending levels, while last year's CapEx was low due to the delayed spending related to the acquisition and integration of Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $52 million in the first quarter, an increase from $33 million last year, excluding the nonrecurring items. 
At quarter end, our cash balance was $696 million compared to $716 million at the end of 2015. Total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. During the quarter, we invested $97 million in acquisitions, and our leverage declined to 3.5x debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are represented on a pro forma basis for all periods as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2015 and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, BeaconLBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. The revenue increase includes the benefit from BeaconLBS of 1% and unfavorable currency translation of 0.6%. Revenue per acquisition increased 2.7%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing revenue grew at a faster rate than core testing revenue. Total volume increased by 4%, of which organic volume was 3.4%, and acquisition volume was 0.6%. Volume benefited from the impact of weather and the additional day that was partially offset by the timing of the Easter holiday.
LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $310 million or 19.5% of revenue compared to $290 million or 19.5% last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to volume, price mix and productivity, partially offset by personnel costs and bad debt. Although the operating margin was consistent with last year, it was constrained by the mix impact from BeaconLBS and an increase in the bad debt rate of approximately 25 basis points due to an increase in patient responsibility. For the remainder of the year, we expect our bad debt rate to improve, benefiting from our LaunchPad initiatives. We remain on track to deliver our $150 million LaunchPad savings goal over the 3-year period ending 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $703 million, an increase of 12.6% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 160 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, revenue increased 17.9% over last year. The strong revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central lab differences. Adjusted operating income was $103 million or 14.7% of revenue compared to $74 million or 11.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to demand, productivity and cost synergies, partially offset by the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement and personnel cost. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $100 million cost savings goal through 2017 related to the acquisition of Covance.
Net orders during the quarter were $830 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.18, while backlog at the end of the quarter was $6.9 billion. The trailing 12 month net book-to-bill was also 1.18.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes March 31 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of 2016. We expect revenue growth of 8.5% to 10.5% after the impact from approximately 40 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% due to strong organic growth and a 60 basis point improvement in currency. We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow for 4% to 5.5% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 20 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% due to organic growth and a 30 basis point improvement in currency. We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 6% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 2% to 5% due to strong organic growth and 150 basis points improvement in currency. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we now expect net revenue to increase approximately 9% to 12%. We expect adjusted EPS of $8.55 to $8.95, which implies growth of 8% to 13% over 2015 and is an increase from our prior guidance of $8.45 to $8.85. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS guidance includes an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. We expect free cash flow of $900 million to $950 million, unchanged from our prior guidance.
This concludes our formal remarks, and we will now take questions. Operator?"

First of all, obviously, we had good margins overall for the company at 16.4% margins. We're up around 60 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. I know your comment was probably more directed to the diagnostic side of the business where we maintained our 19.5% margins year-over-year. As I commented in our opening remarks, our first quarter was constrained. So were not for some of those issues, we would've seen margin expansion. And really, there are 3 primary reasons. The first is our BeaconLBS business, which we had a full quarter this year with none last year. It annualizes actually now beginning into the second quarter. So given that most of it right now is still passthrough that was constrained at our margins. We also did have but rate increase for the first time, given the high patient responsibility. But again, as we said, we expect that rate to come down going forward through LaunchPad initiatives, so it won't be a constraint, we believe, going forward. And then finally worth noting is that with our merit increase, we did have a good merit increase year-over-year that will annualize in July of this year. So for the first half, we'll see some constrain on the margin from that. But overall, over 7% top line growth, maintaining very strong 19.5% margins operating income grew by over 7% despite these constraints. Dave?"

So I think you can expect as of this year to set some inspirational -- aspirational targets for EPS growth over time. I think if you look back, historically, obviously, before the major reimbursement cuts of '13 and '14, we had a very nice, I believe, it was a 5-year EPS CAGR of 13-plus percent, and we had a couple of years of flat to declining EPS simply because of decline in pricing and the cuts attended to that.

The first part is just continuing to look at for right now the tuck-ins, the things that are additive to particular parts of the business that we would like to expand, so therapeutic expertise, market access, the areas where we feel that there is an interesting opportunity to either expand capabilities or enhance capabilities with things that would be additive to the overall end-to-end capabilities of the business. Over time, as you said, we need -- we feel that we need to be larger in the clinical business, and some of that will come from organic growth and the initiatives that we have underway, therapeutic expertise and integration with LabCorp Diagnostics, but it's my expectation that some of that will also come from acquisition. I would say that now, our focus is not on another sizable deal. Our focus is on complementary capabilities that are additive to what we have, although obviously, we evaluate a lot of things, and we're going to look at anything that looks like the right opportunity for us, given price multiples and long-term return on invested capital. So that's how I would summarize the acquisition strategy around the Covance business. In terms of the performance, it's hard to single out any particular area because they all did so well. The business has quickened along extremely well. Deb is doing a great job as CEO and on top of that, the leadership moves that she has made have created terrific stability and sense of purpose in the organization. And so I complement everybody at Covance from early development and preclinical all the way to clinical for a very strong performance in the quarter, just as I complement everybody on the diagnostic side from phlebotomist to senior executive for a very strong performance there. We just really -- we really executed well on the strategic initiatives and we performed well operationally in the quarter."

Early development, as Dave said, had another strong quarter, and the market has been recovering over the past 18 to 24 months, and our demand remains strong. Utilization in the market is tightening, which results in slight price increases, and it has in the last 6 quarters. So we continue to manage our capacity very efficiently and effectively. As far as central labs, we had fantastic growth. We've had strong volume and strong demand. It's been fueled by the breadth of assays that we have because of the combination of LabCorp and Covance. We've also seen a nice conversion of the studies that we have in central labs, so that's been driving volume. In clinical trials, as they get more and more complex, the number of esoteric assays are increasing, and that allows us to be a one-stop shop for our customers, which they tend to value that. When you look at clinical, this is the largest market that we serve and one of the largest opportunities that we have for growth, both for Covance as well as for the combined entity. We had strong results of this quarter, and we continue to invest in talent and tools. In January, we added a new sales leader who was previously head of sales for both central labs and early development. And then, as you know, we recently announced that has joined, and he brings a wealth of experience at clinical development as well as his perspective from the voice of the client. So these hires plus our investment in informatics, as David talked about earlier and the combined data, is going to allow us to adjust our clients' biggest pain points, which is decreasing the time for study startups, identifying patients and so we are very pleased with the results this quarter."

So my experience has been -- this is readily understood.

Of the $100 million we talked about for companion diagnostics, I think we've been very clear that we have done extremely well. And I think we, in all likelihood, if I had the handicap it now, I think we'd exceed that $100 million over the 3-year period just because that business has been thriving with the combined tools.

But driven by the success that we're experiencing on our LaunchPad initiatives, that will only continue to accrue favorably going forward. So an issue in the quarter, don't expect it to be one going forward, but were not for the LaunchPad, could be."

Obviously, we are seeing more and more patience and high deductible plans whether through exchanges or through commercial plans. So more patients with high deductible plans means more dollars out of pocket before there's any insurance payment whatsoever. What that means is with higher deductibles, higher patient responsibility at the onset of the year, and then we're also seeing plans with higher co-pays and with a greater incidence of noncover services. So between those 3 factors, you're seeing more dollars of exposure flowing to patients. And although our patient collection rate is generally very good, it still is more dollars going to patients and just puts more pressure on collecting overall -- of that overall component. And as Glenn said, some upward movement in the quarter, but we still feel confident that for the year will be in the same range as we were last year."

So that's going to be an important component of use of mobile devices in clinical trials as we go forward, and we're pleased that we have the launched the tools to be able to help our clients with that."

It centers on, first of all, is it fit -- one of our 3 strategic priorities, which we talked about, is being the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, number one. Number two, bringing novel medicines to patients faster, and number three, using technology and tools to transform the way the care is delivered. So anything we do has to fit within those 3 basic parameters. The next thing we look at is does it enhance our capabilities in a meaningful way, whether those are existing capabilities, whether they're add-on capabilities that we need to be better at the business. And then -- or more geographic capabilities. So it could be footprint, could be test menu, it could be incremental capabilities that support one or the other of the businesses. Then we look at price multiples, return on invested capital, IRR, discounted cash flows, all the basic acquisition metrics. And so the question what are we prioritizing, the nice thing about our position now is that there are many, many opportunities to deploy capital towards acquisitions and yet our businesses are performing extremely well, and so there's no sort of major gap that we need to fill. And so I don't think -- I don't think I can answer the question what's the highest priority. The highest priority is high-value, high-return deals that are going to fit our strategic framework."

We had an impressive quarter in which we continued to demonstrate the power of our transformed company through our operating performance and progress on key strategic priorities. First quarter pro forma revenue growth was nearly 9%, with strong organic growth in both LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development. This growth, coupled with reengineering our business process through Project LaunchPad and capturing additional cost synergies in the Covance acquisition, drove another quarter of margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our excellent first quarter operational performance and business momentum give us confidence to increase our 2016 revenue and EPS outlook.
Our ongoing success is due to sustained focus on our mission to improve health and improve lives and execution on our 3 key strategic initiatives: being the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using information to change the way care is delivered. I will now update you on our progress on these strategic guideposts.
First, we are delivering diagnostic solutions through a combination of enhanced offerings, complementary acquisitions and technological innovation. We continue to lead in offering cutting-edge testing, introducing over 75 new tests to market during the past year. We are increasingly deploying our integrated testing capabilities, industry-leading science and innovative technology offerings to establish strategic partnerships with providers. Hospitals, health systems and large physician networks seek us out for our comprehensive capabilities in reference testing, supply chain management, IT and informatics, decision support and clinical trials. We're also focused on our relationship with managed care organizations, a backbone of our business. We have the strongest managed care portfolio in the industry and are proud of our deep partnerships with these plans. In addition, we are increasing our focus on partnering with government and quasi-government payers as they take on broader roles in developing new payment structures and care models.
Underpinning core diagnostic strategy is our innovation in data integration and in tools to support enhanced connectivity, reporting and decision support. We differentiate from our competitors by providing these tools as well as the highest quality, most cost-efficient laboratory services to help a wide array of partners as they move to more extensive management of patient health and broader sharing of risk.
We complement our organic growth initiatives with carefully considered acquisitions and partnerships that drive long-term profitable growth. During the quarter, we invested approximately $100 million in strategic tuck-in deals, predominantly focused on esoteric testing, such as anatomic pathology, which provides critical diagnostic information in the determination of the appropriate course of cancer treatment.
Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we see attractive opportunities to enhance our test menu and expand our geographic footprint. 
In addition to our revenue growth initiatives, we are committed to increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience. Project LaunchPad is introducing new tools and systems to reengineer our processes as well as enhance the patient, employee and customer experience. 
With identified projects underway, such as improving our billing system and patient service center workflow, LaunchPad will sustainably reduce costs, benefiting the long-term margins of LabCorp Diagnostics. We remain on track to deliver $150 million net savings to the 3-year period ending in 2017. Although LaunchPad is a finite program aimed at process reengineering, we will always have opportunities to drive shareholder value through further productivity and efficiency programs. Our culture of continuous improvement began long before LaunchPad and will remain after we achieve our stated LaunchPad goals. In its second year, LaunchPad has transitioned from shorter-duration initiatives to system reengineering, which entails longer time lines for execution and longer-term savings impact.
Our second core objective is bringing innovative medicines to patients faster. We execute that objective by offering unique capabilities and solutions to solve problems for our customers. Inefficiency in the clinical trial recruitment and startup process persists as the most significant pain point for our biopharma customers. We are introducing solutions that no other company can replicate to address this challenge. 
We are commercializing the combination of LabCorp's proprietary patient data and Covance's proprietary informatics and the investigator database in support of enhanced study planning as well as informed clinical -- improved clinical trial placement and recruitment. 
During the quarter, the use of LabCorp data played a key role in winning a large Phase III oncology study, which increased our cumulative orders from use of LabCorp data to over $190 million. We have begun to convert this backlog into revenue and remain on track to deliver $150 million in incremental revenue through 2018.
In addition, the number of patients that provided consent through our Patient Portal to be contacted about clinical trials steadily increased throughout the quarter. We believe patients will want to be part of a process that improves the speed at which cutting-edge therapeutics are delivered to the market, and we are exploring partnerships to expand our reach with this initiative. 
Over time, we believe that this database will further differentiate our study start-up and recruitment capabilities in support of better drug development.
We continue to develop comprehensive solutions in key therapeutic areas, capitalizing on our unique end-to-end capabilities across all aspects of drug development. The scientific and clinical expertise that Covance Drug Development and LabCorp Diagnostics offer in combination, our combined laboratory expertise and our ability to deliver all of our services with the highest quality and at scale put us significantly ahead of our competitors. 
To give you a couple of specifics, our industry-leading central lab, a product of our combined capabilities, reported another outstanding quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. We recently introduced automation to our Geneva central lab to improve productivity and expanded it to double capacity, allowing us to better serve the growing demand for our enhanced menu of lab testing in Europe, Africa and around the globe. Our companion diagnostics franchise continues to thrive and is another excellent example of the power of our combined offering. Companion diagnostics are growing in importance to our customers to help them secure regulatory approval, reimbursement and market adoption for their medicines in an increasingly demanding healthcare system. 
LabCorp and Covance uniquely offer companion diagnostic capabilities from discovery through commercialization. These capabilities include development, validation, support for in vitro diagnostic kits, ability to responsibly launch laboratory developed diagnostics, market analysis, reimbursement support, lifecycle management and timely commercialization of drugs and their companion diagnostics to our sizable base of providers and their patients. We see strong revenue growth in companion diagnostic services across many therapeutic areas, including oncology, inflammation and central nervous system disorders. We remain confident that we will deliver $100 million in incremental revenue in this area through 2018 and highlight our differentiated capabilities from our competitors.
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is delivered through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions. In diagnostics, as noted, we are expanding our menu of decision support tools and integrated content to assist payers, physicians, health systems and patients in better understanding and managing medical conditions. 
We also recently marked the one-year anniversary of BeaconLBS' commercial launch, and we are pleased with the technology's clear financial and clinical benefits. In addition, we are seeing increased provider satisfaction with BeaconLBS' test and lab selection functionality as well as its ease of use. We intend to add new capabilities to BeaconLBS this year and remain optimistic about its introduction in new markets.
In drug development, we are enhancing Covance's Xcellerate suite of services to enable faster patient enrollment, more efficient site monitoring and improved study planning. Xcellerate helps reduce the time and cost of trials by providing an easy-to-use replicable tool to improve insight into trial site performance and trial success. We will also implement new approaches to lower the patient burden and improve the patient journey through clinical trials. We recently launched a suite of mobile capabilities designed to help biopharmaceutical and technology companies navigate the rapidly evolving global health landscape.  Through this novel offering, we will provide regulatory consulting and validation services to help companies certify the accuracy and consistency of mobile devices and applications for using clinical trials. Through all of this activity, we have been and will be excellent stewards of capital. We have made steady progress in our commitment to delever the balance sheet, and we are now at approximately 3.5x leverage approaching our target. We continue to deploy capital towards strategic acquisitions and expect to be in a position to return capital to shareholders in the second half of the year.
By virtue of our investments in innovation, talent, science, quality, operational excellence and distinctive technology, LabCorp is increasingly well positioned to profit from global opportunities across our $200 billion addressable market. I am proud of my colleagues who every day reflect our core values of excellence, integrity, teamwork, courage, inspiration and ownership as they work tirelessly to improve the health and lives of patients around the globe. Our team's efforts are the reason for our success this quarter, and they will continue to be LabCorp's greatest competitive advantage. I thank them for their great work and the results they continue to deliver.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance.Revenue for the quarter",1497,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 30% over last year. Covance contributed 24% year-over-year growth due to strong demand as well as the inclusion of a full quarter of results compared to a partial quarter last year. The remainder of the increase of 6% was driven by LabCorp Diagnostics' strong organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. Gross profit for the quarter was $777 million or 33.9% of revenue compared to $625 million or 35.3% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to strong demand, productivity and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to the mix impact from a full quarter of Covance results. On a pro forma basis, gross margin would've increased 50 basis points over last year.
SG&A for the quarter was $412 million or 17.9% of revenue compared to $442 million or 25% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $10 million, primarily related to the integration of Covance and executive transition expenses compared to $119 million a year ago, which were primarily related to the acquisition of Covance. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $402 million or 17.5% of revenue compared to $322 million or 18.2%. The increase in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to acquisitions, personnel costs and bad debt, while the percentage of our SG&A benefited from a full quarter of Covance's lower rate. On a pro forma basis, adjusted SG&A would've improved 10 basis points over last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $19 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to the closure of redundant facilities and general integration initiatives. Amortization expense for the quarter was $44 million, up from $31 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions.
Operating income for the quarter was $302 million or 13.2% of revenue compared to $132 million or 7.5% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $74 million, adjusted operating income was $376 million or 16.4% of revenue compared to $302 million or 17.1% last year. The decline in margin was primarily due to the mix impact from a full quarter of Covance results.  On a pro forma basis, adjusted operating margin would've improved 60 basis points. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $55 million compared to $104 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was due to nonrecurring acquisition-related items of $53 million recorded last year, partially offset by higher debt balances following the acquisition of Covance. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 37.3%. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 36.5%, up from 35.4% last year, primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be comparable to last year's rate of 35.3%.
Net earnings for the quarter were $160 million or $1.55 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.02 in the quarter, up 15% from $1.76 last year. These results included a net gain in the quarter of $0.05 per diluted share on the sale of investment securities from our venture fund. 
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $123 million compared to negative $87 million in the first quarter of 2015. Last year, cash flow was negatively impacted by $154 million of onetime charges relating to the acquisition of Covance. 
Excluding these charges, operating cash flow was up $57 million over last year due primarily to improved earnings. 
Capital expenditures totaled $71 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from $34 million or 1.9% last year. Capital expenditures in the quarter were in line with typical spending levels, while last year's CapEx was low due to the delayed spending related to the acquisition and integration of Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $52 million in the first quarter, an increase from $33 million last year, excluding the nonrecurring items.
At quarter end, our cash balance was $696 million compared to $716 million at the end of 2015. Total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. During the quarter, we invested $97 million in acquisitions, and our leverage declined to 3.5x debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are represented on a pro forma basis for all periods as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2015, and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, BeaconLBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. The revenue increase includes the benefit from BeaconLBS of 1% and unfavorable currency translation of 0.6%. Revenue per acquisition increased 2.7%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing revenue grew at a faster rate than core testing revenue. Total volume increased by 4% of which organic volume was 3.4%, and acquisition volume was 0.6%. Volume benefited from the impact of weather and the additional day that was partially offset by the timing of the Easter holiday.
LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $310 million or 19.5% of revenue compared to $290 million or 19.5% last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to volume, price mix and productivity, partially offset by personnel costs and bad debt. Although the operating margin was consistent with last year, it was constrained by the mix impact from BeaconLBS and an increase in the bad debt rate of approximately 25 basis points due to an increase in patient responsibility. For the remainder of the year, we expect our bad debt rate to improve, benefiting from our LaunchPad initiatives. We remain on track to deliver our $150 million LaunchPad savings goal over the 3-year period ending 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $703 million, an increase of 12.6% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 160 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, revenue increased 17.9% over last year. The strong revenue growth was broad based across our early development, clinical and central lab differences. Adjusted operating income was $103 million or 14.7% of revenue compared to $74 million or 11.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to demand, productivity and cost synergies, partially offset by the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement and personnel costs. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $100 million cost savings goal through 2017 related to the acquisition of Covance.
Net orders during the quarter were $830 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.18, while backlog at the end of the quarter was $6.9 billion. The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill was also 1.18.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes March 31 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of 2016. We expect revenue growth of 8.5% to 10.5% after the impact from approximately 40 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% due to strong organic growth and a 60 basis points improvement in currency. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 4% to 5.5% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 20 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% due to organic growth and a 30 basis point improvement in currency. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 6% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 2% to 5% due to strong organic growth and a 150 basis point improvement in currency. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we now expect net revenue to increase approximately 9% to 12%. 
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.55 to $8.95, which implies growth of 8% to 13% over 2015 and is an increase from our prior guidance of $8.45 to $8.85. 
As a reminder, our adjusted EPS guidance includes an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. We expect free cash flow of $900 million to $950 million, unchanged from our prior guidance.

First of all, obviously, we had good margins overall for the company at 16.4% margins. We're up around 60 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. I know your comment was probably more directed to the diagnostic side of the business, where we maintained our 19.5% margins year-over-year. As I commented in our opening remarks, our first quarter was constrained. So were not for some of those issues, we would've seen margin expansion, and really, there are 3 primary reasons. The first is our BeaconLBS business, which we had a full quarter this year with none last year. It annualizes actually now beginning into the second quarter. So given that most of it right now is still passthrough through that was constrained at our margins. We also did have bad debt rate increase for the first time, given the high patient responsibility. But again, as we said, we expect that rate to come down going forward through LaunchPad initiatives. So it won't be a constraint we believe going forward. And then finally worth noting is that with our merit increase, we did have a good merit increase year-over-year that will annualize in July of this year. So for the first half, we'll see some constrain on the margin from that. But overall, at over 7% top line growth, maintaining very strong 19.5% margin still means our operating income grew by over 7% despite those constraints. Dave?"

I think we have a sense of where we think long-term revenue growth should be, and that's with the diagnostics business kind of low to mid-single digits; and with the Covance business, mid- to higher single digits consistently over time. How that translates to EPS, obviously, is a function of capital deployment and some other things. So I think you can expect us this year to set some inspirational -- aspirational targets for EPS growth over time. I think if you look back, historically, obviously, before the major reimbursement cuts of '13 and '14, we had a very nice, I believe, was a 5-year EPS CAGR of 13-plus percent. And then we had a couple of years of flat to declining EPS simply because of decline in pricing and the cuts attended to that. But I think it's an excellent question. And as I said, I think you can expect us during this year to set out some long-term EPS growth expectations that we expect to achieve over time as these businesses are fully integrated."

The first part is just continuing to look at for right now the tuck-ins and the things that are additive to particular parts of the business that we would like to expand. So therapeutic expertise, market access, the areas where we feel that there is an interesting opportunity to either expand capabilities or enhance capabilities, with things that would be additive to the overall end-to-end capabilities of the business. Over time, as we've said, we need -- we feel that we need to be larger in the clinical business, and some of that will come from organic growth and the initiatives that we have underway, therapeutic expertise and integration with LabCorp Diagnostics, but it's my expectation that some of that will also come from acquisition. I would say that now, our focus is not on another sizable deal. Our focus is on complementary capabilities that are additive to what we have, although, obviously, we evaluate a lot of things. And we're going to look at anything that looks like the right opportunity for us, given price multiples and long-term return on invested capital. So that's how I would summarize the acquisition strategy around the Covance business. In terms of the performance, it's hard to single out any particular area because they all did so well. The business has quickened along extremely well. Deb is doing a great job as CEO and on top of that, the leadership moves that she has made have created terrific stability and sense of purpose in the organization. And so I compliment everybody at Covance from early development and preclinical all the way through clinical for a very strong performance in the quarter, just as I compliment everybody on the diagnostic side from phlebotomist to senior executive for a very strong performance there. We just really -- we really executed well on the strategic initiatives, and we performed well operationally in the quarter."

Early development, as Dave said, had another strong quarter, and the market's been recovering over the past 18 to 24 months and our demand remains strong. The utilization in the market is tightening, which results in slight price increases, and it has in the last 6 quarters. So we continue to manage our capacity very efficiently and effectively. As far as central lab, we've had fantastic growth. We've had strong volume and strong demand that's been fueled by the breadth of assays that we have because of the combination of LabCorp and Covance. We've also seen a nice conversion of the studies that we have in central labs, so that's been driving volume. In clinical trials, as they get more and more complex, the number of esoteric assays are increasing, and that allows us to be a one-stop shop for our customers, which they tend to value that. When you look at clinical, this is the largest market that we serve and one of the largest opportunities that we have for growth, both for Covance as well as for the combined entity. We had strong results of this quarter, and we continue to invest in talent and tools. In January, we added a new sales leader who was previously the head of sales for both central labs and early development. And then, as you know, we recently announced that Jonathan Zung has joined, and he brings a wealth of experience in clinical development as well as his perspective from the voice of the client. So these hires plus our investment in informatics, as Dave had talked about earlier, and the combined data is; going to allow us to address our clients' biggest pain points, which is decreasing the time for study start-ups, identifying patients' insights.

As we said, the #1 pain point in terms of getting trials started is finding sites, finding good investigators and particularly, finding patients. And you look at the statistics, most trials are under-enrolled; a large majority of trial sites never enroll the patient; oncology trials, in particular, suffer from a lack of patient enrollment, which makes it hard to get the drugs approved and brought to market. So my experience has been -- this is readily understood. It's something that our customers are very enthusiastic about, and we have a lot of demand not only for help us find patients for traditional trials but also help us find patients for observational studies, help us create a database of patients for registry studies.

We'll just keep you advised, not specific order-by-order, but generally against the $150 million target. On the $100 million that we talked about for companion diagnostics, I think we've been very clear that we have done extremely well. And I think we, in all likelihood, if I had to handicap it now, I think we'll exceed that $100 million over the 3-year period just because that business has been thriving with the combined tools and I commented on that, I think, at some length in the prepared remarks. I think on what we had identified is the last $50 million, which is the real-world evidence, that's probably a longer-term impact just because of the number of areas in which real-world evidence is likely to be applicable.

Obviously, we are seeing more and more patients in high-deductible plans, whether through exchanges or through commercial and employer plans. So more patients at high-deductible plans means more dollars out of pocket before there's any insurance payment whatsoever. What that means is with higher deductibles, higher patient responsibility at the onset of the year, and then we're also seeing plans with higher co-pays and with a greater incidence of noncover services. So between those 3 factors, you're seeing more dollars of exposure flowing to patients. And although our patient collection rate is generally very good, it still is more dollars going to patients and just puts more pressure on collecting overall -- that overall component.

So I don't think of it as -- I think of it is there is a very large incremental market for companion diagnostics, but I don't know that, that would translate into LDTs versus -- I wouldn't break it down LDTs versus kits, I would just think about it as what does the global companion diagnostics opportunity look like.

We had an impressive quarter in which we continued to demonstrate the power of our transformed company through our operating performance and progress on key strategic priorities. First quarter pro forma revenue growth was nearly 9%, with strong organic growth in both LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development. This growth, coupled with reengineering our business process through Project LaunchPad and capturing additional cost synergies from the Covance acquisition, drove another quarter of margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our excellent first quarter operational performance and business momentum give us confidence to increase our 2016 revenue and EPS outlook.
Our ongoing success is due to sustained focus on our mission to improve health and improve lives and execution on our 3 key strategic initiatives: being the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using information to change the way care is delivered. I will now update you on our progress on these strategic guideposts.
First, we are delivering diagnostic solutions through a combination of enhanced offerings, complementary acquisitions and technological innovation. We continue to lead in offering cutting-edge testing, introducing over 75 new tests to market during the past year. We are increasingly deploying our integrated testing capabilities, industry-leading science and innovative technology offerings to establish strategic partnerships with providers. Hospitals, health systems and large physician networks seek us out for our comprehensive capabilities in reference testing, supply chain management, IT and informatics, decision support and clinical trials. We are also focused on our relationship with managed care organizations, a backbone of our business. We have the strongest managed care portfolio in the industry and are proud of our deep partnerships with these plans. In addition, we are increasing our focus on partnering with government and quasi-government payers as they take on broader roles in developing new payment structures and care models.
Underpinning our core diagnostic strategy is our innovation in data integration and in tools to support enhanced connectivity, reporting and decision support. We differentiate from our competitors by providing these tools as well as the highest quality, most cost-efficient laboratory services to help a wide array of partners as they move to more extensive management of patient health and broader sharing of risk.
We complement our organic growth initiatives with carefully considered acquisitions and partnerships that drive long-term profitable growth. During the quarter, we invested approximately $100 million in strategic tuck-in deals, predominantly focused on esoteric testing, such as anatomic pathology, which provides critical diagnostic information in the determination of the appropriate course of cancer treatment.
Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we see attractive opportunities to enhance our test menu and expand our geographic footprint. 
In addition to our revenue growth initiatives, we are committed to increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience. Project LaunchPad is introducing new tools and systems to reengineer our processes as well as enhance the patient, employee and customer experience. 
With identified projects underway, such as improving our billing system and patient service center workflow, LaunchPad will sustainably reduce costs, benefiting the long-term margins of LabCorp Diagnostics. We remain on track to deliver $150 million in net savings to the 3-year period ending in 2017. Although LaunchPad is a finite program aimed at process reengineering, we will always have opportunities to drive shareholder value through further productivity and efficiency programs. Our culture of continuous improvement began long before LaunchPad and will remain after we achieve our stated LaunchPad goals. In its second year, LaunchPad has transitioned from shorter-duration initiatives to system reengineering, which entails longer time lines for execution and longer-term savings impact.
Our second core objective is bringing innovative medicines to patients faster. We execute that objective by offering unique capabilities and solutions to solve problems for our customers. Inefficiency in the clinical trial recruitment and startup process persists as the most significant pain point for our biopharma customers. We are introducing solutions that no other company can replicate to address this challenge. 
We are commercializing the combination of LabCorp's proprietary patient data and Covance's proprietary informatics and investigator database in support of enhanced study planning as well as informed clinical -- improved clinical trial placement and recruitment. 
During the quarter, the use of LabCorp data played a key role in winning a large Phase III oncology study, which increased our cumulative orders from use of LabCorp data to over $190 million. We have begun to convert this backlog into revenue and remain on track to deliver $150 million in incremental revenue through 2018.
In addition, the number of patients that provided consent through our Patient Portal to be contacted about clinical trials steadily increased throughout the quarter. We believe patients will want to be part of a process that improves the speed at which cutting-edge therapeutics are delivered to the market, and we are exploring partnerships to expand our reach with this initiative. 
Over time, we believe that this database will further differentiate our study start-up and recruitment capabilities in support of better drug development.
We continue to develop comprehensive solutions in key therapeutic areas, capitalizing on our unique end-to-end capabilities across all aspects of drug development. The scientific and clinical expertise that Covance Drug Development and LabCorp Diagnostics offer in combination, our combined laboratory expertise and our ability to deliver all of our services with the highest quality and at scale put us significantly ahead of our competitors. 
To give you a couple of specifics, our industry-leading central lab, a product of our combined capabilities, reported another outstanding quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. We recently introduced automation to our Geneva central lab to improve productivity and expanded it to double capacity, allowing us to better serve the growing demand for our enhanced menu of lab testing in Europe, Africa and around the globe. Our companion diagnostics franchise continues to thrive and is another excellent example of the power of our combined offering. Companion diagnostics are growing in importance to our customers to help them secure regulatory approval, reimbursement and market adoption for their medicines in an increasingly demanding healthcare system. 
LabCorp and Covance uniquely offer companion diagnostic capabilities from discovery through commercialization. These capabilities include development, validation, support for in vitro diagnostic kits, ability to responsibly launch laboratory developed diagnostics, market analysis, reimbursement support, lifecycle management and timely commercialization of drugs and their companion diagnostics to our sizable base of providers and their patients. We see strong revenue growth in companion diagnostic services across many therapeutic areas, including oncology, inflammation and central nervous system disorders. We remain confident that we will deliver $100 million in incremental revenue in this area through 2018 and highlight our differentiated capabilities from our competitors.
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is delivered through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions. In diagnostics, as noted, we are expanding our menu of decision support tools and integrated content to assist payers, physicians, health systems and patients in better understanding and managing medical conditions. 
We also recently marked the one-year anniversary of BeaconLBS's commercial launch, and we are pleased with the technology's clear financial and clinical benefits. In addition, we are seeing increased provider satisfaction with BeaconLBS's test and lab selection functionality as well as its ease of use. We intend to add new capabilities to BeaconLBS this year and remain optimistic about its introduction in new markets.
In drug development, we are enhancing Covance's Xcellerate suite of services to enable faster patient enrollment, more efficient site monitoring and improved study planning. Xcellerate helps reduce the time and cost of trials by providing an easy-to-use replicable tool to improve insight into trial site performance and trial success. We will also implement new approaches to lower the patient burden and improve the patient journey through clinical trials. We recently launched a suite of mobile capabilities designed to help biopharmaceutical and technology companies navigate the rapidly evolving global health landscape.  Through this novel offering, we will provide regulatory consulting and validation services to help companies certify the accuracy and consistency of mobile devices and applications for use in clinical trials. Through all of this activity, we have been and will be excellent stewards of capital. We have made steady progress in our commitment to delever the balance sheet, and we are now at approximately 3.5x leverage approaching our target. We continue to deploy capital towards strategic acquisitions and expect to be in a position to return capital to shareholders in the second half of the year.
By virtue of our investments in innovation, talent, science, quality, operational excellence and distinctive technology, LabCorp is increasingly well positioned to profit from global opportunities across our $200 billion addressable market. I am proud of my colleagues who every day reflect our core values of excellence, integrity, teamwork, courage, inspiration and ownership as they work tirelessly to improve the health and lives of patients around the globe. Our team's efforts are the reason for our success this quarter, and they will continue to be LabCorp's greatest competitive advantage. I thank them for their great work and the results they continue to deliver.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 30% over last year. Covance contributed 24% year-over-year growth due to strong demand as well as the inclusion of a full quarter of results compared to a partial quarter last year. The remainder of the increase of 6% was driven by LabCorp Diagnostics' strong organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. Gross profit for the quarter was $777 million or 33.9% of revenue compared to $625 million or 35.3% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to strong demand, productivity and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to the mix impact from a full quarter of Covance results. On a pro forma basis, gross margin would've increased 50 basis points over last year.
SG&A for the quarter was $412 million or 17.9% of revenue compared to $442 million or 25% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $10 million, primarily related to the integration of Covance and executive transition expenses compared to $119 million a year ago, which were primarily related to the acquisition of Covance. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $402 million or 17.5% of revenue compared to $322 million or 18.2%. The increase in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to acquisitions, personnel costs and bad debt, while the percentage of our SG&A benefited from a full quarter of Covance's lower rate. On a pro forma basis, adjusted SG&A would've improved 10 basis points over last year. 
During the quarter, we recorded $19 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to the closure of redundant facilities and general integration initiatives. Amortization expense for the quarter was $44 million, up from $31 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions.
Operating income for the quarter was $302 million or 13.2% of revenue compared to $132 million or 7.5% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $74 million, adjusted operating income was $376 million or 16.4% of revenue compared to $302 million or 17.1% last year. The decline in margin was primarily due to the mix impact from a full quarter of Covance results.  On a pro forma basis, adjusted operating margin would've improved 60 basis points. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $55 million compared to $104 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was due to nonrecurring acquisition-related items of $53 million recorded last year, partially offset by higher debt balances following the acquisition of Covance. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 37.3%. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 36.5%, up from 35.4% last year, primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be comparable to last year's rate of 35.3%.
Net earnings for the quarter were $160 million or $1.55 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.02 in the quarter, up 15% from $1.76 last year. These results included a net gain in the quarter of $0.05 per diluted share on the sale of investment securities from our venture fund. 
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $123 million compared to negative $87 million in the first quarter of 2015. Last year, cash flow was negatively impacted by $154 million of onetime charges relating to the acquisition of Covance. 
Excluding these charges, operating cash flow was up $57 million over last year due primarily to improved earnings. 
Capital expenditures totaled $71 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from $34 million or 1.9% last year. Capital expenditures in the quarter were in line with typical spending levels, while last year's CapEx was low due to the delayed spending related to the acquisition and integration of Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $52 million in the first quarter, an increase from $33 million last year, excluding the nonrecurring items.
At quarter end, our cash balance was $696 million compared to $716 million at the end of 2015. Total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. During the quarter, we invested $97 million in acquisitions, and our leverage declined to 3.5x debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are represented on a pro forma basis for all periods as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2015, and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, BeaconLBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. The revenue increase includes a benefit from BeaconLBS of 1% and unfavorable currency translation of 0.6%. Revenue per acquisition increased 2.7%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing revenue grew at a faster rate than core testing revenue. Total volume increased by 4% of which organic volume was 3.4% and acquisition volume was 0.6%. Volume benefited from the impact of weather and the additional day that was partially offset by the timing of the Easter holiday.
LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $310 million or 19.5% of revenue compared to $290 million or 19.5% last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to volume, price, mix and productivity, partially offset by personnel costs and bad debt. Although the operating margin was consistent with last year, it was constrained by the mix impact from BeaconLBS and an increase in the bad debt rate of approximately 25 basis points due to an increase in patient responsibility. For the remainder of the year, we expect our bad debt rate to improve, benefiting from our LaunchPad initiatives. We remain on track to deliver our $150 million LaunchPad savings goal over the 3-year period ending 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $703 million, an increase of 12.6% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 160 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, revenue increased 17.9% over last year. The strong revenue growth was broad based across our early development, clinical and central lab businesses. Adjusted operating income was $103 million or 14.7% of revenue compared to $74 million or 11.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to demand, productivity and cost synergies, partially offset by the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement and personnel costs. We remain on track to achieve our 3-year $100 million cost savings goal through 2017 related to the acquisition of Covance.
Net orders during the quarter were $830 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.18, while backlog at the end of the quarter was $6.9 billion. The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill was also 1.18.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes March 31 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of 2016. We expect revenue growth of 8.5% to 10.5% after the impact from approximately 40 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% due to strong organic growth and a 60 basis point improvement in currency. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 4% to 5.5% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 20 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% due to organic growth and a 30 basis point improvement in currency. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 6% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 2% to 5% due to strong organic growth and a 150 basis point improvement in currency. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we now expect net revenue to increase approximately 9% to 12%. 
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.55 to $8.95, which implies growth of 8% to 13% over 2015 and is an increase from our prior guidance of $8.45 to $8.85. 
As a reminder, our adjusted EPS guidance includes an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. We expect free cash flow of $900 million to $950 million, unchanged from our prior guidance.

First of all, obviously, we had good margins overall for the company at 16.4% margins. We're up around 60 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. I know your comment was probably more directed to the diagnostic side of the business, where we maintained our 19.5% margins year-over-year. As I commented in our opening remarks, our first quarter was constrained. So were it not for some of those issues, we would've seen margin expansion, and really, there are 3 primary reasons. The first is our BeaconLBS business, which we had a full quarter this year with none last year. It annualizes actually now beginning into the second quarter. So given that most of it right now is still passthrough, that was a constraint on our margins. We also did have bad debt rate increase for the first time, given the high patient responsibility. But again, as we said, we expect that rate to come down going forward through LaunchPad initiatives. So it won't be a constraint we believe going forward. And then finally worth noting is that with our merit increase, we did have a good merit increase year-over-year, that will annualize in July of this year. So for the first half, we'll see some constraint on the margin from that. But overall, at over 7% top line growth, maintaining very strong 19.5% margin still means our operating income grew by over 7% despite those constraints. Dave?"

How that translates to EPS, obviously, is a function of capital deployment and some other things. So I think you can expect us this year to set some inspirational -- aspirational targets for EPS growth over time. I think if you look back, historically, obviously, before the major reimbursement cuts of '13 and '14, we had a very nice, I believe it was a 5-year EPS CAGR of 13-plus percent. And then we had a couple of years of flat to declining EPS simply because of declining pricing and the cuts attendant to that. But I think it's an excellent question. And as I said, I think you can expect us during this year to set out some long-term EPS growth expectations that we expect to achieve over time as these businesses are fully integrated."

The first part is just continuing to look at, for right now, the tuck-ins and the things that are additive to particular parts of the business that we would like to expand. So therapeutic expertise, market access, the areas where we feel that there is an interesting opportunity to either expand capabilities or enhance capabilities with things that would be additive to the overall end-to-end capabilities of the business. Over time, as we've said, we need -- we feel that we need to be larger in the clinical business, and some of that will come from organic growth and the initiatives that we have underway in therapeutic expertise and integration with LabCorp Diagnostics, but it's my expectation that some of that will also come from acquisition. I would say that now our focus is not on another sizable deal. Our focus is on complementary capabilities that are additive to what we have, although, obviously, we evaluate a lot of things. And we're going to look at anything that looks like the right opportunity for us, given price, multiples and long-term return on invested capital. So that's how I would summarize the acquisition strategy around the Covance business. In terms of the performance, it's hard to single out any particular area because they all did so well. The business has quickened along extremely well. Deb is doing a great job as CEO and on top of that, the leadership moves that she has made have created terrific stability and sense of purpose in the organization. And so I compliment everybody at Covance from early development and preclinical all the way through clinical for a very strong performance in the quarter, just as I compliment everybody on the diagnostic side from phlebotomist to senior executive for a very strong performance there. We just really -- we really executed well on the strategic initiatives, and we performed well operationally in the quarter."

Early development, as Dave said, had another strong quarter, and the market's been recovering over the past 18 to 24 months and our demand remains strong. The utilization in the market is tightening, which results in slight price increases, and it has in the last 6 quarters. So we continue to manage our capacity very efficiently and effectively. As far as central labs, we've had fantastic growth. We've had strong volume and strong demand that's been fueled by the breadth of assays that we have because of the combination of LabCorp and Covance. We've also seen a nice conversion of the studies that we have in central labs, so that's been driving volume. In clinical trials, as they get more and more complex, the number of esoteric assays are increasing, and that allows us to be a one-stop shop for our customers, which they tend to value that. When you look at clinical, this is the largest market that we serve and one of the largest opportunities that we have for growth, both for Covance as well as for the combined entity. We had strong results this quarter and we continue to invest in talent and tools. In January, we added a new sales leader who was previously the head of sales for both central labs and early development. And then, as you know, we recently announced that Jonathan Zung has joined, and he brings a wealth of experience in clinical development as well as his perspective from the voice of the client. So these hires plus our investment in informatics, as Dave had talked about earlier, and the combined data is going to allow us to address our clients' biggest pain points, which is decreasing the time for study start-ups, identifying patients' insight. So we are very pleased with the results this quarter."

As we said, the #1 pain point in terms of getting trials started is finding sites, finding good investigators and, particularly, finding patients. And you look at the statistics, most trials are under-enrolled; a large majority of trial sites never enroll a patient; oncology trials, in particular, suffer from a lack of patient enrollment, which makes it hard to get the drugs approved and brought to market. So my experience has been -- this is readily understood. It's something that our customers are very enthusiastic about, and we have a lot of demand not only for -- help us find patients for traditional trials but also help us find patients for observational studies, help us create a database of patients for registry studies.

We'll just keep you advised, not specific order-by-order, but generally against the $150 million target. On the $100 million that we talked about for companion diagnostics, I think we've been very clear that we have done extremely well. And I think we, in all likelihood, if I had to handicap it now, I think we will exceed that $100 million over the 3-year period, just because that business has been thriving with the combined tools and I commented on that, I think, at some length in the prepared remarks. I think on what we had identified is the last $50 million, which is the real-world evidence, that's probably a longer-term impact just because of the number of areas in which real-world evidence is likely to be applicable.

Obviously, we are seeing more and more patients in high-deductible plans, whether through exchanges or through commercial and employer plans. So more patients in high-deductible plans means more dollars out of pocket before there's any insurance payment whatsoever. What that means is with higher deductibles, higher patient responsibility at the onset of the year, and then we're also seeing plans with higher co-pays and with a greater incidence of non-covered services. So between those 3 factors, you're seeing more dollars of exposure flowing to patients. And although our patient collection rate is generally very good, it still is more dollars going to patients.

While we did pick up plus or minus around $15 million in cash from the sale of those securities, that does not show up in free cash flow. It's below the operating line. So that cash would not be included. So it's really just the operating improvement impacting EPS that would be cash-related. Given where we are in the year and we have a $50 million spread between the $900 million and $950 million and the fact that the first quarter is seasonally low, we did around $52 million of free cash versus our $900 million-plus for the year, we felt it appropriate to maintain the current level of our guidance.

It's an exciting yet LabCorp to be as we continue to establish ourselves as the world's leading health care diagnostics company. Operationally, we reported another strong quarter led by organic growth and LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance drug development. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 7%, continued margin expansion and another quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our continued business momentum is attributable to our commitment to improve health and improve lives around the globe, driven by our focus on our 3 strategic priorities: delivering world-class diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using information to change the way care is provided. 
I'll now update you on our key activities during the quarter and our progress in each of these objectives. First, to be the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, we continue to expand our test menu, innovate in science and complement our internal efforts with strategic acquisitions. This morning is exciting, as I said, because we announced another important acquisition. We will acquire Sequenom, a market leader in noninvasive prenatal testing and reproductive health. Sequenom is the first company to offer a clinically validated noninvasive prenatal test, and the more than 500,000 tests it has performed to date give it the largest clinical evidence base in the country. This is a highly strategic acquisition as Sequenom's best-in-class offerings and strong R&D pipeline perfectly complements LabCorp's extensive women's health test menu. We will now offer patients and physicians one source for the full range of women's health reproductive genetics and NIPT testing.
Furthermore, Sequenom spans our geographic reach, both domestically with New York licensure and internationally through licensing and commercial partnerships with emphasis on the European Union and the Asia Pacific region. The transaction also meets our financial criteria, making it, as I said, an important and highly strategic transaction. 
I note that the acquisition of Sequenom is much like our strategic decision to acquire LipoScience and its unique NMR lipo profile test 18 months ago, which has translated into strong and consistent organic growth. As we expected, our reach in customer relationships, coupled with the test strong clinical evidence and numerous expert society recommendations, has established us as the leading diagnostic laboratory for comprehensive cardiovascular testing and risk assessment.
We also continue to focus on extending our core testing capabilities beyond the traditional health care setting. For example, our forensics business is a leader in high-quality forensic DNA testing solutions, helping law enforcement agencies solve crimes across the globe. is one of 2 labs partnering with law enforcement across the U.S. to process a significant backlog of sexual assault evidence kits aiding in solving open criminal cases. In addition, we continue to capitalize in our global footprint and our chemistry and microbiology expertise to provide the highest quality testing and turnaround time to a growing number of food safety customers. We will next build on our track record of scientific innovation into food safety through commercialization of new technologies that enable faster passage and detection and expect to drive growth through acquisitions that increase our scale in this growing and fragmented market.
Second, to bring innovative medicines to patients faster, we continue to enhance our data capabilities, develop innovative solutions and expand our therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development. Data are an essential ingredient to improve patient recruitment and study start-up. We have access to unique data generated from each of our business segments. LabCorp Diagnostics provides a growing proprietary database of patient-specific information, including demographics, lab values and diagnosis codes. 
Covance Drug Development has a growing base of insights into global investigator and site performance obtained through our central laboratory network and clinical trial experience. We are uniquely able to link this data to individual patients and sites, empowering patients to be more directly engaged with their own health care, helping enrich our clinical trial proposals and speeding patient recruitment. 
In addition, our unique solutions offer client their choice of our end-to-end services offering, fostering deeper customer relationships and expanded opportunities to grow our business. For example, our companion diagnostics franchise continues to lead the industry as evidenced by important new test launched during the quarter. We were the only national laboratory to introduce a Roche cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 for non-small cell lung cancer patients, the first blood-based liquid biopsy test cleared by FDA for clinical use. We also extended our leadership in immuno-oncology through the commercial launch of a complementary PDL 1 diagnostic test for bladder cancer, our third PDL 1 launch and fourth PDL 1 indication in the past year. Our world-class companion diagnostic capabilities offer our customers unmatched end-to-end development and commercialization expertise. 
Tying together all of our drug development growth initiatives, we focus on key therapeutic areas such as genetics, rare and orphan diseases, oncology and infectious cease. These strategic focus areas combine the best capabilities of both organizations to improve health and improve lives. 
All of our drug development businesses performed well during the quarter. We saw a strong revenue growth in clinical, early development and central labs. Customers have consistently awarded us new orders since the acquisition appreciate the benefits of our end-to-end offering and expanded capabilities. 
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is delivered through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions. In diagnostics, we are expanding our menu of decision support tools and integrated content to assist payers, physicians, health systems and patients in better understanding and managing disease. is now entering its second year, and we expect it to grow as we add new markets and capabilities to the platform. 
In drug development, we are enhancing Covance's accelerated suite of services to enable faster patient enrollment, more efficient site monitoring an improved study planning. Accelerate monitoring has been successfully implemented as the exclusive central monitoring portfolio for one of our larger partner's worldwide clinical trials portfolio and is being used by over a dozen other clients. 
In closing, we continue to invest in assets, people and capabilities that will drive profitable growth, unlock the value of our growing organization and further our mission to improve health and improve lives around the globe.
I want to specifically compliment both the Sequenom and LabCorp acquisition teams to the extraordinary efforts that have led to today's announcement. The teams worked tirelessly to get us to the finish line in this important and highly strategic deal. I continue to be enormously proud of the work of all of my 50,000 colleagues, and I thank them for the direct positive impact they have on millions of lives every day.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. Revenue for the quart",1289,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 7.4% over last year, primarily due to strong organic growth in both segments and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 6.4%. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $827 million or 34.7% of revenue compared to $773 million or 34.8% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to strong revenue growth, partially offset by personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact from faster growth in Covance drug development, which has a lower gross margin than the company's average. Excluding the mix impact, gross margin would've improved 10 basis points.
SG&A for the quarter was $408 million or 17.1% of revenue compared to $391 million or 17.6% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $8 million, primarily related to the integration of Covance and our LaunchPad initiative compared to $9 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $400 million or 16.8% of revenue compared to $382 million or 17.2%. The increase in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to acquisitions and personal costs. The improvement in the SG&A rate was due to continued expense control and the mix impact from faster growth and Covance Drug Development, which has a lower SG&A rate than the company's average. Excluding the mix impact, the SG&A rate would've improved 20 basis points.
During the quarter, we reported $7 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to severance and the closure of redundant facilities. Amortization expense for the quarter was $45 million, consistent with last year. 
Operating income for the quarter was $367 million or 15.4% of revenue compared to $323 million or 14.6% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $60 million, adjusted operating income was $427 million or 17.9% of revenue compared to $391 million or 17.6% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to strong revenue growth, partially offset by personnel costs. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $54 million compared to $58 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was due to lower debt balances, which included repayment of $339 million of debt during the quarter. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 36.6% compared to 36.1% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%, the same as last year. We continue to expect our 2016 full year adjusted tax rate to be 35.3%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $198 million or $1.91 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.31 in the quarter, up 11% from $2.09 last year.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $344 million compared to $397 million last year. The decline was primarily due to the timing of income taxes paid last year. Capital expenditures totaled $67 million or 2.8% of revenue, down from $69 million or 3.1% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $277 million in the quarter compared to $328 million last year. We continue to expect free cash flow to be between $900 million and $950 million for the full year. 
At quarter end, our cash balance was $640 million down from $696 million at the end of the first quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.1 billion.
During the quarter, we invested $51 million in acquisitions and paid down $339 million of debt, reducing the company's leverage to 3.3x gross debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. Segment results exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historic reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. The increase of revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions partially offset by currency. The revenue increase includes unfavorable currency translation of 0.3%. Revenue per requisition increased 3.5%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing. 
Total volume increased by 2.1%, of which organic volume was 1.2% and acquisition volume was 0.9%.
LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 21.5% of revenue compared to $337 million or 21.4% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to price, mix, organic volume, tuck-in acquisitions and our LaunchPad initiative, which was partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on track to achieve our LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $722 million, an increase of 12.2% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 70 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, revenue increased 16.4% over last year. The strong revenue growth was broad-based across our early development clinical and central lab businesses. 
Adjusted operating income was $108 million or 14.9% of revenue compared to $90 million or 14% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to strong revenue growth and cost synergies, which was partially offset by the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement and personnel costs. We remain on track to deliver cost synergies of $100 million for the 3-year period ending 2017. 
Net orders during the quarter were $818 million, up 11% over last year, representing a net book to bill for the quarter of 1.13 and a trailing 12-month net book to bill of 1.17. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes June 30 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the year. In addition, our guidance excludes the impact from the acquisition of Sequenom, which we expect to close by year-end. We expect revenue growth of 9.5% to 10.5% after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 8.5% to 10.5%. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 4.5% to 5.5% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 10 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4% to 4.5%. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 7% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 110 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance to 6% to 9% due to strong organic growth, partially offset by a 60 basis point unfavorable change in currency. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we expect net revenue to increase 11% to 13%. 
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $8.95, which implies a growth rate of 9% to 13% over 2015 and is an increase from our prior guidance of $8.55 to $8.95. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS guidance includes an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. 
Finally, we continue to expect record free cash flow for the year of $900 million to $950 million. This concludes our formal remarks, and we will now take questions. Operator?"

So I think the major challenges for Sequenom as a stand-alone entity have been -- have related to rev of test menu and scale. I think under [indiscernible] leadership in the last 9 months, Sequenom has made significant improvements in technology and operations, but the reality is there still is a need for a comprehensive women's health portfolio. There still is a need for broader reach into the OB/GYN office. There's a need for region in terms of convenience of being able to order NIPT testing on one requisition form with the same orders as other women's health-related testing. So anything from the operational perspective, we think about several opportunities to make this success, and we strongly believe it will be a success. Number one is just improving the laboratory operation and the efficiency of that operation, which as you know, is something that we excel at. Number two is expanding the reach of their sales force, which we think of very highly, and extending that into the primary care in the OB/GYN market. And the number three is the comprehensiveness of the test menu and the opportunity to create one point where physicians could order all of what they need in women's health and reproductive genetics."

It's Dave. So it's just more complicated to maintain a send-out relationship when you're talking about the high-end reproductive genetic testing, and it's more complicated, obviously, for somebody like Sequenom because they're not offering the full test menu there. You're dealing with organizing logistics, you're dealing with routing blood from one place to another, routing samples from one place to another, and you're dealing with delays in turnaround time as a result of the logistics. So although a send-out relationship in concept sounds attractive, it actually leads to more complexity. And as we think about how to be successful in the business, generally, and in this aspect of the business, in particular, what the physicians and the patients want is more simplicity. So they want to be able to order out one req form, they want to be able to have one courier pick it up, they want to be able to have it go to one place where the logistics are handled by LabCorp instead of being handled by 2 different entities. They want to get the results back on one report form, and they want to have one place to go for interpretation if genetic counseling, for example, is required. So from my perspective, what we're doing is we're taking the opportunity to integrate a best-in-class NIPT test into a best-in-class women's health portfolio. And that, in my mind, leads to an enormous opportunity to grow in that market, which is one of the fastest-growing parts of the diagnostics industry in which we think over the long term as the technology improves and the test menu improves around, not only noninvasive prenatal testing but all sorts of noninvasive testing that's now done through more invasive methods, that they will be extremely well positioned to succeed."

So we are seeing significant progress in payer coverage for noninvasive prenatal testing for average-risk patients. So the opportunity there obviously grows the market significantly because it provides at least the potential to reach a couple of hundred million covered lives as opposed to what we would characterize as merely the high-risk market. And you're seeing payer acceptance of it because the technology is sound, the clinical results are well validated. And again, with Sequenom, you have over 500,000 tests performed, and you have the largest clinical database to support the expansion of the market. In terms of expansion of the testing, obviously, Sequenom has been at the forefront in terms of offering fetal fractionation, micro deletions. Now the genome aspect of NIPT to expand upon the original MaterniT21 test. So yes, we think there will continue to be opportunities there. And then, I will also parenthetically mention the talking points Bill point to the international opportunity that this provides us should not be underestimated because Sequenom is focused on Europe and Asia Pacific, and those are markets where we think there's still plenty of opportunity for adoption of noninvasive prenatal testing."

And again, the number of tests that they performed and the clinical evidence and support will really help in terms of the average -- the demonstration that this test makes sense for the average-risk population. In terms of the managed-care contract, typically, the managed-care relationships fall under our contracts post acquisition. We've carefully examined to the extent we're able to do so, obviously, as part of the diligent process our managed-care contracts versus their managed-care contracts, and we don't see material difference there.

As you know, CMS started out with the idea of the bundle demonstration or the bundled payment for the joint replacements. Now they proposed bundled payments for cardiovascular.

As you know, CMS started out with the idea of the bundle demonstration or the bundled payment for the joint replacements. Now they proposed bundled payments for cardiovascular. Obviously, it's going to take some time to see how that really plays out. But I would say that, particularly when you move away from the inpatient setting, so let's distinguish between the inpatient and the outpatient setting. In the inpatient setting, I continue to believe that these types of bundled structures will encourage hospitals to look at how they can reduce the cost of the components of the bundle. And on the laboratory and the diagnostic side, that obviously puts us in a very strong competitive position. On the outpatient side, as you look at bundled payments for total care, again, physicians who are treating patients who are owned or affiliated with health systems are going to be looking at how do I get each component of what I need to treat this patient at the highest quality and the most effective price point, and we're going to be extremely well positioned. With cardiovascular, in particular, as we think about cardiovascular risk because of LipoScience and the NMR profile and because of our comprehensive suite of cardiovascular services and risk assessment services, I think we're going to be extremely well positioned to be a valuable ally to the hospitals as they think about how to make the most of any sort of cardiovascular bundling."

We have plenty of lab management deals, but we try to frame them in the context of an overall partnering relationship around pathology, around reference testing around lab management. And we, certainly, are having these conversations about -- in every hospital executive I talk to, it's about how do we continue to provide the highest quality care to our patients and continue to reduce the cost side of the equation.

In recent quarter, we actually added a large oncology study where we had an integrated offering as well as what we did in the rare and orphan disease. We had a win in that category as well. I think when we look at the central labs and specifically, that business has taken market share for many years and continues to do so. And now with the acquisition of LabCorp, we have even more offerings that we can provide to clients whether it's in anatomical pathology or genomics around the globe.

And I just want to say that I think CMS -- I'm pleased that CMS has been willing to consider the industry's comments. I think ACLA has done a terrific job and the hospital associations as well in bringing these issues to CMS' attention. I continue to be disappointed that the data showed that 50% of lab revenue is still going through the hospitals even though the volume is lower, considerably lower than what goes through the independent labs. That means hospital pricing has to be way higher, and we all know it is. So to say that we're doing a market survey and essentially take into account only a very limited slice of that market, to me does not do what Congress ask CMS to do. Having said that, our visibility into what the impact or the floor will be is still limited until we go through the process of understanding how many more labs are captured and what the survey looks like. In terms of offsetting the financial impact, I think it's important that people think of LaunchPad as a long-term initiative for our business, not a as specific projects. And so what we said about LaunchPad is that we're going to get the savings over a 3-year period. But what we've also said is LaunchPad has now transitioned into organizational structural activities as opposed to things like our supply chain. And a lot of the things that we're doing around LaunchPad, particularly now focusing on that front-end engagement with the patient, are going to help us to offset the impact of whatever the PAMA and the clinical lab fee schedule reductions in 2018 turn out to be."

So it's a pretty significant accomplishment that, that team took an idea and a concept and really built it into a business that's now generating a pretty significant amount of revenue. The results from BeaconLBS when you look at the things that the team set out to achieve, the out-of-network lab spend in Florida has declined, the tech selection based on evidence-based guidance has improved, the use of the lab network has increased, which leads to lower consumer out-of-pocket costs. So these are all, I think, positives for the -- for what BeaconLBS can accomplish. Are there things we want to do to make it better? Absolutely. We want to make it more attractive to providers in helping them to select the right tests, so it becomes a positive tool for choosing the right diagnostic testing. We want to expand the scope of it to increase the utility. Again, you look at the surveys, and physicians say 30% of the time they're not sure what tests to order, particularly when it comes to molecular testing. So we have the opportunity to make BeaconLBS something that becomes a positive in the provider office and helps them get the right tests and interpret it correctly. Those enhancements are in process. And obviously, there are also competitive tools in the marketplace, and we want to be better than the competitive tools. As we enhance BeaconLBS, as we extend its capabilities, as it becomes more and more integrated into EMR systems, I think we will move to new markets. And I think my perception is that it's a -- United sees it as a valued tool to help them with correct lab test selection and management of their network spend, and we're both anxious to see it grow and expand into new markets."

So we don't have a perfect idea, but we always assume there's going to be some attrition. One of the nice things about this test though is we really do feel that it's best-in-class. And so I think the likelihood that there's going to be significant attrition is not the same as it would be in a typical acquiring another -- just acquiring another laboratory. I think the other reality is as you get into highly specialized testing that's really dependent on capabilities and methodology and the clinical database that there is less appetite for switching than there is if you're using just one reference lab and now it's acquired by another reference lab. So we feel good about the ability to retain the key customers and again are counting on looking forward to working with the Sequenom team to make that the case."

In the out years, the combination of the top line revenue growth opportunity and bringing some greater efficiency to their laboratory operation, we think will give us the opportunity for the acquisition to be materially accretive. In terms of what we look for in acquisitions, we've always talked about expanding our capabilities. We've talked about geographic footprint. We've talked about test menu, 2 very important criteria for this transaction. And we talked about strategic fit with the business, whether it's the diagnostics business or the drug development business. And in terms of the financial criteria, I mean we look at many multiples. Obviously, we look at multiples of EBITDA, pre and post, we look at DCF, but the fundamental premise is accretive in year 1 and meets our cost of capital sort of by year 3 to 4. And again, this transaction falls squarely within those metrics, and our aspiration is that every transaction that we do when we deploy capital would fall squarely within those metrics."

It's an exciting day at LabCorp today as we continue to establish ourselves as the world's leading health care diagnostics company.

It's an exciting day at LabCorp today as we continue to establish ourselves as the world's leading health care diagnostics company. Operationally, we reported another strong quarter led by organic growth in LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 7%, continued margin expansion and another quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our continued business momentum is attributable to our commitment to improve health and improve lives around the globe, driven by our focus on our 3 strategic priorities: delivering world-class diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using information to change the way care is provided. 
I'll now update you on our key activities during the quarter and our progress on each of these objectives. First, to be the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, we continue to expand our test menu, innovate in science and complement our internal efforts with strategic acquisitions. This morning is exciting, as I said, because we announced another important acquisition. We will acquire Sequenom, a market leader in noninvasive prenatal testing and reproductive health. Sequenom is the first company to offer a clinically validated noninvasive prenatal test, and the more than 500,000 tests it has performed to date give it the largest clinical evidence base in the industry. This is a highly strategic acquisition as Sequenom's best-in-class offerings and strong R&D pipeline perfectly complement LabCorp's extensive women's health test menu. We will now offer patients and physicians one source for the full range of women's health reproductive genetics and NIPT testing.
Furthermore, Sequenom expands our geographic reach, both domestically with New York licensure, and internationally through licensing and commercial partnerships, with emphasis on the European Union and the Asia Pacific region. The transaction also meets our financial criteria, making it, as I said, an important and highly strategic transaction. 
I note that the acquisition of Sequenom is much like our strategic decision to acquire LipoScience and its unique NMR LipoProfile Test 18 months ago, which is translated into strong and consistent organic growth. As we expected, our reach in customer relationships, coupled with the test's strong clinical evidence and numerous expert society recommendations has established us as the leading diagnostic laboratory for comprehensive cardiovascular testing and risk assessment.
We also continue to focus on extending our core testing capabilities beyond the traditional health care setting. For example, our Bode Cellmark Forensics business is the leader in high-quality forensic DNA testing solutions, helping law enforcement agencies solve crimes across the globe. Bode Cellmark is one of 2 labs partnering with law enforcement across the U.S. to process a significant backlog of sexual assault evidence kits, aiding in solving open criminal cases. In addition, we continue to capitalize on our global footprint and our chemistry and microbiology expertise to provide the highest-quality testing and rapid turnaround time to a growing number of food safety customers. We will next build on our track record of scientific innovation into food safety through commercialization of new technologies that enable faster pathogen detection and expect to drive growth through acquisitions that increase our scale in this growing and fragmented market.
Second, to bring innovative medicines to patients faster, we continue to enhance our data capabilities, develop innovative solutions and expand our therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development. Data are an essential ingredient to improve patient recruitment and study startup. We have access to unique data generated from each of our business segments. LabCorp Diagnostics provides a growing proprietary database of patient-specific information, including demographics, lab values and diagnosis codes. 
Covance Drug Development has a growing base of insights into global investigator and site performance obtained through our central laboratory network and clinical trial experience. We are uniquely able to link this data to individual patients and sites, empowering patients to be more directly engaged with their own health care, helping enrich our clinical trial proposals and speeding patient recruitment. 
In addition, our unique solutions offer clients their choice of our end-to-end services offering, fostering deeper customer relationships and expanded opportunities to grow our business. For example, our companion diagnostics franchise continues to lead the industry as evidenced by important new tests launched during the quarter. We were the only national laboratory to introduce a Roche cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 for non-small cell lung cancer patients, the first blood-based liquid biopsy test cleared by FDA for clinical use. We also extended our leadership in immuno-oncology through the commercial launch of a complementary PD-L1 diagnostic test for bladder cancer, our third PD-L1 launch and fourth PD-L1 indication in the past year. Our world-class companion diagnostic capabilities offer our customers unmatched end-to-end development and commercialization expertise. 
Tying together all of our drug development growth initiatives, we focus on key therapeutic areas such as genetics, rare and orphan diseases, oncology and infectious disease. These strategic focus areas combine the best capabilities of both organizations to improve health and improve lives. 
All of our drug development businesses performed well during the quarter. We saw a strong revenue growth in clinical, early development and central labs. Customers have consistently awarded us new orders since the acquisition as they appreciate the benefits of our end-to-end offering and expanded capabilities. 
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is delivered through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions. In diagnostics, we are expanding our menu of decision support tools and integrated content to assist payers, physicians, health systems and patients in better understanding and managing disease. BeaconLBS is now entering its second year, and we expect it to grow as we add new markets and capabilities to the platform.
In drug development, we are enhancing Covance's accelerated suite of services to enable faster patient enrollment, more efficient site monitoring an improved study planning. Xcellerate Monitoring has been successfully implemented as the exclusive central monitoring portfolio for one of our larger partner's worldwide clinical trials portfolio and is being used by over a dozen other clients. 
In closing, we continue to invest in assets, people and capabilities that will drive profitable growth, unlock the value of our growing organization and further our mission to improve health and improve lives around the globe.
I want to specifically compliment both the Sequenom and the LabCorp acquisition teams to the extraordinary efforts that have led to today's announcement. The teams worked tirelessly to get us to the finish line in this important and highly strategic deal. I continue to be enormously proud of the work of all of my 50,000 colleagues, and I thank them for the direct positive impact they have on millions of lives every day.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

Revenue for the quar",1287,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 7.4% over last year, primarily due to strong organic growth in both segments and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 6.4%.
Gross profit for the quarter was $827 million or 34.7% of revenue compared to $773 million or 34.8% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to strong revenue growth, partially offset by personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact from faster growth in Covance Drug Development, which has a lower gross margin than the company's average. Excluding the mix impact, gross margin would've improved 10 basis points.
SG&A for the quarter was $408 million or 17.1% of revenue compared to $391 million or 17.6% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $8 million, primarily related to the integration of Covance and our LaunchPad initiative compared to $9 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $400 million or 16.8% of revenue compared to $382 million or 17.2%. The increase in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to acquisitions and personnel costs. The improvement in the SG&A rate was due to continued expense control and the mix impact from faster growth in Covance Drug Development, which has a lower SG&A rate than the company's average. Excluding the mix impacts, the SG&A rate would've improved 20 basis points.
During the quarter, we reported $7 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to severance and the closure of redundant facilities. Amortization expense for the quarter was $45 million, consistent with last year. 
Operating income for the quarter was $367 million or 15.4% of revenue compared to $323 million or 14.6% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $60 million, adjusted operating income was $427 million or 17.9% of revenue compared to $391 million or 17.6% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to strong revenue growth, partially offset by personnel costs.
Interest expense for the quarter was $54 million compared to $58 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was due to lower debt balances, which included repayment of $339 million of debt during the quarter.
The tax rate for the quarter was 36.6% compared to 36.1% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%, the same as last year. We continue to expect our 2016 full year adjusted tax rate to be 35.3%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $198 million or $1.91 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.31 in the quarter, up 11% from $2.09 last year.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $344 million compared to $397 million last year. The decline was primarily due to the timing of income taxes paid last year. Capital expenditures totaled $67 million or 2.8% of revenue, down from $69 million or 3.1% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $277 million in the quarter compared to $328 million last year. We continue to expect free cash flow to be between $900 million and $950 million for the full year. 
At quarter end, our cash balance was $640 million down from $696 million at the end of the first quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.1 billion.
During the quarter, we invested $51 million in acquisitions and paid down $339 million of debt, reducing the company's leverage to 3.3x gross debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. Segment results exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions partially offset by currency. The revenue increase includes unfavorable currency translation of 0.3%. Revenue per requisition increased 3.5%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing. 
Total volume increased by 2.1%, of which organic volume was 1.2% and acquisition volume was 0.9%.
LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 21.5% of revenue compared to $337 million or 21.4% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to price mix, organic volume, tuck-in acquisitions and our LaunchPad initiative, which was partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on-track to achieve our LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $722 million, an increase of 12.2% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 70 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, revenue increased 16.4% over last year. The strong revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central lab businesses. 
Adjusted operating income was $108 million or 14.9% of revenue compared to $90 million or 14% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to strong revenue growth and cost synergies, which was partially offset by the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement and personnel costs. We remain on-track to deliver cost synergies of $100 million for the 3-year period ending 2017. 
Net orders during the quarter were $818 million, up 11% over last year, representing a net book to bill for the quarter of 1.13 and a trailing 12-month net book to bill of 1.17. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes June 30 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the year. In addition, our guidance excludes the impact from the acquisition of Sequenom, which we expect to close by year-end. We expect revenue growth of 9.5% to 10.5% after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 8.5% to 10.5%. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 4.5% to 5.5% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 10 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4% to 5.5%. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 7% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 110 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 6% to 9% due to strong organic growth, partially offset by a 60 basis point unfavorable change in currency. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we expect net revenue to increase 11% to 13%. 
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $8.95, which implies a growth rate of 9% to 13% over 2015 and is an increase from our prior guidance of $8.55 to $8.95. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS guidance includes an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. 
Finally, we continue to expect record free cash flow for the year of $900 million to $950 million. This concludes our formal remarks, and we will now take questions. Operator?"

So I think the major challenges for Sequenom as a stand-alone entity have been -- have related to breadth of test menu and scale. I think under Dirk van den Boom's leadership in the last 9 months, Sequenom has made significant improvements in technology and operations, but the reality is there still is a need for a comprehensive women's health portfolio. There still is a need for broader reach into the OB/GYN office. There's a need for reach in terms of convenience of being able to order NIPT testing on one requisition form with the same orders as other women's health-related testing. So I think from the operational perspective, we think about several opportunities to make this a success, and we strongly believe it will be a success. Number one is just improving the laboratory operation and the efficiency of that operation, which, as you know, is something that we excel at. Number two is expanding the reach of their sales force, which we think of very highly, and extending that into the primary care and the OB/GYN market. And the number three is the comprehensiveness of the test menu and the opportunity to create one point where physicians can order all of what they need in women's health and reproductive genetics."

So it's just more complicated to maintain a send-out relationship when you're talking about the high-end reproductive genetic testing. And it's more complicated, obviously, for somebody like Sequenom because they're not offering the full test menu there. You're dealing with organizing logistics, you're dealing with routing blood from one place to another, routing samples from one place to another, and you're dealing with delays in turnaround time as a result of the logistics. So although a send-out relationship, in concept, sounds attractive, it actually leads to more complexity. And as we think about how to be successful in the business, generally, and in this aspect of the business, in particular, what the physicians and the patients want is more simplicity. So they want to be able to order on one req form, they want to be able to have one courier pick it up, they want to be able to have it go to one place where the logistics are handled by LabCorp instead of being handled by 2 different entities. They want to get the results back on one report form, and they want to have one place to go for interpretation if genetic counseling, for example, is required. So from my perspective, what we're doing is we're taking the opportunity to integrate a best-in-class NIPT test into a best-in-class women's health portfolio. And that, in my mind, leads to enormous opportunity to grow in that market, which is one of the fastest-growing parts of the diagnostics industry, in which we think, over the long term, as the technology improves and the test menu improves around not only noninvasive prenatal testing but all sorts of noninvasive testing that's now done through more invasive methods, that they will be extremely well positioned to succeed."

So we are seeing significant progress in payer coverage for noninvasive prenatal testing for average-risk patients. So the opportunity there obviously grows the market significantly because it provides at least the potential to reach a couple of hundred million covered lives as opposed to what we would characterize as merely the high-risk market. And you're seeing payer acceptance of it because the technology is sound, the clinical results are well validated. And again, with Sequenom, you have over 500,000 tests performed and you have the largest clinical database to support the expansion of the market. In terms of expansion of the testing, obviously, Sequenom has been at the forefront in terms of offering fetal fractionation, microdeletions. Now the genome aspect of NIPT to expand upon the original MaterniT21 test. So yes, we think there will continue to be opportunities there. And then, I would just also parenthetically, as mentioned in the talking points, Bill, point to the international opportunity that this provides us should not be underestimated because Sequenom has focused on Europe and Asia Pacific, and those are markets where we think there's still plenty of opportunity for adoption of noninvasive prenatal testing."

Obviously, it's going to take some time to see how that really plays out. But I would say that, particularly when you move away from the inpatient setting, so let's distinguish between the inpatient and the outpatient setting. In the inpatient setting, I continue to believe that these types of bundled structures will encourage hospitals to look at how they can reduce the cost of the components of the bundle. And on the laboratory and the diagnostics side, that obviously puts us in a very strong competitive position. On the outpatient side, as you look at bundled payments for total care, again, physicians who are treating patients as -- who are owned or affiliated with health systems are going to be looking at how do I get each component of what I need to treat this patient at the highest quality and the most effective price point. And we're going to be extremely well positioned. And with cardiovascular, in particular, as you think about cardiovascular risk, because of LipoScience and the NMR profile and because of our comprehensive suite of cardiovascular services and risk assessment services, I think we're going to be extremely well positioned to be a valuable ally to the hospitals as they think about how to make the most of any sort of cardiovascular bundling."

We've seen -- continue to see strong orders in early development. That's a really good marketplace right now. There's good market demand there, and we're winning, and so we're very happy and pleased with the performance from that group. Central labs, as I said earlier, continues to take market share and have good orders as well. Clinical, we've had good orders in our early clinical, very strong orders. We have seen more and more emerging clients from that segment coming to that into our business there, so we see a little bit more in cancellations and delays. And then our Phase II-IV, we've had some good order quarters. You do see the volatility as you look at some of our competitors. And you look at their Q2 earnings versus their Q2 book-to-bill versus their Q1, so you do see some volatility there. We recently added a sales leader into -- for our Phase II-IV business and added some additional sales people, and so we're starting to bear fruit from some of those investments."

And I just want to say that I think CMS -- I'm pleased that CMS has been willing to consider the industry's comments. I think ACLA has done a terrific job and the hospital associations as well in bringing these issues to CMS' attention. I continue to be disappointed that the data showed that 50% of lab revenue is still going through the hospitals even though the volume is lower -- considerably lower than what goes through the independent labs. That means hospital pricing has to be way higher, and we all know it is. So to say that we're doing a market survey and essentially take into account only a very limited slice of that market, to me does not do what Congress asks CMS to do. Having said that, our visibility into what the impact or the floor will be is still limited until we go through the process of understanding how many more labs are captured and what the survey looks like. In terms of offsetting the financial impact, I think it's important that people think of LaunchPad as a long-term initiative for our business, not as specific projects. And so what we've said about LaunchPad is that we're going to get the savings over a 3-year period. But what we've also said is LaunchPad has now transitioned into organizational and structural activities as opposed to things like our supply chain. And a lot of the things that we're doing around LaunchPad, particularly now focusing on that front-end engagement with the patient, are going to help us to offset the impact of whatever the PAMA and the clinical lab fee schedule reductions in 2018 turn out to be."

So it's a pretty significant accomplishment that, that team took an idea and the concepts and really built it into a business that's now generating a pretty significant amount of revenue. The results from BeaconLBS, when you look at the things that the team set out to achieve, the out-of-network lab spend in Florida has declined, the tech selection based on evidence-based guidance has improved, the use of the lab network has increased, which leads to lower consumer out-of-pocket costs. So these are all, I think, positives for the -- for what BeaconLBS can accomplish. Are there things that we want to do to make it better? Absolutely. We want to make it more attractive to providers in helping them to select the right tests, so that it becomes a positive tool for choosing the right diagnostic testing. We want to expand the scope of it to increase the utility. Again, you look at the surveys, and physicians say, 30% of the time they're not sure what tests to order, particularly when it comes to molecular testing. So we have the opportunity to make BeaconLBS something that becomes a positive in the provider office and helps them get the right tests and interpret it correctly. Those enhancements are in process. And obviously, there are also competitive tools in the marketplace, and we want to be better than the competitive tools. As we enhance BeaconLBS, as we extend its capabilities, as it becomes more and more integrated into EMR systems, I think we will move to new markets. And I think my perception is that it's a -- United sees it as a valued tool to help them with correct lab test selection and management of their out-of-network spend, and we're both anxious to see it grow and expand into new markets."

It's an exciting day at LabCorp today as we continue to establish ourselves as the world's leading health care diagnostics company.

It's an exciting day at LabCorp today as we continue to establish ourselves as the world's leading health care diagnostics company. Operationally, we reported another strong quarter led by organic growth in LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 7%, continued margin expansion and another quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our continued business momentum is attributable to our commitment to improve health and improve lives around the globe, driven by our focus on our 3 strategic priorities: delivering world-class diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using information to change the way care is provided. 
I'll now update you on our key activities during the quarter and our progress on each of these objectives. First, to be the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, we continue to expand our test menu, innovate in science and complement our internal efforts with strategic acquisitions. This morning is exciting, as I said, because we announced another important acquisition. We will acquire Sequenom, a market leader in noninvasive prenatal testing and reproductive health. Sequenom is the first company to offer a clinically validated noninvasive prenatal test, and the more than 500,000 tests it has performed to date give it the largest clinical evidence base in the industry. This is a highly strategic acquisition as Sequenom's best-in-class offerings and strong R&D pipeline perfectly complement LabCorp's extensive women's health test menu. We will now offer patients and physicians one source for the full range of women's health reproductive genetics and NIPT testing.
Furthermore, Sequenom expands our geographic reach, both domestically with New York licensure, and internationally through licensing and commercial partnerships, with emphasis on the European Union and the Asia Pacific region. The transaction also meets our financial criteria, making it, as I said, an important and highly strategic transaction. 
I note that the acquisition of Sequenom is much like our strategic decision to acquire LipoScience and its unique NMR LipoProfile Test 18 months ago, which is translated into strong and consistent organic growth. As we expected, our reach in customer relationships, coupled with the test's strong clinical evidence and numerous expert society recommendations has established us as the leading diagnostic laboratory for comprehensive cardiovascular testing and risk assessment.
We also continue to focus on extending our core testing capabilities beyond the traditional health care setting. For example, our Bode Cellmark Forensics business is the leader in high-quality forensic DNA testing solutions, helping law enforcement agencies solve crimes across the globe. Bode Cellmark is one of 2 labs partnering with law enforcement across the U.S. to process a significant backlog of sexual assault evidence kits, aiding in solving open criminal cases. In addition, we continue to capitalize on our global footprint and our chemistry and microbiology expertise to provide the highest-quality testing and rapid turnaround time to a growing number of food safety customers. We will next build on our track record of scientific innovation into food safety through commercialization of new technologies that enable faster pathogen detection and expect to drive growth through acquisitions that increase our scale in this growing and fragmented market.
Second, to bring innovative medicines to patients faster, we continue to enhance our data capabilities, develop innovative solutions and expand our therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development. Data are an essential ingredient to improve patient recruitment and study startup. We have access to unique data generated from each of our business segments. LabCorp Diagnostics provides a growing proprietary database of patient-specific information, including demographics, lab values and diagnosis codes. 
Covance Drug Development has a growing base of insights into global investigator and site performance obtained through our central laboratory network and clinical trial experience. We are uniquely able to link this data to individual patients and sites, empowering patients to be more directly engaged with their own health care, helping enrich our clinical trial proposals and speeding patient recruitment. 
In addition, our unique solutions offer clients their choice of our end-to-end services offering, fostering deeper customer relationships and expanded opportunities to grow our business. For example, our companion diagnostics franchise continues to lead the industry as evidenced by important new tests launched during the quarter. We were the only national laboratory to introduce a Roche cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 for non-small cell lung cancer patients, the first blood-based liquid biopsy test cleared by FDA for clinical use. We also extended our leadership in immuno-oncology through the commercial launch of a complementary PD-L1 diagnostic test for bladder cancer, our third PD-L1 launch and fourth PD-L1 indication in the past year. Our world-class companion diagnostic capabilities offer our customers unmatched end-to-end development and commercialization expertise. 
Tying together all of our drug development growth initiatives, we focus on key therapeutic areas such as genetics, rare and orphan diseases, oncology and infectious disease. These strategic focus areas combine the best capabilities of both organizations to improve health and improve lives. 
All of our drug development businesses performed well during the quarter. We saw a strong revenue growth in clinical, early development and central labs. Customers have consistently awarded us new orders since the acquisition as they appreciate the benefits of our end-to-end offering and expanded capabilities. 
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is delivered through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions. In diagnostics, we are expanding our menu of decision support tools and integrated content to assist payers, physicians, health systems and patients in better understanding and managing disease. BeaconLBS is now entering its second year, and we expect it to grow as we add new markets and capabilities to the platform.
In drug development, we are enhancing Covance's accelerated suite of services to enable faster patient enrollment, more efficient site monitoring an improved study planning. Xcellerate Monitoring has been successfully implemented as the exclusive central monitoring portfolio for one of our larger partner's worldwide clinical trials portfolio and is being used by over a dozen other clients. 
In closing, we continue to invest in assets, people and capabilities that will drive profitable growth, unlock the value of our growing organization and further our mission to improve health and improve lives around the globe.
I want to specifically compliment both the Sequenom and the LabCorp acquisition teams for the extraordinary efforts that have led to today's announcement. The teams worked tirelessly to get us to the finish line in this important and highly strategic deal. I continue to be enormously proud of the work of all of my 50,000 colleagues, and I thank them for the direct positive impact they have on millions of lives every day.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. Revenue for the quar",1287,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 7.4% over last year, primarily due to strong organic growth in both segments and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 6.4%.
Gross profit for the quarter was $827 million or 34.7% of revenue compared to $773 million or 34.8% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to strong revenue growth, partially offset by personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact from faster growth in Covance Drug Development, which has a lower gross margin than the company's average. Excluding the mix impact, gross margin would've improved 10 basis points.
SG&A for the quarter was $408 million or 17.1% of revenue compared to $391 million or 17.6% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $8 million, primarily related to the integration of Covance and our LaunchPad initiative compared to $9 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $400 million or 16.8% of revenue compared to $382 million or 17.2%. The increase in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to acquisitions and personnel costs. The improvement in the SG&A rate was due to continued expense control and the mix impact from faster growth in Covance Drug Development, which has a lower SG&A rate than the company's average. Excluding the mix impacts, the SG&A rate would've improved 20 basis points.
During the quarter, we reported $7 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to severance and the closure of redundant facilities. Amortization expense for the quarter was $45 million, consistent with last year. 
Operating income for the quarter was $367 million or 15.4% of revenue compared to $323 million or 14.6% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $60 million, adjusted operating income was $427 million or 17.9% of revenue compared to $391 million or 17.6% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to strong revenue growth, partially offset by personnel costs.
Interest expense for the quarter was $54 million compared to $58 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was due to lower debt balances, which included repayment of $339 million of debt during the quarter.
The tax rate for the quarter was 36.6% compared to 36.1% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%, the same as last year. We continue to expect our 2016 full year adjusted tax rate to be 35.3%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $198 million or $1.91 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.31 in the quarter, up 11% from $2.09 last year.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $344 million compared to $397 million last year. The decline was primarily due to the timing of income taxes paid last year. Capital expenditures totaled $67 million or 2.8% of revenue, down from $69 million or 3.1% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $277 million in the quarter compared to $328 million last year. We continue to expect free cash flow to be between $900 million and $950 million for the full year. 
At quarter end, our cash balance was $640 million down from $696 million at the end of the first quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.1 billion.
During the quarter, we invested $51 million in acquisitions and paid down $339 million of debt, reducing the company's leverage to 3.3x gross debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. Segment results exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions partially offset by currency. The revenue increase includes unfavorable currency translation of 0.3%. Revenue per requisition increased 3.5%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing. 
Total volume increased by 2.1%, of which organic volume was 1.2% and acquisition volume was 0.9%.
LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 21.5% of revenue compared to $337 million or 21.4% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to price mix, organic volume, tuck-in acquisitions and our LaunchPad initiative, which was partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on-track to achieve our LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $722 million, an increase of 12.2% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 70 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, revenue increased 16.4% over last year. The strong revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central lab businesses. 
Adjusted operating income was $108 million or 14.9% of revenue compared to $90 million or 14% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to strong revenue growth and cost synergies, which was partially offset by the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement and personnel costs. We remain on-track to deliver cost synergies of $100 million for the 3-year period ending 2017. 
Net orders during the quarter were $818 million, up 11% over last year, representing a net book to bill for the quarter of 1.13x and a trailing 12-month net book to bill of 1.17x. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes June 30 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the year. In addition, our guidance excludes the impact from the acquisition of Sequenom, which we expect to close by year-end. We expect revenue growth of 9.5% to 10.5% after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 8.5% to 10.5%. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 4.5% to 5.5% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 10 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4% to 5.5%. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 7% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 110 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 6% to 9% due to strong organic growth, partially offset by a 60 basis point unfavorable change in currency. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we expect net revenue to increase 11% to 13%. 
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $8.95, which implies a growth rate of 9% to 13% over 2015 and is an increase from our prior guidance of $8.55 to $8.95. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS guidance includes an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. 
Finally, we continue to expect record free cash flow for the year of $900 million to $950 million. This concludes our formal remarks, and we will now take questions. Operator?"

So I think the major challenges for Sequenom as a stand-alone entity have been -- have related to breadth of test menu and scale. I think under Dirk van den Boom's leadership in the last 9 months, Sequenom has made significant improvements in technology and operations, but the reality is there still is a need for a comprehensive women's health portfolio. There still is a need for broader reach into the OB/GYN office. There's a need for reach in terms of convenience of being able to order NIPT testing on one requisition form with the same orders as other women's health-related testing. So I think from the operational perspective, we think about several opportunities to make this a success, and we strongly believe it will be a success. Number one is just improving the laboratory operation and the efficiency of that operation, which, as you know, is something that we excel at. Number two is expanding the reach of their sales force, which we think of very highly, and extending that into the primary care and the OB/GYN market. And the number three is the comprehensiveness of the test menu and the opportunity to create one point where physicians can order all of what they need in women's health and reproductive genetics."

So it's just more complicated to maintain a send-out relationship when you're talking about the high-end reproductive genetic testing. And it's more complicated, obviously, for somebody like Sequenom because they're not offering the full test menu there. You're dealing with organizing logistics, you're dealing with routing blood from one place to another, routing samples from one place to another, and you're dealing with delays in turnaround time as a result of the logistics. So although a send-out relationship, in concept, sounds attractive, it actually leads to more complexity. And as we think about how to be successful in the business, generally, and in this aspect of the business, in particular, what the physicians and the patients want is more simplicity. So they want to be able to order on one req form, they want to be able to have one courier pick it up, they want to be able to have it go to one place where the logistics are handled by LabCorp instead of being handled by 2 different entities. They want to get the results back on one report form, and they want to have one place to go for interpretation if genetic counseling, for example, is required. So from my perspective, what we're doing is we're taking the opportunity to integrate a best-in-class NIPT test into a best-in-class women's health portfolio. And that, in my mind, leads to enormous opportunity to grow in that market, which is one of the fastest-growing parts of the diagnostics industry, in which we think, over the long term, as the technology improves and the test menu improves around not only noninvasive prenatal testing but all sorts of noninvasive testing that's now done through more invasive methods, that they will be extremely well positioned to succeed."

So we are seeing significant progress in payer coverage for noninvasive prenatal testing for average-risk patients. So the opportunity there obviously grows the market significantly because it provides at least the potential to reach a couple of hundred million covered lives as opposed to what we would characterize as merely the high-risk market. And you're seeing payer acceptance of it because the technology is sound, the clinical results are well validated. And again, with Sequenom, you have over 500,000 tests performed and you have the largest clinical database to support the expansion of the market. In terms of expansion of the testing, obviously, Sequenom has been at the forefront in terms of offering fetal fractionation, microdeletions. Now the genome aspect of NIPT to expand upon the original MaterniT21 test. So yes, we think there will continue to be opportunities there. And then, I would just also parenthetically, as mentioned in the talking points, Bill, point to the international opportunity that this provides us should not be underestimated because Sequenom has focused on Europe and Asia Pacific, and those are markets where we think there's still plenty of opportunity for adoption of noninvasive prenatal testing."

And again, the number of tests that they performed and the clinical evidence and support will really help in terms of the average -- the demonstration that this test makes sense for the average-risk population. In terms of the managed care contracts, typically, the managed care relationships fall under our contracts post acquisition. We've carefully examined to the extent we're able to do so, obviously, as part of the diligent process, our managed care contracts versus their managed care contracts, and we don't see material difference there.

As you know, CMS started out with the idea of the bundled demonstration or the bundled payment for the joint replacements. Now they've proposed bundled payments for cardiovascular. Obviously, it's going to take some time to see how that really plays out. But I would say that, particularly when you move away from the inpatient setting, so let's distinguish between the inpatient and the outpatient setting. In the inpatient setting, I continue to believe that these types of bundled structures will encourage hospitals to look at how they can reduce the cost of the components of the bundle. And on the laboratory and the diagnostics side, that obviously puts us in a very strong competitive position. On the outpatient side, as you look at bundled payments for total care, again, physicians who are treating patients as -- who are owned or affiliated with health systems are going to be looking at how do I get each component of what I need to treat this patient at the highest quality and the most effective price point. And we're going to be extremely well positioned. And with cardiovascular, in particular, as you think about cardiovascular risk, because of LipoScience and the NMR profile and because of our comprehensive suite of cardiovascular services and risk assessment services, I think we're going to be extremely well positioned to be a valuable ally to the hospitals as they think about how to make the most of any sort of cardiovascular bundling."

In recent quarter, we actually added a large oncology study, where we had an integrated offering as well as what we did in the rare and orphan disease. We had a win in that category as well. I think when we look at the central labs, specifically, that business has taken market share for many years and continues to do so.

And I just want to say that I think CMS -- I'm pleased that CMS has been willing to consider the industry's comments. I think ACLA has done a terrific job and the hospital associations as well in bringing these issues to CMS' attention. I continue to be disappointed that the data showed that 50% of lab revenue is still going through the hospitals even though the volume is lower -- considerably lower than what goes through the independent labs. That means hospital pricing has to be way higher, and we all know it is. So to say that we're doing a market survey and essentially take into account only a very limited slice of that market, to me does not do what Congress asks CMS to do. Having said that, our visibility into what the impact or the floor will be is still limited until we go through the process of understanding how many more labs are captured and what the survey looks like. In terms of offsetting the financial impact, I think it's important that people think of LaunchPad as a long-term initiative for our business, not as specific projects. And so what we've said about LaunchPad is that we're going to get the savings over a 3-year period. But what we've also said is LaunchPad has now transitioned into organizational and structural activities as opposed to things like our supply chain. And a lot of the things that we're doing around LaunchPad, particularly now focusing on that front-end engagement with the patient, are going to help us to offset the impact of whatever the PAMA and the clinical lab fee schedule reductions in 2018 turn out to be."

So it's a pretty significant accomplishment that, that team took an idea and the concepts and really built it into a business that's now generating a pretty significant amount of revenue. The results from BeaconLBS, when you look at the things that the team set out to achieve, the out-of-network lab spend in Florida has declined, the tech selection based on evidence-based guidance has improved, the use of the lab network has increased, which leads to lower consumer out-of-pocket costs. So these are all, I think, positives for the -- for what BeaconLBS can accomplish. Are there things that we want to do to make it better? Absolutely. We want to make it more attractive to providers in helping them to select the right tests, so that it becomes a positive tool for choosing the right diagnostic testing. We want to expand the scope of it to increase the utility. Again, you look at the surveys, and physicians say, 30% of the time they're not sure what tests to order, particularly when it comes to molecular testing. So we have the opportunity to make BeaconLBS something that becomes a positive in the provider office and helps them get the right tests and interpret it correctly. Those enhancements are in process. And obviously, there are also competitive tools in the marketplace, and we want to be better than the competitive tools. As we enhance BeaconLBS, as we extend its capabilities, as it becomes more and more integrated into EMR systems, I think we will move to new markets. And I think my perception is that it's a -- United sees it as a valued tool to help them with correct lab test selection and management of their out-of-network spend, and we're both anxious to see it grow and expand into new markets."

And so I think the likelihood that there's going to be significant attrition is not the same as it would be in a typical -- we're acquiring another -- just acquiring another laboratory. I think the other reality is as you get into highly specialized testing that's really dependent on capabilities and methodology and the clinical database, that there is less appetite for switching than there is if you're using just one reference lab, and now it's acquired by another reference lab. So we feel good about the ability to retain the key customers and, again, are counting on and looking forward to working with the Sequenom team to make that the case."

In the out years, the combination of the top line revenue growth opportunity and bringing some greater efficiency to their laboratory operation, we think, will give us the opportunity for the acquisition to be materially accretive. In terms of what we look for in acquisitions, we've always talked about expanding our capabilities. We've talked about geographic footprint. We've talked about test menu, 2 very important criteria for this transaction. And we've talked about strategic fit with the business, whether it's the diagnostics business or the drug development business. And in terms of the financial criteria, I mean, we look at many multiples. Obviously, we look at multiples of EBITDA, pre and post, we look at DCF, but the fundamental premise is accretive in year 1 and meets our cost of capital sort of by year 3 to 4.

It's an exciting day at LabCorp today as we continue to establish ourselves as the world's leading health care diagnostics company. Operationally, we reported another strong quarter led by organic growth in LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 7%, continued margin expansion and another quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our continued business momentum is attributable to our commitment to improve health and improve lives around the globe, driven by our focus on our 3 strategic priorities: delivering world-class diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using information to change the way care is provided. 
I'll now update you on our key activities during the quarter and our progress on each of these objectives. First, to be the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, we continue to expand our test menu, innovate in science and complement our internal efforts with strategic acquisitions. This morning is exciting, as I said, because we announced another important acquisition. We will acquire Sequenom, a market leader in noninvasive prenatal testing and reproductive health. Sequenom is the first company to offer a clinically validated noninvasive prenatal test, and the more than 500,000 tests it has performed to date give it the largest clinical evidence base in the industry. This is a highly strategic acquisition as Sequenom's best-in-class offerings and strong R&D pipeline perfectly complement LabCorp's extensive women's health test menu. We will now offer patients and physicians one source for the full range of women's health reproductive genetics and NIPT testing.
Furthermore, Sequenom expands our geographic reach, both domestically with New York licensure, and internationally through licensing and commercial partnerships, with emphasis on the European Union and the Asia Pacific region. The transaction also meets our financial criteria, making it, as I said, an important and highly strategic transaction. 
I note that the acquisition of Sequenom is much like our strategic decision to acquire LipoScience and its unique NMR LipoProfile Test 18 months ago, which is translated into strong and consistent organic growth. As we expected, our reach in customer relationships, coupled with the test's strong clinical evidence and numerous expert society recommendations has established us as the leading diagnostic laboratory for comprehensive cardiovascular testing and risk assessment.
We also continue to focus on extending our core testing capabilities beyond the traditional health care setting. For example, our Bode Cellmark Forensics business is the leader in high-quality forensic DNA testing solutions, helping law enforcement agencies solve crimes across the globe. Bode Cellmark is one of 2 labs partnering with law enforcement across the U.S. to process a significant backlog of sexual assault evidence kits, aiding in solving open criminal cases. In addition, we continue to capitalize on our global footprint and our chemistry and microbiology expertise to provide the highest-quality testing and rapid turnaround time to a growing number of food safety customers. We will next build on our track record of scientific innovation into food safety through commercialization of new technologies that enable faster pathogen detection and expect to drive growth through acquisitions that increase our scale in this growing and fragmented market.
Second, to bring innovative medicines to patients faster, we continue to enhance our data capabilities, develop innovative solutions and expand our therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development. Data are an essential ingredient to improve patient recruitment and study startup. We have access to unique data generated from each of our business segments. LabCorp Diagnostics provides a growing proprietary database of patient-specific information, including demographics, lab values and diagnosis codes. 
Covance Drug Development has a growing base of insights into global investigator and site performance obtained through our central laboratory network and clinical trial experience. We are uniquely able to link this data to individual patients and sites, empowering patients to be more directly engaged with their own health care, helping enrich our clinical trial proposals and speeding patient recruitment. 
In addition, our unique solutions offer clients their choice of our end-to-end services offering, fostering deeper customer relationships and expanded opportunities to grow our business. For example, our companion diagnostics franchise continues to lead the industry as evidenced by important new tests launched during the quarter. We were the only national laboratory to introduce a Roche cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 for non-small cell lung cancer patients, the first blood-based liquid biopsy test cleared by FDA for clinical use. We also extended our leadership in immuno-oncology through the commercial launch of a complementary PD-L1 diagnostic test for bladder cancer, our third PD-L1 launch and fourth PD-L1 indication in the past year. Our world-class companion diagnostic capabilities offer our customers unmatched end-to-end development and commercialization expertise. 
Tying together all of our drug development growth initiatives, we focus on key therapeutic areas such as genetics, rare and orphan diseases, oncology and infectious disease. These strategic focus areas combine the best capabilities of both organizations to improve health and improve lives. 
All of our drug development businesses performed well during the quarter. We saw a strong revenue growth in clinical, early development and central labs. Customers have consistently awarded us new orders since the acquisition as they appreciate the benefits of our end-to-end offering and expanded capabilities. 
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is delivered through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions. In diagnostics, we are expanding our menu of decision support tools and integrated content to assist payers, physicians, health systems and patients in better understanding and managing disease. BeaconLBS is now entering its second year, and we expect it to grow as we add new markets and capabilities to the platform.
In drug development, we are enhancing Covance's accelerated suite of services to enable faster patient enrollment, more efficient site monitoring an improved study planning. Xcellerate Monitoring has been successfully implemented as the exclusive central monitoring portfolio for one of our larger partner's worldwide clinical trials portfolio and is being used by over a dozen other clients. 
In closing, we continue to invest in assets, people and capabilities that will drive profitable growth, unlock the value of our growing organization and further our mission to improve health and improve lives around the globe.
I want to specifically compliment both the Sequenom and the LabCorp acquisition teams for the extraordinary efforts that have led to today's announcement. The teams worked tirelessly to get us to the finish line in this important and highly strategic deal. I continue to be enormously proud of the work of all of my 50,000 colleagues, and I thank them for the direct positive impact they have on millions of lives every day.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

Revenue for the quar",1287,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 7.4% over last year, primarily due to strong organic growth in both segments and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 6.4%.
Gross profit for the quarter was $827 million or 34.7% of revenue compared to $773 million or 34.8% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to strong revenue growth, partially offset by personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact from faster growth in Covance Drug Development, which has a lower gross margin than the company's average. Excluding the mix impact, gross margin would've improved 10 basis points.
SG&A for the quarter was $408 million or 17.1% of revenue compared to $391 million or 17.6% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $8 million, primarily related to the integration of Covance and our LaunchPad initiative compared to $9 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $400 million or 16.8% of revenue compared to $382 million or 17.2%. The increase in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to acquisitions and personnel costs. The improvement in the SG&A rate was due to continued expense control and the mix impact from faster growth in Covance Drug Development, which has a lower SG&A rate than the company's average. Excluding the mix impacts, the SG&A rate would've improved 20 basis points.
During the quarter, we reported $7 million of restructuring charges, primarily relating to severance and the closure of redundant facilities. Amortization expense for the quarter was $45 million, consistent with last year. 
Operating income for the quarter was $367 million or 15.4% of revenue compared to $323 million or 14.6% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $60 million, adjusted operating income was $427 million or 17.9% of revenue compared to $391 million or 17.6% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to strong revenue growth, partially offset by personnel costs.
Interest expense for the quarter was $54 million compared to $58 million in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was due to lower debt balances, which included repayment of $339 million of debt during the quarter.
The tax rate for the quarter was 36.6% compared to 36.1% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%, the same as last year. We continue to expect our 2016 full year adjusted tax rate to be 35.3%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $198 million or $1.91 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.31 in the quarter, up 11% from $2.09 last year.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $344 million compared to $397 million last year. The decline was primarily due to the timing of income taxes paid last year. Capital expenditures totaled $67 million or 2.8% of revenue, down from $69 million or 3.1% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $277 million in the quarter compared to $328 million last year. We continue to expect free cash flow to be between $900 million and $950 million for the full year. 
At quarter end, our cash balance was $640 million down from $696 million at the end of the first quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.1 billion.
During the quarter, we invested $51 million in acquisitions and paid down $339 million of debt, reducing the company's leverage to 3.3x gross debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.
Now I'll review our segment performance. Segment results exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions partially offset by currency. The revenue increase includes unfavorable currency translation of 0.3%. Revenue per requisition increased 3.5%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing. 
Total volume increased by 2.1%, of which organic volume was 1.2% and acquisition volume was 0.9%.
LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 21.5% of revenue compared to $337 million or 21.4% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to price mix, organic volume, tuck-in acquisitions and our LaunchPad initiative, which was partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on-track to achieve our LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $722 million, an increase of 12.2% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 70 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, revenue increased 16.4% over last year. The strong revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central lab businesses. 
Adjusted operating income was $108 million or 14.9% of revenue compared to $90 million or 14% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to strong revenue growth and cost synergies, which was partially offset by the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement and personnel costs. We remain on-track to deliver cost synergies of $100 million for the 3-year period ending 2017. 
Net orders during the quarter were $818 million, up 11% over last year, representing a net book to bill for the quarter of 1.13x and a trailing 12-month net book to bill of 1.17x. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes June 30 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the year. In addition, our guidance excludes the impact from the acquisition of Sequenom, which we expect to close by year-end. We expect revenue growth of 9.5% to 10.5% after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 8.5% to 10.5%. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 4.5% to 5.5% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 10 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4% to 5.5%. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 7% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 110 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 6% to 9% due to strong organic growth, partially offset by a 60 basis point unfavorable change in currency. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we expect net revenue to increase 11% to 13%. 
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $8.95, which implies a growth rate of 9% to 13% over 2015 and is an increase from our prior guidance of $8.55 to $8.95. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS guidance includes an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases. 
Finally, we continue to expect record free cash flow for the year of $900 million to $950 million. This concludes our formal remarks, and we will now take questions. Operator?"

So I think the major challenges for Sequenom as a stand-alone entity have been -- have related to breadth of test menu and scale. I think under Dirk van den Boom's leadership in the last 9 months, Sequenom has made significant improvements in technology and operations, but the reality is there still is a need for a comprehensive women's health portfolio. There still is a need for broader reach into the OB/GYN office. There's a need for reach in terms of convenience of being able to order NIPT testing on one requisition form with the same orders as other women's health-related testing. So I think from the operational perspective, we think about several opportunities to make this a success, and we strongly believe it will be a success. Number one is just improving the laboratory operation and the efficiency of that operation, which, as you know, is something that we excel at. Number two is expanding the reach of their sales force, which we think of very highly, and extending that into the primary care and the OB/GYN market. And the number three is the comprehensiveness of the test menu and the opportunity to create one point where physicians can order all of what they need in women's health and reproductive genetics."

So it's just more complicated to maintain a send-out relationship when you're talking about the high-end reproductive genetic testing. And it's more complicated, obviously, for somebody like Sequenom because they're not offering the full test menu there. You're dealing with organizing logistics, you're dealing with routing blood from one place to another, routing samples from one place to another, and you're dealing with delays in turnaround time as a result of the logistics. So although a send-out relationship, in concept, sounds attractive, it actually leads to more complexity. And as we think about how to be successful in the business, generally, and in this aspect of the business, in particular, what the physicians and the patients want is more simplicity. So they want to be able to order on one req form, they want to be able to have one courier pick it up, they want to be able to have it go to one place where the logistics are handled by LabCorp instead of being handled by 2 different entities. They want to get the results back on one report form, and they want to have one place to go for interpretation if genetic counseling, for example, is required. So from my perspective, what we're doing is we're taking the opportunity to integrate a best-in-class NIPT test into a best-in-class women's health portfolio. And that, in my mind, leads to enormous opportunity to grow in that market, which is one of the fastest-growing parts of the diagnostics industry, in which we think, over the long term, as the technology improves and the test menu improves around not only noninvasive prenatal testing but all sorts of noninvasive testing that's now done through more invasive methods, that they will be extremely well positioned to succeed."

So we are seeing significant progress in payer coverage for noninvasive prenatal testing for average-risk patients. So the opportunity there obviously grows the market significantly because it provides at least the potential to reach a couple of hundred million covered lives as opposed to what we would characterize as merely the high-risk market. And you're seeing payer acceptance of it because the technology is sound, the clinical results are well validated. And again, with Sequenom, you have over 500,000 tests performed and you have the largest clinical database to support the expansion of the market. In terms of expansion of the testing, obviously, Sequenom has been at the forefront in terms of offering fetal fractionation, microdeletions. Now the genome aspect of NIPT to expand upon the original MaterniT21 test. So yes, we think there will continue to be opportunities there. And then, I would just also parenthetically, as mentioned in the talking points, Bill, point to the international opportunity that this provides us should not be underestimated because Sequenom has focused on Europe and Asia Pacific, and those are markets where we think there's still plenty of opportunity for adoption of noninvasive prenatal testing."

And again, the number of tests that they performed and the clinical evidence and support will really help in terms of the average -- the demonstration that this test makes sense for the average-risk population. In terms of the managed care contracts, typically, the managed care relationships fall under our contracts post acquisition. We've carefully examined to the extent we're able to do so, obviously, as part of the diligent process, our managed care contracts versus their managed care contracts, and we don't see material difference there.

Obviously, it's going to take some time to see how that really plays out. But I would say that, particularly when you move away from the inpatient setting, so let's distinguish between the inpatient and the outpatient setting. In the inpatient setting, I continue to believe that these types of bundled structures will encourage hospitals to look at how they can reduce the cost of the components of the bundle. And on the laboratory and the diagnostics side, that obviously puts us in a very strong competitive position. On the outpatient side, as you look at bundled payments for total care, again, physicians who are treating patients as -- who are owned or affiliated with health systems are going to be looking at how do I get each component of what I need to treat this patient at the highest quality and the most effective price point. And we're going to be extremely well positioned. And with cardiovascular, in particular, as you think about cardiovascular risk, because of LipoScience and the NMR profile and because of our comprehensive suite of cardiovascular services and risk assessment services, I think we're going to be extremely well positioned to be a valuable ally to the hospitals as they think about how to make the most of any sort of cardiovascular bundling."

We've seen -- continue to see strong orders in early development. That's a really good marketplace right now. There's good market demand there, and we're winning, and so we're very happy and pleased with the performance from that group. Central labs, as I said earlier, continues to take market share and have good orders as well. Clinical, we've had good orders in our early clinical, very strong orders. We have seen more and more emerging clients from that segment coming to that into our business there, so we see a little bit more in cancellations and delays. And then our Phase II-IV, we've had some good order quarters. You do see the volatility as you look at some of our competitors. And you look at their Q2 earnings versus or their Q2 book-to-bill versus their Q1, so you do see some volatility there.

And I just want to say that I think CMS -- I'm pleased that CMS has been willing to consider the industry's comments. I think ACLA has done a terrific job and the hospital associations as well in bringing these issues to CMS' attention. I continue to be disappointed that the data showed that 50% of lab revenue is still going through the hospitals even though the volume is lower -- considerably lower than what goes through the independent labs. That means hospital pricing has to be way higher, and we all know it is. So to say that we're doing a market survey and essentially take into account only a very limited slice of that market, to me does not do what Congress asks CMS to do. Having said that, our visibility into what the impact or the floor will be is still limited until we go through the process of understanding how many more labs are captured and what the survey looks like. In terms of offsetting the financial impact, I think it's important that people think of LaunchPad as a long-term initiative for our business, not as specific projects. And so what we've said about LaunchPad is that we're going to get the savings over a 3-year period. But what we've also said is LaunchPad has now transitioned into organizational and structural activities as opposed to things like our supply chain. And a lot of the things that we're doing around LaunchPad, particularly now focusing on that front-end engagement with the patient, are going to help us to offset the impact of whatever the PAMA and the clinical lab fee schedule reductions in 2018 turn out to be."

So it's a pretty significant accomplishment that, that team took an idea and the concepts and really built it into a business that's now generating a pretty significant amount of revenue. The results from BeaconLBS, when you look at the things that the team set out to achieve, the out-of-network lab spend in Florida has declined, the tech selection based on evidence-based guidance has improved, the use of the lab network has increased, which leads to lower consumer out-of-pocket costs. So these are all, I think, positives for the -- for what BeaconLBS can accomplish. Are there things that we want to do to make it better? Absolutely. We want to make it more attractive to providers in helping them to select the right tests, so that it becomes a positive tool for choosing the right diagnostic testing. We want to expand the scope of it to increase the utility. Again, you look at the surveys, and physicians say, 30% of the time they're not sure what tests to order, particularly when it comes to molecular testing. So we have the opportunity to make BeaconLBS something that becomes a positive in the provider office and helps them get the right tests and interpret it correctly. Those enhancements are in process. And obviously, there are also competitive tools in the marketplace, and we want to be better than the competitive tools. As we enhance BeaconLBS, as we extend its capabilities, as it becomes more and more integrated into EMR systems, I think we will move to new markets. And I think my perception is that it's a -- United sees it as a valued tool to help them with correct lab test selection and management of their out-of-network spend, and we're both anxious to see it grow and expand into new markets."

We've talked about test menu, 2 very important criteria for this transaction. And we've talked about strategic fit with the business, whether it's the diagnostics business or the drug development business.

We reported another solid quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 4.5% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%.

We reported another solid quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 4.5% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%. We expanded margins in the enterprise level and within LabCorp Diagnostics, an impressive accomplishment in light of lower demand. 
We also continue to augment our growth through the deployment of free cash flow through strategic acquisitions. It is our expectation that our strong free cash flow will also enable us to restart our long-standing program of returning capital to shareholders next year.
We are steadfast and committed to improve health and improve lives around the globe, led by our focus on our 3 strategic priorities: Delivering world-class diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and developing technology-enabled solutions to change the way care is provided. I will now update you on our key activities during the quarter and our progress in each of these objectives. 
First, to be the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, we continue to expand our test menu, innovative science and complement our robust capabilities with key acquisitions. In the third quarter, we completed the strategic acquisition of Sequenom, and our integration plans are on track. The addition of Sequenom positions us as the market leader in NIPT, women's health and reproductive genetics. We now offer patients and physicians one source for the most complete range of women's health diagnostics, simplifying the customer experience. 
Noninvasive prenatal testing is an exciting long-term growth opportunity that continues to gain traction with payers, as evidenced by increasing coverage for average-risk pregnancies. We also see increasing interest from providers, as evidenced by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics updated position statement which recommends that providers inform all pregnant women that noninvasive prenatal screening is the most sensitive screening option for traditionally screened aneuploidies. 
We are also investing in technology that increases patient and consumer engagement and creates a better experience with LabCorp. Our most recent initiatives include our realtime insurance eligibility capability which was implemented nationally earlier this year and allows our personnel to determine whether a patient is insured at the time of service. This tool benefits our patients by helping them avoid unexpected coverage denials. 
In addition, we are testing enhancements in this capability in select locations that provide a preservice disclosure to patients, itemizing their expected payment responsibility, which will benefit patients by reducing surprises in their bills. Both of these initiatives will also help us reduce bad debt.
As part of our commitment to customer engagement, we also expect to launch our consumer-initiated lab test offering before year end, giving consumers access to certain lab tests online in an expeditious, compliant and responsible manner. 
In addition, we expect to launch a mobile-optimized version of our Patient Portal in early 2017, which will improve the customer experience by enabling patient-friendly functionality, such as scheduling appointment or paying a bill anytime, anywhere from any mobile device. 
Second, to bring innovative medicines to patients faster, we continue to enhance our data capabilities, develop differentiated solutions and expand our therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development. 
Last month, we announced the addition of John Ratliff as the CEO of Covance Drug Development. We are thrilled to have John join us, and he is already engaged the Covance team and many of our key clients. We're excited to have John's experience and vision to further enhance our ability to provide superior drug development services. John is deeply engaged in tactical actions of our clinical business, as well as the development of the strategy for the entire Covance portfolio, and we look forward to his contributions to LabCorp in the year to come.
Clients continue to be attracted to the insights extracted from our combined LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development data to optimize clinical trial recruitment. We are focused on effective data utilization for enhanced patient identification, patient engagement, protocol, feasibility and site selection to drive faster recruitment for our clients. Since the acquisition of Covance, our customers have awarded us a dozen studies based on the unique value of LabCorp's data, and we continue to use our integrated data capabilities as a point of differentiation. 
We are committed to enhancing our therapeutic expertise, with a particular focus on the growing areas of oncology and rare and orphan disease. Our combined scientific expertise and experience in these categories is substantial. For example, we worked on all 14 oncology drugs approved by the FDA last year, and we are the only company to provide diagnostic support for all 3 immuno-oncology drugs approved to date. In rare and orphan disease, we worked on 20 of the 21 FDA-approved drugs in 2015. 
Over 80% of rare diseases are genetically defined, and we offer clients more than 480 tests in this category, as well as biomarker development, genetic sequencing, specialty testing and market access services, all of which create a clear differentiator for us in the marketplace. We are further strengthening our enterprise-wide sales force to target clients that will benefit from our scientific leadership for these important therapeutic categories. 
Our success in combining LabCorp and Covance's scientific and operational expertise is particularly apparent in companion diagnostics. Our clients seek scientifically driven cost-effective options for companion diagnostic development, and we are delivering. We are currently supporting more than 3 dozen companion diagnostic programs, 1/3 of which are proprietary programs where we are developing the companion diagnostic for the customer. We look forward to sharing the progress of these programs as they advance through the regulatory process. 
We continue to look at all technology platforms for companion diagnostic applications. For example, we are presently conducting studies on the MiSeqDx next-generation sequencing platform, analyzing the collection of genes that represent a potential CDX application. This work is being performed in our industry-leading Covance central lab genomics facility, which has broad experience in NGS technologies and applications and is a qualified sequencing provider for all leading platform manufacturers. 
Our market-leading central laboratory capabilities are generating revenue growth opportunities beyond companion diagnostics. For example, Covance's central lab is on pace to win new orders in 2016 that will translate into 150,000 tests for LabCorp's esoteric laboratory network, up from 18,000 tests last year. In 1 year, this would be a nearly tenfold increase in the number of complex tests awarded from Covance to LabCorp rather than to other laboratories as a result of our successful lab integration efforts.
We also continue to enhance our central laboratory offering through integration with LabCorp's capabilities and complementary partnerships. Clinical trial investigators' enthusiasm for our enhanced offering is evident in the responses of more than 250 investigators worldwide provided in the recently published survey. Our central lab is rated the most preferred by 60% of surveyed investigators compared to 16% and 11% for the second and third ranked labs, respectively. This was a substantial increase from the 2013 survey, which was the most recent, using the same methodology, where Covance was compared -- was preferred by 47% of investigators compared to 23% for the next-ranked lab. Importantly, 98% of investigators stated that the pharma sponsor selection of central laboratory impacts the investigators' willingness to work with that sponsor in the future. 
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is provided through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions, such as BeaconLBS. The BeaconLBS UnitedHealthcare college [ph][ph]  in Florida has demonstrated positive results, including improved quality of care. Compliance with evidence-based guidelines when ordering lab tests has increased by nearly 50% since the initiation of BeaconLBS. The use of the network has [[ph][ph]  ph] also increased, helping UnitedHealthcare members maximize their benefits coverage and reduce out-of-pocket costs. 
Following the successful pilot program in Florida, UnitedHealthcare recently announced the program will expand to Texas in 2017, a significant milestone for the BeaconLBS team. In addition, BeaconLBS will enhance the technology by the end of the year to incorporate molecular and genetic test decision support, an area of confusion preventing providers and a driver of lab spend overall. 
Next year, we expect to introduce additional BeaconLBS functionality for health plans, physicians and consumers, including the potential use of the BeaconLBS platform for applications beyond lab testing, such as support for HEDIS and Star ratings. BeaconLBS is an important component of our unique strategic relationship with UnitedHealthcare, and the decision to implement it in an additional market reflects our mutual commitment to the partnership. 
Although earnings and cash flow for this quarter are slightly below our aspirations, this is principally due to deliberate actions in our part. Those decisions include exiting certain accounts in diagnostics, acquiring Sequenom and entering into a strategic collaboration in our central labs business. In addition, our cash flow expectations were diminished by increased DSO in the Covance segment, which reflects a broader industry trend. Despite all of this, our earnings guidance is essentially unchanged. We will finish the year with record cash flow, and we remain excited about and confident for the long-term outlook for our business. 
We remain sharply focused on executing our 3 foundational strategies. The progress we are making positions us as the go-to partner, bringing the critical solutions to address our customers' needs. Our progress on all of these initiatives furthers our misison to improve health and improve lives, something that every one of our 50,000 employees around the globe is committed to every day. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."
30643,403471274,1061350,"Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Labcorp Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. Revenue for the quart",1688,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 4.5% over last year, due to organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 50 basis points. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 3.6%. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $788 million or 33.2% of revenue compared to $765 million or 33.7% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to price, mix, acquisitions, our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative and Covance cost synergies, partially offset by unusually high level of rework in the clinical business and personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was due to lower margins in Covance Drug Development. 
SG&A for the quarter was $400 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $386 million or 17% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $16 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Sequenom and our LaunchPad initiative compared to $5 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $384 million or 16.2% of revenue compared to $381 million or 16.8% a year ago. We continue to leverage our SG&A expense well, as evidenced by our 60 basis point improvement in the SG&A rate, which was primarily due to continued expense control, including our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A dollars would've been down from last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $23 million of restructuring charges, primarily due to the closure of redundant facilities and associated severance. These closures include our progress on consolidating our 8 main central laboratory facilities to 4 by the end of 2017 as part of the integration of Covance. 
Operating income for the quarter was $324 million or 13.7% of revenue compared to $308 million or 13.6% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $80 million, adjusted operating income was $404 million or 17% of revenue compared to $384 million or 16.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix and our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives, partially offset by higher rework in the clinical business and personnel costs. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million compared to $56 million in the third quarter of 2015. The increase was due to a $6 million non-recurring expense for the early retirement of debt assumed as part of the acquisition to Sequenom, partially offset by lower debt balances. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 31.7% compared to 38.4% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%, down from 35.3% last year.
Two accounting changes impacted the tax rate. First, the early adoption in the third quarter of the new FASB pronouncement relating to tax benefits of stock compensation lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rates by 1%. And second, the reclassification this quarter of certain gross receipts taxes from income tax expense to SG&A expense lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rate by 0.6%. This reclassification does not impact EPS and has been adjusted for prior periods. These 2 accounting changes resulted in a 1.6% improvement in our tax rate for the quarter. In addition, the reversal of expired tax reserves, as well as geographic mix of earnings, also contributed to the improvement over last year's tax rate. 
For the year, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 34%, which represents our prior expectation of 35.3% less the impact from these 2 accounting changes.
Net earnings for the quarter were $180 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.25 in the quarter, up 9% over $2.07 last year. Our GAAP and adjusted results in the quarter included 2 special items: A benefit of $0.02 per diluted share from the adoption of FASB pronouncement and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from the impairment of an investment in our venture fund. In addition, the company incurred a loss of $0.01 per diluted share during the quarter from the acquisition of Sequenom. However, we continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to results during our first year of ownership.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $250 million compared to $288 million last year. The decline was primarily due to fees associated with the acquisition of Sequenom and higher working capital requirements, including an advance payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central labs business. 
Capital expenditures totaled $66 million or 2.8% of revenue, down from $68 million or 3% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $184 million in the quarter compared to $220 million last year.
At quarter end, our cash balance was $568 million, down from $640 million at the end of the second quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.2 billion. During the quarter, we invested $253 million in acquisitions and assumed $130 million of Sequenom debt, which was retired in October. The company's leverage at quarter end was 3.3x gross debt for the last 12 months pro forma EBITDA, unchanged from the second quarter.
Now I'll review our segment performance. Segment results exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 4.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of price, mix and acquisitions; partially offset by organic volume, measured by requisitions; and currency. Revenue per requisition increased 4.2%, benefiting from price, mix and acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing. 
Total volume increased 0.3%, with organic volume down 0.3% and acquisition volume up 0.6%. The decline in organic volume is explained by our decision to exit certain low-margin accounts and to discontinue relationships with third-party providers of consumer-initiated testing. These decisions accounted for 70 basis points of organic volume decline. Also as a reminder, we do not include requisitions generated by our hospital lab management agreements in our reported volumes due to the lack of similarity to our core business in terms of both testing frequency and revenue per requisition.
LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $342 million or 20.4% of revenue compared to $319 million or 19.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix, our LaunchPad initiative and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on track to achieve our LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $701 million, an increase of 4.8% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 150 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, which annualizes at the end of October, revenue increased 9.5% over last year. The revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central add businesses. 
Adjusted operating income was $96 million or 13.6% of revenue compared to $97 million or 14.5% last year. The decline in operating income and margin were primarily due to the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, an unusually high level of rework in the clinical business and personnel costs, including investments in CRAs and sales force to support ongoing growth. This was partially offset by increased demand and cost synergies. We remain on track to deliver cost synergies of $100 million for the 3-year period ending in 2017. 
Net orders during the quarter were $755 million, down 7% from last year, representing a net book to bill for the quarter of 1.08 and a trailing 12-month net book to bill of 1.14. Despite the lower-than-expected book to bill ratio, proposals are at a high level. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes September 30 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the year. We expect revenue growth of 10% to 11% after the impact from approximately 60 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 9.5% to 10.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 5% to 6% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 30 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 7.5% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 110 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we expect net revenue to increase 11.2% to 12.7%.
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.70 to $8.90, which implies a growth rate of 10% to 13% over 2015 versus our prior guidance of $8.60 to $8.95. Our adjusted EPS guidance now includes $0.05 per diluted share of special items consisting of on $0.11 benefit from the adoption of the new FASB pronouncement, $0.04 of dilution from the acquisition of Sequenom and a $0.02 impairment from an investment in our venture funds. 
Finally, we expect free cash flow for the year of $840 million to $880 million versus our prior guidance of $900 million to $950 million. This change in our guidance reflects the cash cost associated with the acquisition of Sequenom and advance payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central lab business and an increase in DSOs in Covance Drug Development, which reflects a broader industry trend.

So that was the first part. The second part in terms of the low margin accounts was, every year, we look at profitability by account, we look at return by account, we look at the trends by account. And we had several accounts where we felt that the demands that were being placed to us in terms of workloads and service were significantly above what we felt was the level of return we were getting. And so we made the decision to exit those. It's not particular timing in any quarter, it's just part of an organized annual review that we do. And so as Glenn said, the combination there accounted for about 70 basis points of volume that we decided we were not going to continue with."

So that gave us -- again, from sequential plans, they gave us the boost the second quarter that probably was equal to 40 or 50 basis points. So normalizing for that, we would see going from 1 in 2Q to a net of about 50 basis points in 3Q, which certainly is a downward trend, but it also reflects some seasonality, summer vacation. Now all that said, we still aspire to do better in terms of volume growth. But to your specific question, yes, high deductible plans have an impact. Position business has an impact. We saw in IMS data, the trend is position the office visits year-over-year were down 5% in the second quarter, but they were down 10% in the third quarter. And obviously, that has an impact on demand. So it's a combination of factors. People do get through their deductibles as you go into the fourth quarter, which is encouraging.

At the same time, we know that some efficiencies of the laboratory in terms of automation and other tools that we've developed because of our size. So that's on the sort of expense side. On the revenue side, we highlighted broader payer acceptance with average risk pregnancies. We highlighted the American College of Genetics and Genomics, our position statement saying this was the most method. I would also highlight to you this is Sequenom with a platform that we can continue to expand and offer more testing, and Sequenom rounds out our women's health and reproductive genetics portfolio.

When I look at biotechs across the portfolio, you can look at this, I know people are focused on the biotech spend rates, et cetera. We see that pretty stable, especially based on the in the past and working through the future as well as we're probably oriented to the top 50. Over 80% is in that top 50. I look at that as also an opportunity on the other side to get more and more share of that biotech side. When you look across the portfolio and the performance there, the early development and central labs had and continued their strong momentum. And then finally, on the clinical side, got more work to do. And while potentially weaker than the other 2 areas, we do see impressive actual proposals right now, and now we need to go off the windows."

We reported another solid quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 4.5% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%. We expanded margins in the enterprise level and within LabCorp Diagnostics, an impressive accomplishment in light of lower demand. 
We also continue to augment our growth through the deployment of free cash flow through strategic acquisitions. It is our expectation that our strong free cash flow will also enable us to restart our long-standing program of returning capital to shareholders next year.
We are steadfast and committed to improve health and improve lives around the globe, led by our focus on our 3 strategic priorities: Delivering world-class diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and developing technology-enabled solutions to change the way care is provided. I will now update you on our key activities during the quarter and our progress in each of these objectives. 
First, to be the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, we continue to expand our test menu, innovative science and complement our robust capabilities with key acquisitions. In the third quarter, we completed the strategic acquisition of Sequenom, and our integration plans are on track. The addition of Sequenom positions us as the market leader in NIPT, women's health and reproductive genetics. We now offer patients and physicians one source for the most complete range of women's health diagnostics, simplifying the customer experience. 
Noninvasive prenatal testing is an exciting long-term growth opportunity that continues to gain traction with payers, as evidenced by increasing coverage for average-risk pregnancies. We also see increasing interest from providers, as evidenced by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics updated position statement which recommends that providers inform all pregnant women that noninvasive prenatal screening is the most sensitive screening option for traditionally screened aneuploidies. 
We are also investing in technology that increases patient and consumer engagement and creates a better experience with LabCorp. Our most recent initiatives include our realtime insurance eligibility capability which was implemented nationally earlier this year and allows our personnel to determine whether a patient is insured at the time of service. This tool benefits our patients by helping them avoid unexpected coverage denials. 
In addition, we are testing enhancements in this capability in select locations that provide a preservice disclosure to patients, itemizing their expected payment responsibility, which will benefit patients by reducing surprises in their bills. Both of these initiatives will also help us reduce bad debt.
As part of our commitment to customer engagement, we also expect to launch our consumer-initiated lab test offering before year end, giving consumers access to certain lab tests online in an expeditious, compliant and responsible manner. 
In addition, we expect to launch a mobile-optimized version of our Patient Portal in early 2017, which will improve the customer experience by enabling patient-friendly functionality, such as scheduling appointment or paying a bill anytime, anywhere from any mobile device. 
Second, to bring innovative medicines to patients faster, we continue to enhance our data capabilities, develop differentiated solutions and expand our therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development. 
Last month, we announced the addition of John Ratliff as the CEO of Covance Drug Development. We are thrilled to have John join us, and he is already engaged the Covance team and many of our key clients. We're excited to have John's experience and vision to further enhance our ability to provide superior drug development services. John is deeply engaged in tactical actions of our clinical business, as well as the development of the strategy for the entire Covance portfolio, and we look forward to his contributions to LabCorp in the year to come.
Clients continue to be attracted to the insights extracted from our combined LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development data to optimize clinical trial recruitment. We are focused on effective data utilization for enhanced patient identification, patient engagement, protocol, feasibility and site selection to drive faster recruitment for our clients. Since the acquisition of Covance, our customers have awarded us a dozen studies based on the unique value of LabCorp's data, and we continue to use our integrated data capabilities as a point of differentiation. 
We are committed to enhancing our therapeutic expertise, with a particular focus on the growing areas of oncology and rare and orphan disease. Our combined scientific expertise and experience in these categories is substantial. For example, we worked on all 14 oncology drugs approved by the FDA last year, and we are the only company to provide diagnostic support for all 3 immuno-oncology drugs approved to date. In rare and orphan disease, we worked on 20 of the 21 FDA-approved drugs in 2015. 
Over 80% of rare diseases are genetically defined, and we offer clients more than 480 tests in this category, as well as biomarker development, genetic sequencing, specialty testing and market access services, all of which create a clear differentiator for us in the marketplace. We are further strengthening our enterprise-wide sales force to target clients that will benefit from our scientific leadership for these important therapeutic categories. 
Our success in combining LabCorp and Covance's scientific and operational expertise is particularly apparent in companion diagnostics. Our clients seek scientifically driven cost-effective options for companion diagnostic development, and we are delivering. We are currently supporting more than 3 dozen companion diagnostic programs, 1/3 of which are proprietary programs where we are developing the companion diagnostic for the customer. We look forward to sharing the progress of these programs as they advance through the regulatory process. 
We continue to look at all technology platforms for companion diagnostic applications. For example, we are presently conducting studies on the MiSeqDx next-generation sequencing platform, analyzing the collection of genes that represent a potential CDX application. This work is being performed in our industry-leading Covance central lab genomics facility, which has broad experience in NGS technologies and applications and is a qualified sequencing provider for all leading platform manufacturers. 
Our market-leading central laboratory capabilities are generating revenue growth opportunities beyond companion diagnostics. For example, Covance's central lab is on pace to win new orders in 2016 that will translate into 150,000 tests for LabCorp's esoteric laboratory network, up from 18,000 tests last year. In 1 year, this would be a nearly tenfold increase in the number of complex tests awarded from Covance to LabCorp rather than to other laboratories as a result of our successful lab integration efforts.
We also continue to enhance our central laboratory offering through integration with LabCorp's capabilities and complementary partnerships. Clinical trial investigators' enthusiasm for our enhanced offering is evident in the responses of more than 250 investigators worldwide provided in the recently published survey. Our central lab is rated the most preferred by 60% of surveyed investigators compared to 16% and 11% for the second and third ranked labs, respectively. This was a substantial increase from the 2013 survey, which was the most recent, using the same methodology, where Covance was compared -- was preferred by 47% of investigators compared to 23% for the next-ranked lab. Importantly, 98% of investigators stated that the pharma sponsor selection of central laboratory impacts the investigators' willingness to work with that sponsor in the future. 
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is provided through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions, such as BeaconLBS. The BeaconLBS UnitedHealthcare pilot in Florida has demonstrated positive results, including improved quality of care. Compliance with evidence-based guidelines when ordering lab tests has increased by nearly 50% since the initiation of BeaconLBS. The use of the in-network labs has also increased, helping UnitedHealthcare members maximize their benefits coverage and reduce out-of-pocket costs. 
Following the successful pilot program in Florida, UnitedHealthcare recently announced the program will expand to Texas in 2017, a significant milestone for the BeaconLBS team. In addition, BeaconLBS will enhance the technology by the end of the year to incorporate molecular and genetic test decision support, an area of confusion preventing providers and a driver of lab spend overall. 
Next year, we expect to introduce additional BeaconLBS functionality for health plans, physicians and consumers, including the potential use of the BeaconLBS platform for applications beyond lab testing, such as support for HEDIS and Star ratings. BeaconLBS is an important component of our unique strategic relationship with UnitedHealthcare, and the decision to implement it in an additional market reflects our mutual commitment to the partnership. 
Although earnings and cash flow for this quarter are slightly below our aspirations, this is principally due to deliberate actions in our part. Those decisions include exiting certain accounts in diagnostics, acquiring Sequenom and entering into a strategic collaboration in our central labs business. In addition, our cash flow expectations were diminished by increased DSO in the Covance segment, which reflects a broader industry trend. Despite all of this, our earnings guidance is essentially unchanged. We will finish the year with record cash flow, and we remain excited about and confident for the long-term outlook for our business. 
We remain sharply focused on executing our 3 foundational strategies. The progress we are making positions us as the go-to partner, bringing the critical solutions to address our customers' needs. Our progress on all of these initiatives furthers our mission to improve health and improve lives, something that every one of our 50,000 employees around the globe is committed to every day. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. Revenue for the quart",1688,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 4.5% over last year, due to organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 50 basis points. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 3.6%. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $788 million or 33.2% of revenue compared to $765 million or 33.7% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to price, mix, acquisitions, our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative and Covance cost synergies, partially offset by unusually high level of rework in the clinical business and personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was due to lower margins in Covance Drug Development. 
SG&A for the quarter was $400 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $386 million or 17% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $16 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Sequenom and our LaunchPad initiative compared to $5 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $384 million or 16.2% of revenue compared to $381 million or 16.8% a year ago. We continue to leverage our SG&A expense well, as evidenced by our 60 basis point improvement in the SG&A rate, which was primarily due to continued expense control, including our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A dollars would've been down from last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $23 million of restructuring charges, primarily due to the closure of redundant facilities and associated severance. These closures include our progress on consolidating our 8 main central laboratory facilities to 4 by the end of 2017 as part of the integration of Covance. 
Operating income for the quarter was $324 million or 13.7% of revenue compared to $308 million or 13.6% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $80 million, adjusted operating income was $404 million or 17% of revenue compared to $384 million or 16.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix and our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives, partially offset by higher rework in the clinical business and personnel costs. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million compared to $56 million in the third quarter of 2015. The increase was due to a $6 million non-recurring expense for the early retirement of debt assumed as part of the acquisition to Sequenom, partially offset by lower debt balances. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 31.7% compared to 38.4% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%, down from 35.3% last year.
Two accounting changes impacted the tax rate. First, the early adoption in the third quarter of the new FASB pronouncement relating to tax benefits of stock compensation lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rates by 1%. And second, the reclassification this quarter of certain gross receipts taxes from income tax expense to SG&A expense lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rate by 0.6%. This reclassification does not impact EPS and has been adjusted for prior periods. These 2 accounting changes resulted in a 1.6% improvement in our tax rate for the quarter. In addition, the reversal of expired tax reserves, as well as geographic mix of earnings, also contributed to the improvement over last year's tax rate. 
For the year, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 34%, which represents our prior expectation of 35.3% less the impact from these 2 accounting changes.
Net earnings for the quarter were $180 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.25 in the quarter, up 9% over $2.07 last year. Our GAAP and adjusted results in the quarter included 2 special items: A benefit of $0.02 per diluted share from the adoption of FASB pronouncement and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from the impairment of an investment in our venture fund. In addition, the company incurred a loss of $0.01 per diluted share during the quarter from the acquisition of Sequenom. However, we continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to results during our first year of ownership.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $250 million compared to $288 million last year. The decline was primarily due to fees associated with the acquisition of Sequenom and higher working capital requirements, including an advance payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central labs business. 
Capital expenditures totaled $66 million or 2.8% of revenue, down from $68 million or 3% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $184 million in the quarter compared to $220 million last year.
At quarter end, our cash balance was $568 million, down from $640 million at the end of the second quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.2 billion. During the quarter, we invested $253 million in acquisitions and assumed $130 million of Sequenom debt, which was retired in October. The company's leverage at quarter end was 3.3x gross debt for the last 12 months pro forma EBITDA, unchanged from the second quarter.
Now I'll review our segment performance. Segment results exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 4.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of price, mix and acquisitions; partially offset by organic volume, measured by requisitions; and currency. Revenue per requisition increased 4.2%, benefiting from price, mix and acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing. 
Total volume increased 0.3%, with organic volume down 0.3% and acquisition volume up 0.6%. The decline in organic volume is explained by our decision to exit certain low-margin accounts and to discontinue relationships with third-party providers of consumer-initiated testing. These decisions accounted for 70 basis points of organic volume decline. Also as a reminder, we do not include requisitions generated by our hospital lab management agreements in our reported volumes due to the lack of similarity to our core business in terms of both testing frequency and revenue per requisition.
LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $342 million or 20.4% of revenue compared to $319 million or 19.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix, our LaunchPad initiative and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on track to achieve our LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $701 million, an increase of 4.8% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 150 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, which annualizes at the end of October, revenue increased 9.5% over last year. The revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central add businesses. 
Adjusted operating income was $96 million or 13.6% of revenue compared to $97 million or 14.5% last year. The decline in operating income and margin were primarily due to the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, an unusually high level of rework in the clinical business and personnel costs, including investments in CRAs and sales force to support ongoing growth. This was partially offset by increased demand and cost synergies. We remain on track to deliver cost synergies of $100 million for the 3-year period ending in 2017. 
Net orders during the quarter were $755 million, down 7% from last year, representing a net book to bill for the quarter of 1.08 and a trailing 12-month net book to bill of 1.14. Despite the lower-than-expected book to bill ratio, proposals are at a high level. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes September 30 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the year. We expect revenue growth of 10% to 11% after the impact from approximately 60 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 9.5% to 10.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 5% to 6% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 30 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 7.5% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 110 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we expect net revenue to increase 11.2% to 12.7%.
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.70 to $8.90, which implies a growth rate of 10% to 13% over 2015 versus our prior guidance of $8.60 to $8.95. Our adjusted EPS guidance now includes $0.05 per diluted share of special items consisting of on $0.11 benefit from the adoption of the new FASB pronouncement, $0.04 of dilution from the acquisition of Sequenom and a $0.02 impairment from an investment in our venture funds. 
Finally, we expect free cash flow for the year of $840 million to $880 million versus our prior guidance of $900 million to $950 million. This change in our guidance reflects the cash cost associated with the acquisition of Sequenom and advance payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central lab business and an increase in DSOs in Covance Drug Development, which reflects a broader industry trend. 
This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll be now happy to take questions. Operator?"

So as we've said, we intend to launch our own consumer-enabled testing service this year.

So that was the first part. The second part in terms of the low margin accounts was, every year, we look at profitability by account, we look at return by account, we look at the trends by account. And we had several accounts where we felt that the demands that were being placed to us in terms of workloads and service were significantly above what we felt was the level of return we were getting. And so we made the decision to exit those. It's not particular timing in any quarter, it's just part of an organized annual review that we do. And so as Glenn said, the combination there accounted for about 70 basis points of volume that we decided we were not going to continue with."

So that gave us -- again, from a sequential trend, it gave us a boost the second quarter that probably was equal to 40 or 50 basis points. So normalizing for that, we would see going from 1% in 2Q to a net of about 50 basis points in 3Q, which certainly is a downward trend, but it also reflects some seasonality, summer vacation. Now all that said, we still aspire to do better in terms of volume growth. But to your specific question, yes, high deductible plans have an impact, physician business has an impact. We saw in the IMS data, the trend is physician with office visits year-over-year were down 5% in the second quarter, but they were down 10% in the third quarter. And obviously, that has an impact on demand. So it's a combination of factors. People do get through their deductibles as you go into the fourth quarter, which is encouraging. But I think there's also a lot of uncertainty. And as you -- as everybody's reading about, the Affordable Care Act plans, there's a lot of pressure on premium cost, there's a lot of pressure on coverage, there's a lot of pressure on providers withdrawing from their plans, with products in the market. So I wouldn't necessarily say that we have clarity in terms of what's going to happen with fourth quarter volumes, aside from what the historical experience has been."

In terms of how that happens, obviously, there are some redundant public company costs, and -- but I want to be clear that it's our intention to keep the laboratory in San Diego open and to actually send more NIPT volume through that laboratory because of its licensure and because of some of the tools that they've developed. At the same time, we know that we can bring some efficiencies of the laboratory just in terms of automation and other tools that we've developed because of our size. So that's on the -- sort of on the expense side. On the revenue side, we've highlighted broader payer acceptance with average-risk pregnancies. We highlighted the American College of Genetics and Genomics position statement saying this was the most sensitive screening method. I would also highlight to you, this is -- Sequenom provides us with a platform that we can continue to expand and offer more testing. And Sequenom rounds out our women's health and reproductive genetics portfolio. So think there's this very attractive opportunity for top line growth, as well as the ability to reduce the expense base.

It's a tool that we invented, basically, to address what we perceived to be a need in the marketplace for 2 things: Better decision support around selection of high-value testing, as well as better ability for payers to manage the trend in high-value testing. And so the fact that United has made the decision that they want to expand to another market, the fact that we're developing capabilities for molecular testing and want to develop capabilities to enhance not only test selection but also to use the platform for HEDIS and Star ratings, think these are all things -- and obviously, with the support of United, I think these are all things that speak to the importance of this tool and the value that's placed on in the relationship.

We have been investing in our revenue cycle management capabilities literally since 1997, 1998, where we started consolidating billing systems and standardizing. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think a lot of the things that have been referenced as potential opportunities between our competitor and Optum, we're already doing. We're already doing realtime eligibility verification. We're already doing transparency to the patient and what they're going to pay. We're already doing collections at point of service. So we're going to continue to -- and we use some outside tools for that. Make no mistake. It's not kind of the everything has to be embedded here syndrome.

And so we're not going to be of a mind that we should turn that over to anyone else to manage for us. We're always looking for tools that enhance our capabilities, but that's a core competency. And as we've said over and over again, consumer engagement and that relationship with the consumer for both the LabCorp and the Covance business brings us a tremendous amount of value."

We reported another solid quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 4.5% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%. We expanded margins in the enterprise level and within LabCorp Diagnostics, an impressive accomplishment in light of lower demand. 
We also continue to augment our growth through the deployment of free cash flow to strategic acquisitions. It is our expectation that our strong free cash flow will also enable us to restart our long-standing program of returning capital to shareholders next year.
We are steadfast and committed to improve health and improve lives around the globe, led by our focus on our 3 strategic priorities: delivering world-class diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and developing technology-enabled solutions to change the way care is provided. I will now update you on our key activities during the quarter and our progress on each of these objectives. 
First, to be the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, we continue to expand our test menu, innovative science and complement our robust capabilities with key acquisitions. In the third quarter, we completed the strategic acquisition of Sequenom, and our integration plans are on track. The addition of Sequenom positions us as the market leader in NIPT, women's health and reproductive genetics. We now offer patients and physicians one source for the most complete range of women's health diagnostics, simplifying the customer experience. 
Noninvasive prenatal testing is an exciting long-term growth opportunity that continues to gain traction with payers, as evidenced by increasing coverage for average-risk pregnancies. We also see increasing interest from providers, as evidenced by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics updated position statement which recommends that providers inform all pregnant women that noninvasive prenatal screening is the most sensitive screening option for traditionally screened aneuploidies. 
We are also investing in technology that increases patient and consumer engagement and creates a better experience with LabCorp. Our most recent initiatives include our real-time insurance eligibility capability which was implemented nationally earlier this year and allows our personnel to determine whether a patient is insured at the time of service. This tool benefits our patients by helping them avoid unexpected coverage denials. 
In addition, we are testing enhancements in this capability in select locations that provide a preservice disclosure to patients, itemizing their expected payment responsibility, which will benefit patients by reducing surprises in their bills. Both of these initiatives will also help us reduce bad debt.
As part of our commitment to customer engagement, we also expect to launch our consumer-initiated lab test offering before year end, giving consumers access to certain lab tests online in an expeditious, compliant and responsible manner. 
In addition, we expect to launch a mobile-optimized version of our Patient Portal in early 2017, which will improve the customer experience by enabling patient-friendly functionality, such as scheduling appointment or paying a bill anytime, anywhere from any mobile device. 
Second, to bring innovative medicines to patients faster, we continue to enhance our data capabilities, develop differentiated solutions and expand our therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development. 
Last month, we announced the addition of John Ratliff as the CEO of Covance Drug Development. We are thrilled to have John join us, and he has already engaged the Covance team and many of our key clients. We're excited to have John's experience and vision to further enhance our ability to provide superior drug development services. John is deeply engaged in tactical actions of our clinical business, as well as the development of the strategy for the entire Covance portfolio, and we look forward to his contributions to LabCorp in the year to come.
Clients continue to be attracted to the insights extracted from our combined LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development data to optimize clinical trial recruitment. We are focused on effective data utilization for enhanced patient identification, patient engagement, protocol feasibility and site selection to drive faster recruitment for our clients. Since the acquisition of Covance, our customers have awarded us a dozen studies based on the unique value of LabCorp's data, and we continue to use our integrated data capabilities as a point of differentiation. 
We are committed to enhancing our therapeutic expertise, with a particular focus on the growing areas of oncology and rare and orphan disease. Our combined scientific expertise and experience in these categories is substantial. For example, we worked on all 14 oncology drugs approved by the FDA last year, and we are the only company to provide diagnostic support for all 3 immuno-oncology drugs approved to date. In rare and orphan disease, we worked on 20 of the 21 FDA-approved drugs in 2015. 
Over 80% of rare diseases are genetically defined, and we offer clients more than 480 tests in this category, as well as biomarker development, genetic sequencing, specialty testing and market access services, all of which create a clear differentiator for us in the marketplace. We are further strengthening our enterprise-wide sales force to target clients that will benefit from our scientific leadership for these important therapeutic categories. 
Our success in combining LabCorp and Covance's scientific and operational expertise is particularly apparent in companion diagnostics. Our clients seek scientifically driven cost-effective options for companion diagnostic development, and we are delivering. We are currently supporting more than 3 dozen companion diagnostic programs, 1/3 of which are proprietary programs where we are developing the companion diagnostic for the customer. We look forward to sharing the progress of these programs as they advance through the regulatory process. 
We continue to look at all technology platforms for companion diagnostic applications. For example, we are presently conducting studies on the MiSeqDx next-generation sequencing platform, analyzing the collection of genes that represent a potential CDX application. This work is being performed in our industry-leading Covance central lab genomics facility, which has broad experience in NGS technologies and applications and is a qualified sequencing provider for all leading platform manufacturers. 
Our market-leading central laboratory capabilities are generating revenue growth opportunities beyond companion diagnostics. For example, Covance's central lab is on pace to win new orders in 2016 that will translate into 150,000 tests for LabCorp's esoteric laboratory network, up from 18,000 tests last year. In 1 year, this would be a nearly tenfold increase in the number of complex tests awarded from Covance to LabCorp rather than to other laboratories as a result of our successful lab integration efforts.
We also continue to enhance our central laboratory offering through integration with LabCorp's capabilities and complementary partnerships. Clinical trial investigators' enthusiasm for our enhanced offering is evident in the responses of more than 250 investigators worldwide provided in a recently published survey. Our central lab was rated the most preferred by 60% of surveyed investigators compared to 16% and 11% for the second and third ranked labs, respectively. This was a substantial increase from the 2013 survey, which was the most recent, using the same methodology, where Covance was compared -- was preferred by 47% of investigators compared to 23% for the next-ranked lab. Importantly, 98% of investigators stated that the pharma-sponsored selection of central laboratory impacts the investigators' willingness to work with that sponsor in the future. 
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is provided through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions, such as BeaconLBS. The BeaconLBS UnitedHealthcare pilot in Florida has demonstrated positive results, including improved quality of care. Compliance with evidence-based guidelines when ordering lab tests has increased by nearly 50% since the initiation of BeaconLBS. The use of in-network labs has also increased, helping UnitedHealthcare members maximize their benefits coverage and reduce out-of-pocket costs. 
Following the successful pilot program in Florida, UnitedHealthcare recently announced the program will expand to Texas in 2017, a significant milestone for the BeaconLBS team. In addition, BeaconLBS will enhance the technology by the end of the year to incorporate molecular and genetic test decision support, an area of confusion preventing providers and a driver of lab spend overall. 
Next year, we expect to introduce additional BeaconLBS functionality for health plans, physicians and consumers, including the potential use of the BeaconLBS platform for applications beyond lab testing, such as support for HEDIS and Star ratings. BeaconLBS is an important component of our unique strategic relationship with UnitedHealthcare, and the decision to implement it in an additional market reflects our mutual commitment to the partnership. 
Although earnings and cash flow for this quarter are slightly below our aspirations, this is principally due to deliberate actions on our part. Those decisions include exiting certain accounts in diagnostics, acquiring Sequenom and entering into a strategic collaboration in our central labs business. In addition, our cash flow expectations were diminished by increased DSO in the Covance segment, which reflects a broader industry trend. Despite all of this, our earnings guidance is essentially unchanged. We will finish the year with record cash flow, and we remain excited about and confident in the long-term outlook for our business. 
We remain sharply focused on executing our 3 foundational strategies. The progress we are making positions us as the go-to partner, bringing the critical solutions to address our customers' needs. Our progress on all of these initiatives furthers our mission to improve health and improve lives, something that every one of our 50,000 employees around the globe is committed to every day.

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. Revenue for the quart",1688,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 4.5% over last year, due to organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 50 basis points. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 3.6%. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $788 million or 33.2% of revenue compared to $765 million or 33.7% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to price, mix, acquisitions, our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative and Covance cost synergies, partially offset by unusually high level of rework in the clinical business and personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was due to lower margins in Covance Drug Development. 
SG&A for the quarter was $400 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $386 million or 17% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $16 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Sequenom and our LaunchPad initiative compared to $5 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $384 million or 16.2% of revenue compared to $381 million or 16.8% a year ago. We continue to leverage our SG&A expense well, as evidenced by our 60 basis point improvement in the SG&A rate, which was primarily due to continued expense control, including our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A dollars would've been down from last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $23 million of restructuring charges, primarily due to the closure of redundant facilities and associated severance. These closures include our progress on consolidating our 8 main central laboratory facilities to 4 by the end of 2017 as part of the integration of Covance. 
Operating income for the quarter was $324 million or 13.7% of revenue compared to $308 million or 13.6% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $80 million, adjusted operating income was $404 million or 17% of revenue compared to $384 million or 16.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix and our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives, partially offset by higher rework in the clinical business and personnel costs. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million compared to $56 million in the third quarter of 2015. The increase was due to a $6 million non-recurring expense for the early retirement of debt assumed as part of the acquisition to Sequenom, partially offset by lower debt balances. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 31.7% compared to 38.4% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%, down from 35.3% last year.
Two accounting changes impacted the tax rate. First, the early adoption in the third quarter of the new FASB pronouncement relating to tax benefits of stock compensation lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rates by 1%. And second, the reclassification this quarter of certain gross receipts taxes from income tax expense to SG&A expense lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rate by 0.6%. This reclassification does not impact EPS and has been adjusted for prior periods. These 2 accounting changes resulted in a 1.6% improvement in our tax rate for the quarter. In addition, the reversal of expired tax reserves, as well as geographic mix of earnings, also contributed to the improvement over last year's tax rate. 
For the year, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 34%, which represents our prior expectation of 35.3% less the impact from these 2 accounting changes.
Net earnings for the quarter were $180 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.25 in the quarter, up 9% over $2.07 last year. Our GAAP and adjusted results in the quarter included 2 special items: a benefit of $0.02 per diluted share from the adoption of FASB pronouncement and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from the impairment of an investment in our venture fund. In addition, the company incurred a loss of $0.01 per diluted share during the quarter from the acquisition of Sequenom. However, we continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to results during our first year of ownership.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $250 million compared to $288 million last year. The decline was primarily due to fees associated with the acquisition of Sequenom and higher working capital requirements, including an advance payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central lab business. 
Capital expenditures totaled $66 million or 2.8% of revenue, down from $68 million or 3% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $184 million in the quarter compared to $220 million last year.
At quarter end, our cash balance was $568 million, down from $640 million at the end of the second quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.2 billion. During the quarter, we invested $253 million in acquisitions and assumed $130 million of Sequenom debt, which was retired in October. The company's leverage at quarter end was 3.3x gross debt for the last 12 months pro forma EBITDA, unchanged from the second quarter.
Now I'll review our segment performance. Segment results exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 4.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of price, mix and acquisitions; partially offset by organic volume, measured by requisitions; and currency. Revenue per requisition increased 4.2%, benefiting from price, mix and acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing. 
Total volume increased 0.3%, with organic volume down 0.3% and acquisition volume up 0.6%. The decline in organic volume is explained by our decision to exit certain low-margin accounts and to discontinue relationships with third-party providers of consumer-initiated testing. These decisions accounted for 70 basis points of organic volume decline. Also as a reminder, we do not include requisitions generated by our hospital lab management agreements in our reported volumes due to the lack of similarity to our core business in terms of both testing frequency and revenue per requisition.
LabCorp Diagnostics’ adjusted operating income for the quarter was $342 million or 20.4% of revenue compared to $319 million or 19.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix, our LaunchPad initiative and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on track to achieve our LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $701 million, an increase of 4.8% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 150 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, which annualizes at the end of October, revenue increased 9.5% over last year. The revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central lab businesses. 
Adjusted operating income was $96 million or 13.6% of revenue compared to $97 million or 14.5% last year. The decline in operating income and margin were primarily due to the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, an unusually high level of rework in the clinical business and personnel costs, including investments in CRAs and sales force to support ongoing growth. This was partially offset by increased demand and cost synergies. We remain on track to deliver cost synergies of $100 million for the 3-year period ending in 2017. 
Net orders during the quarter were $755 million, down 7% from last year, representing a net book to bill for the quarter of 1.08 and a trailing 12-month net book to bill of 1.14. Despite the lower-than-expected book to bill ratio, proposals are at a high level. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes September 30 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the year. We expect revenue growth of 10% to 11% after the impact from approximately 60 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 9.5% to 10.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 5% to 6% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 30 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 7.5% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 110 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we expect net revenue to increase 11.2% to 12.7%.
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.70 to $8.90, which implies a growth rate of 10% to 13% over 2015 versus our prior guidance of $8.60 to $8.95. Our adjusted EPS guidance now includes $0.05 per diluted share of special items consisting of on $0.11 benefit from the adoption of the new FASB pronouncement, $0.04 of dilution from the acquisition of Sequenom and a $0.02 impairment from an investment in our venture funds. 
Finally, we expect free cash flow for the year of $840 million to $880 million versus our prior guidance of $900 million to $950 million. This change in our guidance reflects the cash cost associated with the acquisition of Sequenom and advance payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central lab business and an increase in DSOs in Covance Drug Development, which reflects a broader industry trend. 
This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll be now happy to take questions. Operator?"

So as we've said, we intend to launch our own consumer-enabled testing service this year. And part of the preparation for that is to discontinue relationships with the existing third parties that are essentially using our brand and our capabilities to provide consumer-initiated testing. So that was the first part. The second part in terms of the low margin accounts was, every year, we look at profitability by account, we look at return by account, we look at the trends by account. And we had several accounts where we felt that the demands that were being placed on us in terms of workloads and service were significantly above what we felt was the level of return we were getting. And so we made the decision to exit those. It's not particular timing in any quarter, it's just part of an organized annual review that we do. And so as Glenn said, the combination there accounted for about 70 basis points of volume that we decided we were not going to continue with."

So that gave us -- again, from a sequential trend, it gave us a boost to the second quarter that probably was equal to 40 or 50 basis points. So normalizing for that, we would see going from 1% in 2Q to a net of about 50 basis points in 3Q, which certainly is a downward trend, but it also reflects some seasonality, summer vacation. Now all that said, we still aspire to do better in terms of volume growth. But to your specific question, yes, high deductible plans have an impact, physician business has an impact. We saw in the IMS data, the trend is physician and office visits year-over-year were down 5% in the second quarter, but they were down 10% in the third quarter. And obviously, that has an impact on demand. So it's a combination of factors. People do get through their deductibles as you go into the fourth quarter, which is encouraging. But I think there's also a lot of uncertainty. And as you -- as everybody's reading about, the Affordable Care Act plans, there's a lot of pressure on premium cost, there's a lot of pressure on coverage, there's a lot of pressure on providers withdrawing from their plans, withdrawing from the markets. So I wouldn't necessarily say that we have clarity in terms of what's going to happen with fourth quarter volumes, aside from what the historical experience has been."

In terms of how that happens, obviously, there are some redundant public company costs, and -- but I want to be clear that it's our intention to keep that laboratory in San Diego open and to actually send more NIPT volume through that laboratory because of its licensure and because of some of the tools that they've developed. At the same time, we know that we can bring some efficiencies to the laboratory just in terms of automation and other tools that we've developed because of our size. So that's on the -- sort of on the expense side. On the revenue side, we've highlighted broader payer acceptance with average-risk pregnancies. We highlighted the American College of Genetics and Genomics position statement saying this was the most sensitive screening method. I would also highlight to you, this is -- Sequenom provides us with a platform that we can continue to expand and offer more testing. And Sequenom rounds out our women's health and reproductive genetics portfolio.

I mean, I think the idea -- and obviously, it's -- we're still framing it as we look at what we're going to have next year and what's on our target list, but the idea is that we would resume the 50-50 split fairly quickly. It's not kind of a we'll start a little bit and dribble it out, it's we're going to return capital to shareholders, and we're going to think about it in the way that we historically have. In terms of the outsourcing of the revenue cycle management, obviously, we have a lot of respect for the people at Optum. They do terrific work. We have been investing in our revenue cycle management capabilities literally since 1997, 1998, when we started consolidating billing systems and standardizing. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think a lot of the things that have been referenced as potential opportunities between our competitor and Optum, we're already doing. We're already doing real-time eligibility verification. We're already doing transparency to the patient and what they're going to pay. We're already doing collections at point of service. So we're going to continue to -- and we use some outside tools for that. Make no mistake. It's not kind of the everything has to be embedded here syndrome. But -- so we'll continue to look at what people can bring to complement our capabilities. But fundamentally, I just want to be clear that we view that direct engagement and relationship with the patient as a very important part of our business. And so we're not going to be of a mind that we should turn that over to anyone else to manage for us. We're always looking for tools that enhance our capabilities, but that's a core competency. And as we've said over and over again, consumer engagement and that relationship with the consumer for both the LabCorp and the Covance business brings us a tremendous amount of value."

We reported another solid quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 4.5% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%. We expanded margins in the enterprise level and within LabCorp Diagnostics, an impressive accomplishment in light of lower demand. 
We also continue to augment our growth through the deployment of free cash flow to strategic acquisitions. It is our expectation that our strong free cash flow will also enable us to restart our long-standing program of returning capital to shareholders next year.
We are steadfast and committed to improve health and improve lives around the globe, led by our focus on our 3 strategic priorities: delivering world-class diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and developing technology-enabled solutions to change the way care is provided. I will now update you on our key activities during the quarter and our progress on each of these objectives. 
First, to be the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, we continue to expand our test menu, innovative science and complement our robust capabilities with key acquisitions. In the third quarter, we completed the strategic acquisition of Sequenom, and our integration plans are on track. The addition of Sequenom positions us as the market leader in NIPT, women's health and reproductive genetics. We now offer patients and physicians one source for the most complete range of women's health diagnostics, simplifying the customer experience. 
Noninvasive prenatal testing is an exciting long-term growth opportunity that continues to gain traction with payers, as evidenced by increasing coverage for average-risk pregnancies. We also see increasing interest from providers, as evidenced by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics updated position statement which recommends that providers inform all pregnant women that noninvasive prenatal screening is the most sensitive screening option for traditionally screened aneuploidies. 
We are also investing in technology that increases patient and consumer engagement and creates a better experience with LabCorp. Our most recent initiatives include our real-time insurance eligibility capability which was implemented nationally earlier this year and allows our personnel to determine whether a patient is insured at the time of service. This tool benefits our patients by helping them avoid unexpected coverage denials. 
In addition, we are testing enhancements in this capability in select locations that provide a preservice disclosure to patients, itemizing their expected payment responsibility, which will benefit patients by reducing surprises in their bills. Both of these initiatives will also help us reduce bad debt.
As part of our commitment to customer engagement, we also expect to launch our consumer-initiated lab test offering before year end, giving consumers access to certain lab tests online in an expeditious, compliant and responsible manner. 
In addition, we expect to launch a mobile-optimized version of our Patient Portal in early 2017, which will improve the customer experience by enabling patient-friendly functionality, such as scheduling appointment or paying a bill anytime, anywhere from any mobile device. 
Second, to bring innovative medicines to patients faster, we continue to enhance our data capabilities, develop differentiated solutions and expand our therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development. 
Last month, we announced the addition of John Ratliff as the CEO of Covance Drug Development. We are thrilled to have John join us, and he has already engaged the Covance team and many of our key clients. We're excited to have John's experience and vision to further enhance our ability to provide superior drug development services. John is deeply engaged in tactical actions of our clinical business, as well as the development of the strategy for the entire Covance portfolio, and we look forward to his contributions to LabCorp in the year to come.
Clients continue to be attracted to the insights extracted from our combined LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development data to optimize clinical trial recruitment. We are focused on effective data utilization for enhanced patient identification, patient engagement, protocol feasibility and site selection to drive faster recruitment for our clients. Since the acquisition of Covance, our customers have awarded us a dozen studies based on the unique value of LabCorp's data, and we continue to use our integrated data capabilities as a point of differentiation. 
We are committed to enhancing our therapeutic expertise, with a particular focus on the growing areas of oncology and rare and orphan disease. Our combined scientific expertise and experience in these categories is substantial. For example, we worked on all 14 oncology drugs approved by the FDA last year, and we are the only company to provide diagnostic support for all 3 immuno-oncology drugs approved to date. In rare and orphan disease, we worked on 20 of the 21 FDA-approved drugs in 2015. 
Over 80% of rare diseases are genetically defined, and we offer clients more than 480 tests in this category, as well as biomarker development, genetic sequencing, specialty testing and market access services, all of which create a clear differentiator for us in the marketplace. We are further strengthening our enterprise-wide sales force to target clients that will benefit from our scientific leadership for these important therapeutic categories. 
Our success in combining LabCorp and Covance's scientific and operational expertise is particularly apparent in companion diagnostics. Our clients seek scientifically driven cost-effective options for companion diagnostic development, and we are delivering. We are currently supporting more than 3 dozen companion diagnostic programs, 1/3 of which are proprietary programs where we are developing the companion diagnostic for the customer. We look forward to sharing the progress of these programs as they advance through the regulatory process. 
We continue to look at all technology platforms for companion diagnostic applications. For example, we are presently conducting studies on the MiSeqDx next-generation sequencing platform, analyzing the collection of genes that represent a potential CDX application. This work is being performed in our industry-leading Covance central lab genomics facility, which has broad experience in NGS technologies and applications and is a qualified sequencing provider for all leading platform manufacturers. 
Our market-leading central laboratory capabilities are generating revenue growth opportunities beyond companion diagnostics. For example, Covance's central lab is on pace to win new orders in 2016 that will translate into 150,000 tests for LabCorp's esoteric laboratory network, up from 18,000 tests last year. In 1 year, this would be a nearly tenfold increase in the number of complex tests awarded from Covance to LabCorp rather than to other laboratories as a result of our successful lab integration efforts.
We also continue to enhance our central laboratory offering through integration with LabCorp's capabilities and complementary partnerships. Clinical trial investigators' enthusiasm for our enhanced offering is evident in the responses of more than 250 investigators worldwide provided in a recently published survey. Our central lab was rated the most preferred by 60% of surveyed investigators compared to 16% and 11% for the second and third ranked labs, respectively. This was a substantial increase from the 2013 survey, which was the most recent, using the same methodology, where Covance was compared -- was preferred by 47% of investigators compared to 23% for the next-ranked lab. Importantly, 98% of investigators stated that the pharma-sponsored selection of central laboratory impacts the investigators' willingness to work with that sponsor in the future. 
For our third objective, we are changing the way care is provided through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions, such as BeaconLBS. The BeaconLBS UnitedHealthcare pilot in Florida has demonstrated positive results, including improved quality of care. Compliance with evidence-based guidelines when ordering lab tests has increased by nearly 50% since the initiation of BeaconLBS. The use of in-network labs has also increased, helping UnitedHealthcare members maximize their benefits coverage and reduce out-of-pocket costs. 
Following the successful pilot program in Florida, UnitedHealthcare recently announced the program will expand to Texas in 2017, a significant milestone for the BeaconLBS team. In addition, BeaconLBS will enhance the technology by the end of the year to incorporate molecular and genetic test decision support, an area of confusion preventing providers and a driver of lab spend overall. 
Next year, we expect to introduce additional BeaconLBS functionality for health plans, physicians and consumers, including the potential use of the BeaconLBS platform for applications beyond lab testing, such as support for HEDIS and Star ratings. BeaconLBS is an important component of our unique strategic relationship with UnitedHealthcare, and the decision to implement it in an additional market reflects our mutual commitment to the partnership. 
Although earnings and cash flow for this quarter are slightly below our aspirations, this is principally due to deliberate actions on our part. Those decisions include exiting certain accounts in diagnostics, acquiring Sequenom and entering into a strategic collaboration in our central labs business. In addition, our cash flow expectations were diminished by increased DSO in the Covance segment, which reflects a broader industry trend. Despite all of this, our earnings guidance is essentially unchanged. We will finish the year with record cash flow, and we remain excited about and confident in the long-term outlook for our business. 
We remain sharply focused on executing our 3 foundational strategies. The progress we are making positions us as the go-to partner, bringing the critical solutions to address our customers' needs. Our progress on all of these initiatives furthers our mission to improve health and improve lives, something that every one of our 50,000 employees around the globe is committed to every day. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress.
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. Revenue for the quart",1688,"Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 4.5% over last year, due to organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 50 basis points. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 3.6%. 
Gross profit for the quarter was $788 million or 33.2% of revenue compared to $765 million or 33.7% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to price, mix, acquisitions, our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative and Covance cost synergies, partially offset by unusually high level of rework in the clinical business and personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was due to lower margins in Covance Drug Development. 
SG&A for the quarter was $400 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $386 million or 17% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $16 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Sequenom and our LaunchPad initiative compared to $5 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $384 million or 16.2% of revenue compared to $381 million or 16.8% a year ago. We continue to leverage our SG&A expense well, as evidenced by our 60 basis point improvement in the SG&A rate, which was primarily due to continued expense control, including our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A dollars would've been down from last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $23 million of restructuring charges, primarily due to the closure of redundant facilities and associated severance. These closures include our progress on consolidating our 8 main central laboratory facilities to 4 by the end of 2017 as part of the integration of Covance. 
Operating income for the quarter was $324 million or 13.7% of revenue compared to $308 million or 13.6% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $80 million, adjusted operating income was $404 million or 17% of revenue compared to $384 million or 16.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix and our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives, partially offset by higher rework in the clinical business and personnel costs. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million compared to $56 million in the third quarter of 2015. The increase was due to a $6 million non-recurring expense for the early retirement of debt assumed as part of the acquisition to Sequenom, partially offset by lower debt balances. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 31.7% compared to 38.4% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%, down from 35.3% last year.
Two accounting changes impacted the tax rate. First, the early adoption in the third quarter of the new FASB pronouncement relating to tax benefits of stock compensation lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rates by 1%. And second, the reclassification this quarter of certain gross receipts taxes from income tax expense to SG&A expense lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rate by 0.6%. This reclassification does not impact EPS and has been adjusted for prior periods. These 2 accounting changes resulted in a 1.6% improvement in our tax rate for the quarter. In addition, the reversal of expired tax reserves, as well as geographic mix of earnings, also contributed to the improvement over last year's tax rate. 
For the year, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 34%, which represents our prior expectation of 35.3% less the impact from these 2 accounting changes.
Net earnings for the quarter were $180 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.25 in the quarter, up 9% over $2.07 last year. Our GAAP and adjusted results in the quarter included 2 special items: a benefit of $0.02 per diluted share from the adoption of FASB pronouncement and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from the impairment of an investment in our venture fund. In addition, the company incurred a loss of $0.01 per diluted share during the quarter from the acquisition of Sequenom. However, we continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to results during our first year of ownership.
During the quarter, operating cash flow was $250 million compared to $288 million last year. The decline was primarily due to fees associated with the acquisition of Sequenom and higher working capital requirements, including an advance payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central lab business. 
Capital expenditures totaled $66 million or 2.8% of revenue, down from $68 million or 3% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $184 million in the quarter compared to $220 million last year.
At quarter end, our cash balance was $568 million, down from $640 million at the end of the second quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.2 billion. During the quarter, we invested $253 million in acquisitions and assumed $130 million of Sequenom debt, which was retired in October. The company's leverage at quarter end was 3.3x gross debt for the last 12 months pro forma EBITDA, unchanged from the second quarter.
Now I'll review our segment performance. Segment results exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.
Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 4.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of price, mix and acquisitions; partially offset by organic volume, measured by requisitions; and currency. Revenue per requisition increased 4.2%, benefiting from price, mix and acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing. 
Total volume increased 0.3%, with organic volume down 0.3% and acquisition volume up 0.6%. The decline in organic volume is explained by our decision to exit certain low-margin accounts and to discontinue relationships with third-party providers of consumer-initiated testing. These decisions accounted for 70 basis points of organic volume decline. Also as a reminder, we do not include requisitions generated by our hospital lab management agreements in our reported volumes due to the lack of similarity to our core business in terms of both testing frequency and revenue per requisition.
LabCorp Diagnostics’ adjusted operating income for the quarter was $342 million or 20.4% of revenue compared to $319 million or 19.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix, our LaunchPad initiative and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on track to achieve our LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the 3-year period ending in 2017.
Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $701 million, an increase of 4.8% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 150 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, which annualizes at the end of October, revenue increased 9.5% over last year. The revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central lab businesses. 
Adjusted operating income was $96 million or 13.6% of revenue compared to $97 million or 14.5% last year. The decline in operating income and margin were primarily due to the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, an unusually high level of rework in the clinical business and personnel costs, including investments in CRAs and sales force to support ongoing growth. This was partially offset by increased demand and cost synergies. We remain on track to deliver cost synergies of $100 million for the 3-year period ending in 2017. 
Net orders during the quarter were $755 million, down 7% from last year, representing a net book to bill for the quarter of 1.08 and a trailing 12-month net book to bill of 1.14. Despite the lower-than-expected book to bill ratio, proposals are at a high level. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion.
Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes September 30 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the year. We expect revenue growth of 10% to 11% after the impact from approximately 60 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 9.5% to 10.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom. 
We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 5% to 6% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 30 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom. 
We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 7.5% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 110 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we expect net revenue to increase 11.2% to 12.7%.
We expect adjusted EPS of $8.70 to $8.90, which implies a growth rate of 10% to 13% over 2015 versus our prior guidance of $8.60 to $8.95. Our adjusted EPS guidance now includes $0.05 per diluted share of special items consisting of on $0.11 benefit from the adoption of the new FASB pronouncement, $0.04 of dilution from the acquisition of Sequenom and a $0.02 impairment from an investment in our venture funds. 
Finally, we expect free cash flow for the year of $840 million to $880 million versus our prior guidance of $900 million to $950 million. This change in our guidance reflects the cash cost associated with the acquisition of Sequenom and advance payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central lab business and an increase in DSOs in Covance Drug Development, which reflects a broader industry trend. 
This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll be now happy to take questions. Operator?"

So as we've said, we intend to launch our own consumer-enabled testing service this year. And part of the preparation for that is to discontinue relationships with the existing third parties that are essentially using our brand and our capabilities to provide consumer-initiated testing. So that was the first part. The second part in terms of the low margin accounts was, every year, we look at profitability by account, we look at return by account, we look at the trends by account. And we had several accounts where we felt that the demands that were being placed on us in terms of workloads and service were significantly above what we felt was the level of return we were getting. And so we made the decision to exit those. It's not particular timing in any quarter, it's just part of an organized annual review that we do. And so as Glenn said, the combination there accounted for about 70 basis points of volume that we decided we were not going to continue with."

So that gave us -- again, from a sequential trend, it gave us a boost to the second quarter that probably was equal to 40 or 50 basis points. So normalizing for that, we would see going from 1% in 2Q to a net of about 50 basis points in 3Q, which certainly is a downward trend, but it also reflects some seasonality, summer vacation. Now all that said, we still aspire to do better in terms of volume growth. But to your specific question, yes, high deductible plans have an impact, physician business has an impact. We saw in the IMS data, the trend is physician and office visits year-over-year were down 5% in the second quarter, but they were down 10% in the third quarter. And obviously, that has an impact on demand. So it's a combination of factors. People do get through their deductibles as you go into the fourth quarter, which is encouraging. But I think there's also a lot of uncertainty. And as you -- as everybody's reading about, the Affordable Care Act plans, there's a lot of pressure on premium cost, there's a lot of pressure on coverage, there's a lot of pressure on providers withdrawing from their plans, withdrawing from the markets. So I wouldn't necessarily say that we have clarity in terms of what's going to happen with fourth quarter volumes, aside from what the historical experience has been."

And I appreciate that, of course, all of this is sort of difficult to handicap quarter-to-quarter. But just want to get a sense of the magnitude of pressure that we might be seeing at least in 3Q."

And again, as we said, we made this strategic investment on the Sequenom side. And obviously, a little bit dilutive in the first year, plus the fees associated with it, the strategic investment in the global specimen solutions business as well. But with regard to the DSOs, we had seen a pickup, if you will, in the DSOs, with customers and looking to push out terms, looking to push out milestones per collection. We had expected that we would see that improve as the year unfolded, which we've not yet. And that's why we've adjusted our guidance to reflect that. What we can tell you is that there are significant programs under way within the business to continue to drive an improvement in our DSOs, and we would expect that to improve over time. But this year, given the pressures and given what we've seen, we're not going to see that improvement that we had expected."

We received some regulatory guidance on the data reporting, which quite frankly, has some inconsistencies with the rule and some gaps. And ACLA and others have advised CMS of some of the things that we view as being inconsistent with the rule. There was the OIG report indicating, as we in the industry all knew, that there were some codes that were being paid below the amounts that Medicare had set, and so there would be some increases there. If anything, I would say the clarity is fuzzier than it was before in terms of how the data is going to be collected, who's going to -- who it's going to be submitted from, how it's going to be analyzed and what the puts and takes will be. So we're going to continue to work collaboratively with CMS. In fairness, they've been quite open to hearing about our concerns. And we'll update you when we have good, solid information about what we think the impact the panel will be on us."
