We're pleased to have reported results that met our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2015. We saw good growth in both currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit. And the individual",570,"Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining. We're pleased to have reported results that met our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2015. We saw good growth in both currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit. And the individual performances of many of our businesses were strong, with currency-neutral comparable sales growth in U.S. Cereal, U.S. Specialty Channel, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We continue to build momentum, and trends continue to improve it. 
And importantly, as you've seen in the public data, our consumption increased in the U.S. Cereal business in the fourth quarter and we gained share. Obviously, this continued momentum had a positive impact on overall results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.
The broad-based quarterly performance led to underlying full year currency-neutral comparable net sales and operating profit results the were in line with our expectations.
2015's performance represented an improvement from 2014's results, and we're continuing to build momentum in 2016. Comparable currency-neutral earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range; and full year cash flow of $1.1 billion was also in line with our recently increased estimates. And we have excellent earnings visibility as we continue to make great progress executing project K and implementing zero-based budgeting. So we met or exceeded our targets for 2015, and the performance we achieved set of great base for growth and momentum we built provides us we confidence as we enter the year.
So now let's turn to Slide 4 and more detail on our expectations for 2016. The momentum we built in 2015 was a result of a better innovation, better support, better execution and some of the visibility provided by our cost savings programs. And we expect this level of execution and momentum to continue in 2016. Specifically, we're very pleased with momentum that we built in the U.S. Cereal business. We ended the year with fourth quarter consumption growth of more than 2% for the Kellogg brand and a share gain of 70 basis points, and results in December were even better. I'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.
The project K and zero-based budgeting programs will each generate $100 million of savings in 2016. That's $200 million in total flexibility that we'll use to continue to drive top line growth and increase margins. Importantly, as you heard at the Investor Day a couple of months ago, we're excited about the plans we have to drive growth in North America in each of the international regions, and we'll remain focus on executing those plans throughout 2016. We're investing in the top line by improving our food, introducing great new innovation across categories and businesses, by increasing the geographic expansion of Pringles, by improving sales capabilities and by focusing on other activities designed to help us Win Where The Shopper Shops.  So we're pleased that this has put us back on our long-term growth algorithm in 2016. Specifically, we still expect low single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit operating profit growth and earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%, all on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Ron will discuss this in a minute.
We're excited about our plans across all the areas of our business and are very encouraged by the impact our actions are making.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results."

Slide 5 shows financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 4.2%. This was ahead of our expectations and included the impact of pricing actions",1592,"Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 4.2%. This was ahead of our expectations and included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. We also saw improving trends and sales growth in our business, excluding the impact of Venezuela. 
We always had anticipated approximately 1 point of sales growth benefit from Venezuela in our guidance for the full year. The accelerated pricing drove an additional point and resulted in full year sales growth of 1.2%.
Currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter. This included a headwind from the rebasing of incentive compensation of 4%. So growth in operating profit in the fourth quarter would have been approximately 7%, excluding the rebasing of incentive comp.
Full year currency-neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 2.3%, at the high end of our guidance range of between down 2% to 4%. Full year operating profit would have also increased by approximately 1%, excluding the impact of rebasing incentive comp.
Reported operating profit for the full year was $1.1 billion and for the quarter was a loss of $39 million, including a noncash mark-to-market charge for pensions of $393 million. This was primarily driven by the impact at asset returns at on our pension plans, but it is worth noting that even at historically low discount rates, our pension plans are almost 90% funded [ph]. You will see more detail regarding items affecting comparability in appendices to the presentation.
Comparable earnings were $0.79 per share in the quarter, and these results include $0.06 of currency headwind. Currency-neutral comparable earnings were $0.85 per share for the quarter, an increase of 1.2%. Full year comparable earnings were $3.53 per share, including $0.28 of impact from currencies. So as a result, full year currency-neutral comparable earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range and flat to last year.
Slide 6 shows the components of the full year and quarterly sales growth. Overall, currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 1.2% for the full year. We delivered double-digit growth in Asia and strong growth in Latin America. Pringles also delivered another strong year of growth across the globe, and our U.S. Cereal business continues to see improving trends and posted good growth in the fourth quarter.
Price mix increased by 1.9% as a result of growth in Latin America, which was driven primarily by the impact of Venezuela. We also saw price mix improvement in several North American businesses and in European snacks. 
While volume declined for the year, driven by developed cereal in U.S. Snacks, we saw good growth in the global Pringles business and in the emerging markets Cereal business. And as you can see on the chart, the impact of 2014's 53rd week reduced reported sales growth by 1.3%, and the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by 7.5%. More than half of which is due to the midyear remeasurement in Venezuela.
As a reminder, our joint ventures in China and Africa aren't included in these numbers, however, we saw very good rates of growth from them in the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 shows details regarding our fourth quarter and full year currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Comparable gross margin for the full year was down slightly and in line with our expectations. It is important to note that gross margin for the quarter and the full year has been impacted by accelerating levels and inflation in Venezuela. Of course, we were able to price and manage the profit of the business to our plan, but gross margin deteriorated. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, gross margin increased by 20 basis points for the full year and by 30 basis points for the fourth quarter.
Slide 8 shows the fourth quarter operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased by 3%. This was due to gross margin expansion resulting from lower input costs and savings from the Project K initiative in the region. This was partially offset by the impact of rebasing incentive compensation, which lowered North America's operating profit growth by more than 5% in the quarter. 
We're pleased with the full year operating profit growth of 4% in Europe. Results for the fourth quarter were due to the timing of investment in brand building and some discrete costs. Without these discrete costs, operating profit would have increased by approximately 5%. 
Operating profit in Latin America increased by 46% due to the impact of Venezuela on the region's results. In addition, we saw good results in Mexico, good overhead management and a favorable impact from the timing of investment. 
Operating profit decreased by 13% in the Asia Pacific region. We do continue to invest in sales growth in cereals and snacks in this region. This includes investment in our brands and our people. In addition, we saw higher costs of goods in the quarter due to the timing of spend across the year.
Slide 9 shows our full year cash flow. Full year operating cash flow after capital expenditure was approximately $1.1 billion, $100 million higher than our estimate as we began 2015 [ph]. We're very pleased with this result as it includes the cash required for Project K of approximately $330 million. We all offset issues of cash with excellent-ish execution of our payables initiative. And importantly, in 2015 we returned more than $1.4 billion to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases.
Slide 10 shows our industry-leading core working capital as a percentage of net sales and the improvement we've made over the last year. You can see that we ended the year with rolling 12-month core working capital as a percentage of sales of 6.2%. The significant year-over-year improvement is the result of excellent work that we've done on our payables initiative, and we'll continue our efforts to free up cash from our balance sheet as we proceed through 2016.
Slide 11 shows our currency-neutral comparable guidance for the full year 2016, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will increase at a rate between 1% and 3%. And while our guidance -- original guidance always included approximately 1% of sales growth from the impact of inflation in Venezuela, our latest outlook includes more pricing to offset inflation in the country. Obviously, this is hard to predict but it is possible that full year comparable net sales growth could exceed our guidance range due to these changes in Venezuela. It's worth noting that even excluding the total impact of Venezuela, we still expect to be in our original guidance range of between 1% to 3%.
We anticipate deflation in cost of goods sold driven by material costs. In combination with savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting, we expect improved gross margin. Of course, this excludes the impact of Venezuela, given the inflation-driven volatility. 
Our material input costs are approximately 70% covered at this time. Operating profit is still expected to grow at between 4% and 6%. And we also still expect that currency-neutral comparable earnings per share will increase between 6% and 8%. Our outlook includes a higher tax rate due to comparisons in 2015 and slightly higher interest expense. Specifically, we expect interest expense to be in a range between $235 million and $245 million, reflecting an anticipated increase in rates and slightly higher levels of debt. The comparable tax rate is expected to be between 27% and 28%. 
Our board has approved a share repurchase program of $1.5 billion, which will run through 2017, and we still expect to repurchase approximately $700 million to $750 million of shares in 2016.
As always, our expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of items affecting comparability. We expect that full year operating cash flow will be approximately $1.1 billion. This includes our expectation of full year capital spending will be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales to support growth in our Pringles business and Project K.
Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk [ph]. We currently expect that currency translation could have an impact of as much as $0.10 per share in 2016. This includes approximately $0.04 for the translation of Venezuela results impacting the first half of 2016. We expect that integration costs from the transactions we did in Egypt and Nigeria in 2015 will be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share for the full year. And we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be approximately $100 million for the full year, approximately 75% to 80% of which will come from cost of goods. We estimate that pretax P&L costs for Project K and our zero-based budgeting implementation will be between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share. Approximately half of this will be in cost of goods. And it's important to note that both Project K and our zero-based budgeting initiative remain on track.
Finally, our currency headwind is much more significant in the first quarter and the first half of the year. And the increases in tax and interest expense also impact Q1 and the first half of the year. So a simple way to think about our comparable earnings per share delivery, including currency, is that it will be delivered relatively evenly across the year.
And now I'll turn it back over to John for more detail regarding the operating segments."

And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. We saw good results in the business in the fourth quarter with sales growth of 1.5%. This was driven by very good results in our U S Cereal business. As you can see on the ch",2465,"Thanks, Ron. And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. We saw good results in the business in the fourth quarter with sales growth of 1.5%. This was driven by very good results in our U S Cereal business. As you can see on the chart, we gained share in 2015 and in the fourth quarter and had a great ending to the year in December. As you saw last quarter, our base sales performance was even better, with growth all year and growth of 4% in the fourth quarter. Importantly, our core 6 brands led this growth: Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes, Mini-Wheats and Special K, also a consumption growth in the quarter, with Special K posting high single-digit growth. This was driven primarily by changes to messaging and the renovation work we last year on Red Berries and the growth we saw all year on Raisin Bran, with the introduction of Raisin Bran with cranberries, which showed good results for the entire franchise. 
So we saw a lot of improvement across the year in the morning foods business. We invested where we needed to and worked hard to improve the fundamentals. We improved our brand building and the new products we launched. We invested in our foods. We put fund back in the box with Avengers and Disney Frozen themed cereals, and we've quarterly taken these learnings to other regions of the world as I'll discuss in a minute.
I'd like to thank Palmore who begain this transformation and Craig Banner who has continued it and the entire morning foods team. Their hard work is having a significant impact. 
And we're optimistic about this business as we entered 2016. We said last year that we would improve the performance of Special K, and we have as you can see on the graph on the side. And we're going to continue to drive sales in 2016 with introduction of new products like Special K Nourish, which you can also see pictured on the slide.
Special K Nourish is a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients that consumers can see and the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trend grains like quinoa. It's early, but the initial response has been encouraging. And we will continue to focus on all our core 6 brands, as Craig discussed at the Investor Day in November.
We have a range of new products launching in 2016. Some are on trend foods such as Special K Nourish and harvest delights Mini-Wheats and some are fun additions including Smores, Disney themed cereal and orange crushed Pop-Tarts.
So we saw improvement throughout 2015. The Cereal business continue to improve as the year progressed, and we saw the results of the investments and changes we made. We're excited about the plans we have to 2016 and expect the continued improvement.
Let's turn to Slide 15 in our U.S. Snacks business. We again saw good sequential improvement in consumption in the cookie, cracker wholesome snacks and Pringles businesses in the quarter. We gained distribution in the overall cracker category as a result of innovation. And [indiscernible] continue to post good consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as it has all year. This was driven by contributions from new products including Cheez-It Extra Toasty and. And as Deeny Elson said at JFK, we will increase our focus and our investment in core brands in 2016, including Cheez-It.
We restaged Special K Cracker chips during the year, and we saw improved consumption performance as the year progressed due to renovations we made to the packaging and the food. We did see continued decline in consumption of popcorn chips in the fourth quarter, which had an impact on results. However, we expect the impact of remaining SKUs to lessen as we progress through 2016.
We also gained distribution in the cookie business in the fourth quarter. The sequential improvement in consumption I mentioned continued the trend we saw last quarter and was driven by Chips Deluxe, Hot Shop and Famous Amos. These brands benefited from expanded distribution, new products and increased in-store activity.
We have great brands in the category and we have some exciting new introductions planned for 2016, and we're also going to give the brand's new support, including the relaunch of advertising, featuring [indiscernible].
We continue to see very good rates of consumption growth in Rice Krispies Treats in the wholesome snacks category in the fourth quarter. In addition, the performance of our Special K bars has improved due to new products and renovation, especially our new special K chewy nut bars. The overall Pringles business posted good underlying growth in the grocery and convenience channels. We continue to expand our global capacity, and we have good plans across our customers in 2016. As a result, we expect this business to post strong raise of growth for the year.
We are making progress in the snacks business. We're increasing investment and focusing it on our largest brands. We're making sure that we have the right offerings in the right channels, and we're expanding our offerings in the On the Go segment. And as in all the North American region, we're using the flexibility we have to fund these changes and drive improving profitability. [indiscernible] whole team are making a real difference, and we expect modest sales growth from the business in 2016 with sequential improvement across the year.
So let's turn to Slide 16 and highlights from the U.S. specialty segment. Comparable net sales in the specialty channels business increased in the quarter. We saw growth in the vending and convenience channels, with net sales in the convenience channel increasing at a high single-digit rate. We saw strong growth from Rice Krispies Treats in the vending channels and from Cheez-It and Pringles in the convenience channel. And we gained or maintain share in the cereal, cracker, wholesome snack and [indiscernible] snack categories within the channel for the full year. We also gained share in the Foodservice channel in the cereal, cracker and cookie categories in the fourth quarter. The specialty business also built a solid base in 2015, and our expectations are the team will drive good results in 2016.
Slide 17 shows the North America other segment, which includes the U.S. frozen foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. The frozen foods business saw continued growth from Eggo handheld sandwiches in the quarter. Consumption increased at a double-digit rate as it did all year. Overall sales declined at a low single-digit rate for the quarter, driven by the impact of egg prices, network improvements, the timing of activity and the drawing down of inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags. This veggie food packaging conversion is going well, but we expect sales to continue to be impacted in first quarter of 2016 and for performance to improve over the balance of the year.
We saw continued sequential improvement in the Kashi business in the fourth quarter, and the performance improved within the quarter. The Cereal business improved due to the stabilization of distribution and the impact of introduction of new products in the second half of 2015, and the Bear Naked granola brand posted double-digit consumption growth in the quarter. The overall Kashi business sales were down at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, however, we expect continued improvement in 2016 due to further improvement in distribution and the impact of our new focus, our new products, high-end plant protein.
The Canadian business posted sales growth in the Cereal and Wholesome Snack businesses in the quarter. For 2016, the Canadian team is planning introductions of new products and programs, much like the rest of the North American region, but we'll continue see an adverse impact from transactional foreign exchange.
Let's turn to Slide 18 in our European business. Sales growth across the region was 1.6% in the quarter, with strong growth in the emerging markets. The Pringles business also posted double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. We grew share in both the U.K. and Germany in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. Germany's performance, which was due to the introduction of Tortilla Pringles and the strong results we saw in the U.K. due to some great activity, including a successful Halloween-themed promotion.
As you might imagine, we had some exciting activity planned for Pringles in 2016 as well, including soccer-themed activity, planned to coincide with the euro soccer tournament in the summer and the continued rollout of Tortilla Pringles in the region. The wholesome snack business also posted sales growth in the fourth quarter. This was due to better results in the U.K., due in part by Disney-branded snacks, mini biscuits, Crunchy Nut and Rice Krispies squares. In addition, the Russian business did well, and we have new foods coming out across the region in 2016.
The Cereal business in Europe declined in the fourth quarter due to challenges in the category and many other countries. However, we improved our plans for Special K and Crunchy Nut in the U.K. So good performance from Extra in Italy and the invention behind Kellogg's brand granola and Germany, and we recently launched Ancient Legends brands in the region. These are great products, which include on-trend ingredients like smelt, apples, [indiscernible] and cheesies.
And we're also applying the learnings in from other parts of the world, including the renovation of Special K red berries, the launch of Special K Nourish, and we're also adding more fun on the box.
So the fourth quarter was a successful one for the European business, and we expect improvement to continue in 2016 as we launch great new products, invest for growth and continue to focus on execution.
Slide 19 shows highlights of our Latin America business in the fourth quarter. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales again increased to double-digit rate, primarily due to the impact of Venezuela. We saw sales growth in Mexico of approximately 4%, driven by great performance in the Cereal business. We gained share in the Cereal category in the latest public data, and we saw improved performance from our adult-oriented cereals. We also gained share in Brazil in the quarter and for the year. These gains were partially the result of parent brand innovation and support. We launched ancient brands in Brazil in Q4 and in the first quarter 2016 in the region and we also have special K protein and granola with quinoa planned for introduction.
Sales in the region's snack business also increased in the quarter. This growth resulted from better execution, good innovation and strength in the Pringles business. In fact, the Pringles business grew at a double-digit rate. Commercial innovation, strong execution and promotional programs drove growth, and we expect continued good performance from the brand in 2016.
And our focus on high-frequency stores continues to drive results. We've seen results in inconvenience and mini superstores in Mexico and smaller mom-and-pop stores in Colombia. And we've also had success driving sales growth through packaging initiatives designed to drive affordability and accessibility in various areas of the business.
So we all had a good in the Latin America business in 2015 despite challenging conditions driven by slowing economies and weakening currencies. The team has done a great job managing through these situations, and we expect continued good performance in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 20 and our Asia Pacific business. Overall, currency-neutral comparable sales growth was 3.3% in the fourth quarter, although this does not include the impact of the JVs in China and West Africa. If we include the impact of those businesses, we would have seen double-digit sales growth. 
The Asian business posted double-digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth in the quarter. We saw double-digit sales growth in Japan, driven by a continued growth of the granola category and the impact of new packaging. We also saw double-digit growth in Korea and Southeast Asia.
The Pringles business in Asia Pacific grew volume at a double-digit rate. We saw broad-based channels growth and share gains due to innovation and gains in distribution. And the sub-Saharan African business also posted double-digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth. We saw better execution and the benefit from the introduction of new products. And as I mentioned, the JV in West Africa also posted very strong growth.
The environment in Australia remained challenging, with category sales continuing to decline. However, the granola and muesli segments are growing well, and we a plan to address the weakness in the overall Australian business in 2016. We're also planning [indiscernible] from other parts of the business to Australia as we are in Europe.
We're pleased with the performance of the Asia Pacific region last year. For the full year, the region posted mid-single-digit currency-neutral comparable sales growth. And including impact of the JVs, we would achieve even higher growth. The Asian business continues to perform very well. And while we expect the environment at this stage remain challenging, we do expect another good year from this business. We have our plans in place, and our execution remains strong.
Let's turn to Page 21 and the summary. Our results from the fourth quarter were in line with or ahead of our expectations. We saw good performance in net sales, operating profit, EPS and cash flow. We built a strong base and generated momentum in 2015. We told you we needed to improve the performance of the U.S. Cereal business, and we have. We saw increased consumption and share gains in the quarter, Special K is performing well and the Kashi business is responding to the introduction of new products. And all of our international businesses posted sales growth in the fourth quarter, and we're on track to meet our expectations for 2016. We expect our momentum to continue. We've made changes where we needed to. We've improved our support. We're launching exciting new products. We've improved our feeds renovation, and we're executing well. And we also had significant flexibility in 2016 from Project K and the 0-based budgeting initiative. These 2 projects will give us an incremental $200 million of savings in 2016 that we will invest in revenue growth and use to improve margin.
So as you step back and look at where we are, we built momentum in 2015, we generated significant savings, we launched a new strategy and we have a strong management team. And as we entered 2016, we are absolutely committed to our algorithm to deliver results for sales, operating profit and EPS and to building long-term earnings visibility.
So finally, I'd like to thank all the Kellogg employees around the world who are making a huge difference and know this is impossible without them.
And now I'll open it up for questions."

Because of those changes, because of the momentum we're seeing in the U.S. Cereal business, we actually are quite optimistic about 2016. I think if you ask me back on the third quarter conference call expectations for U.S. Cereal, we will define flat sales in 2016 a success. Given the strength of U.S. Cereal across 2015, we actually expect our U.S. Cereal business to grow slightly, a couple percent in 2016. The morning foods business obviously includes more things than just U.S. Cereal as Pop-Tarts business in there, which is also doing well and helped the [indiscernible] business. But in aggregate, I'd say that total business, we expect to be up slightly in 2016."

We -- this is a multiyear program, and we obviously believe that there are more opportunities for savings and we're implementing a process make sure that we can sustain those savings. We are reinvesting some of the savings back into our business. For example, we're refining money and brand building. We're taking some opportunity to reinvest back into brand building for revenue growth. And as we've talked all along, we're investing money back into our food as well. Our international regions are underway. So we have started a work in all of our international regions at this point in time, kicked off the process, dissecting our spend, identifying the opportunities as well. Some specific areas of learnings in terms of where we're seeing savings. So we looked to cost of goods sold. For example, we've identified opportunities in our transportation and warehousing costs. We've done a deep dive in professional and contracted services and balanced some money there. And our people-related costs, things like travel, relocation, things of that nature, we've implemented policy changes to impact and benefit our cost structure. As I mentioned, we are finding some money in brand building as well our and media, nonworking media as well as TV media. Again, we're investing some of that back into the business to drive revenue growth because overall project is progressing well, remains on track."

The good news is where we have renovated those foods, I mean, what we've done in Cereal, we've seen the business to stabilize, and so Special K Cracker is stabilizing. And Special K chain up bars doing well in the Wholesome Snacks business because if you look at that, that headwind is still there, but to a much less degree. And as we go forward, we expect some of the tailwind of the business to become more evident. So we had strong growth in Cheez-It over the last several years. We've seen good growth in Pringles. We're seeing good growth in Rice Krispies treats and wholesome snacks. Our cookie business is stable in the last couple of quarters. So we've actually seen better trends within the business. So as we go forward into 2016, we expect to return this business to top line growth over the months, and we absolutely expect to return the business to bottom line growth.

First, as we said in the prepared remarks, Venezuela was also included in our sales guidance back in August as we gave the original guidance. We always expected about a point of contribution from Venezuela to our sales performance. It's hard to predict and it's gotten even harder as inflation increased dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2015. And based on our projections, that could continue as we move through 2016 as well. And that's why we said we could see sales growth exceed the 1% to 3% range as a result of pricing actions we take in Venezuela to offset inflation and make sure that our business stays profitable. So we said excluding Venezuela, we still expect to be in that 1% to 3% range on sales. And also on operating profit and earnings per share, Venezuela, we expect to be in the ranges that we communicated. Okay? Now remember, we're pricing to offset inflation. So it's possible that could throw up more profit, but it remains to be seen. There are margin controls within Venezuela. Some may have the question as well. ""So why haven't we do consolidated Venezuela?"" So let me just put that out there. In terms of Venezuela we operate within the preferred industry fit within the country, and most of our inputs are locally sourced. Remember, generally accepted accounting principles, one of the key criteria for the consolidating is exchangeability of currency. We've been able to exchange Bolivar for U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 and also here in January of 2016. We have control over our business. As I said, we're profitable in local currency as well. We remeasured some commodity rate in 2015, so it has become a smaller portion of our business as a result of that.

We saw good growth in both currency neutral comparable net sales and operating profit. And the individual performances of many of our businesses were strong, with currency neutral comparable sales growth in U.S. Cereal, U.S. Specialty Channels, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We continue to build momentum, and trends continue to improve it. 
And importantly, as you've seen in the public data, our consumption increased in the U.S. Cereal business in the fourth quarter and we gained share. Obviously, this continued momentum had a positive impact on overall results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.
The broad-based quarterly performance led to underlying full year currency neutral comparable net sales and operating profit results that were in line with our expectations.
2015's performance represented an improvement from 2014's results, and we're continuing to build momentum in 2016. Comparable currency neutral earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range; and full year cash flow of $1.1 billion was also in line with our recently increased estimates. And we have excellent earnings visibility as we continue to make great progress executing Project K and implementing zero-based budgeting. So we met or exceeded our targets for 2015, and the performance we achieved set a great base for growth and the momentum we've built provides us with confidence as we enter the year.
So now let's turn to Slide 4 and more detail on our expectations for 2016. The momentum we built in 2015 was a result of a better innovation, better support, better execution and some of the visibility provided by our cost savings programs. And we expect this level of execution and momentum to continue in 2016. Specifically, we're very pleased with the momentum that we built in the U.S. Cereal business. We ended the year with fourth quarter consumption growth of more than 2% for the Kellogg brand and a share gain of 70 basis points, and results in December were even better. I'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.
The project K and zero-based budgeting programs will each generate $100 million of savings in 2016. That's $200 million in total flexibility that we'll use to continue to drive top line growth and increase margins. Importantly, as you heard at the Investor Day, a couple of months ago, we're excited about the plans we have to drive growth in North America and in each of the international regions, and we will remain focus on executing those plans throughout 2016. We're investing in the top line by improving our food, introducing great new innovation across categories and businesses, by increasing the geographic expansion of Pringles, by improving sales capabilities and by focusing on other activities designed to help us Win Where The Shopper Shops.  So we're pleased that all this has put us back on our long-term growth algorithm in 2016. Specifically, we still expect low single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit operating profit growth and earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%, all on a currency neutral comparable basis. Ron will discuss this in a minute.
We're excited about our plans across all the areas of our business and are very encouraged by the impact our actions are making.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results."

Slide 5 shows financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 4.2%.

Fourth quarter currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 4.2%. This was ahead of our expectations and included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. We also saw improving trends and sales growth in our business, excluding the impact of Venezuela. 
We always had anticipated approximately 1 point of sales growth benefit from Venezuela in our guidance for the full year. The accelerated pricing drove an additional point and resulted in full year sales growth of 1.2%.
Currency neutral comparable operating profit increased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter. This included a headwind from the rebasing of incentive compensation of 4%. So growth in operating profit in the fourth quarter would have been approximately 7%, excluding the rebasing of incentive comp.
Full year currency neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 2.3%, at the high end of our guidance range of between down 2% to 4%. Full year operating profit would have also increased by approximately 1%, excluding the impact of rebasing incentive comp.
Reported operating profit for the full year was $1.1 billion and for the quarter was a loss of $39 million, including a noncash mark-to-market charge for pensions of $393 million. This was primarily driven by the impact that asset returns had on our pension plans, but it is worth noting that even at historically low discount rates, our pension plans are almost 90% funded. You will see more detail regarding items affecting comparability in appendices to the presentation.
Comparable earnings were $0.79 per share in the quarter, and these results include $0.06 of currency headwind. Currency neutral comparable earnings were $0.85 per share for the quarter, an increase of 1.2%. Full year comparable earnings were $3.53 per share, including $0.28 of the impact from currencies. So as a result, full year currency neutral comparable earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range and flat to last year.
Slide 6 shows the components of the full year and quarterly sales growth. Overall, currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 1.2% for the full year. We delivered double-digit growth in Asia and strong growth in Latin America. Pringles also delivered another strong year of growth across the globe, and our U.S. Cereal business continues to see improving trends and posted good growth in the fourth quarter.
Price mix increased by 1.9% as a result of growth in Latin America, which was driven primarily by the impact of Venezuela. We also saw price mix improvement in several North America businesses and in European snacks. 
While volume declined for the year, driven by developed Cereal and U.S. Snacks, we saw good growth in the global Pringles business and in the emerging markets Cereal business. And as you can see on the chart, the impact of 2014's 53rd week reduced reported sales growth by 1.3%, and the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by 7.5%. More than half of which is due to the midyear remeasurement in Venezuela.
As a reminder, our joint ventures in China and Africa aren't included in these numbers, however, we saw very good rates of growth from them in the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 shows details regarding our fourth quarter and full year currency neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Comparable gross margin for the full year was down slightly and in line with our expectations. It is important to note that gross margin for the quarter and the full year has been impacted by accelerating levels of inflation in Venezuela. Of course, we were able to price and manage the profit of the business to our plan, but gross margin deteriorated. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, gross margin increased by 20 basis points for the full year and by 30 basis points for the fourth quarter.
Slide 8 shows the fourth quarter operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's currency neutral comparable operating profit increased by 3%. This was due to gross margin expansion resulting from lower input costs and savings from the Project K initiative in the region. This was partially offset by the impact of rebasing incentive compensation, which lowered North America's operating profit growth by more than 5% in the quarter. 
We're pleased with the full year operating profit growth of 4% in Europe. Results for the fourth quarter were due to the timing of investment in brand building and some discrete costs. Without these discrete costs, operating profit would have increased by approximately 5%. 
Operating profit in Latin America increased by 46% due to the impact of Venezuela on the region's results. In addition, we saw good results in Mexico, good overhead management and a favorable impact from the timing of investment. 
Operating profit decreased by 13% in the Asia Pacific region. We do continue to invest in sales growth in cereals and snacks in this region. This include investment in our brands and our people. In addition, we saw higher costs of goods in the quarter due to the timing of spend across the year.
Slide 9 shows our full year cash flow. Full year operating cash flow after capital expenditure was approximately $1.1 billion, $100 million higher than our estimate as we began 2015. We're very pleased with this result as it includes the cash required for Project K of approximately $330 million. We offset the issues of cash with excellent execution of our payables initiative. And importantly, in 2015 we returned more than $1.4 billion to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases.
Slide 10 shows our industry-leading core working capital as a percentage of net sales and the improvement we've made over the last year. You can see that we ended the year with rolling 12-month core working capital as a percentage of sales of 6.2%. The significant year-over-year improvement is the result of excellent work that we've done on our payables initiative, and we'll continue our efforts to free up cash from our balance sheet as we proceed through 2016.
Slide 11 shows our currency neutral comparable guidance for the full year 2016, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will increase at a rate between 1% and 3%. And while our guidance -- original guidance always included approximately 1% of sales growth from the impact of inflation in Venezuela, our latest outlook includes more pricing to offset inflation in the country. Obviously, this is hard to predict but it is possible that full year comparable net sales growth could exceed our guidance range due to these changes in Venezuela. It's worth noting that even excluding the total impact of Venezuela, we still expect to be in our original guidance range of between 1% to 3%.
We anticipate deflation in cost of goods sold driven by material costs. And in combination with savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting, we expect improved gross margin. Of course, this excludes the impact of Venezuela, given the inflation-driven volatility. 
Our material input costs are approximately 70% covered at this time. Operating profit is still expected to grow at between 4% and 6%. And we also still expect that currency neutral comparable earnings per share will increase between 6% and 8%. Our outlook includes a higher tax rate due to comparisons in 2015 and slightly higher interest expense. Specifically, we expected interest expense to be in a range between $235 million and $245 million, reflecting an anticipated increase in rates and slightly higher levels of debt. The comparable tax rate is expected to be between 27% and 28%. 
Our board has approved a share repurchase program of $1.5 billion, which will run through 2017, and we still expect to repurchase approximately $700 million to $750 million of shares in 2016.
As always, our expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of items affecting comparability. We expect that full year operating cash flow will be approximately $1.1 billion. This includes our expectation that full year capital spending will be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales to support growth in our Pringles business and Project K.
Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk. We currently expect that currency translation could have an impact of as much as $0.10 per share in 2016. This includes approximately $0.04 for the translation of Venezuela results impacting the first half of 2016. We expect that integration costs from the transactions we did in Egypt and Nigeria in 2015 will be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share for the full year. And we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be approximately $100 million for the full year, approximately 75% to 80% of which will come from cost of goods. We estimate that pretax P&L costs for Project K and our zero-based budgeting implementation will be between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share. Approximately half of this will be in cost of goods. And it's important to note that both Project K and our zero-based budgeting initiative remain on track.
Finally, our currency headwind is much more significant in the first quarter and the first half of the year. And the increases in tax and interest expense also impact Q1 and the first half of the year. So a simple way to think about our comparable earnings per share delivery, including currency, is it -- it will be delivered relatively evenly across the year.
And now I'll turn it back over to John for more detail regarding the operating segments."

And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. We saw good results from the business in the fourth quarter with sales growth of 1.5%. This was driven by very good results in our U S Cereal business. As you can see on the",2493,"Thanks, Ron. And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. We saw good results from the business in the fourth quarter with sales growth of 1.5%. This was driven by very good results in our U S Cereal business. As you can see on the chart, we gained share in 2015 and in the fourth quarter and had a great ending to the year in December. As you saw last quarter, our base sales performance was even better, with growth all year and growth of 4% in the fourth quarter. Importantly, our core 6 brands led this growth: Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes, Mini-Wheats and Special K, all saw a consumption growth in the quarter, with Special K posting high single-digit growth. This was driven primarily by changes to messaging and the renovation work we did last year on Red Berries and the good growth we saw all year on Raisin Bran, which result in the introduction of Raisin Bran with cranberries, which showed good results for the entire franchise. 
So we saw a lot of improvement across the year in the Morning Foods business. We invested where we needed to and worked hard to improve the fundamentals. We improved our brand building and the new products we launched. We invested in our foods. We put fund back in the box with Avengers and Disney Frozen-themed Cereals, and we've quickly taken these learnings to other regions of the world as I'll discuss in a minute.
I'd like to thank Paul norman who began this transformation and Craig Bahner who has continued it, and the entire Morning Foods team. Their hard work is having a significant impact. 
And we're optimistic about this business as we entered 2016. We said last year that we would improve the performance of Special K, and we have as you can see on the graph on the side. And we're going to continue to drive sales in 2016 with introduction of new products like Special K Nourish, which you can also see pictured on the slide.
Special K Nourish is a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients that consumer can see and the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trend grains like quinoa. It's early, but the initial response has been encouraging. And we will continue to focus on all our core 6 brands, as Craig discussed at the Investor Day in November.
We have a range of new products launching in 2016. Some are on-trend foods such as Special K Nourish and Harvest Delights Mini-Wheats and some are fun additions including S'Mores, Disney Dory-themed cereal and orange crushed Pop-Tarts.
So we saw improvement throughout 2015. The Cereal business continue to improve as the year progressed, and we saw the results of the investments and changes we made. We're excited about the plans we have to 2016 and expected continued improvement.
Let's turn to Slide 15 in our U.S. Snacks business. We again saw sequential improvement in consumption in the cookie, cracker wholesome snacks and Pringles businesses in the quarter. We gained distribution in the overall cracker category as a result of innovation. And Cheez-It continue to post good consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as it has all year. This was driven by contributions from new products including Cheez-It Extra Toasty and Grooves. And as Deanie Elsner said at [ph] FK, we will increase our focus and our investment on core brands in 2016, including Cheez-It.
We restaged Special K Cracker Chips during the year, and we saw improved consumption performance as the year progressed due to renovations we made to the packaging and the food. We did see continued decline in consumption of popcorn chips in the fourth quarter, which had an impact on results. However, we expect the impact of remaining SKUs to lessen as we progress through 2016.
We also gained distribution in the cookie business in the fourth quarter. The sequential improvement in consumption I mentioned continue the trend we saw last quarter and was driven by Chips Deluxe, Fudge Shop and Famous Amos. These brands benefited from expanded distribution, new products and increased in-store activity.
We have great brands in the category and with some exciting new introductions planned for 2016, and we're also going to give the brand's new support, including the relaunch of advertising, featuring the Keebler Elves.
We continue to see very good rates of consumption growth in Rice Krispies Treats in the wholesome snacks category in the fourth quarter. In addition, the performance of our Special K bars has improved due to new products and renovation, especially our new Special K chewy nut bars. The overall Pringles business posted good underlying growth in the grocery and convenience channels. We continue to expand our global capacity, and we have good plans across all our customers in 2016. As a result, we expect this business to post strong rates of growth for the year.
We are making progress in the Snacks business. We're increasing investment and focusing it on our largest brands. We're making sure that we have the right offerings in the right channels, and we're expanding our offerings in the On the Go segment. And as in all of the North American region, we're using the flexibility we have to fund these changes and drive improving profitability. Deanie and the whole team are making a real difference, and we expect modest sales growth from the business in 2016 with sequential improvement across the year.
So let's turn to Slide 16 and highlights from the U.S. Specialty segment. Comparable net sales in the Specialty Channels business increased in the quarter. We saw growth in the vending and convenience channels, with net sales in the convenience channel increasing at a high single-digit rate. We saw strong growth from Rice Krispies Treats in the vending channels and from Cheez-It and Pringles in the convenience channel. And we gained or maintain share in the cereal, cracker, wholesome snack and salty snack categories within the channel for the full year. We also gained share in the Foodservice channel in the cereal, cracker and cookie categories in the fourth quarter. The Specialty business also built a solid base in 2015, and our expectations are the team will drive good results in 2016.
Slide 17 shows the North America Other segment, which includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. The Frozen Foods business saw continued growth from Eggo handheld sandwiches in the quarter. Consumption increased at a double-digit rate as it did all year. Overall sales declined at a low single-digit rate for the quarter, driven by the impact of egg prices, network improvements, the timing of activity and the drawing down of inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags. This veggie food packaging conversion is going well, but we expect sales to continue to be impacted in the first quarter of 2016 and for performance to improve over the balance of the year.
We saw continued sequential improvement in the Kashi business in the fourth quarter, and the performance improved within the quarter. The Cereal business improved due to the stabilization of distribution and the impact of introduction of new products in the second half of 2015, and the Bear Naked Granola brand posted double-digit consumption growth in the quarter. The overall Kashi business sales were down at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, however, we expect continued improvement in 2016 due to further improvement in distribution and the impact of our new focus, our new products, high in plant protein.
The Canadian business posted sales growth in the Cereal and Wholesome Snack businesses in the quarter. For 2016, the Canadian team is planning introductions of new products and programs, much like the rest of the North American region, but we'll continue to see an adverse impact from transactional foreign exchange.
Let's turn to Slide 18 in our European business. Sales growth across the region was 1.6% in the quarter, with strong growth in the emerging markets. The Pringles business also posted double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. We grew share in both the U.K. and Germany, in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. Germany's performance, which was through the introduction of Tortilla Pringles and the strong results we saw in the U.K. due to some great activity, including a successful Halloween-themed promotion.
As you might imagine, we had some exciting activity planned for Pringles in 2016 as well, including soccer-themed activity, planned to coincide with the Euro soccer tournament in the summer and the continued rollout of Tortilla Pringles in the region. The wholesome snack business also posted sales growth in the fourth quarter. This was due to better results in the U.K., due in part by Disney-branded snacks, mini biscuits, Crunchy Nut and Rice Krispies squares. In addition, the Russian business did well, and we have new foods coming out across the region in 2016.
The Cereal business in Europe declined in the fourth quarter due to challenges in the category in many of the countries. However, we improved our plans for Special K and Crunchy Nut in the U.K. So good performance from Extra in Italy and invention behind Kellogg's brand in Granola in Germany, and we recently launched the Ancient Legends brand in the region. These are great products, which include on-trend ingredients like smelt, apples, sultanas and cheese seeds.
And we're also applying the learnings from other parts of the world, including the renovation of Special K Red Berries, the launch of Special K Nourish, and we're also adding more fun on the box.
So the fourth quarter was a successful one for the European business, and we expect improvement to continue in 2016 as we launch great new products, invest for growth and continue to focus on execution.
Slide 19 shows highlights of our Latin American business in the fourth quarter. Total currency neutral comparable net sales again increased to double-digit rate, primarily due to the impact of Venezuela. We saw sales growth in Mexico of approximately 4%, driven by great performance in the Cereal business. We gained share in the Cereal category in the latest public data, and we saw improved performance from our adult-oriented cereals. We also gained share in Brazil in the quarter and for the year. These gains were partially the result of parent brand innovation and support. We launched Ancient Grains in Brazil in Q4 and in the first quarter of 2016 in the Andean region and we also have Special K protein and granola with quinoa planned for introduction.
Sales in the region's Snack business also increased in the quarter. This growth resulted from better execution, good innovation and strength in the Pringles business. In fact, the Pringles business grew at a double-digit rate. Commercial innovation, strong execution and promotional programs drove growth, and we expect a continued good performance from the brand in 2016.
And our focus on high-frequency stores continues to drive results. We've seen results in convenience and mini superstores in Mexico and smaller mom-and-pop stores in Colombia. And we've also had success driving sales growth through packaging initiatives designed to drive affordability and accessibility in various areas of the business.
Cereals had a good year in the Latin America business in 2015 despite challenging conditions driven by slowing economies and weakening currencies. The team has done a great job managing through these situations, and we expect a continued good performance in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 20 and our Asia Pacific business. Overall, currency neutral comparable sales growth was 3.3% in the fourth quarter, although this does not include the impact of the JVs in China and West Africa. If we include the impact of those businesses, we would have seen double-digit sales growth. 
The Asian business posted double-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth in the quarter. We saw double-digit sales growth in Japan, driven by the continued growth of the Granola category and the impact of new packaging. We also saw double-digit growth in Korea and Southeast Asia.
The Pringles business in Asia Pacific grew volume at a double-digit rate. We saw broad-based channels growth and share gains due to innovation and gains in distribution. And the sub-Saharan African business also posted double-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth. We saw better execution and the benefit from the introduction of new products. And as I mentioned, the JV in West Africa also posted very strong growth.
The environment in Australia remained challenging, with category sales continuing to decline. However, the Granola and Muesli segments are growing well, and we have a plan to address the weakness in the overall Australian business in 2016. We're also applying lessons learned from other parts of the business to Australia as we are in Europe.
We were pleased with the performance of the Asia Pacific region last year. For the full year, the region posted mid-single-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth. And including impact of the JVs, we would achieve even higher growth. The Asian business continues to perform very well. And while we expect the environment in Australia to remain challenging, we do expect another good year from this business. We got our plans in place, and our execution remains strong.
Let's turn to Page 21 and the summary. Our results from the fourth quarter were in line with or ahead of our expectations. We saw good performance in net sales, operating profit, EPS and cash flow. We built a strong base and generated momentum in 2015. We told you we needed to improve the performance of the U.S. Cereal business, and we have. We saw increased consumption and share gains in the quarter, Special K is performing well and the Kashi Cereal business is responding to the introduction of new products. And all of our international businesses posted sales growth in the fourth quarter, and we're on track to meet our expectations for 2016. We expect our momentum to continue. We've made changes where we needed to. We've improved our support. We're launching exciting new products. We've improved our Foods renovation, and we're executing well. And we also had significant flexibility in 2016 from Project K and the zero-based budgeting initiative. These 2 projects will give us an incremental $200 million of savings in 2016 that we will invest in revenue growth and use to improve margins.
So as you step back and look at where we are, we built momentum in 2015, we generated significant savings, we launched a new strategy and we have a strong management team. And as we entered 2016, we are absolutely committed to our algorithm to deliver results for sales, operating profit and EPS and to building long-term earnings visibility.
So finally, I'd like to thank all the Kellogg employees around the world, their efforts are making a huge difference and none of this would be possible without them.
And now I'll open it up for questions."

I'll take the Cereal questions and the sales growth question. I'll hand ZBB over to Ron. There's no question that the additional investors remain in our sales organizations part of our Project K reinvestments absolutely helped the performance of our U.S. Cereal business. In addition, our U.S. Cereal business has been helped by some of the great food improvements we've made such as Special K Red Berries, some of the outstanding brand building programs we had such as the Raisin brand program out there. But in-store execution this year has been significantly better than in the past. And I think the U.S. sales reps, the U.S. sales team has done a tremendous job of improving the in-store execution in driving the performance of that business. Because of those changes, because of the momentum we're seeing in the U.S. Cereal business, we actually are quite optimistic about 2016. I think if you ask me back on the third quarter conference call our expectations for U.S. Cereal, we would've defined flat sales in 2016 a success. Given the strength of U.S. Cereal across 2015, we'd actually expect our U.S. Cereal business to grow slightly, 2% in 2016. The Morning Foods business obviously includes more things than just U.S. Cereal, there is a Pop-Tarts business in there, which is also doing well and helped [indiscernible] business. But in aggregate, I'd say that total business, we expect to be up slightly in 2016."

And remember, we're targeting over $2 billion worth of discretionary spend in North America for the start of the program. And the areas that we're targeting are in general administrative overhead, distribution costs, brand building and supply team overhead as well. As we said, we still expect to see $100 million in 2016, but what I would point out is that's not a ceiling in terms of our savings, okay. We -- this is a multiyear program, and we obviously believe that there are more opportunities for savings and then we're implementing a process to make sure that we can sustain those savings. We are reinvesting some of those savings back into our business. For example, we're refining money and brand building. We're taking some opportunity to reinvest back in the brand building for revenue growth. And as we've talked all along, we're investing money back into our Food as well. Our international regions are underway. So we have started the work in all of our international regions at this point in time, kicked off the process, dissecting our spend, identifying the opportunities as well. Some specific areas of learnings in terms of where we're seeing savings. So we've looked to cost of goods sold. For example, we've identified opportunities in our transportation and warehousing costs. We've done a deep dive in professional and contracted services and balanced some money there. And on people-related costs, things like travel, relocation, things of that nature, we've implemented policy changes to impact and benefit our cost structure. As I mentioned, we are finding some money in brand building as well our and media, nonworking media as well as TV media. But again, we're investing some of that back into the business to drive revenue growth. So overall project is progressing well, remains on track."

We've talked a lot in the context of our Cereal business, about Special K. The Special K has also had a fundamental impact to our Snacks business. We've had a headwind from Special K in Snacks over the last couple of years. You've seen this come through in our cracker business with Special K Cracker Chips has come through and our wholesome Snacks business with Special K bars. The good news is where we have renovated those foods similar to what we've done in Cereal, we're seeing the business to stabilize, and so Special K Cracker Chips is stabilizing. And Special K chewy nut bars actually are doing quite well in the wholesome Snacks business. So if you look at that, that headwind is still there to a degree, but to a much less degree. And as we go forward, we expect some of the tailwinds in the business to become more evident. So we've had strong growth in Cheez-It over the last several years. We're seeing good growth in Pringles. We're seeing good growth in Rice Krispies treats and wholesome snacks. Our cookie business is stable in the last couple of quarters. So we've actually seen better trends within the business. So as we go forward into 2016, we expect to return this business to top line growth over modest, and we absolutely expect to return the business to bottom line growth. So we recognize it has been an area of weakness for us. Deanie and the team have taken actions to address it, and we feel much good about our 2016 outlook. And you're actually seeing it in the consumption data even in 2015. And that the consumption in the fourth quarter for 2015 was stronger than the prior parts of the year, and we're seeing sequential improvement as we go through the year."

We also have our base productivity improvements, Project K. And we've said Project K, that $100 million, about 75% to 80% of that runs through cost of goods sold. On the zero-based budgeting savings that we quoted, a little less than half of that is coming through cost of goods sold. Remember, Jason, we've said all along that we were going to invest in our food. And we've done that in 2015, and we're doing it in 2016. Renovating our Foods and launching granolas and mueslis based on consumer trends that we're seeing. That investment in food remains at about a 50-basis-point headwind in relation to our gross margin performance. The other thing that we have impacting us in 2016 is some transactional currency exposure. So we've had good hedges in 2015. Some of those are rolling off, and what we're seeing is some headwind particularly around the Canadian dollar and the peso, but also some of the other international currencies as they weaken versus the U.S. dollar. And we're seeing about a 40-basis-point headwind in relation to transactional currency exposure. So all up slight net deflation and some gross margin expansion in 2016."

But if you look at that Snack business in totality, we have other large businesses in there beyond just the Cereal bar side, including Crackers where we have a strongly advantage footprint, particularly with Cheez-It, where we're seeing strong growth. We have Pringles. And the Pringles around the world we're seeing double-digit growth in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and low single-digit growth in North America. We believe we have an opportunity to drive much more growth around Pringles in North America as we go into 2016, and that will help our U.S. Snacks results. We have great areas of strengths within cookies as well. So as you think about our Snacks business, yes, there's some challenges in wholesome snacks. I think the answer to that is renovate, improve the food, continue to have strong brands, continue to execute in-store, but it's really a food discussion. I think we're making progress there and then we have other sources of growth within that Snacks business that's why we have confidence to get that business back to growth in 2016."

So let me give you a little bit of color on how our cash flow kind of holds together and the $1.1 billion that we guided out for capital spending. And first, I think it's important to note that in 2016, we are converting net income to cash flow after capital spending at a rate of 100%. And in 2015, we actually did better than that. So we have a slightly elevated capital spending in 2016. We're in the 4% to 5% range. That includes Pringles growth, some capital behind that growth and then as well some cash for Project K. Our cash for Project K is $200 million. And what we're doing is we're continuing to roll out that supplier financing initiative to offset the cash requirements for Project K. We did just that in 2015, and we were able to offset the cash requirements for Project K based on the improvements we saw in our core working capital. So we're expecting the same thing in 2016, and that's what's allowing us to convert our net income to cash at 100%."

But I just wanted to make sure. So in the fourth quarter, Venezuela, because of the pricing contributed about a little over 3.5% to currency neutral sales growth and it contributed about 2.5% to currency neutral operating income growth. So as we look at your guidance and I heard your comments about revenues. You're basically -- I guess, my interpretation of it is to the extent that it has that sort of impact on revenues, you're still looking at your 1% to 3% as if kind of normal [indiscernible] so if Venezuela contributes significantly more, there could potentially be upside to revenues. Would that saying hold true for operating income as well to the extent that it has the potential to deliver this type of impact on the growth to operating income? Would you be looking at operating income the same way in terms of the effect of what a normal growth would be? And how Venezuela affects it?"

And let me just kind of run through on how Venezuela is impacting things. First, as we've said in the prepared remarks, Venezuela was always included in our sales guidance back in August as we gave the original guidance. We always expected about a point of contribution from Venezuela to our sales performance. It's hard to predict and it's gotten even harder as inflation increased dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2015. And based on our projections, that could continue as we move through 2016 as well. And that's why we said we could see sales growth exceed the 1% to 3% range as a result of pricing actions we'll take in Venezuela to offset inflation and make sure that our business stays profitable. So we said excluding Venezuela, we still expect to be in that 1% to 3% range on sales. And also on operating profit and earnings per share excluding Venezuela, we expect to be in the ranges that we communicated. Okay? Now remember, we're pricing to offset inflation. So it's possible that could throw off more profit, but it remains to be seen. There are margin controls within Venezuela. Some may have the question as well. ""So why haven't we deconsolidated Venezuela?"" And let me just put that out there. In terms of Venezuela we operate in the preferred industry food within the country, and most of our inputs are locally sourced. Remember, generally accepted accounting principles, one of the key criteria for deconsolidating is exchangeability of currency. We've been able to exchange bolivar for U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 and also here in January of 2016. We have control over our business. As I said, we're profitable in local currency as well. We remeasured to the SIMADI rate in 2015, so it has become a smaller portion of our business as a result of that. We continue to monitor and manage the business, and our team there is doing a superb job at that."

We saw good growth in both currency neutral comparable net sales and operating profit. And the individual performances of many of our businesses were strong, with currency neutral comparable sales growth in U.S. Cereal, U.S. Specialty Channels, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We continue to build momentum, and trends continue to improve. 
And importantly, as you've seen in the public data, our consumption increased in the U.S. Cereal business in the fourth quarter and we gained share. Obviously, this continued momentum had a positive impact on overall results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.
The broad-based quarterly performance led to underlying full year currency neutral comparable net sales and operating profit results that were in line with our expectations.
2015's performance represented an improvement from 2014's results, and we're continuing to build momentum in 2016. Comparable currency neutral earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range; and full year cash flow of $1.1 billion was also in line with our recently increased estimates. And we have excellent earnings visibility as we continue to make great progress executing Project K and implementing zero-based budgeting. So we met or exceeded our targets for 2015, and the performance we achieved set a great base for growth and the momentum we've built provides us with confidence as we enter the year.
So now let's turn to Slide 4 and more detail on our expectations for 2016. The momentum we built in 2015 was a result of a better innovation, better support, better execution and some of the visibility provided by our cost savings programs. And we expect this level of execution and momentum to continue in 2016. Specifically, we're very pleased with the momentum that we built in the U.S. Cereal business. We ended the year with fourth quarter consumption growth of more than 2% for the Kellogg brand and a share gain of 70 basis points, and results in December were even better. I'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.
The project K and zero-based budgeting programs will each generate $100 million of savings in 2016. That's $200 million in total flexibility that we'll use to continue to drive top line growth and increase margins. Importantly, as you heard at the Investor Day a couple of months ago, we're excited about the plans we have to drive growth in North America and in each of the international regions, and we will remain focus on executing those plans throughout 2016. We're investing in the top line by improving our food, introducing great new innovation across categories and businesses, by increasing the geographic expansion of Pringles, by improving sales capabilities and by focusing on other activities designed to help us Win Where The Shopper Shops.  So we're pleased that all this has put us back on our long-term growth algorithm in 2016. Specifically, we still expect low single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit operating profit growth and earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%, all on a currency neutral comparable basis. Ron will discuss this in a minute.
We're excited about our plans across all the areas of our business and are very encouraged by the impact our actions are making.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results."

We always had anticipated approximately 1 point of sales growth benefit from Venezuela in our guidance for the full year. The accelerated pricing drove an additional point and resulted in full year sales growth of 1.2%.

Full year currency neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 2.3%, at the high end of our guidance range of between down 2% to 4%. Full year operating profit would have also increased by approximately 1%, excluding the impact of rebasing incentive comp.
Reported operating profit for the full year was $1.1 billion and for the quarter was a loss of $39 million, including a noncash mark-to-market charge for pensions of $393 million. This was primarily driven by the impact that asset returns had on our pension plans, but it is worth noting that even at historically low discount rates, our pension plans are almost 90% funded. You will see more detail regarding items affecting comparability in appendices to the presentation.
Comparable earnings were $0.79 per share in the quarter, and these results include $0.06 of currency headwind. Currency neutral comparable earnings were $0.85 per share for the quarter, an increase of 1.2%. Full year comparable earnings were $3.53 per share, including $0.28 of the impact from currencies. So as a result, full year currency neutral comparable earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range and flat to last year.
Slide 6 shows the components of the full year and quarterly sales growth. Overall, currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 1.2% for the full year. We delivered double-digit growth in Asia and strong growth in Latin America. Pringles also delivered another strong year of growth across the globe, and our U.S. Cereal business continues to see improving trends and posted good growth in the fourth quarter.
Price mix increased by 1.9% as a result of growth in Latin America, which was driven primarily by the impact of Venezuela. We also saw price mix improvement in several North America businesses and in European snacks. 
While volume declined for the year, driven by developed Cereal and U.S. Snacks, we saw good growth in the global Pringles business and in the emerging markets Cereal business. And as you can see on the chart, the impact of 2014's 53rd week reduced reported sales growth by 1.3%, and the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by 7.5%. More than half of which is due to the midyear remeasurement in Venezuela.
As a reminder, our joint ventures in China and Africa aren't included in these numbers, however, we saw very good rates of growth from them in the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 shows details regarding our fourth quarter and full year currency neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Comparable gross margin for the full year was down slightly and in line with our expectations. It is important to note that gross margin for the quarter and the full year has been impacted by accelerating levels of inflation in Venezuela. Of course, we were able to price and manage the profit of the business to our plan, but gross margin deteriorated. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, gross margin increased by 20 basis points for the full year and by 30 basis points for the fourth quarter.
Slide 8 shows the fourth quarter operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's currency neutral comparable operating profit increased by 3%. This was due to gross margin expansion resulting from lower input costs and savings from the Project K initiative in the region. This was partially offset by the impact of rebasing incentive compensation, which lowered North America's operating profit growth by more than 5% in the quarter. 
We're pleased with the full year operating profit growth of 4% in Europe. Results for the fourth quarter were due to the timing of investment in brand building and some discrete costs. Without these discrete costs, operating profit would have increased by approximately 5%. 
Operating profit in Latin America increased by 46% due to the impact of Venezuela on the region's results. In addition, we saw good results in Mexico, good overhead management and a favorable impact from the timing of investment. 
Operating profit decreased by 13% in the Asia Pacific region. We do continue to invest in sales growth in cereals and snacks in this region. This include investment in our brands and our people. In addition, we saw higher costs of goods in the quarter due to the timing of spend across the year.
Slide 9 shows our full year cash flow. Full year operating cash flow after capital expenditure was approximately $1.1 billion, $100 million higher than our estimate as we began 2015. We're very pleased with this result as it includes the cash required for Project K of approximately $330 million. We offset the issues of cash with excellent execution of our payables initiative. And importantly, in 2015 we returned more than $1.4 billion to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases.
Slide 10 shows our industry-leading core working capital as a percentage of net sales and the improvement we've made over the last year. You can see that we ended the year with rolling 12-month core working capital as a percentage of sales of 6.2%. The significant year-over-year improvement is the result of excellent work that we've done on our payables initiative, and we'll continue our efforts to free up cash from our balance sheet as we proceed through 2016.
Slide 11 shows our currency neutral comparable guidance for the full year 2016, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will increase at a rate between 1% and 3%. And while our guidance -- original guidance always included approximately 1% of sales growth from the impact of inflation in Venezuela, our latest outlook includes more pricing to offset inflation in the country. Obviously, this is hard to predict but it is possible that full year comparable net sales growth could exceed our guidance range due to these changes in Venezuela. It's worth noting that even excluding the total impact of Venezuela, we still expect to be in our original guidance range of between 1% to 3%.
We anticipate deflation in cost of goods sold driven by material costs. And in combination with savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting, we expect improved gross margin. Of course, this excludes the impact of Venezuela, given the inflation-driven volatility. 
Our material input costs are approximately 70% covered at this time. Operating profit is still expected to grow at between 4% and 6%. And we also still expect that currency neutral comparable earnings per share will increase between 6% and 8%. Our outlook includes a higher tax rate due to comparisons in 2015 and slightly higher interest expense. Specifically, we expecte interest expense to be in a range between $235 million and $245 million, reflecting an anticipated increase in rates and slightly higher levels of debt. The comparable tax rate is expected to be between 27% and 28%. 
Our board has approved a share repurchase program of $1.5 billion, which will run through 2017, and we still expect to repurchase approximately $700 million to $750 million of shares in 2016.
As always, our expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of items affecting comparability. We expect that full year operating cash flow will be approximately $1.1 billion. This includes our expectation that full year capital spending will be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales to support growth in our Pringles business and Project K.
Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk. We currently expect that currency translation could have an impact of as much as $0.10 per share in 2016. This includes approximately $0.04 for the translation of Venezuela results impacting the first half of 2016. We expect that integration costs from the transactions we did in Egypt and Nigeria in 2015 will be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share for the full year. And we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be approximately $100 million for the full year, approximately 75% to 80% of which will come from cost of goods. We estimate that pretax P&L costs for Project K and our zero-based budgeting implementation will be between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share. Approximately half of this will be in cost of goods. And it's important to note that both Project K and our zero-based budgeting initiative remain on track.
Finally, our currency headwind is much more significant in the first quarter and the first half of the year. And the increases in tax and interest expense also impact Q1 and the first half of the year. So a simple way to think about our comparable earnings per share delivery, including currency, is it -- it will be delivered relatively evenly across the year.
And now I'll turn it back over to John for more detail regarding the operating segments."

And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. We saw good results from the business in the fourth quarter with sales growth of 1.5%. This was driven by very good results in our U S Cereal business. As you can see on the",2495,"Thanks, Ron. And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. We saw good results from the business in the fourth quarter with sales growth of 1.5%. This was driven by very good results in our U S Cereal business. As you can see on the chart, we gained share in 2015 and in the fourth quarter and had a great ending to the year in December. As you saw last quarter, our base sales performance was even better, with growth all year and growth of 4% in the fourth quarter. Importantly, our core 6 brands led this growth: Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes, Mini-Wheats and Special K, all saw a consumption growth in the quarter, with Special K posting high single-digit growth. This was driven primarily by changes to messaging and the renovation work we did last year on Red Berries and the good growth we saw all year on Raisin Bran, which result in the introduction of Raisin Bran with cranberries, which showed good results for the entire franchise. 
So we saw a lot of improvement across the year in the Morning Foods business. We invested where we needed to and worked hard to improve the fundamentals. We improved our brand building and the new products we launched. We invested in our foods. We put fun back in the box with Avengers and Disney Frozen-themed Cereals, and we've quickly taken these learnings to other regions of the world as I'll discuss in a minute.
I'd like to thank Paul Norman who began this transformation and Craig Bahner who has continued it, and the entire Morning Foods team. Their hard work is having a significant impact. 
And we're optimistic about this business as we enter 2016. We said last year that we would improve the performance of Special K, and we have as you can see on the graph on the slide. And we're going to continue to drive sales in 2016 with introduction of new products like Special K Nourish, which you can also see pictured on the slide.
Special K Nourish is a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients that consumer can see and the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trend grains like quinoa. It's early, but the initial response has been encouraging. And we will continue to focus on all our core 6 brands, as Craig discussed at the Investor Day in November.
We have a range of new products launching in 2016. Some are on-trend foods such as Special K Nourish and Harvest Delights Mini-Wheats and some are fun additions including S'Mores, Disney Dory-themed cereal and Orange Crush Pop-Tarts.
So we saw improvement throughout 2015. The Cereal business continue to improve as the year progressed, and we saw the results of the investments and changes we made. We're excited about the plans we have to 2016 and expect continued improvement.
Let's turn to Slide 15 and our U.S. Snacks business. We again saw sequential improvement in consumption in the cookie, cracker, wholesome snacks and Pringles businesses in the quarter. We gained distribution in the overall cracker category as a result of innovation. And Cheez-It continue to post good consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as it has all year. This was driven by contributions from new products including Cheez-It Extra Toasty and Grooves. And as Deanie Elsner said at Day at K, we will increase our focus and our investment on core brands in 2016, including Cheez-It.
We restaged Special K Cracker Chips during the year, and we saw improved consumption performance as the year progressed due to renovations we made to the packaging and the food. We did see continued decline in consumption of popcorn chips in the fourth quarter, which had an impact on results. However, we expect the impact of remaining SKUs to lessen as we progress through 2016.
We also gained distribution in the cookie business in the fourth quarter. The sequential improvement in consumption I mentioned continue the trend we saw last quarter and was driven by Chips Deluxe, Fudge Shop and Famous Amos. These brands benefited from expanded distribution, new products and increased in-store activity.
We have great brands in the category and we have some exciting new introductions planned for 2016, and we're also going to give the brand's new support, including the relaunch of advertising, featuring the Keebler Elves.
We continue to see very good rates of consumption growth in Rice Krispies Treats in the wholesome snacks category in the fourth quarter. In addition, the performance of our Special K bars has improved due to new products and renovation, especially our new Special K chewy nut bars. The overall Pringles business posted good underlying growth in the grocery and convenience channels. We continue to expand our global capacity, and we have good plans across all our customers in 2016. As a result, we expect this business to post strong rates of growth for the year.
We are making progress in the Snacks business. We're increasing investment and focusing it on our largest brands. We're making sure that we have the right offerings in the right channels, and we're expanding our offerings in the On the Go segment. And as in all of the North American region, we're using the flexibility we have to fund these changes and drive improving profitability. Deanie and the whole team are making a real difference, and we expect modest sales growth from the business in 2016 with sequential improvement across the year.
So let's turn to Slide 16 and highlights from the U.S. Specialty segment. Comparable net sales in the Specialty Channels business increased in the quarter. We saw growth in the vending and convenience channels, with net sales in the convenience channel increasing at a high single-digit rate. We saw strong growth from Rice Krispies Treats in the vending channels and from Cheez-It and Pringles in the convenience channel. And we gained or maintain share in the cereal, cracker, wholesome snack and salty snack categories within the channel for the full year. We also gained share in the Foodservice channel in the cereal, cracker and cookie categories in the fourth quarter. The Specialty business also built a solid base in 2015, and our expectations are the team will drive good results in 2016.
Slide 17 shows the North America Other segment, which includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. The Frozen Foods business saw continued growth from Eggo handheld sandwiches in the quarter. Consumption increased at a double-digit rate as it did all year. Overall sales declined at a low single-digit rate for the quarter, driven by the impact of egg prices, network improvements, the timing of activity and the drawing down of inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags. This veggie food packaging conversion is going well, but we expect sales to continue to be impacted in the first quarter of 2016 and for performance to improve over the balance of the year.
We saw continued sequential improvement in the Kashi business in the fourth quarter, and the performance improved within the quarter. The Cereal business improved due to the stabilization of distribution and the impact of introduction of new products in the second half of 2015, and the Bear Naked Granola brand posted double-digit consumption growth in the quarter. The overall Kashi business sales were down at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, however, we expect continued improvement in 2016 due to further improvement in distribution and the impact of a new focus on new products high in plant protein.
The Canadian business posted sales growth in the Cereal and Wholesome Snack businesses in the quarter. For 2016, the Canadian team is planning introductions of new products and programs, much like the rest of the North American region, but we'll continue to see an adverse impact from transactional foreign exchange.
Let's turn to Slide 18 in our European business. Sales growth across the region was 1.6% in the quarter, with strong growth in the emerging markets. The Pringles business also posted double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. We grew share in both the U.K. and Germany, in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. Germany's performance, which was through the introduction of Tortilla Pringles and the strong results we saw in the U.K. due to some great activity, including a successful Halloween-themed promotion.
As you might imagine, we had some exciting activity planned for Pringles in 2016 as well, including soccer-themed activity, planned to coincide with the Euro soccer tournament in the summer and the continued rollout of Tortilla Pringles in the region. The wholesome snack business also posted sales growth in the fourth quarter. This was due to better results in the U.K., due in part by Disney-branded snacks, mini biscuits, Crunchy Nut and Rice Krispies squares. In addition, the Russian business did well, and we have new foods coming out across the region in 2016.
The Cereal business in Europe declined in the fourth quarter due to challenges in the category in many of the countries. However, we improved our plans for Special K and Crunchy Nut in the U.K. Saw good performance from Extra in Italy and invention behind Kellogg's brand in Granola in Germany, and we recently launched the Ancient Legends brand in the region. These are great products, which include on-trend ingredients like smelt, apples, sultanas and cheese seeds.
And we're also applying the learnings from other parts of the world, including the renovation of Special K Red Berries, the launch of Special K Nourish, and we're also adding more fun on the box.
So the fourth quarter was a successful one for the European business, and we expect improvement to continue in 2016 as we launch great new products, invest for growth and continue to focus on execution.
Slide 19 shows highlights of our Latin American business in the fourth quarter. Total currency neutral comparable net sales again increased to double-digit rate, primarily due to the impact of Venezuela. We saw sales growth in Mexico of approximately 4%, driven by great performance in the Cereal business. We gained share in the Cereal category in the latest public data, and we saw improved performance from our adult-oriented cereals. We also gained share in Brazil in the quarter and for the year. These gains were partially the result of parent brand innovation and support. We launched Ancient Grains in Brazil in Q4 and in the first quarter of 2016 in the Andean region and we also have Special K protein and granola with quinoa planned for introduction.
Sales in the region's Snack business also increased in the quarter. This growth resulted from better execution, good innovation and strength in the Pringles business. In fact, the Pringles business grew at a double-digit rate. Commercial innovation, strong execution and promotional programs drove growth, and we expect a continued good performance from the brand in 2016.
And our focus on high-frequency stores continues to drive results. We've seen results in convenience and mini superstores in Mexico and smaller mom-and-pop stores in Colombia. And we've also had success driving sales growth through packaging initiatives designed to drive affordability and accessibility in various areas of the business.
Cereals had a good year in the Latin America business in 2015 despite challenging conditions driven by slowing economies and weakening currencies. The team has done a great job managing through these situations, and we expect a continued good performance in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 20 and our Asia Pacific business. Overall, currency neutral comparable sales growth was 3.3% in the fourth quarter, although this does not include the impact of the JVs in China and West Africa. If we include the impact of those businesses, we would have seen double-digit sales growth. 
The Asian business posted double-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth in the quarter. We saw double-digit sales growth in Japan, driven by the continued growth of the Granola category and the impact of new packaging. We also saw double-digit growth in Korea and Southeast Asia.
The Pringles business in Asia Pacific grew volume at a double-digit rate. We saw broad-based channels growth and share gains due to innovation and gains in distribution. And the sub-Saharan African business also posted double-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth. We saw better execution and the benefit from the introduction of new products. And as I mentioned, the JV in West Africa also posted very strong growth.
The environment in Australia remained challenging, with category sales continuing to decline. However, the Granola and Muesli segments are growing well, and we have a plan to address the weakness in the overall Australian business in 2016. We're also applying lessons learned from other parts of the business to Australia as we are in Europe.
We were pleased with the performance of the Asia Pacific region last year. For the full year, the region posted mid-single-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth. And including impact of the JVs, we would achieve even higher growth. The Asian business continues to perform very well. And while we expect the environment in Australia to remain challenging, we do expect another good year from this business. We got our plans in place, and our execution remains strong.
Let's turn to Page 21 and the summary. Our results from the fourth quarter were in line with or ahead of our expectations. We saw good performance in net sales, operating profit, EPS and cash flow. We built a strong base and generated momentum in 2015. We told you we needed to improve the performance of the U.S. Cereal business, and we have. We saw increased consumption and share gains in the quarter, Special K is performing well and the Kashi Cereal business is responding to the introduction of new products. And all of our international businesses posted sales growth in the fourth quarter, and we're on track to meet our expectations for 2016. We expect our momentum to continue. We've made changes where we needed to. We've improved our support. We're launching exciting new products. We've improved our Foods renovation, and we're executing well. And we also had significant flexibility in 2016 from Project K and the zero-based budgeting initiative. These 2 projects will give us an incremental $200 million of savings in 2016 that we will invest in revenue growth and use to improve margins.
So as you step back and look at where we are, we built momentum in 2015, we generated significant savings, we launched a new strategy and we have a strong management team. And as we entered 2016, we are absolutely committed to our algorithm to deliver results for sales, operating profit and EPS and to building long-term earnings visibility.
So finally, I'd like to thank all the Kellogg employees around the world, their efforts are making a huge difference and none of this would be possible without them.
And now I'll open it up for questions."

I'll take the Cereal questions and the sales growth question. I'll hand ZBB over to Ron. There's no question that the additional investments made in our sales organizations part of our Project K reinvestments absolutely helped the performance of our U.S. Cereal business. In addition, our U.S. Cereal business has been helped by some of the great food improvements we've made such as Special K Red Berries, some of the outstanding brand building programs we had such as the Raisin brand program out there. But in-store execution this year has been significantly better than in the past. And I think the U.S. sales reps, the U.S. sales team has done a tremendous job of improving the in-store execution in driving the performance of that business. Because of those changes, because of the momentum we're seeing in the U.S. Cereal business, we actually are quite optimistic about 2016. I think if you asked me back on the third quarter conference call our expectations for U.S. Cereal, we would've defined flat sales in 2016 a success. Given the strength of U.S. Cereal across 2015, we'd actually expect our U.S. Cereal business to grow slightly, 2% in 2016. The Morning Foods business obviously includes more things than just U.S. Cereal, there is a Pop-Tarts business in there, which is also doing well and Health and Wellness business. But in aggregate, I'd say that total business, we expect to be up slightly in 2016."

And remember, we're targeting over $2 billion worth of discretionary spend in North America for the start of the program. And the areas that we're targeting are in general administrative overhead, distribution costs, brand building and supply chain overhead as well. As we said, we still expect to see $100 million in 2016, but what I would point out is that's not a ceiling in terms of our savings, okay. We -- this is a multiyear program, and we obviously believe that there are more opportunities for savings and then we're implementing a process to make sure that we can sustain those savings. We are reinvesting some of those savings back into our business. For example, we're refining money and brand building. We're taking some opportunity to reinvest back in the brand building for revenue growth. And as we've talked all along, we're investing money back into our Food as well. Our international regions are underway. So we have started the work in all of our international regions at this point in time, kicked off the process, dissecting our spend, identifying the opportunities as well. Some specific areas or learnings in terms of where we're seeing savings. So we've looked to cost of goods sold. For example, we've identified opportunities in our transportation and warehousing costs. We've done a deep dive in professional and contracted services and balanced some money there. And on people-related costs, things like travel, relocation, things of that nature, we've implemented policy changes to impact and benefit our cost structure. As I mentioned, we are finding some money in brand building as well around media, nonworking media as well as TV media. But again, we're investing some of that back into the business to drive revenue growth. So overall project is progressing well, remains on track."

We've talked a lot in the context of our Cereal business, about Special K. But Special K has also had a fundamental impact to our Snacks business. We've had a headwind from Special K in Snacks over the last couple of years. You've seen this come through in our cracker business with Special K Cracker Chips has come through and our wholesome Snacks business with Special K bars. The good news is where we have renovated those foods similar to what we've done in Cereal, we're seeing the business to stabilize, and so Special K Cracker Chips is stabilizing. And Special K chewy nut bars actually are doing quite well in the wholesome Snacks business. So if you look at that, that headwind is still there to a degree, but to a much less degree. And as we go forward, we expect some of the tailwinds in the business to become more evident. So we've had strong growth in Cheez-It over the last several years. We're seeing good growth in Pringles. We're seeing good growth in Rice Krispies treats and wholesome snacks. Our cookie business is stable in the last couple of quarters. So we've actually seen better trends within the business. So as we go forward into 2016, we expect to return this business to top line growth, although modest, and we absolutely expect to return the business to bottom line growth. So we recognize it has been an area of weakness for us. Deanie and the team have taken actions to address it, and we feel much good about our 2016 outlook. And you're actually seeing it in the consumption data even in 2015. And that the consumption in the fourth quarter for 2015 was stronger than the prior parts of the year, and we're seeing sequential improvement as we go through the year."

Overall, we do expect net deflation driving gross margin expansion. And I'm speaking specifically excluding Venezuela. We're seeing a lot of volatility and inflation in Venezuela. So I said Venezuela is aside. Excluding Venezuela, we expect gross margin expansion. We are seeing raw and packaging material deflation in 2016. We also have our base productivity improvements, Project K. And we've said Project K, that $100 million, about 75% to 80% of that runs through cost of goods sold. On the zero-based budgeting savings that we quoted, a little less than half of that is coming through cost of goods sold. Remember, Jason, we've said all along that we were going to invest in our food. And we've done that in 2015, and we're doing it in 2016. Renovating our Foods and launching granolas and mueslis based on consumer trends that we're seeing. That investment in food remains at about a 50-basis-point headwind in relation to our gross margin performance. The other thing that we have impacting us in 2016 is some transactional currency exposure. So we had good hedges in 2015. Some of those are rolling off, and what we're seeing is some headwind particularly around the Canadian dollar and the peso, but also some of the other international currencies as they weaken versus the U.S. dollar. And we're seeing about a 40-basis-point headwind in relation to transactional currency exposure. So all up slight net deflation and some gross margin expansion in 2016."

A broader question is I see the improvement that's occurring in U.S. Morning Foods driven by the Cereal it's obviously positive.

So I'm wondering, as you think about the snack bar category in general and relative to Cereal, what are the main differences you see to actually being able to recapture growth and take share and improve the top line off of a somewhat depressed snack bar performance relative to what you're doing in Cereal? And the reason I asked is you've done a lot of work that just shown that there really haven't been that many new players in Cereal over the past few years, but over the past let say, 3 to 5 years there's been a massive influx of brands that might make the category a bit more competitive."

One, which is wholesome snacks. Within that the key is to have great food that's on trend. Where we have that we're growing strongly. So Rice Krispies Treats is up high single digits in the fourth quarter. Some of our foods though are not as on trend as they need to be, we've been renovating some of that food with Special K chewy nut bar. We have work on Nutri-Grain and new Nutri-Grain bars coming up. So we believe we have strong brands. Our wholesome snacks business is more about ensuring all of our foods that are on trend. There's work that's being done there. We've done that work. We've seen better results, and there's still more to do. But if you look at that Snack business in totality, we have other large businesses in there beyond just the Cereal bar side, including Crackers where we have a strongly advantage footprint, particularly with Cheez-It, where we're seeing strong growth. We have Pringles. And for Pringles around the world we're seeing double-digit growth in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and low single-digit growth in North America. We believe we have an opportunity to drive much more growth around Pringles in North America as we go into 2016, and that will help our U.S. Snacks results. We have great areas of strengths within cookies as well. So as you think about our Snacks business, yes, there's some challenges in wholesome snacks. I think the answer to that is renovate, improve the food, continue to have strong brands, continue to execute in-store, but it's really a food discussion. I think we're making progress there and then we have other sources of growth within that Snacks business that's why we have confidence we'll get that business back to growth in 2016."

Our cash for Project K is $200 million. And what we're doing is we're continuing to roll out that supplier financing initiative to offset the cash requirements for Project K. We did just that in 2015, and we were able to offset the cash requirements for Project K based on the improvements we saw in our core working capital.

So in the fourth quarter, Venezuela, because of the pricing contributed about a little over 3.5% to currency neutral sales growth and it contributed about 2.5% to currency neutral operating income growth. So as we look at your guidance and I heard your comments about revenues. You're basically -- I guess, my interpretation of it is to the extent that it has that sort of impact on revenues, you're still looking at your 1% to 3% as if kind of normal, so if Venezuela contributes significantly more, there could potentially be upside to revenues. Would that saying hold true for operating income as well to the extent that it has the potential to deliver this type of impact on the growth to operating income, would you be looking at operating income the same way in terms of the effect of what a normal growth would be?

And let me just kind of run through on how Venezuela is impacting things. First, as we've said in the prepared remarks, Venezuela was always included in our sales guidance back in August as we gave the original guidance. We always expected about a point of contribution from Venezuela to our sales performance. It's hard to predict and it's gotten even harder as inflation increased dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2015. And based on our projections, that could continue as we move through 2016 as well. And that's why we said we could see sales growth exceed the 1% to 3% range as a result of pricing actions we'll take in Venezuela to offset inflation and make sure that our business stays profitable. So we said excluding Venezuela, we still expect to be in that 1% to 3% range on sales. And also on operating profit and earnings per share excluding Venezuela, we expect to be in the ranges that we communicated. Okay? Now remember, we're pricing to offset inflation. So it's possible that could throw off more profit, but it remains to be seen. There are margin controls within Venezuela. Some may have the question as well. ""So why haven't we deconsolidated Venezuela?"" And let me just put that out there. In terms of Venezuela we operate in the preferred industry food within the country, and most of our inputs are locally sourced. Remember, generally accepted accounting principles, one of the key criteria for deconsolidating is exchangeability of currency. We've been able to exchange bolivar for U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 and also here in January of 2016. We have control over our business. As I said, we're profitable in local currency as well. We remeasured to the SIMADI rate in 2015, so it has become a smaller portion of our business as a result of that. We continue to monitor and manage the business, and our team there is doing a superb job at that."

And the individu",580,"Thanks, Simon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We're pleased to have reported results that met our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2015. We saw good growth in both currency neutral comparable net sales and operating profit. And the individual performances of many of our businesses were strong, with currency neutral comparable sales growth in U.S. Cereal, U.S. Specialty Channels, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We continue to build momentum, and trends continue to improve. 
And importantly, as you've seen in the public data, our consumption increased in the U.S. Cereal business in the fourth quarter and we gained share. Obviously, this continued momentum had a positive impact on overall results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year.
The broad-based quarterly performance led to underlying full year currency neutral comparable net sales and operating profit results that were in line with our expectations.
2015's performance represented an improvement from 2014's results, and we're continuing to build momentum in 2016. Comparable currency neutral earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range; and full year cash flow of $1.1 billion was also in line with our recently increased estimates. And we have excellent earnings visibility as we continue to make great progress executing Project K and implementing zero-based budgeting. So we met or exceeded our targets for 2015, and the performance we achieved set a great base for growth and the momentum we've built provides us with confidence as we enter the year.
So now let's turn to Slide 4 and more detail on our expectations for 2016. The momentum we built in 2015 was a result of a better innovation, better support, better execution and some of the visibility provided by our cost savings programs. And we expect this level of execution and momentum to continue in 2016. Specifically, we're very pleased with the momentum that we built in the U.S. Cereal business. We ended the year with fourth quarter consumption growth of more than 2% for the Kellogg brand and a share gain of 70 basis points, and results in December were even better. I'll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.
The project K and zero-based budgeting programs will each generate $100 million of savings in 2016. That's $200 million in total flexibility that we'll use to continue to drive top line growth and increase margins. Importantly, as you heard at the Investor Day a couple of months ago, we're excited about the plans we have to drive growth in North America and in each of the international regions, and we will remain focus on executing those plans throughout 2016. We're investing in the top line by improving our food, introducing great new innovation across categories and businesses, by increasing the geographic expansion of Pringles, by improving sales capabilities and by focusing on other activities designed to help us Win Where The Shopper Shops.  So we're pleased that all this has put us back on our long-term growth algorithm in 2016. Specifically, we still expect low single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit operating profit growth and earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%, all on a currency neutral comparable basis. Ron will discuss this in a minute.
We're excited about our plans across all the areas of our business and are very encouraged by the impact our actions are making.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ron for a discussion of our financial results."

Slide 5 shows financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 4.2%.

Fourth quarter currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 4.2%. This was ahead of our expectations and included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. We also saw improving trends and sales growth in our business, excluding the impact of Venezuela. 
We always had anticipated approximately 1 point of sales growth benefit from Venezuela in our guidance for the full year. The accelerated pricing drove an additional point and resulted in full year sales growth of 1.2%.
Currency neutral comparable operating profit increased by 2.8% in the fourth quarter. This included a headwind from the rebasing of incentive compensation of 4%. So growth in operating profit in the fourth quarter would have been approximately 7%, excluding the rebasing of incentive comp.
Full year currency neutral comparable operating profit decreased by 2.3%, at the high end of our guidance range of between down 2% to 4%. Full year operating profit would have also increased by approximately 1%, excluding the impact of rebasing incentive comp.
Reported operating profit for the full year was $1.1 billion and for the quarter was a loss of $39 million, including a noncash mark-to-market charge for pensions of $393 million. This was primarily driven by the impact that asset returns had on our pension plans, but it is worth noting that even at historically low discount rates, our pension plans are almost 90% funded. You will see more detail regarding items affecting comparability in appendices to the presentation.
Comparable earnings were $0.79 per share in the quarter, and these results include $0.06 of currency headwind. Currency neutral comparable earnings were $0.85 per share for the quarter, an increase of 1.2%. Full year comparable earnings were $3.53 per share, including $0.28 of the impact from currencies. So as a result, full year currency neutral comparable earnings were $3.81 per share, at the high end of our guidance range and flat to last year.
Slide 6 shows the components of the full year and quarterly sales growth. Overall, currency neutral comparable net sales increased by 1.2% for the full year. We delivered double-digit growth in Asia and strong growth in Latin America. Pringles also delivered another strong year of growth across the globe, and our U.S. Cereal business continues to see improving trends and posted good growth in the fourth quarter.
Price mix increased by 1.9% as a result of growth in Latin America, which was driven primarily by the impact of Venezuela. We also saw price mix improvement in several North America businesses and in European snacks. 
While volume declined for the year, driven by developed Cereal and U.S. Snacks, we saw good growth in the global Pringles business and in the emerging markets Cereal business. And as you can see on the chart, the impact of 2014's 53rd week reduced reported sales growth by 1.3%, and the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by 7.5%. More than half of which is due to the midyear remeasurement in Venezuela.
As a reminder, our joint ventures in China and Africa aren't included in these numbers, however, we saw very good rates of growth from them in the fourth quarter.
Slide 7 shows details regarding our fourth quarter and full year currency neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin. Comparable gross margin for the full year was down slightly and in line with our expectations. It is important to note that gross margin for the quarter and the full year has been impacted by accelerating levels of inflation in Venezuela. Of course, we were able to price and manage the profit of the business to our plan, but gross margin deteriorated. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, gross margin increased by 20 basis points for the full year and by 30 basis points for the fourth quarter.
Slide 8 shows the fourth quarter operating profit performance for each of the regions. North America's currency neutral comparable operating profit increased by 3%. This was due to gross margin expansion resulting from lower input costs and savings from the Project K initiative in the region. This was partially offset by the impact of rebasing incentive compensation, which lowered North America's operating profit growth by more than 5% in the quarter. 
We're pleased with the full year operating profit growth of 4% in Europe. Results for the fourth quarter were due to the timing of investment in brand building and some discrete costs. Without these discrete costs, operating profit would have increased by approximately 5%. 
Operating profit in Latin America increased by 46% due to the impact of Venezuela on the region's results. In addition, we saw good results in Mexico, good overhead management and a favorable impact from the timing of investment. 
Operating profit decreased by 13% in the Asia Pacific region. We do continue to invest in sales growth in cereals and snacks in this region. This include investment in our brands and our people. In addition, we saw higher costs of goods in the quarter due to the timing of spend across the year.
Slide 9 shows our full year cash flow. Full year operating cash flow after capital expenditure was approximately $1.1 billion, $100 million higher than our estimate as we began 2015. We're very pleased with this result as it includes the cash required for Project K of approximately $330 million. We offset the issues of cash with excellent execution of our payables initiative. And importantly, in 2015 we returned more than $1.4 billion to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases.
Slide 10 shows our industry-leading core working capital as a percentage of net sales and the improvement we've made over the last year. You can see that we ended the year with rolling 12-month core working capital as a percentage of sales of 6.2%. The significant year-over-year improvement is the result of excellent work that we've done on our payables initiative, and we'll continue our efforts to free up cash from our balance sheet as we proceed through 2016.
Slide 11 shows our currency neutral comparable guidance for the full year 2016, which has not changed. We continue to expect that net sales will increase at a rate between 1% and 3%. And while our guidance -- original guidance always included approximately 1% of sales growth from the impact of inflation in Venezuela, our latest outlook includes more pricing to offset inflation in the country. Obviously, this is hard to predict but it is possible that full year comparable net sales growth could exceed our guidance range due to these changes in Venezuela. It's worth noting that even excluding the total impact of Venezuela, we still expect to be in our original guidance range of between 1% to 3%.
We anticipate deflation in cost of goods sold driven by material costs. And in combination with savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting, we expect improved gross margin. Of course, this excludes the impact of Venezuela, given the inflation-driven volatility. 
Our material input costs are approximately 70% covered at this time. Operating profit is still expected to grow at between 4% and 6%. And we also still expect that currency neutral comparable earnings per share will increase between 6% and 8%. Our outlook includes a higher tax rate due to comparisons in 2015 and slightly higher interest expense. Specifically, we expected interest expense to be in a range between $235 million and $245 million, reflecting an anticipated increase in rates and slightly higher levels of debt. The comparable tax rate is expected to be between 27% and 28%. 
Our board has approved a share repurchase program of $1.5 billion, which will run through 2017, and we still expect to repurchase approximately $700 million to $750 million of shares in 2016.
As always, our expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share exclude the impact of items affecting comparability. We expect that full year operating cash flow will be approximately $1.1 billion. This includes our expectation that full year capital spending will be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales to support growth in our Pringles business and Project K.
Slide 12 shows our full year earnings per share walk. We currently expect that currency translation could have an impact of as much as $0.10 per share in 2016. This includes approximately $0.04 for the translation of Venezuela results impacting the first half of 2016. We expect that integration costs from the transactions we did in Egypt and Nigeria in 2015 will be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share for the full year. And we expect that incremental savings from Project K will be approximately $100 million for the full year, approximately 75% to 80% of which will come from cost of goods. We estimate that pretax P&L costs for Project K and our zero-based budgeting implementation will be between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share. Approximately half of this will be in cost of goods. And it's important to note that both Project K and our zero-based budgeting initiative remain on track.
Finally, our currency headwind is much more significant in the first quarter and the first half of the year. And the increases in tax and interest expense also impact Q1 and the first half of the year. So a simple way to think about our comparable earnings per share delivery, including currency, is it -- it will be delivered relatively evenly across the year.
And now I'll turn it back over to John for more detail regarding the operating segments."

And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. We saw good results from the business in the fourth quarter with sales growth of 1.5%. This was driven by very good results in our U S Cereal business. As you can see on the",2495,"Thanks, Ron. And now let's turn to Slide 13 and the U.S. Morning Foods business. We saw good results from the business in the fourth quarter with sales growth of 1.5%. This was driven by very good results in our U S Cereal business. As you can see on the chart, we gained share in 2015 and in the fourth quarter and had a great ending to the year in December. As you saw last quarter, our base sales performance was even better, with growth all year and growth of 4% in the fourth quarter. Importantly, our core 6 brands led this growth: Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes, Mini-Wheats and Special K, all saw a consumption growth in the quarter, with Special K posting high single-digit growth. This was driven primarily by changes to messaging and the renovation work we did last year on Red Berries and the good growth we saw all year on Raisin Bran, which result in the introduction of Raisin Bran with cranberries, which showed good results for the entire franchise. 
So we saw a lot of improvement across the year in the Morning Foods business. We invested where we needed to and worked hard to improve the fundamentals. We improved our brand building and the new products we launched. We invested in our foods. We put fun back in the box with Avengers and Disney Frozen-themed Cereals, and we've quickly taken these learnings to other regions of the world as I'll discuss in a minute.
I'd like to thank Paul Norman who began this transformation and Craig Bahner who has continued it, and the entire Morning Foods team. Their hard work is having a significant impact. 
And we're optimistic about this business as we enter 2016. We said last year that we would improve the performance of Special K, and we have as you can see on the graph on the slide. And we're going to continue to drive sales in 2016 with introduction of new products like Special K Nourish, which you can also see pictured on the slide.
Special K Nourish is a cereal with positive nutrition and ingredients that consumer can see and the food includes fruits, nuts and on-trend grains like quinoa. It's early, but the initial response has been encouraging. And we will continue to focus on all our core 6 brands, as Craig discussed at the Investor Day in November.
We have a range of new products launching in 2016. Some are on-trend foods such as Special K Nourish and Harvest Delights Mini-Wheats and some are fun additions including S'Mores, Disney Dory-themed cereal and Orange Crush Pop-Tarts.
So we saw improvement throughout 2015. The Cereal business continue to improve as the year progressed, and we saw the results of the investments and changes we made. We're excited about the plans we have to 2016 and expect continued improvement.
Let's turn to Slide 15 and our U.S. Snacks business. We again saw sequential improvement in consumption in the cookie, cracker, wholesome snacks and Pringles businesses in the quarter. We gained distribution in the overall cracker category as a result of innovation. And Cheez-It continue to post good consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as it has all year. This was driven by contributions from new products including Cheez-It Extra Toasty and Grooves. And as Deanie Elsner said at Day at K, we will increase our focus and our investment on core brands in 2016, including Cheez-It.
We restaged Special K Cracker Chips during the year, and we saw improved consumption performance as the year progressed due to renovations we made to the packaging and the food. We did see continued decline in consumption of popcorn chips in the fourth quarter, which had an impact on results. However, we expect the impact of remaining SKUs to lessen as we progress through 2016.
We also gained distribution in the cookie business in the fourth quarter. The sequential improvement in consumption I mentioned continue the trend we saw last quarter and was driven by Chips Deluxe, Fudge Shop and Famous Amos. These brands benefited from expanded distribution, new products and increased in-store activity.
We have great brands in the category and we have some exciting new introductions planned for 2016, and we're also going to give the brand's new support, including the relaunch of advertising, featuring the Keebler Elves.
We continue to see very good rates of consumption growth in Rice Krispies Treats in the wholesome snacks category in the fourth quarter. In addition, the performance of our Special K bars has improved due to new products and renovation, especially our new Special K chewy nut bars. The overall Pringles business posted good underlying growth in the grocery and convenience channels. We continue to expand our global capacity, and we have good plans across all our customers in 2016. As a result, we expect this business to post strong rates of growth for the year.
We are making progress in the Snacks business. We're increasing investment and focusing it on our largest brands. We're making sure that we have the right offerings in the right channels, and we're expanding our offerings in the On the Go segment. And as in all of the North American region, we're using the flexibility we have to fund these changes and drive improving profitability. Deanie and the whole team are making a real difference, and we expect modest sales growth from the business in 2016 with sequential improvement across the year.
So let's turn to Slide 16 and highlights from the U.S. Specialty segment. Comparable net sales in the Specialty Channels business increased in the quarter. We saw growth in the vending and convenience channels, with net sales in the convenience channel increasing at a high single-digit rate. We saw strong growth from Rice Krispies Treats in the vending channels and from Cheez-It and Pringles in the convenience channel. And we gained or maintain share in the cereal, cracker, wholesome snack and salty snack categories within the channel for the full year. We also gained share in the Foodservice channel in the cereal, cracker and cookie categories in the fourth quarter. The Specialty business also built a solid base in 2015, and our expectations are the team will drive good results in 2016.
Slide 17 shows the North America Other segment, which includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. The Frozen Foods business saw continued growth from Eggo handheld sandwiches in the quarter. Consumption increased at a double-digit rate as it did all year. Overall sales declined at a low single-digit rate for the quarter, driven by the impact of egg prices, network improvements, the timing of activity and the drawing down of inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags. This veggie food packaging conversion is going well, but we expect sales to continue to be impacted in the first quarter of 2016 and for performance to improve over the balance of the year.
We saw continued sequential improvement in the Kashi business in the fourth quarter, and the performance improved within the quarter. The Cereal business improved due to the stabilization of distribution and the impact of introduction of new products in the second half of 2015, and the Bear Naked Granola brand posted double-digit consumption growth in the quarter. The overall Kashi business sales were down at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, however, we expect continued improvement in 2016 due to further improvement in distribution and the impact of a new focus on new products high in plant protein.
The Canadian business posted sales growth in the Cereal and Wholesome Snack businesses in the quarter. For 2016, the Canadian team is planning introductions of new products and programs, much like the rest of the North American region, but we'll continue to see an adverse impact from transactional foreign exchange.
Let's turn to Slide 18 in our European business. Sales growth across the region was 1.6% in the quarter, with strong growth in the emerging markets. The Pringles business also posted double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. We grew share in both the U.K. and Germany, in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. Germany's performance, which was through the introduction of Tortilla Pringles and the strong results we saw in the U.K. due to some great activity, including a successful Halloween-themed promotion.
As you might imagine, we had some exciting activity planned for Pringles in 2016 as well, including soccer-themed activity, planned to coincide with the Euro soccer tournament in the summer and the continued rollout of Tortilla Pringles in the region. The wholesome snack business also posted sales growth in the fourth quarter. This was due to better results in the U.K., due in part by Disney-branded snacks, mini biscuits, Crunchy Nut and Rice Krispies squares. In addition, the Russian business did well, and we have new foods coming out across the region in 2016.
The Cereal business in Europe declined in the fourth quarter due to challenges in the category in many of the countries. However, we improved our plans for Special K and Crunchy Nut in the U.K. Saw good performance from Extra in Italy and invention behind Kellogg's brand in Granola in Germany, and we recently launched the Ancient Legends brand in the region. These are great products, which include on-trend ingredients like smelt, apples, sultanas and cheese seeds.
And we're also applying the learnings from other parts of the world, including the renovation of Special K Red Berries, the launch of Special K Nourish, and we're also adding more fun on the box.
So the fourth quarter was a successful one for the European business, and we expect improvement to continue in 2016 as we launch great new products, invest for growth and continue to focus on execution.
Slide 19 shows highlights of our Latin American business in the fourth quarter. Total currency neutral comparable net sales again increased to double-digit rate, primarily due to the impact of Venezuela. We saw sales growth in Mexico of approximately 4%, driven by great performance in the Cereal business. We gained share in the Cereal category in the latest public data, and we saw improved performance from our adult-oriented cereals. We also gained share in Brazil in the quarter and for the year. These gains were partially the result of parent brand innovation and support. We launched Ancient Grains in Brazil in Q4 and in the first quarter of 2016 in the Andean region and we also have Special K protein and granola with quinoa planned for introduction.
Sales in the region's Snack business also increased in the quarter. This growth resulted from better execution, good innovation and strength in the Pringles business. In fact, the Pringles business grew at a double-digit rate. Commercial innovation, strong execution and promotional programs drove growth, and we expect a continued good performance from the brand in 2016.
And our focus on high-frequency stores continues to drive results. We've seen results in convenience and mini superstores in Mexico and smaller mom-and-pop stores in Colombia. And we've also had success driving sales growth through packaging initiatives designed to drive affordability and accessibility in various areas of the business.
Cereals had a good year in the Latin America business in 2015 despite challenging conditions driven by slowing economies and weakening currencies. The team has done a great job managing through these situations, and we expect a continued good performance in 2016.
Let's turn to Slide 20 and our Asia Pacific business. Overall, currency neutral comparable sales growth was 3.3% in the fourth quarter, although this does not include the impact of the JVs in China and West Africa. If we include the impact of those businesses, we would have seen double-digit sales growth. 
The Asian business posted double-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth in the quarter. We saw double-digit sales growth in Japan, driven by the continued growth of the Granola category and the impact of new packaging. We also saw double-digit growth in Korea and Southeast Asia.
The Pringles business in Asia Pacific grew volume at a double-digit rate. We saw broad-based channels growth and share gains due to innovation and gains in distribution. And the sub-Saharan African business also posted double-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth. We saw better execution and the benefit from the introduction of new products. And as I mentioned, the JV in West Africa also posted very strong growth.
The environment in Australia remained challenging, with category sales continuing to decline. However, the Granola and Muesli segments are growing well, and we have a plan to address the weakness in the overall Australian business in 2016. We're also applying lessons learned from other parts of the business to Australia as we are in Europe.
We were pleased with the performance of the Asia Pacific region last year. For the full year, the region posted mid-single-digit currency neutral comparable sales growth. And including impact of the JVs, we would achieve even higher growth. The Asian business continues to perform very well. And while we expect the environment in Australia to remain challenging, we do expect another good year from this business. We got our plans in place, and our execution remains strong.
Let's turn to Page 21 and the summary. Our results from the fourth quarter were in line with or ahead of our expectations. We saw good performance in net sales, operating profit, EPS and cash flow. We built a strong base and generated momentum in 2015. We told you we needed to improve the performance of the U.S. Cereal business, and we have. We saw increased consumption and share gains in the quarter, Special K is performing well and the Kashi Cereal business is responding to the introduction of new products. And all of our international businesses posted sales growth in the fourth quarter, and we're on track to meet our expectations for 2016. We expect our momentum to continue. We've made changes where we needed to. We've improved our support. We're launching exciting new products. We've improved our Foods renovation, and we're executing well. And we also had significant flexibility in 2016 from Project K and the zero-based budgeting initiative. These 2 projects will give us an incremental $200 million of savings in 2016 that we will invest in revenue growth and use to improve margins.
So as you step back and look at where we are, we built momentum in 2015, we generated significant savings, we launched a new strategy and we have a strong management team. And as we entered 2016, we are absolutely committed to our algorithm to deliver results for sales, operating profit and EPS and to building long-term earnings visibility.
So finally, I'd like to thank all the Kellogg employees around the world, their efforts are making a huge difference and none of this would be possible without them.
And now I'll open it up for questions."

I'll take the Cereal questions and the sales growth question. I'll hand ZBB over to Ron. There's no question that the additional investments made in our sales organizations part of our Project K reinvestments absolutely helped the performance of our U.S. Cereal business. In addition, our U.S. Cereal business has been helped by some of the great food improvements we've made such as Special K Red Berries, some of the outstanding brand building programs we had such as the Raisin brand program out there. But in-store execution this year has been significantly better than in the past. And I think the U.S. sales reps, the U.S. sales team has done a tremendous job of improving the in-store execution in driving the performance of that business. Because of those changes, because of the momentum we're seeing in the U.S. Cereal business, we actually are quite optimistic about 2016. I think if you asked me back on the third quarter conference call our expectations for U.S. Cereal, we would've defined flat sales in 2016 a success. Given the strength of U.S. Cereal across 2015, we'd actually expect our U.S. Cereal business to grow slightly, 2% in 2016. The Morning Foods business obviously includes more things than just U.S. Cereal, there is a Pop-Tarts business in there, which is also doing well and Health and Wellness business. But in aggregate, I'd say that total business, we expect to be up slightly in 2016."

And remember, we're targeting over $2 billion worth of discretionary spend in North America for the start of the program. And the areas that we're targeting are in general administrative overhead, distribution costs, brand building and supply chain overhead as well. As we said, we still expect to see $100 million in 2016, but what I would point out is that's not a ceiling in terms of our savings, okay. We -- this is a multiyear program, and we obviously believe that there are more opportunities for savings and then we're implementing a process to make sure that we can sustain those savings. We are reinvesting some of those savings back into our business. For example, we're refining money and brand building. We're taking some opportunity to reinvest back in the brand building for revenue growth. And as we've talked all along, we're investing money back into our Food as well. Our international regions are underway. So we have started the work in all of our international regions at this point in time, kicked off the process, dissecting our spend, identifying the opportunities as well. Some specific areas or learnings in terms of where we're seeing savings. So we've looked to cost of goods sold. For example, we've identified opportunities in our transportation and warehousing costs. We've done a deep dive in professional and contracted services and balanced some money there. And on people-related costs, things like travel, relocation, things of that nature, we've implemented policy changes to impact and benefit our cost structure. As I mentioned, we are finding some money in brand building as well around media, nonworking media as well as TV media. But again, we're investing some of that back into the business to drive revenue growth. So overall project is progressing well, remains on track."

We've talked a lot in the context of our Cereal business, about Special K. But Special K has also had a fundamental impact to our Snacks business. We've had a headwind from Special K in Snacks over the last couple of years. You've seen this come through in our cracker business with Special K Cracker Chips has come through and our wholesome Snacks business with Special K bars. The good news is where we have renovated those foods similar to what we've done in Cereal, we're seeing the business to stabilize, and so Special K Cracker Chips is stabilizing. And Special K chewy nut bars actually are doing quite well in the wholesome Snacks business. So if you look at that, that headwind is still there to a degree, but to a much less degree. And as we go forward, we expect some of the tailwinds in the business to become more evident. So we've had strong growth in Cheez-It over the last several years. We're seeing good growth in Pringles. We're seeing good growth in Rice Krispies treats and wholesome snacks. Our cookie business is stable in the last couple of quarters. So we've actually seen better trends within the business. So as we go forward into 2016, we expect to return this business to top line growth, although modest, and we absolutely expect to return the business to bottom line growth. So we recognize it has been an area of weakness for us. Deanie and the team have taken actions to address it, and we feel much good about our 2016 outlook. And you're actually seeing it in the consumption data even in 2015. And that the consumption in the fourth quarter for 2015 was stronger than the prior parts of the year, and we're seeing sequential improvement as we go through the year."

We also have our base productivity improvements, Project K. And we've said Project K, that $100 million, about 75% to 80% of that runs through cost of goods sold. On the zero-based budgeting savings that we quoted, a little less than half of that is coming through cost of goods sold. Remember, Jason, we've said all along that we were going to invest in our food. And we've done that in 2015, and we're doing it in 2016. Renovating our Foods and launching granolas and mueslis based on consumer trends that we're seeing. That investment in food remains at about a 50-basis-point headwind in relation to our gross margin performance. The other thing that we have impacting us in 2016 is some transactional currency exposure. So we had good hedges in 2015. Some of those are rolling off, and what we're seeing is some headwind particularly around the Canadian dollar and the peso, but also some of the other international currencies as they weaken versus the U.S. dollar. And we're seeing about a 40-basis-point headwind in relation to transactional currency exposure. So all up slight net deflation and some gross margin expansion in 2016."

Some of our foods though are not as on trend as they need to be, we've been renovating some of that food with Special K chewy nut bar. We have work on Nutri-Grain and new Nutri-Grain bars coming up. So we believe we have strong brands. Our wholesome snacks business is more about ensuring all of our foods that are on trend. There's work that's being done there. We've done that work. We've seen better results, and there's still more to do. But if you look at that Snack business in totality, we have other large businesses in there beyond just the Cereal bar side, including Crackers where we have a strongly advantage footprint, particularly with Cheez-It, where we're seeing strong growth. We have Pringles. And for Pringles around the world we're seeing double-digit growth in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and low single-digit growth in North America. We believe we have an opportunity to drive much more growth around Pringles in North America as we go into 2016, and that will help our U.S. Snacks results. We have great areas of strengths within cookies as well. So as you think about our Snacks business, yes, there's some challenges in wholesome snacks. I think the answer to that is renovate, improve the food, continue to have strong brands, continue to execute in-store, but it's really a food discussion. I think we're making progress there and then we have other sources of growth within that Snacks business that's why we have confidence we'll get that business back to growth in 2016."

We did just that in 2015, and we were able to offset the cash requirements for Project K based on the improvements we saw in our core working capital.

So as we look at your guidance and I heard your comments about revenues. You're basically -- I guess, my interpretation of it is to the extent that it has that sort of impact on revenues, you're still looking at your 1% to 3% as if kind of normal, so if Venezuela contributes significantly more, there could potentially be upside to revenues. Would that saying hold true for operating income as well to the extent that it has the potential to deliver this type of impact on the growth to operating income, would you be looking at operating income the same way in terms of the effect of what a normal growth would be?

First, as we've said in the prepared remarks, Venezuela was always included in our sales guidance back in August as we gave the original guidance. We alw",335,"Sure, Bryan. Good question. And let me just kind of run through on how Venezuela is impacting things. First, as we've said in the prepared remarks, Venezuela was always included in our sales guidance back in August as we gave the original guidance. We always expected about a point of contribution from Venezuela to our sales performance. It's hard to predict and it's gotten even harder as inflation increased dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2015. And based on our projections, that could continue as we move through 2016 as well. And that's why we said we could see sales growth exceed the 1% to 3% range as a result of pricing actions we'll take in Venezuela to offset inflation and make sure that our business stays profitable. So we said excluding Venezuela, we still expect to be in that 1% to 3% range on sales. And also on operating profit and earnings per share excluding Venezuela, we expect to be in the ranges that we communicated. Okay? Now remember, we're pricing to offset inflation. So it's possible that could throw off more profit, but it remains to be seen. There are margin controls within Venezuela. Some may have the question as well. ""So why haven't we deconsolidated Venezuela?"" And let me just put that out there. In terms of Venezuela we operate in the preferred industry food within the country, and most of our inputs are locally sourced. Remember, generally accepted accounting principles, one of the key criteria for deconsolidating is exchangeability of currency. We've been able to exchange bolivar for U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2015 and also here in January of 2016. We have control over our business. As I said, we're profitable in local currency as well. We remeasured to the SIMADI rate in 2015, so it has become a smaller portion of our business as a result of that. We continue to monitor and manage the business, and our team there is doing a superb job at that."

So thank you, Simon, and welcome, John. 
Turning to the business. We are pleased to report a good start to the year with operating profit and earnings exceeding our expectations in the first quarter. The earlier pricing actions in Venezuela certainly gave our results boost, but even excluding Venezuela, our profit came in better than anticipated. Net sales, excluding Venezuela came in slightly below our expectations but even where we came up short, we can point to specific factors that we don't consider to be ongoing. For example, first, in U.S. Snacks, we underwent a major reorganization about DSD sales force, changing thousands of employees roles, managers, zones and customers and this impacted a display activity in Q1 and into Q2. It was the right thing to do and when everyone settles into their new roles, we should see improved selling and merchandising effectiveness. 
Second, in the European Cereal, sales were soft in Q1. We think this is a consequence of timing investment our innovation came in mid-May through the quarter and we have our big events such as tie-ins with Euro Soccer and Olympics coming in the summer. And finally, in businesses like Eggo and [indiscernible] farms, we made portfolio changes and transitions that weighed down short-term results thus should lead to better performance as the year goes on. Like I said, these are all factors that should proved to be temporary and we expect to see gradual improvement as the year progresses. 
Q1 features some very tangible signs of progress and clear evidence of sustainable improvement and results. Our U.S. Cereal business continued to gain share reflecting the benefits of investing in our food and Kellog sales reps. Our Victory U.S. Cracker brands collectively grew sales, consumption and share. We generated growth in our Pringles brand in all 4 regions reflecting our expansion of that brand's portfolio and presence around the world. Our business in Asia grew comparable net sales at high single-digit rate, reflecting our commitment to emerging markets. And our joint ventures, they're not consolidated in a net sales results, also provided excellent emerging markets growth. Meanwhile, Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives, in conjunction with our underlying productivity initiatives, delivered strong efficiencies that contributed to our higher operating profit margin. 
So there's a lot of be encouraged about in Q1. Let's talk briefly about where these leaves us for the full year. While we get into the specifics of our guidance in a moment, here's how I would summarize the outlook at currency-neutral comparable basis. Our outlook for operating profit and earnings per share, excluding Venezuela has not changed. We are on track. Including Venezuela, our outlook actually improved the sales, profit and earnings owing to an early impact from inflationary pricing actions. We'll see a little more of our net sales growth coming from Venezuela due to pricing and other less from the rest of the business, which we now believe will finish the year with 0 to 2% net sales growth, excluding Venezuela. But remember, as a short-term factors I mentioned earlier get behind us, we continue to expect to build momentum as we go through the year. And with that, let me turn it to Ron for more details on the financials."
283356,330901427,973733,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning.

First quarter currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 6.6%. Like last quarter, these results included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales, excluding the impact of Venezuela, declined by 1%. First quarter currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased by 34.9%, also including the impact of Venezuela price. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit, excluding the impact of Venezuela, increased nearly 2% and exceeded our expectations. Reported operating profit for the first quarter was $438 million, including the impact of mark-to-market accounting, Project K upfront costs and the currency remeasurement to the Venezuelan business. You will see more detail regarding items affecting comparability in the appendices to this presentation. 
Comparable earnings were $0.97 per share in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations due to operating profit performance. This included $0.36 of currency headwind, $0.34 of which was due to the mid-2015 currency remeasurement in Venezuela. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $1.33 per share, which represented the year-over-year increase of 36% and which was above our original expectations. It's worth noting that the currency remeasurement of the Venezuelan business occurred at the end of the second quarter 2015. So this large year-on-year impact from currencies will continue to the second quarter of this year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 in the drivers of the first quarter sales. Volume declined slightly in the quarter, including a few factors that are temporary, as John mentioned. This included sales force transition in the U.S. Snacks, trade inventory reductions in markets like Mexico and product cost and transitions in U.S. Frozen Foods. These factors masked good volume growth in our U.S. Specialty Channels, our Asian Cereal business and our International Snack businesses led by Pringles. Price mix contributed 7.3% to sales growth, largely due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. Price mix, excluding the impact of Venezuela, declined slightly by 0.4%, largely a result of a difficult economic environment in Europe. And finally, you can see on the chart that the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by almost 12% in the quarter, with 10 points to that impact coming from Venezuela. 
Slide 6 shows the currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin for the quarter. Currency-neutral comparable gross margin increased by 210 basis points in the first quarter, including the impact of significant and earlier pricing actions to cover inflation in our Venezuela business. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, our gross margin decreased by 20 basis points reflecting the investments we're making in our food and packaging around the world, as well as some headwinds from transactional currencies. We also experienced the impact of some category and channel mix in the quarter, but we should see this reverse a bit as our sales trends improve in certain categories and markets as the year progresses. 
We still expect the gross margin, excluding Venezuela, will improve for the full year as we experienced positive contributions from Project K, our zero-based budgeting initiative and net deflation and input costs. 
Slide 7 shows the regional operating profit performance for the first quarter. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit in North America increased by 8%. This was due to gross margin growth and lower SG&A driven by Project K savings, zero-based budgeting initiative and lower net input cost. 
In Europe, first quarter operating profit increased by 1%, building on difficult comparisons last year. This year's performance was the result of the timing of a brand investment to support commercial programs and innovation, which was partially offset by the lower impact of sales, where we're also lapping difficult comparisons in Latin America, although operating profit increased by 329% due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, operating profit decreased by 27% due to the impact of lower volume, driven by trade inventory reductions, as well as inflation we saw in cost of goods sold. Asia Pacific's operating profit decreased by 6% in the quarter and this included increased levels of investment and capabilities to support growth, as well as transactional currency impacts. It's important to note that our Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives remain on track. 
In North America business realized savings from zero-based budgeting in line with our plan and our international regions are making good progress, assessing their spending and developing their goals for late 2016 and beyond. 
Slide 8 details cash flow for the first quarter. Our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer completed during the quarter. This lower cash flow by approximately $145 million, although it's important to note that we get a cash tax benefit in the second quarter so the net cash impact of the tender will be around $95 million. Even with the impact of the bond tender, we are still on track to deliver the $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital expenditures that we targeted initially. 
And finally, our Board recently approved a 4% increase in the dividend, which will bring our payout ratio slightly above 50% and we remain committed to returning cash to our share owners. 
Slide 9 shows our low levels of working capital as a percentage of net sales. And as you can see, we reached 5.6% in the first quarter. This improvement was again driven by the Accounts Payable initiative that has been benefiting our working capital over the last year. And importantly, we have plans to improve this metric further in the periods to come. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10 and our full year earnings per share walk. As you can see, there is no change in our comparable earnings per share, which remains a range of $3.64 to $3.71. What has changed is our currency-neutral comparable earnings per share, which increases to $4 to $4.07 per share, a year-on-year growth rate of 13% to 15%. And this is because of the impact of earlier pricing actions in Venezuela. In this slide, this is depicted in the walk from currency neutral to comparable, was Venezuela currency impact going to $0.30 per share from a previous estimate of $0.04 per share. Obviously, Venezuela is a volatile market so this estimate could change. But as a reminder, our guidance for comparable earnings per share remains unchanged at $3.64 to $3.71. 
Pretax upfront costs remain consistent with our original guidance of between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share, about half of which should be in cost of goods sold. And full year integration cost are still anticipated to be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share. 
Slide 11 adds net sales and operating profit showing everything on a currency-neutral comparable basis and giving you a sense of what our outlook looks like with and without Venezuela. On this basis, including Venezuela, our guidance for net sales and operating profit just like our earnings per share moves higher. Specifically currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth goes to 11% to 13% from our previous estimate of 4% to 6%. And the currency-neutral comparable net sales growth goes to 4% to 6% from our previous estimate of 1% to 3%. The makeup of our net sales outlook changes with more growth coming from Venezuela and a little less than from the rest of the business. We are toning down our outlook on said Venezuela because of some of the first half factors that we've already mentioned such as the sales force transition and snacks, product transition and frozen foods end market conditions in Europe and Latin America. The good news is that we still expect the business to build momentum throughout the year, but the result of a trend down first half sales growth estimate is that we now expect full year comparable sales growth, excluding Venezuela to be more like 0% to 2% instead of 1% to 3%. 
Looking into other assumptions, we continue to expect improved gross margin for the year. We expected input cost will be net deflationary and the savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting will contribute to the margin improvement. As was the case previously, our margin guidance excludes the impact of Venezuela given the inflation-driven pricing and crisis there and volatility on the market. Incremental savings from Project K are still expected to be approximately $100 million for the full year, approximately 75% to 80% of which will come in cost of goods sold. Savings through zero-based budgeting are still expected to be roughly $100 million, spread between cost of goods sold, brand building and overhead. Comparable interest expense should be in the range between $235 million and $245 million comparable tax rates should be between 27% and 28% and we still expect to repurchase approximately 700 million to 750 million of shares in 2016. So no changes here. And we continue to expect that full year operating cash will be approximately $1.1 billion. Full year capital spending will be in the range between 4% and 5% of sales, including the investments we're making in Pringles growth and Project K. Remember, we said in the fourth quarter call that our comparable earnings per share delivery would be spread relatively evenly across the quarters. This is changing as we delivered slightly higher earnings per share in the first quarter than we anticipated and this will likely come out in Q2, partially due to the timing of investors. And now, I'll turn it over to Paul for more detail regarding the North America operating segments."

Good morning, everyone. Slide 13 is 1 I showed you at CAGNY earlier this year. As I mentioned then, our priority in North America is to return the business to profitable growth, and there are 3 key drivers of this transformation. We will accelerate the momentum behind advantage brands in Cereal, Snacks and Frozen. We will transform the Veggie business and unlock the full potential of the Kashi company; and we will expand margins while investing to grow, driven by our Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives. As you'll hear in the next 3 minutes, we're making progress in all of these areas. Some may take longer to achieve than others, but we are confident we're on the right track that we'll see continued improvements. 
Now let's start with the Slide 14 in the U.S. Morning Foods business. Overall, we are pleased with the results in the first quarter and we remain on track with our plan to return to growth in 2016. Our core 6 Cereal brands, in combination drove another quarter of share growth. Special K, Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes and Mini-Wheats, all gained or maintained share in the quarter, and Special K led the way with good performance resulting from our redesigned messaging, product renovation and innovation. And as you know, we recently launched new Special K Nourish in the U.S.. It's early, but we're encouraged by the initial acceptance. I'll See You At Breakfast promotion in January and the Give A Child a Breakfast promotion in March both performed very well. We did see some volatility in consumption in the Cereal category during the quarter and an impact from the timing of the Easter at the end of the quarter. But if you look at more recent weeks data, the categories picked up again and is clearly better than it has been in recent years. We have confidence that our business will continue to improve in the coming quarters. Our share performance reflects the actions we took last year and we've got more activity planned for the remainder of the year. In Q2, this includes 2 new Raisin Bran Granolas and a Pixar's Finding Dory-themed cereal and promotion, time to coincide with the launch of the movie here in June. We also have our Olympic-themed activity coming up in Q3 and also coincides with the timing of our big back-to-school promotion. 
Turning to Pop Tarts briefly, it's worth mentioning that the business posted a mid-single digit increase in net sales and share gains in the quarter. As we look forward, we have great new products planned including Orange Crush and A&W Root Beer flavors. We expect growth to continue for the full year. In summary, the Morning Foods business makes significant progress and we'll continue to improve. We've identified the issues that we needed to address and we've taken action and we started to see the benefits. The work isn't over, but we're committed to continuing the progress we've made so far over the balance of 2016 and 2017. 
Turning to U.S. Snacks on Slide 15. Our net sales declined in Q1 was a little more than we planned, really because of 2 factors: First, we reorganized our sales force, creating a more clearly defined roles selling, merchandising and support. This is going to drive more effective selling and merchandising, but we did see some disruption in our sales and display activity as we transition thousands of employees to new roles, zones and customers. This was most visible in cookies and crackers and it continued into the month of April, but will be the behind us as we get through Q2. Second, our wholesome snacks business continued to decline in Q1. As we've discussed previously, this business remains our biggest challenge in Snacks, and we're still up against lost distribution particularly from some prior year's innovations that simply haven't stocked. As you know, it's absolutely critical to get the food and the brand positioning right in this category. The good news is the Rice Krispies Treats have been a strong performer and the share was up again in Q1 and that we have several on-trend innovations and renovations launching here in the back half for all of our big wholesome snacks brands, such as Special K Protein Trail Mix Buzz, a new Nutri-Grain Tompkins Spice Variety and a couple of Cocoa Krispies treats, one including M&Ms. This give us reason to believe we can stabilize this business as the year progresses. 
Now, in the meantime, let's not lose sight of what's working well in Snacks. Our big 3 brands and crackers, Cheez-It, Town House and Club, together posted good growth in net sales, consumption and share, all led by accelerated base consumption in the quarter. This is where we've invested, both in brand building and innovation and it continues to pay off. We feel very good about our plans for the rest of the year in crackers, including innovations like Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers and Club Snacks tax launching midyear. 
We also feel very good about our Pringles business. In Q1, it posted growth in net sales and consumption. In fact, we saw double-digit consumption gains through our core range aided by efforts to improve assortment on shelf and increased brand building support. We also had double-digit consumption growth in our on-the-go formats business. We have more brand investment and exciting promotional events coming, giving us confidence in an accelerating growth transfer this brand years ago. While cookies declined in Q1, it was probably the category most affected by our sales force reorganization. It was also held back by an investment plan that doesn't really get going until here in Q2. We are reinvesting in our core foods in the form of renovated products and packaging, new products and seasonal rotations. And importantly, we are returning to advertising behind key after several years out there. So the plans are in place for a better performance ahead. We still got work to do on snacks for sure, but we are starting to see signs of the return to growth we expect this year. Growth will accelerate in crackers and Pringles with more brand investment, a focus on assortment and format and exciting innovation coming here in the back half. We've got advertising coming on cookies with the key [indiscernible] returning. We'll get past these sales transition in Q2 and we've got much in the way of improved innovation. That should start coming on wholesome snacks later in the year to turn that business go forward. 
So now, let's turn to Slide 16 and highlights of the U.S. Specialty segment. Our Specialty Channels business posted good mid-single digit net sales growth in Q1 with, net sales growth in all channels and a balance between price realization and volume growth. Leading the way was double-digit growth in the convenience channel, which reached strong consumption and share growth in Cereal, Crackers, Rice Krispies Treats, Pop-Tarts and Salty[ph] Snacks. Foodservice also recorded good sales growth led by Cereal, wholesome snacks, Pop-Tarts, Cookies and Salty Snacks. We also saw a distribution gains in bending in various categories and we have a strong Girl Scout cookie season. 
Slide 17 shows the North American Others segment, which includes the U.S. frozen foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. Net sales for the segment were down, but we're making good progress in each of the businesses. In Frozen Foods, our Eggo business was down because of last year's SKU rationalization and a shift in the timing of innovation this year to Q2 from Q1. But excluding the cold SKUs, Eggo grew consumption in Q1. Similarly, our MorningStar farms business felt the impact of resetting the shelf with our new resealable packaging. From where we have converted to the new packaging, we are seeing positive results and this conversion is now largely behind us. Frozen Foods will see better performance as we get past these codes and these resets and as we see the benefits of advertising on Eggo and Morningstar Farms, a promotional tie-in with the movie Finding Dory and some great innovation launching right here in the month of May. While star Kashi business posted lower sales year-on-year in Q1, we did see sequential improvement led by Cereal where we maintain share overall and gained share in the natural food channel. In addition to our renovation efforts, we've got great new products rolling out soon, including new Kashi and Bear Naked cereals, new gluten-free crackers and some great Savory granola bars. In addition, we're introducing here in May, the plant-based protein powders we showed you at CAGNY a couple of months ago. All this means that we expect continued improvement as we progress through the year. 
And finally, in Canada, we saw good performance by both Cereal and Snacks. Cereal posted gains in net gain sales consumption and share led by core brands and the continued recovery of Special K, which grew 6% and gain 40 basis points of share. 
So let's turn to Slide 18 and the summary. Hopefully, you have a sense to the progress we are making on our priorities. We're continuing to gain share in the U.S. and our core 6 brands are performing well. Our core snacking brands, including our big 3 crackers and Pringles, are gaining momentum. The Frozen Foods business is poised to return to growth on the strength of innovation. Kashi performance continues to improve as we get the food right and new products arrive in the market. Significant savings from project K and ZBB are driving strong gross margin and operating profit growth. I'm confident we've taken the right actions across the regions to invest, drive growth and increase margins. So finally, I'd like to thank all the members of the North American team for their hard work. We're making great progress together. Now, I'll turn it back to John."
283356,330901427,973733,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Paul. Now let's turn to Slide 19 in our European business, where sales declined slightly in the quarter. However, we did see some pockets of growth, particularly in the Pringles and wholesome snack businesses. The Pringles business in the region p",1118,"Thanks, Paul. Now let's turn to Slide 19 in our European business, where sales declined slightly in the quarter. However, we did see some pockets of growth, particularly in the Pringles and wholesome snack businesses. The Pringles business in the region posted high single-digit growth in the quarter. This was led by a sustained momentum in key markets and expansion of Pringles to a tier into new markets. Pringles process from share performance in the region with share gains most pronounced in the U.K. and Germany. The wholesome snacks business also posted high single-digit sales growth led by continued good performance in the U.K. it, in Russia and in the Mediterranean Middle Eastern the region. Great food and the business had responded. However, our Cereal sales remain soft, particularly in the U.K. and France. Much of this is due to the timing of investment. As I mentioned earlier, our innovation launches later in the quarter, and we had promotions tied to the Euro Soccer Tournament and the Olympics planned for the summer. Over the balance of the year, we're investing in our food, specifically, we have new innovation including Ancient Legends and Special K Nourish, which is similar to the product we recently launched in the U.S. And we'll continue to work on the underlying fundamentals, including focusing on increasing our distribution and also our channels. We also have a plan that has more supporting Q2 you and the second half than Q1. We expect a slight increase in that sales in the coming quarters on sustained growth and also Snacks and an sequential improvement in cereal as a brand building investment because the pickup in support of innovation and promotions. We also should see continued expansion of our Pringles business. 
Slide 20 highlights performance of our Latin America business in the first quarter. As was the case for much of last year, the impact of pricing and inflationary in Venezuela threw a double-digit currency neutral comparable net sales growth in the period. We continue to manage the Venezuelan business very carefully, navigating local supply and power outages. Despite this, we gained share in Venezuela in the quarter. Excluding the Venezuelan business, sales and region declined by 2% in the quarter driven by Cereal and softness in 2 markets. In Mexico, where we compared against strong year ago growth, we saw a reduction in trade inventories and the timing of promotional investment and these factors cool down the net sales. However, our consumption in Mexico increased and we gained share across our Cereal and Snacks categories driven by strong innovation and commercial activation. 
In the Americas region, we felt the impact of economic softness in trade inventory reductions in Brazil, especially where we lapped difficult year ago to past. The good news is that amidst economic softness, we did increase our share that's Cereal category and Also snacks category in Brazil. So our consumption performance, I'd also like to point out consumption and share gains in Colombia, was better than it performance in Latin America. We launched new products late last year and in Q1 of this year, we are contributing to the consumption performance, specifically the launch of Special K protein, which I mentioned last quarter, has gone very well. Meanwhile, the region's Snacks business continue to perform well, posting mid-single digit sales growth with growth and expansion of markets like Mexico and the Andean and local regions. The Pringles brand good mid single-digit rate and we view that we have considerable upside in this plan. 
As we said on the Q4 call, the macroeconomic conditions in the region are challenging and we've seen some good results in many positive region, especially in our in-market performance with the share gains I mentioned. So we remain on plans to improve results x Venezuela as the year progresses. 
Let's look at Slide 21 in our Asia Pacific business. currency-neutral comparable sales growth for the region was approximately 1%, with the sales would have increased at a mid-single digit rate if the impact to the joint venture in China and Africa were included. In Asia, our sales increased at a high single-digit rate with strong growth in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Southeast Asia in Japan. We reinvested in the Pringles business and was new products both of which help to drive mid-single digit sales growth for the brand in the quarter. In Australia, sales decline in Q1 although we saw sequential improvement and year-to-date, through April, we've gained share in the Cereal category. We also innovation plan for introduction in Australia beginning in the second quarter. This, in combination with new support to contribute to the improving trend that we start to see. 
In summary, our plans for the overall business are exciting and we expect improving performance by the remainder of the year. Please turn to the summary on Slide 22. On last quarter's earnings call, I mentioned 4 reasons to believe that we are building momentum in 2016. First, we are investing in our food and packaging. We saw this in Q1. We saw Special K Nourish, driving improved performance in the U.S. and Canada. We've rolled out GMO-free cash products in the U.S. and new resealable packaging  [indiscernible] bonds. In Europe, we saw a good success in new Granola and Muesli offerings and we'll see more consumer-driven renovation and innovation as we go through the year. Second, we are expanding Pringles. This could be seen during Q1 with our growth across every region. This will continue to be an avenue of growth for us in the future. Third, we are enhancing our sales capabilities. We took action in Q1, as evidenced by our reorganization in U.S. Snacks, we continued progress with additional fleet on the Street in Morning Foods and expanding our presence in high-frequency stores in Latin America and Asia. Winning with the The Shopper Shops is a key strategic thing for us, which we'll see even more benefit from these capability, investments as the year progresses. And finally, increasing our earnings visibility by our Project K in CVB. This helped drive profitability already Q1 and behind the scenes, these initiatives are creating a cost discipline and spending behavior that can yield more savings and more earnings visibility going forward. So I'm happy to report that we are on track on all of these. I've also stated that we should see steady improvement in our performance as the year progresses. The plan is designed that way with bigger reinvestments ahead, savings as the year progresses and some hurdles coming early in the year and giving way to a better performance later in short remain momentum to build through the year. And now, on to questions."

We have Granola Bites coming from Bear Naked at the turn of the quarter as well in the third quarter and we have a brand new range which is shipping now Kashi Go Lean and Kashi-branded protein powders to lean into new segments with the brand. Of note, our Bear Naked Granola business is growing at a good mid-single to high-single digit so the granola business in Bear Naked does well. While more part of the Kashi companies stretched out in food snacks, a very small business we had talked a lot about, but that's growing at a strong double-digit rate as well and we've reinvented that food, made it to organic and investment back there as well.

And what should give us confidence that new innovation you're talking about for second quarter and -- why is that going to stabilize the business and maybe start there, for me."

In both cases, where we'll put on-trend food in the marketplace is, we've seen consumers respond to that very positively. We've seen these results come through in the U.S. results last year and into this year. Same is true in Canada and as I said in the prepared remarks, in Australia, we're also seeing significantly improved results through first quarter on the back of improved food that's more on trend by consumers are looking for. The same will be true in the U.K. So we have 4 large cereal markets, U.S, Canada, Australia and the U.K. The UK's one last with we believe again putting the right food in the marketplace for consumers is going to make the difference. The Ancient Legends food that we have at this more of a granola, great taste, visible nutrition type food as is the Special K Nourish food has been an important part of the Special K turnaround in the U.S. And in Special K, we had various renovation of the U.S. we're also have going into the U.K. market as well. A lot of those food changes though, that cut into the shelves and it may a part of Q1 so we do expect to see the business respond to that. I don't necessarily expect Europeans to get back to growth in this year, but in many respects, that 0 weakness in Europe is masking some very strong growth in other parts of the European business. So when you have Pringles, up high single-digits and wholesome snacks, up high single-digits. We clearly have the ability to execute if we have great food in the marketplace. We have great food behind Cereal. I have confidence we'll see a European top-line trends improve as we go through this year."

Beyond that as you lean towards the healthier, if you like, perceived elements of wholesome snack, we've already renovated many of our base Special K bars and since those renovations, they are doing better, we are now bringing Protein Trail Mix bars to Special K and then the 1 or 2 brands that really I think need to step up and step in here to broaden out our portfolio and our growth, they're actually coming from Kashi Bear Naked because they've really been absent over the last 2, 3 years. And therefore, we're renovating our core Kashi Granola Bars. We're bringing new to the world Savory bars on Kashi. We're bringing new granola bites from Bear Naked as we go into the end of the second quarter here. And you'll see more innovation coming on bars from Kashi and Bear Naked, and that what I would call lifestyle performance area for wholesome snacks. You have to look at the whole picture to think about how we innovate and renovate across every segment.

Turning to the business. We are pleased to report a good start to the year, with operating profit and earnings exceeding our expectations in the first quarter. The earlier pricing actions in Venezuela certainly gave our results boost, but even excluding Venezuela, our profit came in better than anticipated. Net sales, excluding Venezuela came in slightly below our expectations, but even where we came up short, we can point to specific factors that we don't consider to be ongoing. For example, first, in U.S. Snacks, we underwent a major reorganization about DSD sales force, changing thousands of employees' roles, managers, zones and customers. And this impacted our display activity in Q1 and into Q2. It was the right thing to do and when everyone settles into their new roles, we should see improved selling and merchandising effectiveness.
Second, in European Cereal, sales were soft in Q1. We think this is largely as the consequence of timing of investment. Our innovation came in midway through the quarter, and we have our big events such as tie-ins with Euro Soccer and Olympics coming in this summer. And finally, in businesses like Eggo and Morningstar Farms, we made portfolio changes and product transitions that weighed down short-term results that it should lead to better performance as the year goes on. Like I said, these are all factors that should proved to be temporary, and we expect to see gradual improvement as the year progresses.
Q1 features some very tangible signs of progress and clear evidence of sustainable improvement and results. Our U.S. Cereal business continued to gain share reflecting the benefits of investing in our food and Kellogg sales reps. Our Big Tree [ph]  U.S. Cracker brands collectively grew sales, consumption and share. We generated growth in our Pringles brand in all 4 regions, reflecting our expansion of that brand's portfolio and presence around the world. Our business in Asia grew currency-neutral comparable net sales at a high single-digit rate, reflecting our commitment to emerging markets. And our joint ventures, they're not consolidated in a net sales results, also provided excellent emerging markets growth. Meanwhile, Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives, in conjunction with our underlying productivity initiatives, delivered strong efficiencies that contributed to our higher operating profit margin.
So there's a lot of be encouraged about in Q1. Let's talk briefly about where these leaves us for the full year. While we get into the specifics of our guidance in a moment, here's how I would summarize the outlook at currency-neutral comparable basis. Our outlook for operating profit and earnings per share, excluding Venezuela has not changed. We are on track. Including Venezuela, our outlook actually improved the sales, profit and earnings owing to an early impact from inflationary pricing actions. We'll see a little more from the net sales growth coming from Venezuela due to the pricing and a little less from the rest of the business, which we now believe we'll finish the year with 0 to 2% net sales growth, excluding Venezuela. But remember, as the short-term factors I mentioned earlier get behind us, we continue to expect to build momentum as we go through the year. 
And with that, let me turn it to Ron for more details on the financials."
283356,330901427,974160,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning.

First quarter currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 6.6%. Like last quarter, these results included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales, excluding the impact of Venezuela, declined by 1%. First quarter currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased by 34.9%, also including the impact of Venezuela price. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit, excluding the impact of Venezuela, increased nearly 2% and exceeded our expectations. Reported operating profit for the first quarter was $438 million, including the impact of mark-to-market accounting, Project K upfront costs and the currency remeasurement to the Venezuelan business. You will see more detail regarding items affecting comparability in the appendices to this presentation.
Comparable earnings were $0.97 per share in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations due to operating profit performance. This included $0.36 of currency headwind, $0.34 of which was due to the mid-2015 currency remeasurement in Venezuela. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $1.33 per share, which represented a year-over-year increase of 36% and which was above our original expectations. It's worth noting that the currency remeasurement of the Venezuelan business occurred at the end of the second quarter 2015. So this large year-on-year impact from currencies will continue through the second quarter of this year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 in the drivers of the first quarter sales. Volume declined slightly in the quarter, including a few factors that are temporary, as John mentioned. This included a sales force transition in U.S. Snacks, trade inventory reductions in markets like Mexico and product cost and transitions in U.S. Frozen Foods. These factors masked good volume growth in our U.S. Specialty Channels, our Asian Cereal business and our International Snack businesses led by Pringles. Price mix contributed 7.3% to sales growth, largely due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. Price mix, excluding the impact of Venezuela, declined slightly by 0.4%, largely a result of a difficult economic environment in Europe. And finally, you can see on the chart that the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by almost 12% in the quarter, with 10 points of that impact coming from Venezuela.
Slide 6 shows the currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin for the quarter. Currency-neutral comparable gross margin increased by 210 basis points in the first quarter, including the impact of significant and earlier pricing actions to cover inflation in our Venezuela business. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, our gross margin decreased by 20 basis points, reflecting the investments we're making in our food and packaging around the world as well as some headwinds from transactional currencies. We also experienced the impact of some category and channel mix in the quarter, but we should see this reverse a bit as our sales trends improve in certain categories and markets as the year progresses.
We still expect the gross margin, excluding Venezuela, will improve for the full year as we experienced positive contributions from Project K, our zero-based budgeting initiative and net deflation and input costs.
Slide 7 shows the regional operating profit performance for the first quarter. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit in North America increased by 8%. This was due to gross margin growth and lower SG&A driven by Project K savings, the zero-based budgeting initiative and lower net input costs.
In Europe, first quarter operating profit increased by 1%, building on difficult comparisons last year. This year's performance was the result of the timing of brand investment to support commercial programs and innovation, which was partially offset by the lower impact of sales. We were also lapping difficult comparisons in Latin America, although operating profit increased by 329% due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, operating profit decreased by 27% due to the impact of lower volume, driven by trade inventory reductions as well as inflation we saw in cost of goods sold. Asia Pacific's operating profit decreased by 6% in the quarter, and this included increased levels of investment and capabilities to support growth as well as transactional currency impacts. It's important to note that our Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives remain on track.
North America business realized savings from zero-based budgeting, in line with our plan, and our international regions are making good progress, assessing their spending and developing their goals for late 2016 and beyond.
Slide 8 details cash flow for the first quarter. Our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer completed during the quarter. This lowered cash flow by approximately $145 million, although it's important to note that we get a cash tax benefit in the second quarter, so the net cash impact of the tender will be around $95 million. Even with the impact of the bond tender, we are still on track to deliver the $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital expenditures that we targeted initially.
And finally, our board recently approved a 4% increase in the dividend, which will bring our payout ratio slightly above 50%, and we remain committed to returning cash to our share owners.
Slide 9 shows our low levels of core working capital as a percentage of net sales. And as you can see, we reached 5.6% in the first quarter. This improvement was again driven by the accounts payable initiative that has been benefiting our working capital over the last year. And importantly, we have plans to improve this metric further in the periods to come.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 and our full year earnings per share walk. As you can see, there is no change in our comparable earnings per share, which remains in range of $3.64 to $3.71. What has changed is our currency-neutral comparable earnings per share, which increases to $4 to $4.07 per share, a year-on-year growth rate of 13% to 15%. And this is because of the impact of earlier pricing actions in Venezuela. In this slide, this is depicted in the walk from currency neutral to comparable, with Venezuela's currency impact going to $0.30 per share from a previous estimate of $0.04 per share. Obviously, Venezuela is a volatile market so this estimate could change. But as a reminder, our guidance for comparable earnings per share remains unchanged at $3.64 to $3.71.
Pretax upfront costs remain consistent with our original guidance of between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share, about half of which should be in cost of goods sold. And full year integration costs are still anticipated to be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share.
Slide 11 adds net sales and operating profit showing everything on a currency-neutral comparable basis and giving you a sense of what our outlook looks like with and without Venezuela. On this basis, including Venezuela, our guidance for net sales and operating profit just like our earnings per share moves higher. Specifically currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth goes to 11% to 13% from our previous estimate of 4% to 6%. And currency-neutral comparable net sales growth goes to 4% to 6% from our previous estimate of 1% to 3%. The makeup of our net sales outlook changes with more growth coming from Venezuela and a little less from the rest of the business. We are toning down our outlook outside Venezuela because of some of the first half factors that we've already mentioned, such as the sales force transition in Snacks, product transitions in Frozen Foods and market conditions in Europe and Latin America. The good news is that we still expect the business to build momentum throughout the year, but the result of a trimmed down first half sales growth estimate is that we now expect full year comparable sales growth, excluding Venezuela, to be more like 0% to 2% instead of 1% to 3%.
Looking into other assumptions. We continue to expect improved gross margin for the year. We expect that input cost will be net deflationary, and the savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting will contribute to the margin improvement. As was the case previously, our margin guidance excludes the impact of Venezuela, given the inflation-driven pricing increases there and volatility in the market. Incremental savings from Project K are still expected to be approximately $100 million for the full year, approximately 75% to 80% of which will come in cost of goods sold. Savings through zero-based budgeting are still expected to be roughly $100 million, spread between cost of goods sold, brand building and overhead. Comparable interest expense should be in a range between $235 million and $245 million, comparable tax rate should be between 27% and 28% and we still expect to repurchase approximately 700 million to 750 million of shares in 2016. So no changes here. And we continue to expect that full year operating cash will be approximately $1.1 billion. Full year capital spending will be in the range between 4% and 5% of sales, including the investments we're making in Pringles growth and Project K. Remember, we said on the fourth quarter call that our comparable earnings per share delivery would be spread relatively evenly across the quarters. This is changing as we delivered slightly higher earnings per share in the first quarter than we anticipate, and this will likely come out in Q2, partially due to the timing of investments. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Paul for more detail regarding the North America operating segments."

Good morning, everyone. Slide 13 is one I showed you at CAGNY earlier this year. As I mentioned then, our priority in North America is to return the business to profitable growth, and there are 3 key drivers of this transformation. We will accelerate the momentum behind advantage brands in Cereal, Snacks and Frozen; we will transform the Veggie business, and unlock the full potential of the Kashi Company; and we will expand margins while investing to grow, driven by our Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives. As you'll hear over the next few minutes, we're making progress in all of these areas. Some may take longer to achieve than others, but we are confident we're on the right track that we'll see continued improvement.
Now let's start with Slide 14 in the U.S. Morning Foods business. Overall, we are pleased with the results in the first quarter, and we remain on track with our plan to return to growth in 2016. Our core 6 Cereal brands, in combination, drove another quarter of share growth. Special K, Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes and Mini-Wheats, all gained or maintained share in the quarter. And Special K led the way with good performance resulting from our redesigned messaging, product renovation and innovation. And as you know, we recently launched new Special K Nourish in the U.S. It's early, but we're encouraged by the initial acceptance. See You At Breakfast promotion in January and Give A Child a Breakfast promotion in March, both performed very well. We did see some volatility in consumption in the Cereal category during the quarter and an impact from the timing of Easter at the end of the quarter. But if you look at more recent weeks data, the categories picked up again and is clearly better than it has been in recent years. We have confidence that our business will continue to improve in the coming quarters. Our share performance reflects the actions we took last year, and we've got more activity planned for the remainder of the year. In Q2, this includes 2 new Raisin Bran granolas at a Pixar's Finding Dory-themed cereal and promotion, timed to coincide with the launch of the movie here in June. We also have our Olympic-themed activity coming in Q3 that also coincides with the timing of our big Back to School promotion.
Turning to Pop Tarts briefly, it's worth mentioning that the business posted a mid-single-digit increase in net sales and share gains in the quarter. As we look forward, we have great new products planned, including Orange Crush and A&W Root Beer flavors. We expect growth to continue for the full year. In summary, the Morning Foods business has made significant progress, and we'll continue to improve. We've identified the issues that we needed to address, we've taken action and we started to see the benefits. The work isn't over, but we're committed to continuing the progress we've made so far over the balance of 2016 and 2017.
Turning to U.S. Snacks on Slide 15. Our net sales declined in Q1 was a little more than we planned, really because of 2 factors. First, we reorganized our sales force, creating a more clearly defined roles for selling, merchandising and support. This is going to drive more effective selling and merchandising, but we did see some disruption in our sales and display activity, as we transitioned thousands of employees to new roles, zones and customers. This was most visible in cookies and crackers, and it continued into the month of April, but will be behind us as we get through Q2. Second, our wholesome snacks business continued to decline in Q1. As we've discussed previously, this business remains our biggest challenge in Snacks, and we're still up against lost distribution, particularly from some prior year's innovations that simply haven't stuck. As you know, it's absolutely critical to get the food and the brand positioning right in this category. The good news is the Rice Krispies Treats have been a strong performer, and it's share was up again in Q1. And that we have several on-trend innovations and renovations launching here in the back half for all of our big wholesome snacks brands, such as Special K Protein Trail Mix Bars, a new Nutri-Grain Pumpkin Spice Variety and a couple of Cocoa Krispies treats, one including M&Ms. These give us reason to believe we can stabilize this business as the year progresses.
Now, in the meantime, let's not lose sight of what's working well in Snacks. Our big 3 brands in crackers, Cheez-It, Town House and Club, together posted good growth in net sales, consumption and share, all led by accelerated base consumption in the quarter. This is where we've invested, both in brand building and innovation and it continues to pay off. We feel very good about our plans for the rest of the year in crackers, including innovations like Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers and Club Snacks Packs launching midyear.
We also feel very good about our Pringles business. In Q1, it posted growth in net sales and consumption. In fact, we saw double-digit consumption gains through our core range aided by efforts to improve assortment on shelf and increased brand building support. We also had double-digit consumption growth in our on-the-go formats business. We have more brand investment and exciting promotional events coming, giving us confidence in an accelerating growth transfer for this brand here to go. While cookies declined in Q1, it was probably the category most affected by our sales force reorganization. It was also held back by an investment plan that doesn't really get going until here in Q2. We are reinvesting in our core foods in the form of renovated products and packaging, new products and seasonal rotations. And importantly, we are returning to advertising behind Keebler [ph]  After several years out there. So the plans are in place for a better performance ahead. We still got work to do on snacks for sure, but we are starting to see signs of the return to growth we expect this year. Growth will accelerate in crackers and Pringles with more brand investment, a focus on assortment and formats and exciting innovation coming here in the back half. We've got advertising coming on cookies with the Keebler [ph] returning. We'll get past this sales transition in Q2, and we've got much in the way of improved innovation. That should start coming on wholesome snacks later in the year to turn that business as we go forward.
So now let's turn to Slide 16 and the highlights of the U.S. Specialty segment. Our Specialty Channels business posted good mid-single-digit net sales growth in Q1, with net sales growth in all channels and a balance between price realization and volume growth. Leading the way was double-digit growth in the convenience channel, which reached strong consumption and share growth in cereal, crackers, Rice Krispies Treats, Pop-Tarts and salty snacks. Foodservice also recorded good sales growth led by cereal, wholesome snacks, Pop-Tarts, cookies and salty snacks. We also saw distribution gains in bending in various categories and we had a strong Girl Scouts cookie season. 
Slide 17 shows the North American Other segment, which includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, kashi and Canadian businesses. Net sales for the segment were down, but we're making good progress in each of the businesses. In Frozen Foods, our Eggo business was down because of last year's SKU rationalization and a shift in the timing of innovation this year to Q2 from Q1. But excluding the cold SKUs, Eggo grew consumption in Q1. Similarly, our Morningstar Farms business felt the impact of resetting the shelf with our new resealable packages. From where we have converted to the new packaging, we are seeing positive results, and this conversion is now largely behind us. Frozen Foods will see better performance as we get past these codes and resets and as we see the benefits of advertising on Eggo and Morningstar Farms, a promotional tie-in with the movie Finding Dory and some great innovation launching right here in the month of May. Whilst our Kashi business posted lower sales year-on-year in Q1, we did see sequential improvement led by Cereal where we maintained share overall and gained share in the natural food channel. In addition to our renovation efforts, we've got great new products rolling out soon, including new Kashi and Bear Naked cereals, new gluten-free crackers and some great Savory granola bars. In addition, we're introducing here in May, the plant-based protein powders we showed you at CAGNY a couple of months ago. All of this means that we expect continued improvement as we progress through the year.
And finally, in Canada, we saw good performance by both Cereal and Snacks. Cereal posted gains in net sales, consumption and share led by core brands and the continued recovery of Special K, which grew 6% and gained 40 basis points of share.
So let's turn to Slide 18 and the summary. Hopefully, you have a sense to the progress we are making on our priorities. We're continuing to gain share in U.S. too, and our core 6 brands are performing well. Our core snacking brands, including our big 3 crackers and Pringles, are gaining momentum. The Frozen Foods business is poised to return to growth on the strength of innovation. Kashi performance continues to improve as we get the food right and new products arrive in the market. Significant savings from Project K and ZBB are driving strong gross margin and operating profit growth. I'm confident we've taken the right actions across the regions to invest, drive growth and increase margins. 
So finally, I'd like to thank all the members of the North American team for their hard work. We're making great progress together. 
Now I'll turn it back to John."

Now let's turn to Slide 19 in our European business, where sales declined slightly in the quarter. However, we did see some pockets of growth, particularly in the Pringles and wholesome snack businesses. The Pringles business in the region p",1119,"Thanks, Paul. Now let's turn to Slide 19 in our European business, where sales declined slightly in the quarter. However, we did see some pockets of growth, particularly in the Pringles and wholesome snack businesses. The Pringles business in the region posted high single-digit growth in the quarter. This was led by a sustained momentum in key markets and expansion of Pringles Tortillas into new markets. Pringles posted strong share performance in the region, with share gains most pronounced in the U.K. and Germany. The wholesome snacks business also posted high single-digit sales growth, led by continued good performance in the U.K., in Russia and in the Mediterranean Middle Eastern region. You want some great food, and the business has responded. However, our cereal sales remained soft, particularly in the U.K. and France. Much of this is due to the timing of investment. As I mentioned earlier, our innovation launched later in the quarter, and we have promotions tied to the Euro Soccer Tournament and the Olympics planned for the summer. Over the balance of the year, we're investing in our food, specifically, we have new innovation, including Ancient Legends and Special K Nourish, which is similar to the product that recently launched in the U.S. And we will continue to work on the underlying fundamentals, including focusing on increasing our distribution in alternate channels. We also have a plan that has more supporting Q2 in the second half than in Q1. We expect a slight increase in net sales in the coming quarters on sustained growth in wholesome snacks and sequential improvement in Cereal as a brand building investment because of pickup in support of innovation and promotions. We also should see continued expansion of our Pringles business.
Slide 20 highlights performance of our Latin American business in the first quarter. As was the case the much of last year, the impact of pricing inflationary in Venezuela threw a double-digit currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in the period. We continued to manage the Venezuelan business very carefully, navigating local supply and power outages. Despite this, we gained share in Venezuela in the quarter. Excluding the Venezuelan business, sales in the region declined by 2% in the quarter, driven by Cereal and softness in 2 markets. In Mexico, where we compared against strong year-ago growth, we saw a reduction in trade inventories and the timing of promotional investment and these factors pulled down the net sales. However, our consumption in Mexico increased, and we gained share across our Cereal and Snacks categories, driven by strong innovation and commercial activation.
In the Mercosur region, we felt the impact of economic softness and trade inventory reductions in Brazil, especially where we lapped difficult year-ago comparisons. The good news is that amidst this economic softness, we did increase our share in the Cereal category and wholesome snacks category in Brazil. So our consumption performance -- and I'd also like to point out consumption and share gains in Colombia, was better than our shipment performance in Latin America. We launched new products late last year and in Q1 of this year, which are contributing to the consumption performance, specifically the launch of Special K protein, which I mentioned last quarter, has gone very well. Meanwhile, the region's Snacks business continued to perform well, posting mid-single-digit sales growth, with growth and expansion of markets like Mexico and the Andean and Mercosur regions. The Pringles brand grew at a mid-single-digit rate and we believe that we considerable upside in this branch.
As we said on the Q4 call, the macroeconomic conditions in the region are challenging, and we've seen some good results in many positive region, especially in our in-market performance with the share gains I mentioned. So we remain on plans to improve results ex Venezuela as the year progresses. 
Let's look at Slide 21 in our Asia Pacific business. Currency-neutral comparable sales growth for the region was approximately 1%, where the sales would have increased at a mid-single-digit rate, if the impact to the joint ventures in China and Africa were included. In Asia, our sales increased at a high single-digit rate with strong growth in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Southeast Asia and Japan. We reinvested in the Pringles business and our new products, both of which helped to drive mid-single-digit sales growth for the brand in the quarter. In Australia, sales declined in Q1, although we saw sequential improvement. And year-to-date, through April, we've gained share in the Cereal category. We also have innovation plan for introduction in Australia beginning in the second quarter. This, in combination with new support to contribute to the improving trend that we'll start to see. 
In summary, our plans for the overall business are exciting, and we expect improving performance over the remainder of the year. 
Please turn to the summary on Slide 22. On last quarter's earnings call, I mentioned 4 reasons to believe that we are building momentum in 2016. 
First, we are investing in our food and packaging. We saw this in Q1, with cereals like Special K Nourish, driving improved performance in the U.S. and Canada. We rolled out GMO-free Kashi products in the U.S. and new resealable packaging in Morningstar Farms. in Europe, we saw good success in new granola and muesli offerings, and we'll see more consumer-driven renovation and innovation as we go through the year. 
Second, we are expanding Pringles. This could be seen during Q1 with our growth across every region. This will continue to be an avenue of growth for us in the future. 
Third, we are enhancing our sales capabilities. We took action in Q1 as evidenced by our reorganization in U.S. Snacks. We continued progress with additional feet on the street in Morning Foods and expanding our presence in high-frequency stores in Latin America and Asia. Win Where The Shopper Shops is a key strategic goal for us, which we'll see even more benefit from these capability investments as the year progresses. 
And finally, increasing our earnings visibility by Project K and ZBB. This helped drive profitability already in Q1 and behind the scenes, these initiatives are creating a cost discipline and spending behavior that can yield more savings and more earnings visibility going forward. So I'm happy to report that we are on track on all of these. I've also stated that we should see steady improvement in our performance as the year progresses. The plan is designed that way with bigger reinvestments ahead, savings [indiscernible] as the year progresses and some hurdles coming early in the year and giving way to better performance later. In short, we'll stay momentum to build through the year. And now, I'll open it up for questions."

We're actually growing the business now in the natural channel, and the team has been really working hard at building a pipeline of ideas to get back ahead in terms of a food-focused mission-based operation. So we have new Kashi and Bear Naked cereals launching here now. We have Savory granola bars launching at the end of the second quarter. We have some culturally inspired crackers that I spoke about before. We have granola bites coming from Bear Naked at the turn of the quarter as well in the third quarter. And we have a brand new range which is shipping now of Kashi GOLEAN and Kashi-branded protein powders to lean into new segments with the brand. Of note, our Bear Naked Granola business is growing at a good mid-single to high single digit. So the granola business in Bear Naked does well. While more part of the Kashi companies stretched out in food snacks, a very small business we had talked a lot about, but that's growing at a strong double-digit rate as well and we've reinvented that food, made it all organic and investment back in the food there as well. So there's been a lot of reinvestment in food to renovate. And now, a lot of innovation about to come, which gives us the confidence we're going to get this business back to growth over the coming months in '16 and into '17."

In both cases, where we put on-trend food in the marketplace, we've seen consumers respond to that very positively. We've seen that these results come through in the U.S. results last year and into this year. Same is true in Canada. And as I said in the prepared remarks, in Australia, we're also seeing significantly improved results through first quarter on the back of improved food that's more on trend for what consumers are looking for. The same will be true in the U.K. So we have 4 large cereal markets, U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. The UK is the last one for us to turn that we believe, again, putting the right food in the marketplace for consumers is going to make the difference. The Ancient Legends food that we had at U.K. is more of a granola, great taste, visible nutrition type food as is the Special K Nourish food that's being an important part of the Special K turnaround in the U.S. And in Special K, we had various renovations in the U.S. We're also have going into the U.K. market as well. A lot of those food changes though got cut into the shelf in the later part of Q1. So we do expect to see the business respond to that. I don't necessarily expect to see the European Cereal to get back to growth in this year, but in many respects, that cereal weakness in Europe is masking some very strong growth in other parts of the European business. So when you have Pringles, up high single digits and wholesome snacks, up high single digits. We clearly have the ability to execute if we have great food in the marketplace, we have great food behind Cereal. I have confidence we'll see our European top line trends improve as we go through this year."

One, a pumpkin spice initiative and another one with chunk and Raspberry, which is very close in to what Nutri-Gain stands for. Beyond that as you lean towards the healthier, if you like, perceived elements of wholesome snacks, we've already renovated many of our base Special K bars. And since those renovations, they are doing better. We are now bringing Protein Trail Mix bars to Special K and then the 1 or 2 brands that really, I think, need to step up and step in here to broaden out our portfolio and our growth. They're actually coming from Kashi and Bear Naked because they've really been absent over the last 2, 3 years. And therefore, we're renovating our core Kashi Granola bars. We're bringing new to the world Savory bars on Kashi. We're bringing new granola bites from Bear Naked as we go into the end of the second quarter here.

We do expect to see a little bit of savings from the international regions in 2016, but most of that will come into 2017. North America, by the way, also in the first quarter was on plan. We had embedded the zero-based budget savings into their plan, and they were on a slightly above plan, frankly. So we're in good shape on the program. Just on the zero-based budgeting, it both delivers savings but also provides a great tool and mechanism just to challenge historical assumptions and to challenge maybe some areas where some investment was happening but not gained a return and move it to money -- to areas that we are getting good return. So it's not always just the savings that comes out of it so much as the underlying methodology and driving in pushing on key assumptions."

So thank you, Simon, and welcome, John.
Turning to the business. We are pleased to report a good start to the year, with operating profit and earnings exceeding our expectations in the first quarter. Earlier pricing actions in Venezuela certainly gave our results a boost, but even excluding Venezuela our profit came in better than anticipated. Net sales excluding Venezuela came in slightly below our expectations, but even where we came up short, we can point to specific factors that we don't consider to be ongoing. For example, first, in U.S. Snacks, we underwent a major reorganization of our DSD sales force, changing thousands of employees' roles, managers, zones and customers. And this impacted our display activity in Q1 and into Q2. It was the right thing to do, and when everyone settles into their new roles, we should see improved selling and merchandising effectiveness.
Second, in European Cereal, sales were soft in Q1. We think this is largely the consequence of timing of investment. Our innovation came in midway through the quarter, and we have our big events, such as tie-ins with Euro soccer and Olympics, coming this summer. And finally, in businesses like Eggo and Morningstar Farms, we made portfolio changes and product transitions that weighed down short-term results, but it should lead to better performance as the year goes on. Like I said, these are all factors that should prove to be temporary, and we expect to see gradual improvement as the year progresses.
Q1 featured some very tangible signs of progress and clear evidence of sustainable improvement in results. Our U.S. Cereal business continued to gain share, reflecting the benefits of investing in our food and Kellogg sales reps. Our big three U.S. cracker brands collectively grew sales, consumption and share. We generated growth in our Pringles brand in all 4 regions, reflecting our expansion of that brand's portfolio and presence around the world. Our business in Asia grew currency-neutral comparable net sales at a high single-digit rate, reflecting our commitment to emerging markets. And our joint ventures, though not consolidated in our net sales results, also provided excellent emerging markets growth. Meanwhile, Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives, in conjunction with our underlying productivity initiatives, delivered strong efficiencies that contributed to our higher operating profit margin.
So there's a lot to be encouraged about in Q1. Let's talk briefly about where this leaves us for the full year. Ron will get into the specifics of our guidance in a moment, but here's how I would summarize our outlook on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Our outlook for operating profit and earnings per share excluding Venezuela has not changed. We are on track. Including Venezuela, our outlook actually improves for sales, profit and earnings owing to an earlier impact from inflationary pricing actions. We'll see a little more of our net sales growth coming from Venezuela due to pricing and a little less from the rest of the business, which we now believe will finish the year with 0% to 2% net sales growth excluding Venezuela. But remember, as the short-term factors I mentioned earlier get behind us, we continue to expect to build momentum as we go through the year. 
And with that, let me turn it to Ron for more details on the financials."
283356,330901427,974474,"Kellogg Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning.

First quarter currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 6.6%. Like last quarter, these results included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Total currency-neutral comparable net sales, excluding the impact of Venezuela, declined by 1%. First quarter currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased by 34.9%, also including the impact of Venezuela price. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit, excluding the impact of Venezuela, increased nearly 2% and exceeded our expectations. Reported operating profit for the first quarter was $438 million, including the impact of mark-to-market accounting, Project K upfront costs and the currency remeasurement to the Venezuelan business. You will see more detail regarding items affecting comparability in the appendices to this presentation.
Comparable earnings were $0.97 per share in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations, due to operating profit performance. This included $0.36 of currency headwind, $0.34 of which was due to the mid-2015 currency remeasurement in Venezuela. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $1.33 per share, which represented a year-over-year increase of 36% and which was above our original expectations. It's worth noting that the currency remeasurement of the Venezuelan business occurred at the end of the second quarter 2015. So this large year-on-year impact from currencies will continue through the second quarter of this year. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 and the drivers of the first quarter sales. Volume declined slightly in the quarter, including a few factors that are temporary, as John mentioned. These included a sales force transition in U.S. Snacks, trade inventory reductions in markets like Mexico and product culls and transitions in U.S. Frozen Foods. These factors masked good volume growth in our U.S. Specialty channels, our Asian Cereal business and our International Snack businesses led by Pringles. Price mix contributed 7.3% to sales growth, largely due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. Price mix, excluding the impact of Venezuela, declined slightly by 0.4%, largely a result of a difficult economic environment in Europe. And finally, you can see on the chart that the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by almost 12% in the quarter, with 10 points of that impact coming from Venezuela.
Slide 6 shows the currency-neutral comparable gross profit and gross margin for the quarter. Currency-neutral comparable gross margin increased by 210 basis points in the first quarter, including the impact of significant and earlier pricing actions to cover inflation in our Venezuela business. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, our gross margin decreased by 20 basis points, reflecting the investments we're making in our food and packaging around the world as well as some headwinds from transactional currencies. We also experienced the impact of some category and channel mix in the quarter, but we should see this reverse a bit as our sales trends improve in certain categories and markets as the year progresses.
We still expect the gross margin, excluding Venezuela, will improve for the full year as we experience positive contributions from Project K, our zero-based budgeting initiative and net deflation and input costs.
Slide 7 shows the regional operating profit performance for the first quarter. Currency-neutral comparable operating profit in North America increased by 8%. This was due to gross margin growth and lower SG&A driven by Project K savings, the zero-based budgeting initiative and lower net input costs.
In Europe, first quarter operating profit increased by 1%, building on difficult comparisons last year. This year's performance was the result of the timing of brand investment to support commercial programs and innovation, which was partially offset by the lower impact of sales. We were also lapping difficult comparisons in Latin America, although operating profit increased by 329% due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, operating profit decreased by 27% due to the impact of lower volume, driven by trade inventory reductions, as well as inflation we saw in cost of goods sold. Asia Pacific's operating profit decreased by 6% in the quarter, and this included increased levels of investment and capabilities to support growth, as well as transactional currency impacts. It's important to note that our Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives remain on track.
North America business realized savings from zero-based budgeting, in line with our plan, and our international regions are making good progress assessing their spending and developing their goals for late 2016 and beyond.
Slide 8 details cash flow for the first quarter. Our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer completed during the quarter. This lowered cash flow by approximately $145 million, although it's important to note that we get a cash tax benefit in the second quarter, so the net cash impact of the tender will be around $95 million. Even with the impact of the bond tender, we are still on track to deliver the $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital expenditures that we targeted initially.
And finally, our board recently approved a 4% increase in the dividend, which will bring our payout ratio slightly above 50%, and we remain committed to returning cash to our share owners.
Slide 9 shows our low levels of core working capital as a percentage of net sales. And as you can see, we reached 5.6% in the first quarter. This improvement was again driven by the accounts payable initiative that has been benefiting our working capital over the last year. And importantly, we have plans to improve this metric further in the periods to come.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 and our full year earnings per share walk. As you can see, there is no change in our comparable earnings per share, which remains in a range of $3.64 to $3.71. What has changed is our currency-neutral comparable earnings per share, which increases to $4 to $4.07 per share, a year-on-year growth rate of 13% to 15%. And this is because of the impact of earlier pricing actions in Venezuela. In this slide, this is depicted in the walk from currency neutral to comparable, with Venezuela's currency impact going to $0.30 per share from a previous estimate of $0.04 per share. Obviously Venezuela is a volatile market so this estimate could change. But as a reminder, our guidance for comparable earnings per share remains unchanged at $3.64 to $3.71.
Pretax upfront costs remain consistent with our original guidance of between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share, about half of which should be in cost of goods sold. And full year integration costs are still anticipated to be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share.
Slide 11 adds net sales and operating profit, showing everything on a currency-neutral comparable basis, and giving you a sense of what our outlook looks like with and without Venezuela. On this basis, including Venezuela, our guidance for net sales and operating profit, just like our earnings per share, moves higher. Specifically currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth goes to 11% to 13% from our previous estimate of 4% to 6%. And currency-neutral comparable net sales growth goes to 4% to 6% from our previous estimate of 1% to 3%. The makeup of our net sales outlook changes with more growth coming from Venezuela and a little less from the rest of the business. 
We are toning down our outlook outside Venezuela because of some of the first half factors that we've already mentioned, such as the sales force transition in Snacks, product transitions in Frozen Foods and market conditions in Europe and Latin America. The good news is that we still expect the business to build momentum throughout the year, but the result of a trimmed down first half sales growth estimate is that we now expect full year comparable sales growth, excluding Venezuela, to be more like 0% to 2% instead of 1% to 3%.
Looking into other assumptions. We continue to expect improved gross margin for the year. We expect that input cost will be net deflationary and that savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting will contribute to the margin improvement. As was the case previously, our margin guidance excludes the impact of Venezuela, given the inflation-driven pricing increases there and volatility in the market. Incremental savings from Project K are still expected to be approximately $100 million for the full year, approximately 75% to 80% of which will come in cost of goods sold. Savings for zero-based budgeting are still expected to be roughly $100 million, spread between cost of goods sold, brand building and overhead. Comparable interest expense should be in a range between $235 million and $245 million, comparable tax rate should be between 27% and 28% and we still expect to repurchase approximately $700 million to $750 million of shares in 2016. So no changes here. And we continue to expect that full year operating cash will be approximately $1.1 billion. Full year capital spending will be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including the investments we're making in Pringles growth and Project K. 
And remember we said on the fourth quarter call that our comparable earnings per share delivery would be spread relatively evenly across the quarters. This is changing, as we delivered slightly higher earnings per share in the first quarter than we anticipated, and this will likely come out in Q2, partially due to the timing of investments. 
And now I'll turn it over to Paul for more detail regarding the North America operating segments."

Good morning, everyone. Slide 13 is one I showed you at CAGNY earlier this year. As I mentioned then, our priority in North America is to return the business to profitable growth, and there are 3 key drivers of this transformation. We will accelerate the momentum behind advantaged brands in Cereal, Snacks and Frozen; we will transform the Veggie business, and unlock the full potential of the Kashi Company; and we will expand margins while investing to grow, driven by our Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives. As you'll hear over the next few minutes, we're making progress in all of these areas. Some may take longer to achieve than others, but we are confident we're on the right track and that we'll see continued improvement.
Now let's start with Slide 14 in the U.S. Morning Foods business. Overall, we are pleased with the results in the first quarter, and we remain on track with our plan to return to growth in 2016. Our core 6 cereal brands in combination, drove another quarter of share growth. Special K, Raisin Bran, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes and Mini-Wheats all gained or maintained share in the quarter. And Special K led the way with good performance resulting from our redesigned messaging, product renovation and innovation. And as you know, we recently launched new Special K Nourish in the U.S. It's early, but we're encouraged by the initial acceptance. 
Our See You At Breakfast promotion in January and the Give A Child a Breakfast promotion in March both performed very well. We did see some volatility in consumption in the Cereal category during the quarter and an impact from the timing of Easter at the end of the quarter. But if you look at more recent weeks data, the categories picked up again and is clearly better than it has been in recent years. 
We have confidence that our business will continue to improve in the coming quarters. Our share performance reflects the actions we took last year, and we've got more activity planned for the remainder of the year. In Q2, this includes 2 new Raisin Bran granolas and a Pixar's Finding Dory-themed cereal and promotion timed to coincide with the launch of the movie here in June. We also have our Olympic-themed activity coming in Q3 that also coincides with the timing of our big Back to School promotion.
Turning to Pop Tarts briefly, it's worth mentioning that the business posted a mid-single-digit increase in net sales and share gains in the quarter. As we look forward, we have great new products planned, including Orange Crush and A&W Root Beer flavors. We expect growth to continue for the full year. 
In summary, the Morning Foods business has made significant progress and will continue to improve. We've identified the issues that we needed to address, we've taken action and we've started to see the benefits. The work isn't over, but we're committed to continuing the progress we've made so far over the balance of 2016 and 2017.
Turning to U.S. Snacks and Slide 15. Our net sales decline in Q1 was a little more than we planned, really because of 2 factors. First, we reorganized our sales force, creating more clearly defined roles for selling, merchandising and support. This is going to drive more effective selling and merchandising, but we did see some disruption in our sales and display activity as we transitioned thousands of employees to new roles, zones and customers. This was most visible in cookies and crackers, and it continued into the month of April but will be behind us as we get through Q2. 
Second, our wholesome snacks business continued to decline in Q1. As we've discussed previously, this business remains our biggest challenge in Snacks, and we're still up against lost distribution, particularly from some prior years' innovations that simply haven't stuck. As you know, it's absolutely critical to get the food and the brand positioning right in this category. The good news is that Rice Krispies Treats have been a strong performer and its share was up again in Q1 and that we have several on-trend innovations and renovations launching here in the back half for all of our big Wholesome Snacks brands, such as Special K Protein Trail Mix bars, a new Nutri-Grain Pumpkin Spice variety and a couple of Cocoa Krispies treats, one including M&Ms. These give us reason to believe we can stabilize this business as the year progresses.
Now, in the meantime, let's not lose sight of what's working well in Snacks. Our big 3 brands in crackers -- Cheez-It, Town House and Club -- together posted good growth in net sales, consumption and share, all led by accelerated base consumption in the quarter. This is where we've invested, both in brand building and innovation, and it continues to pay off. We feel very good about our plans for the rest of the year in crackers, including innovations like Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers and Club Snack Stacks launching midyear.
We also feel very good about our Pringles business. In Q1 it posted growth in net sales and consumption. In fact, we saw double-digit consumption gains through our core range, aided by efforts to improve assortment on shelf and increased brand building support. We also had double-digit consumption growth in our on-the-go formats business. We have more brand investment and exciting promotional events coming, giving us confidence in an accelerating growth trend for this brand here to go. 
While cookies declined in Q1, it was probably the category most affected by our sales force reorganization. It was also held back by an investment plan that doesn't really get going until here in Q2. We are reinvesting in our core foods in the form of renovated products and packaging, new products and seasonal rotations. And importantly, we are returning to advertising behind Keebler after several years off air. 
So the plans are in place for a better performance ahead. We've still got work to do on snacks for sure, but we are starting to see signs of the return to growth we expect this year. Growth will accelerate in crackers and Pringles with more brand investment, a focus on assortment and formats and exciting innovation coming here in the back half. We've got advertising coming on cookies with the Keebler Elves returning. We'll get past this sales transition in Q2, and we've got much in the way of improved innovation that should start coming on wholesome snacks later in the year to turn that business as we go forward.
So now let's turn to Slide 16 and the highlights of the U.S. Specialty segment. Our Specialty channels business posted good mid-single-digit net sales growth in Q1, with net sales growth in all channels and a balance between price realization and volume growth. Leading the way was double-digit growth in the Convenience channel, which reached strong consumption and share growth in cereal, crackers, Rice Krispies Treats, Pop-Tarts and salty snacks. Foodservice also recorded good sales growth, led by cereal, wholesome snacks, Pop-Tarts, cookies and salty snacks. We also saw distribution gains in Vending in various categories and we had a strong Girl Scouts cookie season. 
Slide 17 shows the North American Other segment, which includes the U.S. Frozen Foods, Kashi and Canadian businesses. Net sales for the segment were down, but we're making good progress in each of the businesses. In Frozen Foods, our Eggo business was down because of last year's SKU rationalization and a shift in the timing of innovation this year to Q2 from Q1. But excluding the culled SKUs, Eggo grew consumption in Q1. Similarly, our Morningstar Farms business felt the impact of resetting the shelf with our new resealable packages. But where we have converted to the new packaging we are seeing positive results, and this conversion is now largely behind us. Frozen Foods will see better performance as we get past these culls and resets and as we see the benefits of advertising on Eggo and Morningstar Farms, a promotional tie-in with the movie Finding Dory and some great innovation launching right here in the month of May. 
Whilst our Kashi business posted lower sales year-on-year in Q1, we did see sequential improvement led by Cereal, where we maintained share overall and gained share in the Natural Food channel. In addition to our renovation efforts, we've got great new products rolling out soon, including new Kashi and Bear Naked cereals, new gluten-free crackers and some great savory granola bars. In addition, we're introducing here in May the plant-based protein powders we showed you at CAGNY a couple of months ago. All of this means that we expect continued improvement as we progress through the year.
And finally, in Canada we saw good performance by both Cereal and Snacks. Cereal posted gains in net sales, consumption and share led by core brands and the continued recovery of Special K, which grew 6% and gained 40 basis points of share.
So let's turn to Slide 18 and the summary. Hopefully you have a sense for the progress we are making on our priorities. We're continuing to gain share in U.S. Cereal, and our core 6 brands are performing well. Our core snacking brands, including our big 3 crackers and Pringles, are gaining momentum. The Frozen Food business is poised to return to growth on the strength of innovation. Kashi performance continues to improve as we get the food right and new products arrive in the market. Significant savings from Project K and ZBB are driving strong gross margin and operating profit growth. I'm confident we've taken the right actions across the region to invest, drive growth and increase margins. 
So finally, I'd like to thank all the members of the North American team for their hard work. We're making great progress together. 
Now I'll turn it back to John."

Now let's turn to Slide 19 and our European business, where sales declined slightly in the quarter. However, we did see some pockets of growth, particularly in the Pringles and Wholesome Snack businesses. The Pringles business in the region posted high single-digit growth in the quarter. This was led by sustained momentum in key markets and expansion of Pringles Tortillas into new markets. Pringles posted strong share performance in the region, with share gains most pronounced in the U.K. and Germany. The Wholesome Snacks business also posted high single-digit sales growth, led by continued good performance in the U.K., in Russia and in the Mediterranean/Middle Eastern region. We've launched some great food, and the business has responded. 
However, our cereal sales remain soft, particularly in the U.K. and France. Much of this is due to the timing of investment. As I mentioned earlier, our innovation launched later in the quarter, and we have promotions tied to the Euro soccer tournament and the Olympics planned for the summer. Over the balance of the year we're investing in our food; specifically, we have new innovation, including Ancient Legends and Special K Nourish, which is similar to the product that recently launched in the U.S. And we will continue to work on the underlying fundamentals, including focusing on increasing our distribution in alternate channels. We also have a plan that has more support in Q2 and the second half than in Q1. 
We expect a slight increase in net sales in the coming quarters on sustained growth in Wholesome Snacks and sequential improvement in Cereal as a brand building investment because of pickup in support of innovation and promotions. We also should see continued expansion of our Pringles business.
Slide 20 highlights performance of our Latin American business in the first quarter. As was the case for much of last year, the impact of pricing and inflationary [indiscernible] Venezuela drove double-digit currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in the period. We continue to manage the Venezuelan business very carefully, navigating local supply and power outages. Despite this, we gained share in Venezuela in the quarter. Excluding the Venezuelan business, sales in the region declined by 2% in the quarter, driven by Cereal and softness in 2 markets. In Mexico, where we compared against strong year-ago growth, we saw a reduction in trade inventories and the timing of promotional investment and these factors pulled down our net sales. However, our consumption in Mexico increased, and we gained share across our Cereal and Snacks categories, driven by strong innovation and commercial activation.
In the Mercosur region, we felt the impact of economic softness and trade inventory reductions in Brazil, especially where we lapped difficult year-ago comparisons. The good news is that, amidst this economic softness, we did increase our share in the Cereal category and Wholesome Snacks category in Brazil. 
So our consumption performance -- and I'd also like to point out consumption and share gains in Colombia -- was better than our shipment performance in Latin America. We launched new products late last year and in Q1 of this year which are contributing to the consumption performance, specifically the launch of Special K Protein, which I mentioned last quarter, has gone very well. Meanwhile, the region's Snacks business continues to perform well, posting mid-single-digit sales growth, with growth and expansion of markets like Mexico and the Andean and Mercosur regions. The Pringles brand grew at a mid-single-digit rate and we believe that we have considerable upside in this brand.
As we said on the Q4 call, the macroeconomic conditions in the region are challenging, but we've seen some good results in many parts of the region, especially in our in-market performance, with the share gains I mentioned. So we remain on plan to improve results ex Venezuela as the year progresses. 
Let's look at Slide 21 and our Asia Pacific business. Currency-neutral comparable sales growth for the region was approximately 1%, but our sales would have increased at a mid-single-digit rate if the impact of the joint ventures in China and Africa were included. In Asia our sales increased at a high single-digit rate with strong growth in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Southeast Asia and Japan. We reinvested in the Pringles business and launched new products, both of which helped to drive mid-single-digit sales growth for the brand in the quarter. In Australia, sales declined in Q1, although we saw sequential improvement. And year-to-date, through April, we've gained share in the Cereal category. We also have innovation planned for introduction in Australia beginning in the second quarter. This, in combination with new support, to contribute to the improving trend that we started to see. 
In summary, our plans for the overall business are exciting, and we expect improving performance over the remainder of the year. 
Please turn to the summary on Slide 22. On last quarter's earnings call I mentioned 4 reasons to believe that we are building momentum in 2016. 
First, we are investing in our food and packaging. We saw this in Q1, with cereals like Special K Nourish driving improved performance in the U.S. and Canada. We rolled out GMO-free Kashi products in the U.S. and new resealable packaging in Morningstar Farms. In Europe, we saw good success in new granola and muesli offerings and will see more consumer-driven renovation and innovation as we go through the year. 
Second, we are expanding Pringles. This could be seen during Q1 with our growth across every region. This will continue to be an avenue of growth for us in the future. 
Third, we are enhancing our sales capabilities. We took action in Q1, as evidenced by our reorganization in U.S. Snacks. We continued progress with additional feet on the street in Morning Foods and expanding our presence in high-frequency stores in Latin America and Asia. Winning Where The Shopper Shops is a key strategic pillar for us. We should see even more benefit from these capability investments as the year progresses. 
And finally, increasing our earnings visibility by our Project K and ZBB. This helped drive profitability already in Q1. And behind the scenes these initiatives are creating a cost discipline and spending behavior that can yield more savings and more earnings visibility going forward. So I'm happy to report that we are on track on all of these. 
I've also stated that we should see steady improvement in our performance as the year progresses. The plan is designed that way, with bigger reinvestments ahead, savings developing as the year progresses and some hurdles coming early in the year and giving way to better performance later. In short, we expect momentum to build through the year. And now I'll open it up for questions."

As you are aware, we put the team back in California just over a year ago. We're seeing especially our Cereal business perform a lot better. Share was flat in the first quarter. We're actually growing the business now in the natural channel. And the team has been really working hard at building a pipeline of ideas to get back ahead in terms of a food-focused mission-based operation. So we have new Kashi and Bear Naked cereals launching here now. We have savory granola bars launching at the end of the second quarter. We have some culturally inspired crackers that I spoke about before. We have granola bites coming from Bear Naked at the turn of the quarter as well, in the third quarter. And we have a brand new range which is shipping now of Kashi GoLean and Kashi-branded protein powders to lean into new segments with the brand. 
Of note, our Bear Naked granola business is growing at a good mid-single to high single digit clip. So the granola business in Bear Naked does well. One more part of the Kashi company is Stretch Island Fruit Snacks, a very small business we don't talk a lot about, but that's growing at a strong double-digit rate as well. And we've reinvented that food, made it all organic and invested back in the food there as well. So there's been a lot of reinvestment in food to renovate and now a lot of innovation about to come, which gives us the confidence we're going to get this business back to growth over the coming months in '16 and into '17."

I think if you come back and look at the U.S. business over the last couple years, we said there are 2 big brands in the U.S. that we needed to fix. One was Special K, one was Kashi. In both cases, where we've put on-trend food in the marketplace we've seen consumers respond to that very positively. You've seen those results come through in the U.S. results last year and into this year. Same is true in Canada. And as I said in the prepared remarks, in Australia we're also seeing significantly improved results through first quarter on the back of improved food that's more on trend for what consumers are looking for. The same will be true in the U.K. So we have 4 large cereal markets: U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. The U.K. is the last one for us to turn. But we believe, again, putting the right food in the marketplace for consumers is going to make the difference. 
The Ancient Legends food that we had at [indiscernible] is more of a granola, great taste, visible nutrition type food, as is the Special K Nourish food that's been an important part of the Special K turnaround in the U.S. And the Special K Red Berries renovation in the U.S. we'll also have going into the U.K. market as well. 
A lot of those food changes, though, got cut into the shelf in the later part of Q1. So we do expect to see the business respond to that. I don't necessarily expect to see the European Cereal business get back to growth in this year. But in many respects that cereal weakness in Europe is masking some very strong growth in other parts of the European business. So when you have Pringles up high single digits and Wholesome Snacks up high single digits, we clearly have the ability to execute if we have great food in the marketplace. We have great food behind Cereal. I have confidence we'll see our European top line trends improve as we go through this year."

And we have 2 initiatives coming -- one a pumpkin spice initiative and another one with chocolate and raspberry -- which is very close in to what Nutri-Gain stands for. 
Beyond that as you lean towards the healthier, if you like, perceived elements of Wholesome Snacks, we've already renovated many of our base Special K bars. And since those renovations they are doing better. We are now bringing protein trail mix bars to Special K. And then the 1 or 2 brands that really, I think, need to step up and step in here to broaden out our portfolio and our growth, they're actually coming from Kashi and Bear Naked, because they've really been absent over the last 2, 3 years. And therefore we're renovating our core Kashi granola bars. We're bringing new to the world savory bars on Kashi. We're bringing new granola bites from Bear Naked as we go into the end of the second quarter here. And you'll see more innovation coming on bars from Kashi and Bear Naked in that what I would call lifestyle performance area of Wholesome Snacks.

We are pleased to report another quarter of operating profit margin expansion. Obviously, were still challenges top line growth. Part of this is an industry-wide dynamic, as you all know, and part of this is our exposure to a shift in weight management trends that affected one of our biggest brands, Special K. That's why it's so important that we continue to make progress on 4 key priorities we've been updating you on over the past several months. 
First, investment in food and packaging, which was evident in Kashi, where we completed the conversion of the entire portfolio to non-GMO. In Frozen Foods, where we completed a packaging transition and the Special K, Cereal and in several markets as we refined the brand to strength. All of these investments had the consumer in mind, and all required need investment and transition would all bring back growth in the future. 
Second, expansion of Pringles, which was reflected in continued growth worldwide be it because of adding distribution, expanding new products like Tortilla or accelerating single-serve offerings. Our brand is going at a solid mid-single-digit rate. Third enhancing our capabilities, which continued as we launched broader revenue growth management capabilities in certain business units. This moves us beyond trade optimization and analytics toward price and other ways to ensure that we have there a price on the right pack for the right occasion. We completed the reorganization of our DSD selling and merchandising organization, which will offer improved effectiveness. We continue to expand distribution in high-frequency stores, particularly in emerging markets. This investment in execution will benefit us going forward. 
And finally, but perhaps most important in today's industry environment, we made progress in increasing our earnings visibility based on our strong productivity programs. Not only did we record a higher operating profit margin in the quarter, we also made good progress launching and executing initiatives that will improve our margins for the rest of the year and beyond. 
We continue to be on track with Project K. We continue to deliver on zero-based budgeting in North America while rolling it out internationally, and our guidance for 2016 now incorporates higher zero-based budgeting savings, with more point [ph] of earnings. This is a key driver behind our more positive stance towards our 2016 earnings guidance. 
As we stated at our 10-K [ph] yesterday, we recognized that margin expansion is a major opportunity in the food industry, and we are committed to making significant progress against this objective. Today, we are announcing an expansion and acceleration of our margin expansion plans. 
As Slide 4 indicates, we now have a plan that can realize approximately 350 basis points of improvement and at currency-neutral comparable OP margin through the year 2018. This is a bit more, and 2 years earlier than previously communicated. 
The chart shows you the key drivers of our margin expansion. The first bucket is productivity. We'll continue to generate our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity to offset inflation, and we're expanding zero-based budgeting in the U.S. while rolling it out internationally. Also, we'll continue to look for additional Project K initiatives that'll help us achieve this 350 basis point improvement with a potential for further savings beyond 2018. 
We've also been looking into ways to improve our price realization. We are now establishing more formal revenue growth management disciplines around the world, an extension of the trade analytics we have always done to help us get better at price realization. 
The next area of focus is investing for impact. Our investment model has to change with today's consumer and technology, and we've been rethinking how we support and build our brands to the highest possible return on investment on every dollar we invest. This could mean less reinvestment going forward and more productivity savings the profit margin. 
The last bucket has to do with making sure our foods on trend. This involves a more impactful approach to growing innovation and innovation. 
We are moderating our net sales growth outlook for the next couple of years to roughly flat. This reflects the current industry dynamics, but also reflects some of these margin expansion efforts, particularly when they touch upon price elasticity and portfolio optimization. a stronger portfolio and stronger earnings strength. We'll provide more detail in the coming months. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ron to walk you through the financials for Q2 and 2016."
283356,367414049,1024817,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows highlights to the financial results for the second quarter. Keep in mind that when describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted",1496,"Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows highlights to the financial results for the second quarter. Keep in mind that when describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. We do this because we know you prefer this basis for analyzing our underlying business performance. Of course, the appendices to our presentation provide you with a detail on both our GAAP and non-GAAP performance. 
Second quarter net sales increased by 8.6%. And like last quarter, these results included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Net sales, excluding the impact of Venezuela, declined by 2%. Our operating profit increased by 10.6%, driven by savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting in North America as well as by price increases in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, operating profit increased by 5.3% and exceeded our expectations. 
On a comparable basis, earnings per share were $0.91 in the quarter due to operating profit performance. This included $0.09 of currency headwind. $0.06 of which was due to the mid-2015 currency remeasurement in Venezuela. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $1 per share for the quarter, which represented a year-over-year increase of 8.7%.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 and the components of the second quarter sales. Volume declined by 1.6% and roughly the same, ex Venezuela. We'll discuss some of the markets where we saw declines a little later. Price/mix contributed more than 10 percentage points to sales growth due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. The price/mix excluding the impact of Venezuela declined by half a percentage point, held down by category channel and SKU mix in various markets. 
And finally, you can see on the chart that the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by 15 points, with almost all of it coming from Venezuela. And on the second half, we will the Venezuelan remeasurement, so its impact will be much smaller. 
Slide 7 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Venezuela's inflation and currency remeasurement can be a bit distorted, but you can see that excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was flat in the quarter and very close to flat for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives all deliver as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America, where our gross profit margin increased meaningfully in spite of investment in food Kashi, adverse transactional currency impact in Canada and some adverse mix in Morning Foods and Snacks. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance where gross margin declines across our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by the adverse transactional currency impacts on dollar-based commodities and other inputs and a deflationary retail environment in Europe. 
Slide 8 shows currency-neutral comparable operating profit margin, excluding Venezuela for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points in the second quarter. It was led by North America, which is where we rolled out ZBB. Operating margin was up internationally as well, though expansion was a bit more modest owing to the gross margin pressures described previously and to the fact the zero-based budgeting is just starting up in these regions. 
Slide 9 summarizes the regional financial performance for the second quarter on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Our focus on the profit and margin performance and John will follow with more color around the top line. The first thing that you'll notice is that excluding Venezuela for Latin America, every region posted profit growth and margin expansion in the quarter. In North America, operating profit increased by 5% as savings programs more than offset a decline in sales. Operating margin improved by 1.4 points, driven by Project K savings, the ZBB initiative and lower net input costs. 
In Europe, operating profit increased by 4% on flat sales with an operating margin increased by half a point, largely on efficiencies and timing of brand building as well as savings in overhead. 
In Latin America, operating profit increased substantially because of inflationary Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, operating profit also increased by 4%. Operating margin, excluding Venezuela, improved by nearly a full point led by price realization and cost management programs. 
Asia Pacific's operating profit jumped by a little more than 17% in the quarter, partially driven by sales growth. Operating margin increased by nearly a full point as the timing of investments more than offset unfavorable transactional currency impacts. 
Slide 10 shows our cash flow for the first half of the year. You may recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by approximately $145 million. Related to that, we did get a cash tax benefit in the second quarter, so the net after tax cash impact of the tender year-to-date is approximately $97 million. And still, our year-to-date cash flow through the second quarter was $399 million, which is about $76 million better than that of the year-ago period. And importantly, we continued to reduce our core working capital as a percentage of sales both sequentially and year-on-year. This improvement was again led by the accounts payable initiative that has been benefiting working capital over the last year. 
We are still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital expenditures. Full year capital spending should still be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including investment for Pringles growth and Project K. We bought back shares worth approximately $176 million in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $386 million, all of this under our current $1.5 billion authorization. 
Slide 7 shows our latest guidance for the year. Again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Our net sales guidance does not change, but we believe we will come in at the low end of the 0% to 2% range that excludes Venezuela. Our operating profit guidance moves higher because of Venezuela's profit performance in the first half. And excluding Venezuela, we are not changing our guidance range, but we expect to achieve the high end of the 4% to 6% range. This is related to zero-based budgeting, which is now projected to deliver roughly $150 million to $180 million of savings in this year. North America has confirmed more savings than anticipated, and our international regions now have savings commencing in the second half. We're allowing more of our projected savings to flow through the bottom line, more than offsetting the impact of sales coming in toward the lower end of our guidance range. 
ZBB savings and the performance of our Venezuela business, we expect our currency-neutral comparable earnings per share to be about $0.11 higher than the range we gave previously. I will point out that on a comparable basis, including currency, our earnings per share outlook range actually comes down $0.06, owing to further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Our increased outlook for operating profit has been offset by a higher average share count due to an increase in share price and dilution from activity. This $0.06 of additional negative currency translation is from the British pound primarily, following a vote to exit the European Union. 
From a fiscal standpoint, the additional $0.06 of impact from currencies is evenly spread across Q3 and Q4. Remember, the impact of Venezuela is immaterial in our second half as we have lapped the year-ago we mentioned. For Q3 earnings per share will be a little lighter than Q4, owing to the timing of investment, particularly around the Olympics and some media campaigns that were shifted to first half into the third quarter. 
Slide 12 shows other elements of our guidance, and first, you can see the currency impacts we just talked about. Interest expense should come in at around $400 million, which includes roughly $150 million from the bond tender, which has been excluded from our comparable results. Our comparable tax rate will be approximately 27%. Share buybacks are expected to be approximately $700 million to $750 million. Though, as I said, a higher share price and increased option exercises will translate into a higher average shares outstanding. 
Full year upfront costs remain consistent with our original guidance of between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share net of tax. It's about half of which should be in cost of goods. And full year integration cost is still anticipated to be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share net of tax. 
For both the upfront cost and integration cost, we are showing on the slide post tax status as well as for new disclosure rules. 
And with that, we'll now discussed the performance and outlook of each of our business units. We'll start with our largest business, U.S. Snacks. And with us today is Deanie Elsner, President of U.S. Snacks."

Before we jump into our Q2 results, let me quickly reground you on what I told you back in November's DK investor presentation. First, we're a big business with good profitability. We compete in 5 different categories, each with their own dynamics and in different aisles of the store. Second, we have a strong portfolio of great brands, which participate in the mega consumer trend towards snacking. This slide points out the size of some of our key brands. Third, and importantly, I laid out the opportunities that exist to get this business back to growth again, and I shared with you the key priorities we're focused on this year. Among those were the following. First, expand our margins. Next, shift investment to our growth brands, the brands most aligned to today's consumer. Next, expand on-the-go formats to reach consumers across occasions and channels. And finally, stabilize Special K. Today, I want to give your progress report on each of these priorities. 
Let's start with how we're improving our profit margins in Slide 14. As you know, we're driving significant productivity through Project K and ZBB. I'm happy to say that we're on track with these savings. We're also institutionalizing a broader, more disciplined approach to revenue growth management. We started with Cheez-It, where we evaluated the price points of our offerings across channels from large sizes to on-the-go and single-serve, and we're assessing how we invest our trade dollars. In market for Cheez-It demonstrates the early impact of this effort. Year-to-date consumption is up 5%, led by volume and strong price/mix. Base sales up 7.6%, and we've increased distribution more than 7% behind an expansion of our price back architecture. The brand also posted improved profit margin. 
Across our portfolio, our efforts on productivity, cost savings and revenue management are paying off. Our currency-neutral comparable operating margin is up year-on-year, both in Q2 and Q1. In fact, year-to-date, that margin is up 120 basis points. So good progress on market -- margin expansion on snacks with more to come. 
Our second priority was to shift our investment to the brands that could give us the strongest growth. This is represented on Slide 15. To optimize our return on investment, we concentrated our spend behind our best brands. In crackers, we're investing behind our big 3: Cheez-It, Club and Town House, all 3 of these brand grew consumption in Q2 and year-to-date. Collectively, they are also being share in Q2 and year-to-date. Pringle's grew consumption nearly 3% year-to-date. Our poor 4 [ph] flavors we were putting the most emphasis on the shelf, increased consumption 9% year-to-date and our single-serve offerings have grown at a double-digit rate. So as we get past some phased-out noncore items in the second half, you'll see accelerated growth for us in salty snacks. 
In cookies, we turned on media for the first time in years on the Keebler brand, introducing a whole new generation to the held and how would. It's early days, but the Keebler brand turned to consumption growth in Q2. 
In Wholesome Snacks, Rice Krispies Treats grew consumption by 4.5% in the quarter, and Nutri-Grain grew consumption by more than 5%. This means that 2/3 of our wholesome portfolio delivered healthy growth in Q2. Focusing on investment on our growth brands is a key element of our plan this year, and we're seeing good results. 
Slide 16 talks about our third priority, expanding our on-the-go offerings and distribution. We know consumers are snacking more and on more occasions. But we've been missing out on many of these occasions by not having the right pack format in the right channel. This has been a key area of focus for us in 2016. We're expanding formats or pack types across channels to better meet consumers' needs. We've expanded our line of smaller-size and single-serve offerings. We've gained distribution, and we've added capacity where needed as with Pringles snack stacks and small cans. An example of this is our crackers and cookies caddies or our multipacks -- our multipack of single-serve items. They have grown consumption year-to-date by 10%, accelerating in early as 4 weeks. Similarly, our Pringles on-the-go products are up double digits. As we launched these new products or these new formats, we're swapping out less relevant SKUs to ensure a more proactive approach to portfolio management. This will result in the in-market data looking a bit mixed today, but improving in the second half. This is a big growth opportunity for us, and we are encouraged by the results. 
The final priority we discussed with you at Day at K is stabilizing Special K, represented on Slide 17. We discussed how the shift in weight management trends have had a negative impact on Special K and how that, more than anything else, has pulled on our sales over the past few years. So taking a page from the Cereal playbook, we're overhauling Special K's Snacks portfolio to drive consumer relevance and reconsideration. We've done a lot of work over the last year, renovating some of the Special K SKUs and launching on-trend foods, like Special K Nourish, Chewy Nut bars, and we're seeing positive results. Our Nourish bars are 80% incremental to the Special K bars line. And importantly, the velocities in Q2 were 3x greater than the rest of the Special K's portfolio. So when we get the food right, this brand can grow. The challenge is that there are food forms in this brand that are simply not as well aligned to how our consumers are eating today. That's why in Q2, consumption for certain lines of Special K declined at a double-digit rate. Stabilizing Special K is mission-critical for us. In 2017, we will make a more aggressive portfolio change to the Special K brand, but we expect to continue experiencing some drag in Special K in the second half of 2016. 
So I'll use our Q2 and rest of year outlook as a summary of everything we've discussed, and that's on Slide 18. We're improving our profit margins in this business. We saw that our Q2 results, and we should continue to see profitability improvement in the second half. Our most important brands are growing, and we'll continue to invest in these brands in the second half. We still have drags on our top line, most notably, Special K. But we anticipate less of a drag in the second half. In Q2, we also felt the impact of some timing-related factors from shifting promotion in addition to the completion of our DSD reorganization. But that is behind us, and we've already started to see signs of improved effectiveness. 
So we have a lot of work going on in U.S. Snacks. In the first half of this year, we've improved our profit margins and grown our focus brands, even as we addressed the drags from Special K and our noncore portions of this portfolio, this gives us the confidence that we will see improved results in the second half. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

In U.S. Morning Foods light snacks, our margin expansion efforts are clearly bearing fruit. Project K savings and ZBB efficiencies contributed to an expansion in operating profit margin of nearly 4 points, an acceleration from Q1's strong performance. In Cereal, the category came back to flat after down Q1, which is encouraging. Our shares rose slightly up the quarter mainly due to the timing of promotional activity that our core 6 brands remain market share year-to-date. and pastries, meanwhile continue to perform well, consumption by 5% with food contribution on the new soda flavors. 
As we look to the second half of the year, we continue to expect improvement in top line performance, particularly the timing of promotions, like the Olympics. We feel good about our business, and strong profit margin expansions should continue to drive profit growth. 
U.S. Specialty Channels is shown on Slide 20. This segment posted another quarter of growth in sales, profit and profit margins in Q2. In Foodservice, we sustained strong growth in cereal, crackers, veggie and Wholesome Snacks, all categories with leading shares. In Convenience, we can share in cereal, salty snacks and crackers. Innovation continues to perform well, and we feel good about the momentum we have in our business. 
We also feel good about our profit margin performance, which continued in Q2. Good price realization and the early benefits of zero-based budgeting are resulting in improved profitability. We expect this to continue in the second half. 
Rounding out North America on Slide 21 is our North America Other segment. During Q2, our North America Other segment posted the lowest sales and profit, as each of its component businesses progressed through transitions. U.S. Frozen Foods is an example of a portfolio in transition as we have reshaped the portfolio for and transitioned to new packaging across the entire Morningstar Farms right. Even as we've made these major moves, this business posted improvement of profit margins driven by Project K and zero-based budgeting. 
Kashi is also missed the major overhaul of this portfolio. We are investing heavily in our food. During the quarter, we completed an overhaul of our portfolio, making every product non-GMO growth word. We also launched several new products. In fact, we believe this is the most innovation launched in Kashi's history. And finally, we've redesigned our packaging across our Kashi portfolio. 
In Canada, we the price realization in order to cover the transactional currency impact on our cost of goods. This caused some elasticity impact on consumption in the quarter, but will help us better offset our adverse cost going forward. The good news is that we continue to see share gains in our renovated and repositioned Special K. So the North America Other segment is clearly in transition, we expect to see gradual improvement in sales and profit margins in the second half. 
Turning to Slide 22 and Europe. We have been expecting sequential improvement in sales in Europe. We saw that in Q2. Sales were flat following Q1's slight decline, and our operating profit margin expansion better profit growth. We are extremely pleased with our Pringles business, which grew at a double-digit rate. 
Wholesome Snacks also had another good quarter, growing at a mid-single-digit rate, led by U.K.'s 5.5% consumption growth and broad-based improvement in trends in most markets. 
Cereal, though, was disappointing in Q2, mainly in the U.K. The category there remains very soft and a difficult economic and retail environment, and we lost share. we to reposition and renovate Special K. All the efforts to renovate Special K's food and new strength positioning are ongoing and while Nourish is doing well, this recovery may take some time. The good news is that in our other cereal markets, including Benelux, Southern Europe and Northern Europe, we did see sequential improvement and we continued to generate double-digit growth in Russia. 
As we look to the second half, we continue to expect sequential improvement in Europe in sales and profit, which will require progress in stabilizing U.K. Cereal. We have plans in place to address this, including an exciting Olympics program and the strength campaign for Special K in the U.K. and big Back to School programs across the region. And of course, we'll continue to improve our profit margins across Europe. 
Slide 23 highlights performance of our Latin America business in the second quarter. We continue to manage well through a difficult business environment. Obviously, Venezuela presents a unique set of challenges, and we're managing that well. We're also operating in a challenging economic environment throughout the region. We're working through these challenges. And in Q2, we realized sequential improvement in sales and profit. Our consumption performance, particularly in Cereal, remains solid, with good growth in Mexico and share gains in key markets like Brazil and Colombia. Our cocoa America soccer promotion did well, and innovations in Special K Protein cereal are helping to stabilize that key brand. We're realizing price across the region, particularly as we cope with adverse transactional foreign exchange and while we saw initial price elasticity impact on volumes in Q2, this should help sales and profit in the second half. 
It's never easy in Latin America, but the team there is managing through the volatility and should see sales and profit growth in the second half. 
Let's look at Slide 24 and our Asia Pacific business. At Q2, net sales growth accelerated from Q1 and increased our operating profit margin as well. Our Australia business continued to improve, posting slight sales growth in Cereal in the quarter. Notice when the turnaround in our biggest cereal brand in Australia, Nutri-Grain. In fact, across the entire cereal portfolio, we improved the penetration and gained share in the quarter. 
In Asia, the was led by distribution gains in Southeast Asia and strong commercial activation in Korea. Our business in Sub-Saharan Africa continued to outpace the Cereal category. Pringles in Asia Pacific grew at a high single-digit rate in Q2, accelerating from Q1. It's important to not to overlook at joint ventures. The results are not consolidated into our reported results, but they represent a key element our emerging markets growth strategy. On a pro forma basis, if they were included in Asia Pacific's net sales, our growth in Q2 would've been nearly 12% year-on-year. We're generating double-digit growth in China, led by granola cereals, and our west Africa JV also posted strong double-digit growth despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. We expect continued growth in Asia Pacific in the second half with added growth our JVs. 
And now let's wrap up our prepared remarks with a quick summary on Slide 25. Regarding Q2, we continue to make progress on our key priorities for this year, investing in our food, expanding Pringles, enhancing our sales capabilities and executing our initiatives, and we're seeing stabilization in key cereal markets like the U.S., Canada and Australia, reflecting a greater focus on profit margins our productivity initiatives and posted earnings that were slightly better than our expectations. As for our 2016 outlook, on a currency-neutral comparable basis, our earnings outlook improved on the strength of inflationary Venezuela. But just as importantly, our operating profit outlook excluding Venezuela, higher end of our guidance range, reflecting the rapid expansion of our ZBB effort. And on our longer-term outlook, new initiatives and accelerated programs are giving us better visibility to improve our profitability going forward. This is going to boost our profit margins even as we reshape our portfolio to better align consumer as we continue to expand our footprint and grow markets around the world. We have more to share on this in coming months. Take this opportunity to thank our employees around the world for their dedicated service to our company. And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A."

And it's also important to note that, that expansion is based on essentially a flat sales expectation. So of course, we have a continuation of Project K savings. And we talked about this before. As we look at 2017, 2018, we have in the range of $130 million to $150 million worth of savings. Our zero-based budgeting program, we communicated for 2016 $150 million to $180 million. We now have visibility for both North America and our international businesses of savings over that period of $450 million to $500 million. So that's over a 3-year period, 2016 through 2018. The other thing, as we discussed, we're doing is we're putting a more concerted effort behind revenue growth management to generate stronger price and mix improvement. So we have very good line of sight to achieve that margin expansion goal on a essentially a flat sales expectation. Of course, our goal will be to do a little bit better on sales if we do then 18%, the 350 basis point expansion, is not a ceiling. It's a targeted or a goal at this point in time.

And secondly, by changing the mix, we can actually get a better impact and potentially at lower cost. So I'm not going to give you guidance over the next few years as where brand building will go, but I think it's fair to say that we probably can see our brand building come down a bit from where it is and continue to drive very strong brand into the future."

And so there will continue to be investments in that area. So as part of our margin goal, we do have an expectation to reinvest some level of savings back into the business. We are giving a sales guidance here the next couple of years of flat. And that's we would normally do. A couple of reasons for that. One is what we're seeing is from an economic model perspective, from an analyst perspective, you keep it in flat sales and the 350 basis points of margin extension, we think that's a good way of modeling the company. Quite frankly, we will shoot to do better than that and actually go to top line from an internal perspective, but we're not relying upon that to get to the operating margin expansion. The margin expansions coming from productivity and price/mix realization, rather than say volume-type growth. In addition to all of that, as we go through next few years, you might see some elasticity, see improve the price realization. And we might see some parts of the portfolio that is lower profit but with emphasize as we continue to grow other parts of our business such as Pringles, which is being grown mid to high single digits the last couple of years."

I feel very good about the progress we're making on the top line. If you look back over the last 3 or 4 years, we talked about the importance of stabilizing a large 4 core cereal businesses. I'm happy to say that if you look at the U.S., Canada and Australia, you get them you can see the categories are stable. And our share stable, across those 3 businesses. In the U.K. continues to be work in progress. That's where we're not happy with its performance, but we expect to see improving results in the back half of the year in the U.K. So core cereals looking a lot better as a couple of years ago. Special K has been a major drag. In fact, pretty much all the loss of sales companies had over the last few years have been in Special K. And we're just seeing in business in markets like Canada and the U.S., particularly in cereal that business has stabilized. And we're want to do and some snacks extensions of Special K but better there. So we do think that the growth from Pringles and will keep coming through. An element of why we're being cautious and saying flat sales again is because one, we've been, I think, prudent from a modeling perspective and clearly if we can get our sales will get us even more flexibility in the P&L. So one, I think we're trying to avoid sort of overstating expectations or expectations so being prudent on the economics. And secondly, as we do drive from more price realization, as we do deemphasize some more profit elements of the portfolio, we might see some drag on the top line. But it's a drag that I wouldn't be concerned because we're building a stronger core business at the time of the better growth profile. So we think we're just getting prudent guidance at this stage."

Quality merchandising is flat. Features this based is up. Displays are down. So it's pretty rational of what you'd expect. It is more competitive, and I can tell you as we look at this one from a Kellogg standpoint, our pricing is very similar to what we're seeing in the category. Our price per pound and per unit we think in cookies and crackers are up versus year ago in the quarter. But ultimately, in the long run, to win in this category, you have to do 3 things. You've got to invest in your brands. You've got to launch innovation consumers love and you have to drive in-store excitement.

So we expect to see Kashi return to growth in the back half of the year. Now there were some parts of the Kashi business, Frozen pizza at its and other items that we've called out in the portfolio, so that might continue to drag on the business but that will ultimately low margin segments of the portfolio anyway. So we feel good about where we are in Kashi in terms of positioning for long-term growth. If I could just say on because that is a part of the portfolio that did drag in the second quarter. So few quick comments more broadly on that segment. Three businesses in there. One is Frozen Foods and Frozen Foods Eggo's actually doing reasonably well when you add in nonmeasured channels. Morningstar Farms has gone through a very difficult packaging transition of that's now complete turning on the marketing the back half of the business -- back half of the year for that business. And also, we did [indiscernible] on the Eggo business at the end of the last year. So when you add all that together, it's had a bit of a rough first half, but we do expect Frozen Foods to return to growth in the second half of the year. Canada, we've had the significant transactional foreign exchange issues in Canada with increased commercial price points. That's going to lead to some disruption in the market. That's its way in. So I think Canada will have a tough year. It's the right long-term decision, but it's going short-term pain as we go through that. And then Kashi, as I said, we do expect Kashi to return to growth in the back half of year. We feel better about it. So in the back half of year, we have 2 of the 3 businesses within North America returning to growth, and we think that the better in the back half the and the front half."

We are pleased to report another quarter of operating profit margin expansion. Obviously, we're still challenged with our top line growth.

We are pleased to report another quarter of operating profit margin expansion. Obviously, we're still challenged with our top line growth. Part of this is an industry-wide dynamic, as you all know, and part of this is our exposure to a shift in weight management trends that affected one of our biggest brands, Special K. 
That's why it's so important that we continue to make progress on 4 key priorities we've been updating you on over the past several months: first, investment in food and packaging, which was evident in Kashi, where we completed the conversion of the entire portfolio to non-GMO; in Frozen Foods, where we completed a packaging transition; and Special K cereal and bars in several markets as we reframe the brand to inner strength. All these investments had the consumer in mind, and all required near-term investment and transition, but all will bring back growth in the future. 
Second, expansion of Pringles, which was reflected in continued growth worldwide, be it because of adding distribution, expanding new  [indiscernible] like Tortilla or accelerating single-serve offerings. Our [indiscernible] brand is growing at a solid mid-single-digit rate. 
Third, enhancing our sales capabilities, which continued as we launched broader revenue growth management capabilities in certain business units. This moves us beyond trade optimization and analytics toward price-pack architecture and other ways to ensure that we have the right price on the right pack for the right occasion. We completed the reorganization of our DSD selling and merchandising organization, which will offer improved effectiveness. We continue to expand distribution in high-frequency stores, particularly in emerging markets. This investment in execution will benefit us going forward. 
And finally, but perhaps most important in today's industry environment, we made double progress in increasing our earnings visibility based on our strong productivity programs. Not only did we record a higher operating profit margin in the quarter, we also made good progress launching and executing initiatives that will improve our margins for the rest of the year and beyond. 
We continue to be on track with Project K. We continue to deliver on zero-based budgeting in North America while rolling it out internationally, and our guidance for 2016 now incorporates higher zero-based budgeting savings, with more of it flowing to earnings. This is a key driver behind our more positive stance towards our 2016 earnings guidance. 
As we stated at our Day at K Investor Day, we recognize that margin expansion is a major opportunity in the food industry, and we are committed to making significant progress against this objective. Today, we are announcing an expansion and acceleration of our margin expansion plans. 
As Slide 4 indicates, we now have a plan that can realize approximately 350 basis points of improvement and a currency-neutral comparable OP margin through the year 2018. This is a bit more and 2 years earlier than previously communicated.
The chart shows you the key drivers of our margin expansion. The first bucket is productivity. We'll continue to generate our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity to offset inflation, and we are expanding zero-based budgeting in the U.S. while rolling it out internationally. Also, we will continue to look for additional Project K initiatives that will help us achieve this 350 basis point improvement with a potential for further savings beyond 2018. 
We've also been looking into ways to improve our price realization. We are now establishing more formal revenue growth management disciplines around the world, an extension of the trade analytics we have always done to help us get better at price realization. 
The next area of focus is investing for impact. Our investment model has to change with today's consumer and technology, and we've been rethinking how we support and build our brands to the highest possible return on investment on every dollar we invest. This could mean less reinvestment going forward and more productivity savings flowing through profit margin. 
The last bucket has to do with making sure our food is on trend. This involves a more impactful approach to renovation and innovation. 
We are moderating our net sales growth outlook for the next couple of years to roughly flat. This reflects the current industry dynamics, but it also reflects some of these margin expansion efforts, particularly when they touch upon price elasticity and portfolio optimization.  [indiscernible] stronger portfolio and stronger earnings strength. We'll provide more detail in the coming months. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ron to walk you through the financials for Q2 and 2016."
283356,367414049,1025196,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows highlights to the financial results for the second quarter. Keep in mind that when describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted",1504,"Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows highlights to the financial results for the second quarter. Keep in mind that when describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. We do this because we know you prefer this basis for analyzing our underlying business performance. And of course, the appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on both our GAAP and non-GAAP performance. 
Second quarter net sales increased by 8.6%, and like last quarter, these results included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Net sales excluding the impact of Venezuela declined by 2%. Our operating profit increased by 10.6%, driven by savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting in North America as well as by price increases in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, operating profit increased by 5.3% and exceeded our expectations. 
On a comparable basis, earnings per share were $0.91 in the quarter due to operating profit performance. This included $0.09 of currency headwind, $0.06 of which was due to the mid-2015 currency remeasurement in Venezuela. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $1 per share for the quarter, which represented a year-over-year increase of 8.7%.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 and the components of the second quarter sales. Volume declined by 1.6% and roughly the same ex Venezuela. We'll discuss some of the markets where we saw declines a little later. Price/mix contributed more than 10 percentage points to sales growth due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. The price/mix excluding the impact of Venezuela declined by 0.5 percentage point, held down by category, channel and SKU mix in various markets. 
And finally, you can see on the chart that the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by 15 points, with almost all of it coming from Venezuela. And on the second half, we will have lapped the Venezuelan remeasurement, so this impact will be much smaller. 
Slide 7 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Venezuela's inflation and currency remeasurement can be a bit distorted, but you can see that excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was flat in the quarter and very close to flat for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives all delivered as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America, where our gross profit margin increased meaningfully in spite of investment in food at Kashi, adverse transactional currency impact in Canada and some adverse mix in Morning Foods and Snacks. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance were gross margin declines across our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by the adverse transactional currency impacts on dollar-based commodities and other inputs and a deflationary retail environment in Europe. 
Slide 8 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating profit margin excluding Venezuela for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points in the second quarter. It was led by North America, which is where we have rolled out ZBB. Operating margin was up internationally as well, though expansion was a bit more modest, owing to the gross margin pressures described previously and to the fact the zero-based budgeting is just starting up in these regions. 
Slide 9 summarizes the regional financial performance for the second quarter on a currency-neutral comparable basis. I'll focus on the profit and margin performance, and then Deanie and John will follow with more color around the top line. The first thing that you'll notice is that excluding Venezuela from Latin America, every region posted profit growth and margin expansion in the quarter. In North America, operating profit increased by 5% as savings programs more than offset a decline in sales. Operating margin improved by 1.4 points, driven by Project K savings, the ZBB initiative and lower net input costs. 
In Europe, operating profit increased by 4% on flat sales, with an operating margin that increased by 0.5 point, largely on efficiencies and timing of brand building as well as savings in overhead. 
In Latin America, operating profit increased substantially because of inflationary Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, operating profit also increased by 4%. Operating margin, excluding Venezuela, improved by nearly a full point, led by price realization and cost management programs. 
Asia Pacific's operating profit jumped by a little more than 17% in the quarter, partially driven by sales growth. Operating margin increased by nearly 1 full point as the timing of investments more than offset unfavorable transactional currency impacts. 
Slide 10 shows our cash flow for the first half of the year. You may recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by approximately $145 million. Related to that, we did get a cash tax benefit in the second quarter, so the net after-tax cash impact of the tender year-to-date is approximately $97 million. And still, our year-to-date cash flow through the second quarter was $399 million, which is about $76 million better than that for the year-ago period. And importantly, we continued to reduce our core working capital as a percentage of sales both sequentially and year-on-year. This improvement was, again, led by the accounts payable initiative that has been benefiting working capital over the last year. 
We are still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital expenditures. Full year capital spending should still be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including investments for Pringles' growth and Project K. 
We bought back shares worth approximately $176 million in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $386 million, all this under our current $1.5 billion authorization. 
Slide 11 shows our latest guidance for the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Our net sales guidance does not change, but we believe we will come in at the low end of the 0% to 2% range that excludes Venezuela. Our operating profit guidance moves higher because of Venezuela's profit performance in the first half. And excluding Venezuela, we are not changing our guidance range, but we expect to achieve the high end of the 4% to 6% range. This is related to zero-based budgeting, which is now projected to deliver roughly $150 million to $180 million of savings in this year. North America has confirmed more savings than anticipated, and our international regions now have savings commencing in the second half. We're allowing more of our projected savings to flow through the bottom line, more than offsetting the impact of sales coming in toward the lower end of our guidance range. 
Between these higher ZBB savings and the performance of our Venezuela business, we expect our currency-neutral comparable earnings per share to be about $0.11 higher than the range we gave previously. I will point out that on a comparable basis, including currency, our earnings per share outlook range actually comes down $0.06, owing to further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Our increased outlook for operating profit has been offset by a higher average share count due to an increase in share price and dilution from options activity. This $0.06 of additional negative currency translation is from the British pound primarily, following a vote to exit the European Union. From a phasing standpoint, the additional $0.06 of impact from currencies is evenly spread across Q3 and Q4. Remember, the impact of Venezuela is immaterial in our second half as we have lapped the year-ago remeasurement. But Q3 earnings per share will be a little lighter than Q4, owing to the timing of investment, particularly around the Olympics and some media campaigns that were shifted from the first half into the third quarter. 
Slide 12 shows other elements of our guidance. And first, you can see the currency impacts we just talked about. Interest expense should come in at around $400 million, which includes roughly $150 million from the bond tender, which has been excluded from our comparable results. Our comparable tax rate will be approximately 27%. Share buybacks are expected to be approximately $700 million to $750 million. Though, as I said, a higher share price and increased options exercises will translate into a higher average shares outstanding. 
Full year upfront costs remain consistent with our original guidance of between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share, net of tax, about half of which should be in cost of goods. And full year integration cost is still anticipated to be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share, net of tax. For both the upfront costs and integration costs, we are showing on the slide a post-tax status as well for new disclosure rules. 
And with that, we'll now discuss the performance and outlook of each of our business units. We'll start with our largest business, U.S. Snacks. And with us today is Deanie Elsner, President of U.S. Snacks."

We compete",1190,"Thanks, Ron, and hello, everybody. Let's go to Slide 13. Before we jump into our Q2 results, let me quickly reground you on what I told you back at November's Day at K Investor Presentation. First, we're a big business with good profitability. We compete in 5 different categories, each with their own dynamics and in different aisles of the store. Second, we have a strong portfolio of great brands, which participate in the mega consumer trend towards snacking. This slide points out the size of some of our key brands. Third, and importantly, I laid out the opportunities that exist to get this business back to growth again, and I shared with you the key priorities we're focused on this year. Among those were the following: first, expand our margins; next, shift investment to our growth brands, the brands most aligned to today's consumer; next, expand on-the-go formats to reach consumers across occasions and channels; and finally, stabilize Special K. Today, I want to give you a progress report on each of these priorities. 
Let's start with how we're improving our profit margins and Slide 14. As you know, we're driving significant productivity through Project K and ZBB. I'm happy to say that we're on track with these savings. We're also institutionalizing a broader, more disciplined approach to revenue growth management. We started with Cheez-It, where we evaluated the price points of our offerings across channels from large sizes to on-the-go and single-serve, and we're assessing how we invest our trade dollars. In-market for Cheez-It demonstrates the early impact of this effort. Year-to-date consumption is up 5%, led by volume and strong price/mix. Base sales, up 7.6%, and we've increased distribution more than 7% behind an expansion of our price-pack architecture. The brand also posted improved profit margin. 
Across our portfolio, our efforts on productivity, cost savings and revenue management are paying off. Our currency-neutral comparable operating margin is up year-on-year, both in Q2 and Q1. In fact, year-to-date, that margin is up 120 basis points. So good progress on margin expansion in Snacks, with more to come. 
Our second priority was to shift our investment to the brands that could give us the strongest growth. This is represented on Slide 15. To optimize our return on investment, we concentrated our spend behind our best brands. In crackers, we're investing behind our big 3: Cheez-It, Club and Town House. All 3 of these brands grew consumption in Q2 and year-to-date. Collectively, they are also gaining share in Q2 and year-to-date. Pringles grew consumption nearly 3% year-to-date. Our core 4 flavors, where we're putting the most emphasis on the shelf, increased consumption 9% year-to-date, and our single-serve offerings have grown at a double-digit rate. So as we get past some phased-out non-core items in the second half, you'll see accelerated growth for us in salty snacks. 
In cookies, we've turned on media for the first time in years on the Keebler brand, introducing a whole new generation to the elves in the Hollow Tree. It's early days, but the Keebler brand turned to consumption growth in Q2. 
In wholesome snacks, Rice Krispies Treats grew consumption by 4.5% in the quarter, and Nutri-Grain grew consumption by more than 5%. This means that 2/3 of our wholesome portfolio delivered healthy growth in Q2. Focusing our investment on our growth brands is a key element of our plan this year, and we're seeing good results. 
Slide 16 talks about our third priority: expanding our on-the-go offerings and distribution. We know consumers are snacking more and on more occasions. But we've been missing out on many of these occasions by not having the right pack format in the right channel. This has been a key area of focus for us in 2016. We're expanding formats or pack types across channels to better meet consumers' needs. We've expanded our line of smaller-size and single-serve offerings. We've gained distribution, and we've even added capacity where needed, as with Pringles Snack Stacks and small cans. An example of this is our crackers and cookies caddies or our multipacks -- our multipack of single-serve items. They have grown consumption year-to-date by 10%, accelerating in early as 4 weeks. Similarly, our Pringles on-the-go products are up double digits. As we launched this new product or these new formats, we're swapping out less relevant SKUs to ensure a more proactive approach to portfolio management. This will result in the in-market data looking a bit mixed today but improving in the second half. This is a big growth opportunity for us, and we are encouraged by the results. 
The final priority we discussed with you at Day at K is stabilizing Special K, represented on Slide 17. We discussed how the shift in weight management trends have had a negative impact on Special K and how that, more than anything else, has pulled on our sales over the past few years. So taking a page from the cereal playbook, we're overhauling Special K's snacks portfolio to drive consumer relevance and reconsideration. We've done a lot of work over the last year renovating some of the Special K SKUs and launching on-trend foods like Special K Nourish, Chewy Nut Bars, and we're seeing positive results. Our Nourish bars are 80% incremental to the Special K Bars line, and importantly, the velocities in Q2 were 3x greater than the rest of the Special K product portfolio. So when we get the food right, this brand can grow. The challenge is that there are food forms in this brand that are simply not as well aligned to how our consumers are eating today. That's why in Q2, consumption for certain lines of Special K declined at a double-digit rate. Stabilizing Special K is mission-critical for us. In 2017, we will make a more aggressive portfolio change to the Special K brand, but we expect to continue experiencing some drag from Special K in the second half of 2016. 
So I'll use our Q2 and rest-of-year outlook as a summary of everything we've discussed, and that's on Slide 18. We're improving our profit margins in this business. We saw that in our Q2 results, and we should continue to see profitability improvement in the second half. Our most important brands are growing, and we'll continue to invest in these brands in the second half. We still have drags on our top line, most notably, Special K, but we anticipate less of a drag in the second half. In Q2, we also felt the impact of some timing-related factors from shifting promotion in addition to the completion of our DSD reorganization. But that is behind us, and we've already started to see signs of improved effectiveness. 
So we have a lot of work going on in U.S. Snacks. In the first half of this year, we've improved our profit margins and grown our focus brands, even as we addressed the drags from Special K and our non-core portions of this portfolio. This gives us the confidence that we will see improved results in the second half. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."
283356,367414049,1025196,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Deanie.  Let's turn to Slide 19 and walk through our business segments' Q2 performance and full year outlook. In U.S. Morning Foods, like Snacks, our margin expansion efforts are clearly bearing fruit. Project K savings and ZBB efficiencies cont",1360,"Thanks, Deanie.  Let's turn to Slide 19 and walk through our business segments' Q2 performance and full year outlook. 
In U.S. Morning Foods, like Snacks, our margin expansion efforts are clearly bearing fruit. Project K savings and ZBB efficiencies contributed to an expansion in operating profit margin of nearly 4 points, an acceleration from Q1's strong performance. In cereal, the category came back to flat after a down Q1, which is encouraging. Our share was up slightly in the quarter mainly due to the timing of promotional activity that our core 6 brands [indiscernible] and remain up in share year-to-date. Toaster pastries, meanwhile, continued to perform well, growing consumption by 5%, with good contribution from the new soda flavors. 
As we look to the second half of the year, we continue to expect improvement in top line performance, particularly the timing of promotions, like the Olympics. We feel good about our business, and strong profit margin expansion should continue to drive profit growth. 
U.S. Specialty Channels is shown on Slide 20. This segment posted another quarter of growth in sales, profit and profit margins in Q2. In Foodservice, we sustained strong growth in cereal, crackers, veggie and wholesome snacks, all categories with leading shares. In Convenience, we gained share in cereal, salty snacks and crackers. Innovation continues to perform well, and we feel good about the momentum we have in our business. 
We also feel good about our profit margin performance, which continued in Q2. Good price realization and the early benefits of zero-based budgeting are resulting in improved profitability. We expect this to continue in the second half. 
Rounding out North America, on Slide 21 is our North America Other segment. During Q2, our North America Other segment posted the lowest sales and profit as each of its component businesses progressed through transitions. The U.S. Frozen Foods is an example of a portfolio in transition as we have reshaped the portfolio for Eggo and transitioned to new packaging across the entire Morningstar Farms line. Even as we've made these major moves, this business posted improvement in profit margins, driven by Project K and zero-based budgeting. 
Kashi has also missed the major overhaul of this portfolio. We are investing heavily in our food. During the quarter, we completed an overhaul of our portfolio, making every product non-GMO verified. We also launched several new products. In fact, we believe this is the most innovation launched in Kashi's history. And finally, we have redesigned our packaging across our Kashi portfolio. 
In Canada, we leaned into the price realization in order to cover the transactional currency impact on our cost of goods. This caused some elasticity impact on consumption in the quarter, but it will help us better offset our adverse cost going forward. The good news is that we continue to see share gains in our renovated and repositioned Special K. So the North America Other segment is clearly in transition, and we expect to see gradual improvement in sales and profit margins in the second half. 
Turning to Slide 22 and Europe. We've been expecting sequential improvement in sales and profit in Europe. We saw that in Q2. Sales were flat following Q1's slight decline, and our operating profit margin expansion led to better profit growth. We're extremely pleased with our Pringles business, which grew at a double-digit rate. 
Wholesome snacks also had another good quarter, growing at a mid-single-digit rate, led by U.K.'s 5.5% consumption growth and broad-based improvement in trends in most markets. Cereal, though, was disappointing in Q2, mainly in the U.K. The category there remains very soft in a difficult economic and retail environment, and we lost share. [indiscernible] to reposition and renovate Special K. Our efforts to renovate Special K's food and new inner strength positioning are ongoing. And while new Nourish is doing well, this recovery may take some time. The good news is that in our other cereal markets, including France/Benelux, Southern Europe and Northern Europe, we did see sequential improvement, and we continued to generate double-digit growth in Russia. 
As we look to the second half, we continue to expect sequential improvement in Europe in sales and profit, which will require progress in stabilizing U.K. Cereal. We have plans in place to address this, including an exciting Olympics program and the inner strength campaign for Special K in the U.K. and big Back to School  [indiscernible] programs across the region. And of course, we'll continue to improve our profit margins across Europe. 
Slide 23 highlights the performance of our Latin American business in the second quarter. We continue to manage well through a difficult business environment. Obviously, Venezuela presents a unique set of challenges, and we're managing that well. We're also operating in a challenging economic environment throughout the region. We're working through these challenges, and in Q2, we realized sequential improvement in sales and profit. Our consumption performance, particularly in cereal, remains solid, with good growth in Mexico and share gains in key markets like Brazil and Colombia. Our Copa America Soccer promotion did well, and innovations like Special K Protein cereal are helping to stabilize that key brand. We are realizing price across the region, particularly as we cope with adverse transactional foreign exchange. And while we saw initial price elasticity impact on volumes in Q2, this should help sales and profit in the second half. It's never easy in Latin America, but the team there is managing through the volatility and should see sales and profit growth in the second half. 
Let's look at Slide 24 and our Asia Pacific business. Our Q2 net sales growth accelerated from Q1 and increased our operating profit margin as well. Our Australia business continued to improve, posting slight sales growth in cereal in the quarter. Of note has been the turnaround in our biggest cereal brand in Australia, Nutri-Grain. In fact, across the entire cereal portfolio, we improved the penetration and gained share in the quarter. 
In Asia, growth was led by distribution gains in Southeast Asia and strong commercial activation in Korea. Our business in Sub-Saharan Africa continues to outpace the cereal category. Pringles in Asia Pacific grew at a high single-digit rate in Q2, accelerating from Q1. 
It's important not to overlook our joint ventures. The results are not consolidated into our reported results, but they represent a key element to our emerging markets growth strategy. On a pro forma basis, if they were included in Asia Pacific's net sales, our growth in Q2 would have been nearly 12% year-on-year. We're generating double-digit growth in China, led by granola cereals, and our West Africa JV also posted strong double-digit growth in spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We expect continued growth in Asia Pacific in the second half, with added growth from our JVs. 
And now let's wrap up our prepared remarks with a quick summary on Slide 25. Regarding Q2, we continue to make progress on our key priorities for this year, investing in our food, expanding Pringles, enhancing our sales capabilities and executing our savings initiatives. And we're seeing stabilization in key cereal markets like the U.S., Canada and Australia, and we're putting a greater focus on profit margins. [indiscernible] productivity initiatives that posted earnings that were slightly better than our expectations. 
As for our 2016 outlook, on a currency-neutral comparable basis, our earnings outlook improves on the strength of inflationary Venezuela. But just as importantly, our operating profit outlook excluding Venezuela, the outlook is to come in at the higher end of our guidance range, reflecting the rapid expansion of our ZBB effort. And on our longer-term outlook, new initiatives and accelerated programs are giving us better visibility into how we can improve our profitability going forward. This is going to boost our profit margins even as we reshape our portfolio to better align sales to consumer as we continue to expand our footprint and grow markets around the world. We have more to share on this in coming months. 
We'll also take this opportunity to thank our employees around the world for their dedicated service to our company. 
With that, let's open up the line for Q&A."

And it's also important to note that, that expansion is based on essentially a flat sales expectation. So of course, we have a continuation of Project K savings, and we've talked about this before. As we look at 2017, 2018, we have in the range of $130 million to $150 million worth of savings. Our zero-based budgeting program, we communicated for 2016 $150 million to $180 million. We now have visibility for both North America and our international businesses of savings over that period of $450 million to $500 million. So that's over a 3-year period, 2016 through 2018. The other thing, as we discussed, we're doing is we're putting a more concerted effort behind revenue growth management to generate stronger price and mix improvement. So we have a very good line of sight to achieve that margin expansion goal on essentially a flat sales expectation. Of course, our goal would be to do a little bit better on sales. If we do, then 18%, the 350 basis point expansion, is not a ceiling. It's a target or a goal at this point in time, and we have a strong plan and good visibility to get there."

We are giving a sales guidance here the next couple of years of flat. And that's less than what we would normally do. A couple of reasons for that. One is what we're seeing is from an economic model perspective, from an analyst perspective, if you put in flat sales and the 350 basis points of margin expansion, we think that's a good way of modeling the company. Quite frankly, we will shoot to do better than that and actually go to top line from an internal perspective, but we're not relying upon that to get to the operating margin expansion. The margin expansion is coming more from productivity and price/mix realization rather than, say, volume-type growth. In addition to all of that, as we go through next few years, you might see some elasticity as we improve price realization. And we might see some parts of the portfolio that is lower profit that we deemphasize as we continue to grow other parts of our business such as Pringles, which is being grown mid- to high single digits the last couple of years."

Special K has been a major drag. In fact, pretty much all the loss of sales the companies had over the last few years has been in Special K. And we're just seeing business in markets like Canada and the U.S., particularly in cereal, that business has stabilized. And we still have some more to do with some snacks extensions of Special K, but we're doing better there.

We can turn the marketing program on the back half of the year. We had a very strong slate of innovation go through here at the middle of the year. So we expect to see Kashi return to growth in the back half of the year. Now there were some parts of the Kashi business, some frozen pizza, ions [ph] and smud ions [ph] that we've called out in the portfolio, so that might continue to drag on the business, but that will be ultimately lower-margin segments of the portfolio anyway. So we feel good about where we are in Kashi in terms of positioning it for long-term growth. If I could just stay on K in Other because that is a part of the portfolio that did drag in the second quarter. So a few quick comments more broadly on that segment. Three businesses in there. One is Frozen Foods. In Frozen Foods, Eggo is actually doing reasonably well when you add in nonmeasured channels. Morningstar Farms has gone through a very difficult packaging transition that's now complete, turning on the marketing in the back half of the business -- back half of the year for that business. And also, we did cull some SKUs on the Eggo business at the end of the last year. So when you add all that together, it's had a bit of a rough first half, but we do expect Frozen Foods to return to growth in the second half of the year. Canada, we've had significant transactional foreign exchange issues in Canada, which increased our commercial price points. That's going to lead to some disruption in the market. That sort of solved its way in. So I think Canada will have a tough year. It's the right long-term decision, but it's going to cover a little bit short-term pain as we go through that. And then Kashi, as I said, we do expect Kashi to return to growth in the back half of year. We feel better about it. So in the back half of year, we have 2 of the 3 businesses within North America Other returning to growth, and we think that the sentiment will be better in the back half than the front half."

283356,367414049,1025644,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We are pleased to report another quarter of operating profit margin expansion. Obviously, we're still challenges (sic) [challenged] with our top line growth. Part of this is an industry-wide dynamic,",765,"Thanks, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We are pleased to report another quarter of operating profit margin expansion. Obviously, we're still challenges (sic) [challenged] with our top line growth. Part of this is an industry-wide dynamic, as you all know, and part of this is our exposure to a shift in weight management trends that affected one of our biggest brands, Special K. 
That's why it's so important that we continue to make progress on 4 key priorities we've been updating you on over the past several months: first, investment in food and packaging, which was evident in Kashi, where we completed the conversion of the entire portfolio to non-GMO; in Frozen Foods, where we completed a packaging transition; and in Special K cereal and bars in several markets as we reframed the brand to inner strength. All these investments had the consumer in mind, and all required near-term investment and transition, but all will bring back growth in the future. 
Second, expansion of Pringles, which was reflected in continued growth worldwide, be it because of adding distribution, expanding new platforms like Tortilla or accelerating single-serve offerings. Our old school brand is growing at a solid mid-single-digit rate. 
Third, enhancing our sales capabilities, which continued as we launched broader revenue growth management capabilities in certain business units. This moves us beyond trade optimization and analytics toward price-pack architecture and other ways to ensure that we have the right price on the right pack for the right occasion. We completed the reorganization of our DSD selling and merchandising organization, which will offer improved effectiveness. We continue to expand distribution in high-frequency stores, particularly in emerging markets. This investment in execution will benefit us going forward. 
And finally, but perhaps most important in today's industry environment, we made notable progress in increasing our earnings visibility based on our strong productivity programs. Not only did we record a higher operating profit margin in the quarter, we also made good progress launching and executing initiatives that will improve our margins for the rest of the year and beyond. 
We continue to be on track with Project K. We continue to deliver on zero-based budgeting in North America while rolling it out internationally, and our guidance for 2016 now incorporates higher zero-based budgeting savings, with more of it flowing to earnings. This is a key driver behind our more positive stance towards our 2016 earnings guidance. 
As we stated at our Day at K Investor Day, we recognize that margin expansion is a major opportunity in the food industry, and we are committed to making significant progress against this objective. Today, we are announcing an expansion and acceleration of our margin expansion plans. 
As Slide 4 indicates, we now have a plan that can realize approximately 350 basis points of improvement and a currency-neutral comparable OP margin through the year 2018. This is a bit more and 2 years earlier than previously communicated.
The chart shows you the key drivers of our margin expansion. The first bucket is productivity. We'll continue to generate our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity to offset inflation, and we are expanding zero-based budgeting in the U.S. while rolling it out internationally. Also, we will continue to look for additional Project K initiatives that will help us achieve this 350 basis point improvement with a potential for further savings beyond 2018. 
We've also been looking into ways to improve our price realization. We are now establishing more formal revenue growth management disciplines around the world, an extension of the trade analytics we have always done to help us get better at price realization. 
The next area of focus is investing for impact. Our investment model has to change with today's consumer and technology, and we've been rethinking how we support and build our brands to the highest possible return on investment on every dollar we invest. This could mean less reinvestment going forward and more productivity savings flowing through profit margin. 
The last bucket has to do with making sure our foods are on trend. This involves a more impactful approach to renovation and innovation. 
We are moderating our net sales growth outlook for the next couple of years to roughly flat. This reflects the current industry dynamics, but it also reflects some of these margin expansion efforts, particularly when they touch upon price elasticity and portfolio optimization but enables stronger portfolio and stronger earnings strength. We'll provide more detail in the coming months. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ron to walk you through the financials for Q2 and 2016."
283356,367414049,1025644,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows highlights to the financial results for the second quarter. Keep in mind that when describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted",1504,"Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows highlights to the financial results for the second quarter. Keep in mind that when describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. We do this because we know you prefer this basis for analyzing our underlying business performance. And of course, the appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on both our GAAP and non-GAAP performance. 
Second quarter net sales increased by 8.6%, and like last quarter, these results included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Net sales excluding the impact of Venezuela declined by 2%. Our operating profit increased by 10.6%, driven by savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting in North America as well as by [ph] price increases in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, operating profit increased by 5.3% and exceeded our expectations. 
On a comparable basis, earnings per share were $0.91 in the quarter due to operating profit performance. This included $0.09 of currency headwind, $0.06 of which was due to the mid-2015 currency remeasurement in Venezuela. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $1 per share for the quarter, which represented a year-over-year increase of 8.7%.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 and the components of the second quarter sales. Volume declined by 1.6% and roughly the same ex Venezuela. We'll discuss some of the markets where we saw declines a little later. Price/mix contributed more than 10 percentage points to sales growth due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. The price/mix excluding the impact of Venezuela declined by 0.5 percentage point, held down by category, channel and SKU mix in various markets. 
And finally, you can see on the chart that the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by 15 points, with almost all of it coming from Venezuela. And on the second half, we will have lapped the Venezuelan remeasurement, so this impact will be much smaller. 
Slide 7 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Venezuela's inflation and currency remeasurement can be a bit distorted, but you can see that excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was flat in the quarter and very close to flat for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives all delivered as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America, where our gross profit margin increased meaningfully in spite of investment in food at Kashi, adverse transactional currency impact in Canada and some adverse mix in Morning Foods and Snacks. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance were gross margin declines across our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by the adverse transactional currency impacts on dollar-based commodities and other inputs and a deflationary retailer environment in Europe. 
Slide 8 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating profit margin excluding Venezuela for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points in the second quarter. It was led by North America, which is where we have rolled out ZBB. Operating margin was up internationally as well, though expansion was a bit more modest, owing to the gross margin pressures described previously and to the fact the zero-based budgeting is just starting up in these regions. 
Slide 9 summarizes the regional financial performance for the second quarter on a currency-neutral comparable basis. I'll focus on the profit and margin performance, and then Deanie and John will follow with more color around the top line. The first thing that you'll notice is that excluding Venezuela from Latin America, every region posted profit growth and margin expansion in the quarter. In North America, operating profit increased by 5% as savings programs more than offset a decline in sales. Operating margin improved by 1.4 points, driven by Project K savings, the ZBB initiative and lower net input costs. 
In Europe, operating profit increased by 4% on flat sales, with an operating margin that increased by 0.5 point, largely on efficiencies and timing of brand building as well as savings in overhead. 
In Latin America, operating profit increased substantially because of inflationary Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, operating profit also increased by 4%. Operating margin, excluding Venezuela, improved by nearly a full point, led by price realization and cost management programs. 
Asia-Pacific's operating profit jumped by a little more than 17% in the quarter, partially driven by sales growth. Operating margin increased by nearly 1 full point as the timing of investments more than offset unfavorable transactional currency impacts. 
Slide 10 shows our cash flow for the first half of the year. You may recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by approximately $145 million. Related to that, we did get a cash tax benefit in the second quarter, so the net after-tax cash impact of the tender year-to-date is approximately $97 million. And still, our year-to-date cash flow through the second quarter was $399 million, which is about $76 million better than that for the year-ago period. And importantly, we continued to reduce our core working capital as a percentage of sales both sequentially and year-on-year. This improvement was, again, led by the accounts payable initiative that has been benefiting working capital over the last year. 
We are still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital expenditures. Full year capital spending should still be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including investments for Pringles' growth and Project K. 
We bought back shares worth approximately $176 million in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $386 million, all this under our current $1.5 billion authorization. 
Slide 11 shows our latest guidance for the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Our net sales guidance does not change, but we believe we will come in at the low end of the 0% to 2% range that excludes Venezuela. Our operating profit guidance moves higher because of Venezuela's profit performance in the first half. And excluding Venezuela, we are not changing our guidance range, but we expect to achieve the high end of the 4% to 6% range. This is related to zero-based budgeting, which is now projected to deliver roughly $150 million to $180 million of savings in this year. North America has confirmed more savings than anticipated, and our international regions now have savings commencing in the second half. We're allowing more of our projected savings to flow through the bottom line, more than offsetting the impact of sales coming in toward the lower end of our guidance range. 
Between these higher ZBB savings and the performance of our Venezuela business, we expect our currency-neutral comparable earnings per share to be about $0.11 higher than the range we gave previously. I will point out that on a comparable basis, including currency, our earnings per share outlook range actually comes down $0.06, owing to further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. 
Our increased outlook for operating profit has been offset by a higher average share count due to an increase in share price and dilution from options activity. This $0.06 of additional negative currency translation is from the British pound primarily, following the vote to exit the European Union. From a phasing standpoint, the additional $0.06 of impact from currencies is evenly spread across Q3 and Q4. Remember, the impact of Venezuela is immaterial in our second half as we have lapped the year-ago remeasurement. But Q3 earnings per share will be a little lighter than Q4, owing to the timing of investment, particularly around the Olympics and some media campaigns that were shifted from the first half into the third quarter. 
Slide 12 shows other elements of our guidance. And first, you can see the currency impacts we just talked about. Interest expense should come in at around $400 million, which includes roughly $150 million from the bond tender, which has been excluded from our comparable results. Our comparable tax rate will be approximately 27%. Share buybacks are expected to be approximately $700 million to $750 million. Though, as I said, a higher share price and increased options exercises will translate into a higher average shares outstanding. 
Full year upfront costs remain consistent with our original guidance of between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share, net of tax, about half of which should be in cost of goods. And full year integration cost is still anticipated to be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share, net of tax. For both the upfront costs and integration costs, we are showing on the slide a post-tax status as well for new disclosure rules. 
And with that, we'll now discuss the performance and outlook of each of our business units. We'll start with our largest business, U.S. Snacks. And with us today is Deanie Elsner, President of U.S. Snacks."

We compete",1191,"Thanks, Ron, and hello, everybody. Let's go to Slide 13. Before we jump into our Q2 results, let me quickly reground you on what I told you back at November's Day at K Investor Presentation. First, we're a big business with good profitability. We compete in 5 different categories, each with their own dynamics and in different aisles of the store. Second, we have a strong portfolio of great brands, which participate in the mega consumer trend towards snacking. This slide points out the size of some of our key brands. Third, and importantly, I laid out the opportunities that exist to get this business back to growth again, and I shared with you the key priorities we're focused on this year. Among those were the following: first, expand our margins; next, shift investment to our growth brands, the brands most aligned to today's consumer; next, expand on-the-go formats to reach consumers across occasions and channels; and finally, stabilize Special K. Today, I want to give you a progress report on each of these priorities. 
Let's start with how we're improving our profit margins in [ph] Slide 14. As you know, we're driving significant productivity through Project K and ZBB. I'm happy to say that we're on track with these savings. We're also institutionalizing a broader, more disciplined approach to revenue growth management. We started with Cheez-It, where we evaluated the price points of our offerings across channels from large sizes to on-the-go and single-serve, and we're assessing how we invest our trade dollars. In-market for Cheez-It demonstrates the early impact of this effort. Year-to-date consumption is up 5%, led by volume and strong price/mix. Base sales, up 7.6%, and we've increased distribution more than 7% behind an expansion of our price-pack architecture. The brand also posted improved profit margin. 
Across our portfolio, our efforts on productivity, cost savings and revenue management are paying off. Our currency-neutral comparable operating margin is up year-on-year, both in Q2 and Q1. In fact, year-to-date, that margin is up 120 basis points. So good progress on margin expansion in Snacks, with more to come. 
Our second priority was to shift our investment to the brands that could give us the strongest growth. This is represented on Slide 15. To optimize our return on investment, we concentrated our spend behind our best brands. In crackers, we're investing behind our big 3: Cheez-It, Club and Town House. All 3 of these brands grew consumption in Q2 and year-to-date. Collectively, they are also gaining share in Q2 and year-to-date. Pringles grew consumption nearly 3% year-to-date. Our core 4 flavors, where we're putting the most emphasis on the shelf, increased consumption 9% year-to-date, and our single-serve offerings have grown at a double-digit rate. So as we get past some phased-out non-core items in the second half, you'll see accelerated growth for us in salty snacks. 
In cookies, we've turned on media for the first time in years on the Keebler brand, introducing a whole new generation to the Elves in the Hollow Tree. It's early days, but the Keebler brand turned to consumption growth in Q2. 
In wholesome snacks, Rice Krispies Treats grew consumption by 4.5% in the quarter, and Nutri-Grain grew consumption by more than 5%. This means that 2/3 of our wholesome portfolio delivered healthy growth in Q2. Focusing our investment on our growth brands is a key element of our plan this year, and we're seeing good results. 
Slide 16 talks about our third priority: expanding our on-the-go offerings and distribution. We know consumers are snacking more and on more occasions. But we've been missing out on many of these occasions by not having the right pack format in the right channel. This has been a key area of focus for us in 2016. We're expanding formats or pack types across channels to better meet consumers' needs. We've expanded our line of smaller-size and single-serve offerings. We've gained distribution, and we've even added capacity where needed, as with Pringles Snack Stacks and small cans. An example of this is our crackers and cookies caddies or our multipacks -- our multipack of single-serve items. They have grown consumption year-to-date by 10%, accelerating in the latest 4 weeks. Similarly, our Pringles on-the-go products are up double digits. As we launched this new product or these new formats, we're swapping out less relevant SKUs to ensure a more proactive approach to portfolio management. This will result in the in-market data looking a bit mixed today but improving in the second half. This is a big growth opportunity for us, and we are encouraged by the results. 
The final priority we discussed with you at Day at K is stabilizing Special K, represented on Slide 17. We discussed how the shift in weight management trends have had a negative impact on Special K and how that, more than anything else, has pulled down our sales over the past few years. So taking a page from the cereal playbook, we're overhauling Special K's snacks portfolio to drive consumer relevance and reconsideration. We've done a lot of work over the last year renovating some of the Special K SKUs and launching on-trend foods like Special K Nourish, Chewy Nut Bars, and we're seeing positive results. Our Nourish bars are 80% incremental to the Special K Bars line, and importantly, the velocities in Q2 were 3x greater than the rest of the Special K product portfolio. So when we get the food right, this brand can grow. The challenge is that there are food forms in this brand that are simply not as well aligned to how our consumers are eating today. That's why in Q2, consumption for certain lines of Special K declined at a double-digit rate. Stabilizing Special K is mission-critical for us. In 2017, we will make a more aggressive portfolio change to the Special K brand, but we expect to continue experiencing some drag from Special K in the second half of 2016. 
So I'll use our Q2 and rest-of-year outlook as a summary of everything we've discussed, and that's on Slide 18. We're improving our profit margins in this business. We saw that in our Q2 results, and we should continue to see profitability improvement in the second half. Our most important brands are growing, and we'll continue to invest in these brands in the second half. We still have drags on our top line, most notably, Special K, but we anticipate less of a drag in the second half. In Q2, we also felt the impact of some timing-related factors from shifting promotion in addition to the completion of our DSD reorganization. But that is behind us, and we've already started to see signs of improved effectiveness. 
So we have a lot of work going on in U.S. Snacks. In the first half of this year, we've improved our profit margins and grown our focus brands, even as we addressed the drags from Special K and our non-core portions of this portfolio. This gives us the confidence that we will see improved results in the second half. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."

Project K savings and ZBB efficiencies contr",1364,"Thanks, Deanie. Let's turn to Slide 19 and walk through our business segments' Q2 performance and full year outlook. 
In U.S. Morning Foods, like Snacks, our margin expansion efforts are clearly bearing fruit. Project K savings and ZBB efficiencies contributed to an expansion in operating profit margin of nearly 4 points, an acceleration from Q1's strong performance. In cereal, the category came back to flat after a down Q1, which is encouraging. Our share was up slightly in the quarter mainly due to the timing of promotional activity that our core 6 brands held firm and remain up in share year-to-date. Toaster pastries, meanwhile, continued to perform well, growing consumption by 5%, with good contribution from the new soda flavors. 
As we look to the second half of the year, we continue to expect improvement in top line performance, particularly the timing of promotions, like the Olympics. We feel good about our business, and strong profit margin expansion should continue to drive profit growth. 
U.S. Specialty Channels is shown on Slide 20. This segment posted another quarter of growth in sales, profit and profit margins in Q2. In Foodservice, we sustained strong growth in cereal, crackers, veggie and wholesome snacks, all categories with leading shares. In Convenience, we gained share in cereal, salty snacks and crackers. Innovation continues to perform well, and we feel good about the momentum we have in our business. 
We also feel good about our profit margin performance, which continued in Q2. Good price realization and the early benefits of zero-based budgeting are resulting in improved profitability. We expect this to continue in the second half. 
Rounding out North America, on Slide 21 is our North America Other segment. During Q2, our North America Other segment posted the lowest sales and profit as each of its component businesses progressed through transitions. The U.S. Frozen Foods is an example of a portfolio in transition as we have reshaped the portfolio for Eggo and transitioned to new packaging across the entire Morningstar Farms line. Even as we've made these major moves, this business posted improvement in profit margins, driven by Project K and zero-based budgeting. 
Kashi has also commenced [ph] a major overhaul of its portfolio. We are investing heavily in our food. During the quarter, we completed an overhaul of our portfolio, making every product non-GMO verified. We also launched several new products. In fact, we believe this is the most innovation launched in Kashi's history. And finally, we have redesigned our packaging across our Kashi portfolio. 
In Canada, we leaned into the price realization in order to cover the transactional currency impact on our cost of goods. This caused some elasticity impact on consumption in the quarter, but it will help us better offset our adverse cost going forward. The good news is that we continue to see share gains in our renovated and repositioned Special K. So the North America Other segment is clearly in transition, and we expect to see gradual improvement in sales and profit margins in the second half. 
Turning to Slide 22 and Europe. We've been expecting sequential improvement in sales and profit in Europe. We saw that in Q2. Sales were flat following Q1's slight decline, and our operating profit margin expansion led to better profit growth. We're extremely pleased with our Pringles business, which grew at a double-digit rate. 
Wholesome snacks also had another good quarter, growing at a mid-single-digit rate, led by U.K.'s 5.5% consumption growth and broad-based improvement in trends in most markets. Cereal, though, was disappointing in Q2, mainly in the U.K. The category there remains very soft in a difficult economic and retail environment, and we lost share. Management [ph] work to reposition and renovate Special K. While our efforts to renovate Special K's food and new inner strength positioning are ongoing and while new Nourish is doing well, this recovery may take some time. The good news is that in our other cereal markets, including France/Benelux, Southern Europe and Northern Europe, we did see sequential improvement, and we continued to generate double-digit growth in Russia. 
As we look to the second half, we continue to expect sequential improvement in Europe in sales and profit, which will require progress in stabilizing U.K. Cereal. We have plans in place to address this, including an exciting Olympics program and the Inner Strength campaign for Special K in the U.K. and big Back to School insert programs across the region. And of course, we'll continue to improve our profit margins across Europe. 
Slide 23 highlights the performance of our Latin American business in the second quarter. We continue to manage well through a difficult business environment. Obviously, Venezuela presents a unique set of challenges, and we're managing that well. We're also operating in a challenging economic environment throughout the region. We're working through these challenges, and in Q2, we realized sequential improvement in sales and profit. And our consumption performance, particularly in cereal, remains solid, with good growth in Mexico and share gains in key markets like Brazil and Colombia. Our Copa America Soccer promotion did well, and innovations like Special K Protein cereal are helping to stabilize that key brand. 
We are realizing price across the region, particularly as we cope with adverse transactional foreign exchange. And while we saw initial price elasticity impact on volumes in Q2, this should help sales and profit in the second half. It's never easy in Latin America, but the team there is managing through the volatility and should see sales and profit growth in the second half. 
Let's look at Slide 24 and our Asia-Pacific business. Our Q2 net sales growth accelerated from Q1 and increased our operating profit margin as well. Our Australia business continued to improve, posting slight sales growth in cereal in the quarter. Of note has been the turnaround in our biggest cereal brand in Australia, Nutri-Grain. In fact, across the entire cereal portfolio, we improved the penetration and gained share in the quarter. 
In Asia, growth was led by distribution gains in Southeast Asia and strong commercial activation in Korea. Our business in Sub-Saharan Africa continues to outpace the cereal category. Pringles in Asia-Pacific grew at a high single-digit rate in Q2, accelerating from Q1. 
It's important not to overlook our joint ventures. The results are not consolidated into our recorded results, but they represent a key element to our emerging markets growth strategy. On a pro forma basis, if they were included in Asia-Pacific's net sales, our growth in Q2 would have been nearly 12% year-on-year. We're generating double-digit growth in China, led by granola cereals, and our West Africa JV also posted strong double-digit growth in spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We expect continued growth in Asia-Pacific in the second half, with added growth from our JVs. 
And now let's wrap up our prepared remarks with a quick summary on Slide 25. Regarding Q2, we continue to make progress on our key priorities for this year, investing in our food, expanding Pringles, enhancing our sales capabilities and executing our savings initiatives. And we're seeing stabilization in key cereal markets like the U.S., Canada and Australia, and we're putting a greater focus on profit margins. We're moving [ph] our productivity initiatives that posted earnings that were slightly better than our expectations. 
As for our 2016 outlook, on a currency-neutral comparable basis, our earnings outlook improves on the strength of inflationary Venezuela. But just as importantly, our operating profit outlook excluding Venezuela, now looks to come in at the higher end of our guidance range, reflecting the rapid expansion of our ZBB effort. And on our longer-term outlook, new initiatives and accelerated programs are giving us better visibility into how we can improve our profitability going forward. This is going to boost our profit margins even as we reshape our portfolio to better align sales to consumer as we continue to expand our footprint and grow markets around the world. We have more to share on this in coming months. 
We'd also take this opportunity to thank our employees around the world for their dedicated service to our company. 
With that, let's open up the line for Q&A."

So can you just talk about the other factors that you've mentioned, like improving mix, revenue management, how those bridge the gap to get you to the 18% target?

And let me just run through some of the elements of that 350 basis points of margin expansion. And remember, that's off of a 2015 base. And it's also important to note that, that expansion is based on essentially a flat sales expectation. So of course, we have a continuation of Project K savings, and we've talked about this before. As we look at 2017, 2018, we have in the range of $130 million to $150 million worth of savings. Our zero-based budgeting program, we communicated for 2016 $150 million to $180 million. We now have visibility for both North America and our international businesses of savings over that period of $450 million to $500 million. So that's over a 3-year period, 2016 through 2018. The other thing, as we discussed, we're doing is we're putting a more concerted effort behind revenue growth management to generate stronger price and mix improvement. So we have a very good line of sight to achieve that margin expansion goal on essentially a flat sales expectation. Of course, our goal would be to do a little bit better on sales. If we do, then 18%, the 350 basis point expansion, is not a ceiling. It's a target or a goal at this point in time, and we have a strong plan and good visibility to get there."

So the importance of TV versus digital, social, mobile, et cetera, all that is changing the mix. As we do that and we apply zero-based budgeting to our principles to that work, we're finding, one, we can do some of the nonworking activity at a lower cost without impacting the amount of activity that we actually do. And secondly, by changing the mix, we can actually get a better impact and potentially at lower cost. So I'm not going to give you guidance over the next few years as where brand building will go, but I think it's fair to say that we probably can see our brand building come down a bit from where it is and continue to drive very strong brands into the future."

I think Kashi is an example of investing to go non-GMO is a major investment by the company. And so we'll continue to ensure our food and packaging is on trend as we go forward. And so there will continue to be investments in that area. So as part of our margin goal, we do have an expectation to reinvest some level of savings back into the business. We are giving a sales guidance here the next couple of years of flat. And that's less than what we would normally do. A couple of reasons for that. One is what we're saying is from an economic model perspective, from an analyst perspective, if you put in flat sales and the 350 basis points of margin expansion, we think that's a good way of modeling the company. Quite frankly, we will shoot to do better than that and actually go to top line from an internal perspective, but we're not relying upon that to get to the operating margin expansion. The margin expansion is coming more from productivity and price/mix realization rather than, say, volume-type growth. In addition to all of that, as we go through next few years, you might see some elasticity as we improve price realization. And we might see some parts of the portfolio that is lower profit that we deemphasize as we continue to grow other parts of our business such as Pringles, which is being grown mid- to high single digits the last couple of years."

I feel very good about the progress we're making on the top line. If you look back over the last 3 or 4 years, we've talked about the importance of stabilizing our large 4-core cereal businesses. I'm happy to say that if you look at the U.S., Canada and Australia, if you look at the measured data, you can see the categories are stable. And our share is stable across those 3 businesses. The U.K. continues to be work in progress. That's why we're not happy with its performance, but we expect to see improving results in the back half of the year in the U.K. So core cereal is looking a lot better, than it was, say a couple of years ago. Special K has been a major drag. In fact, pretty much all the loss of sales the companies had over the last few years has been in Special K. And what you're seeing business in markets like Canada and the U.S., particularly in cereal, that business has stabilized. And we still have some more to do with some snacks extensions of Special K, but we're doing better there. And so we do think that the growth from Pringles and so on will keep coming through. An element of why we're being cautious and saying flat sales again is because, one, we've been, I think, prudent from a modeling perspective. And clearly, if we can get our sales growth, it will give us even more flexibility in the P&L, sort of one. I think we're trying to avoid sort of overstating expectations or cooking expectations. So being prudent on the economics. And secondly, as we do drive for more price realization, as we do deemphasize some more profit elements of the portfolio, we might see some drag on the top line. But it's a drag that I wouldn't be concerned about because we're building a stronger core business over time with a better growth profile. So we think we're just giving prudent guidance at this stage."

It's never productive to comment on competitors, but I'll give you a perspective of how we are looking at the category. For me, the category dynamics appear pretty rational.

Quality merchandising is flat. Features in displays are up. Displays are down. So it's pretty rational of what you'd expect. It is more competitive. And I can tell you as we look at this one from a Kellogg standpoint, our pricing is very similar to what we're seeing in the category. Our price per pound and per unit both in cookies and crackers are up versus year ago in the quarter. But ultimately, in the long run, to win in this category, you have to do 3 things: you've got to invest in your brands; you've got to launch innovation consumers love and you have to drive in-store excitement. And so we're going to continue down our playbook in terms of how to go win in this category, and you'll see us do that both in cookies on Keebler as well as a couple of our regional brands as well as the big 3 in crackers."

We can turn the marketing program on the back half of the year. We had a very strong slate of innovation go through here at the middle of the year. So we expect to see Kashi return to growth in the back half of the year. Now there were some parts of the Kashi business, some frozen pizza, items and some other items that we've culled out in the portfolio, so that might continue to drag on the business, but that will be ultimately lower-margin segments of the portfolio anyway. So we feel good about where we are in Kashi in terms of positioning it for long-term growth. If I could just stay on K in Other because that is a part of the portfolio that did drag in the second quarter. So a few quick comments more broadly on that segment. Three businesses in there. One is Frozen Foods. In Frozen Foods, Eggo is actually doing reasonably well when you add in nonmeasured channels. Morningstar Farms has gone through a very difficult packaging transition that's now complete, turning on the marketing in the back half of the business -- back half year of that [ph] business. And also, we did cull some SKUs on the Eggo business at the end of the last year. So when you add all that together, it's had a bit of a rough first half, but we do expect Frozen Foods to return to growth in the second half of the year. Canada, we've had significant transactional foreign exchange issues in Canada. We've increased our promotional price points. That's going to lead to some disruption in the market. That's going to -- sort of settle its way in. So I think Canada will have a tough year. It's the right long-term decision, but it's going to come with a little bit short-term pain as we go through that. And then Kashi, as I said, we do expect Kashi to return to growth in the back half of year. We feel better about it. So in the back half of year, we have 2 of the 3 businesses within North America Other returning to growth, and we think that the sentiment will be better in the back half than the front half."

Obviously, we're still challenges (sic) [challenged] with our top line growth. Part of this is an industry-wide dynamic, as you all know, and part of this is our exposure to a shift in weight management trends that affected one of our biggest brands, Special K. 
That's why it's so important that we continue to make progress on 4 key priorities we've been updating you on over the past several months: first, investment in food and packaging, which was evident in Kashi, where we completed the conversion of the entire portfolio to non-GMO; in Frozen Foods, where we completed a packaging transition; and in Special K cereal and bars in several markets as we reframed the brand to inner strength. All these investments had the consumer in mind, and all required near-term investment and transition, but all will bring back growth in the future. 
Second, expansion of Pringles, which was reflected in continued growth worldwide, be it because of adding distribution, expanding new platforms like Tortilla or accelerating single-serve offerings. Our old school brand is growing at a solid mid-single-digit rate. 
Third, enhancing our sales capabilities, which continued as we launched broader revenue growth management capabilities in certain business units. This moves us beyond trade optimization and analytics toward price-pack architecture and other ways to ensure that we have the right price on the right pack for the right occasion. We completed the reorganization of our DSD selling and merchandising organization, which will offer improved effectiveness. We continue to expand distribution in high-frequency stores, particularly in emerging markets. This investment in execution will benefit us going forward. 
And finally, but perhaps most important in today's industry environment, we made notable progress in increasing our earnings visibility based on our strong productivity programs. Not only did we record a higher operating profit margin in the quarter, we also made good progress launching and executing initiatives that will improve our margins for the rest of the year and beyond. 
We continue to be on track with Project K. We continue to deliver on zero-based budgeting in North America while rolling it out internationally, and our guidance for 2016 now incorporates higher zero-based budgeting savings, with more of it flowing to earnings. This is a key driver behind our more positive stance towards our 2016 earnings guidance. 
As we stated at our Day at K Investor Day, we recognize that margin expansion is a major opportunity in the food industry, and we are committed to making significant progress against this objective. Today, we are announcing an expansion and acceleration of our margin expansion plans. 
As Slide 4 indicates, we now have a plan that can realize approximately 350 basis points of improvement and a currency-neutral comparable OP margin through the year 2018. This is a bit more and 2 years earlier than previously communicated.
The chart shows you the key drivers of our margin expansion. The first bucket is productivity. We'll continue to generate our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity to offset inflation, and we are expanding zero-based budgeting in the U.S. while rolling it out internationally. Also, we will continue to look for additional Project K initiatives that will help us achieve this 350 basis point improvement with a potential for further savings beyond 2018. 
We've also been looking into ways to improve our price realization. We are now establishing more formal revenue growth management disciplines around the world, an extension of the trade analytics we have always done to help us get better at price realization. 
The next area of focus is investing for impact. Our investment model has to change with today's consumer and technology, and we've been rethinking how we support and build our brands to the highest possible return on investment on every dollar we invest. This could mean less reinvestment going forward and more productivity savings flowing through profit margin. 
The last bucket has to do with making sure our foods are on trend. This involves a more impactful approach to renovation and innovation. 
We are moderating our net sales growth outlook for the next couple of years to roughly flat. This reflects the current industry dynamics, but it also reflects some of these margin expansion efforts, particularly when they touch upon price elasticity and portfolio optimization but enables stronger portfolio and stronger earnings strength. We'll provide more detail in the coming months. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ron to walk you through the financials for Q2 and 2016."

Slide 5 shows highlights to the financial results for the second quarter. Keep in mind that when describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted",1504,"Thanks, John, and good morning. Slide 5 shows highlights to the financial results for the second quarter. Keep in mind that when describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. We do this because we know you prefer this basis for analyzing our underlying business performance. And of course, the appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on both our GAAP and non-GAAP performance. 
Second quarter net sales increased by 8.6%, and like last quarter, these results included the impact of pricing actions in Venezuela. Net sales excluding the impact of Venezuela declined by 2%. Our operating profit increased by 10.6%, driven by savings from Project K and zero-based budgeting in North America as well as by [ph] price increases in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of Venezuela, operating profit increased by 5.3% and exceeded our expectations. 
On a comparable basis, earnings per share were $0.91 in the quarter due to operating profit performance. This included $0.09 of currency headwind, $0.06 of which was due to the mid-2015 currency remeasurement in Venezuela. As a result, currency-neutral comparable earnings were $1 per share for the quarter, which represented a year-over-year increase of 8.7%.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 and the components of the second quarter sales. Volume declined by 1.6% and roughly the same ex Venezuela. We'll discuss some of the markets where we saw declines a little later. Price/mix contributed more than 10 percentage points to sales growth due to the impact of pricing in Venezuela. The price/mix excluding the impact of Venezuela declined by 0.5 percentage point, held down by category, channel and SKU mix in various markets. 
And finally, you can see on the chart that the impact of foreign exchange lowered reported sales growth by 15 points, with almost all of it coming from Venezuela. And on the second half, we will have lapped the Venezuelan remeasurement, so this impact will be much smaller. 
Slide 7 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Venezuela's inflation and currency remeasurement can be a bit distorted, but you can see that excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was flat in the quarter and very close to flat for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and zero-based budgeting initiatives all delivered as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America, where our gross profit margin increased meaningfully in spite of investment in food at Kashi, adverse transactional currency impact in Canada and some adverse mix in Morning Foods and Snacks. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance were gross margin declines across our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by the adverse transactional currency impacts on dollar-based commodities and other inputs and a deflationary retailer environment in Europe. 
Slide 8 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating profit margin excluding Venezuela for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points in the second quarter. It was led by North America, which is where we have rolled out ZBB. Operating margin was up internationally as well, though expansion was a bit more modest, owing to the gross margin pressures described previously and to the fact the zero-based budgeting is just starting up in these regions. 
Slide 9 summarizes the regional financial performance for the second quarter on a currency-neutral comparable basis. I'll focus on the profit and margin performance, and then Deanie and John will follow with more color around the top line. The first thing that you'll notice is that excluding Venezuela from Latin America, every region posted profit growth and margin expansion in the quarter. In North America, operating profit increased by 5% as savings programs more than offset a decline in sales. Operating margin improved by 1.4 points, driven by Project K savings, the ZBB initiative and lower net input costs. 
In Europe, operating profit increased by 4% on flat sales, with an operating margin that increased by 0.5 point, largely on efficiencies and timing of brand building as well as savings in overhead. 
In Latin America, operating profit increased substantially because of inflationary Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, operating profit also increased by 4%. Operating margin, excluding Venezuela, improved by nearly a full point, led by price realization and cost management programs. 
Asia-Pacific's operating profit jumped by a little more than 17% in the quarter, partially driven by sales growth. Operating margin increased by nearly 1 full point as the timing of investments more than offset unfavorable transactional currency impacts. 
Slide 10 shows our cash flow for the first half of the year. You may recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by approximately $145 million. Related to that, we did get a cash tax benefit in the second quarter, so the net after-tax cash impact of the tender year-to-date is approximately $97 million. And still, our year-to-date cash flow through the second quarter was $399 million, which is about $76 million better than that for the year-ago period. And importantly, we continued to reduce our core working capital as a percentage of sales both sequentially and year-on-year. This improvement was, again, led by the accounts payable initiative that has been benefiting working capital over the last year. 
We are still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital expenditures. Full year capital spending should still be in a range between 4% and 5% of sales, including investments for Pringles' growth and Project K. 
We bought back shares worth approximately $176 million in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $386 million, all this under our current $1.5 billion authorization. 
Slide 11 shows our latest guidance for the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Our net sales guidance does not change, but we believe we will come in at the low end of the 0% to 2% range that excludes Venezuela. Our operating profit guidance moves higher because of Venezuela's profit performance in the first half. And excluding Venezuela, we are not changing our guidance range, but we expect to achieve the high end of the 4% to 6% range. This is related to zero-based budgeting, which is now projected to deliver roughly $150 million to $180 million of savings in this year. North America has confirmed more savings than anticipated, and our international regions now have savings commencing in the second half. We're allowing more of our projected savings to flow through the bottom line, more than offsetting the impact of sales coming in toward the lower end of our guidance range. 
Between these higher ZBB savings and the performance of our Venezuela business, we expect our currency-neutral comparable earnings per share to be about $0.11 higher than the range we gave previously. I will point out that on a comparable basis, including currency, our earnings per share outlook range actually comes down $0.06, owing to further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. 
Our increased outlook for operating profit has been offset by a higher average share count due to an increase in share price and dilution from options activity. This $0.06 of additional negative currency translation is from the British pound primarily, following the vote to exit the European Union. From a phasing standpoint, the additional $0.06 of impact from currencies is evenly spread across Q3 and Q4. Remember, the impact of Venezuela is immaterial in our second half as we have lapped the year-ago remeasurement. But Q3 earnings per share will be a little lighter than Q4, owing to the timing of investment, particularly around the Olympics and some media campaigns that were shifted from the first half into the third quarter. 
Slide 12 shows other elements of our guidance. And first, you can see the currency impacts we just talked about. Interest expense should come in at around $400 million, which includes roughly $150 million from the bond tender, which has been excluded from our comparable results. Our comparable tax rate will be approximately 27%. Share buybacks are expected to be approximately $700 million to $750 million. Though, as I said, a higher share price and increased options exercises will translate into a higher average shares outstanding. 
Full year upfront costs remain consistent with our original guidance of between $200 million and $250 million or approximately $0.40 to $0.50 per share, net of tax, about half of which should be in cost of goods. And full year integration cost is still anticipated to be between $0.02 and $0.03 per share, net of tax. For both the upfront costs and integration costs, we are showing on the slide a post-tax status as well for new disclosure rules. 
And with that, we'll now discuss the performance and outlook of each of our business units. We'll start with our largest business, U.S. Snacks. And with us today is Deanie Elsner, President of U.S. Snacks."

We compete",1191,"Thanks, Ron, and hello, everybody. Let's go to Slide 13. Before we jump into our Q2 results, let me quickly reground you on what I told you back at November's Day at K Investor Presentation. First, we're a big business with good profitability. We compete in 5 different categories, each with their own dynamics and in different aisles of the store. Second, we have a strong portfolio of great brands, which participate in the mega consumer trend towards snacking. This slide points out the size of some of our key brands. Third, and importantly, I laid out the opportunities that exist to get this business back to growth again, and I shared with you the key priorities we're focused on this year. Among those were the following: first, expand our margins; next, shift investment to our growth brands, the brands most aligned to today's consumer; next, expand on-the-go formats to reach consumers across occasions and channels; and finally, stabilize Special K. Today, I want to give you a progress report on each of these priorities. 
Let's start with how we're improving our profit margins in [ph] Slide 14. As you know, we're driving significant productivity through Project K and ZBB. I'm happy to say that we're on track with these savings. We're also institutionalizing a broader, more disciplined approach to revenue growth management. We started with Cheez-It, where we evaluated the price points of our offerings across channels from large sizes to on-the-go and single-serve, and we're assessing how we invest our trade dollars. In-market for Cheez-It demonstrates the early impact of this effort. Year-to-date consumption is up 5%, led by volume and strong price/mix. Base sales, up 7.6%, and we've increased distribution more than 7% behind an expansion of our price-pack architecture. The brand also posted improved profit margin. 
Across our portfolio, our efforts on productivity, cost savings and revenue management are paying off. Our currency-neutral comparable operating margin is up year-on-year, both in Q2 and Q1. In fact, year-to-date, that margin is up 120 basis points. So good progress on margin expansion in Snacks, with more to come. 
Our second priority was to shift our investment to the brands that could give us the strongest growth. This is represented on Slide 15. To optimize our return on investment, we concentrated our spend behind our best brands. In crackers, we're investing behind our big 3: Cheez-It, Club and Town House. All 3 of these brands grew consumption in Q2 and year-to-date. Collectively, they are also gaining share in Q2 and year-to-date. Pringles grew consumption nearly 3% year-to-date. Our core 4 flavors, where we're putting the most emphasis on the shelf, increased consumption 9% year-to-date, and our single-serve offerings have grown at a double-digit rate. So as we get past some phased-out non-core items in the second half, you'll see accelerated growth for us in salty snacks. 
In cookies, we've turned on media for the first time in years on the Keebler brand, introducing a whole new generation to the Elves in the Hollow Tree. It's early days, but the Keebler brand turned to consumption growth in Q2. 
In wholesome snacks, Rice Krispies Treats grew consumption by 4.5% in the quarter, and Nutri-Grain grew consumption by more than 5%. This means that 2/3 of our wholesome portfolio delivered healthy growth in Q2. Focusing our investment on our growth brands is a key element of our plan this year, and we're seeing good results. 
Slide 16 talks about our third priority: expanding our on-the-go offerings and distribution. We know consumers are snacking more and on more occasions. But we've been missing out on many of these occasions by not having the right pack format in the right channel. This has been a key area of focus for us in 2016. We're expanding formats or pack types across channels to better meet consumers' needs. We've expanded our line of smaller-size and single-serve offerings. We've gained distribution, and we've even added capacity where needed, as with Pringles Snack Stacks and small cans. An example of this is our crackers and cookies caddies or our multipacks -- our multipack of single-serve items. They have grown consumption year-to-date by 10%, accelerating in the latest 4 weeks. Similarly, our Pringles on-the-go products are up double digits. As we launched this new product or these new formats, we're swapping out less relevant SKUs to ensure a more proactive approach to portfolio management. This will result in the in-market data looking a bit mixed today but improving in the second half. This is a big growth opportunity for us, and we are encouraged by the results. 
The final priority we discussed with you at Day at K is stabilizing Special K, represented on Slide 17. We discussed how the shift in weight management trends have had a negative impact on Special K and how that, more than anything else, has pulled down our sales over the past few years. So taking a page from the cereal playbook, we're overhauling Special K's snacks portfolio to drive consumer relevance and reconsideration. We've done a lot of work over the last year renovating some of the Special K SKUs and launching on-trend foods like Special K Nourish, Chewy Nut Bars, and we're seeing positive results. Our Nourish bars are 80% incremental to the Special K Bars line, and importantly, the velocities in Q2 were 3x greater than the rest of the Special K product portfolio. So when we get the food right, this brand can grow. The challenge is that there are food forms in this brand that are simply not as well aligned to how our consumers are eating today. That's why in Q2, consumption for certain lines of Special K declined at a double-digit rate. Stabilizing Special K is mission-critical for us. In 2017, we will make a more aggressive portfolio change to the Special K brand, but we expect to continue experiencing some drag from Special K in the second half of 2016. 
So I'll use our Q2 and rest-of-year outlook as a summary of everything we've discussed, and that's on Slide 18. We're improving our profit margins in this business. We saw that in our Q2 results, and we should continue to see profitability improvement in the second half. Our most important brands are growing, and we'll continue to invest in these brands in the second half. We still have drags on our top line, most notably, Special K, but we anticipate less of a drag in the second half. In Q2, we also felt the impact of some timing-related factors from shifting promotion in addition to the completion of our DSD reorganization. But that is behind us, and we've already started to see signs of improved effectiveness. 
So we have a lot of work going on in U.S. Snacks. In the first half of this year, we've improved our profit margins and grown our focus brands, even as we addressed the drags from Special K and our non-core portions of this portfolio. This gives us the confidence that we will see improved results in the second half. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."
283356,367414049,1026308,"Kellogg Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Deanie. Let's turn to Slide 19 and walk through our business segments' Q2 performance and full year outlook. In U.S. Morning Foods, like Snacks, our margin expansion efforts are clearly bearing fruit. Project K savings and ZBB efficiencies contr",1364,"Thanks, Deanie. Let's turn to Slide 19 and walk through our business segments' Q2 performance and full year outlook. 
In U.S. Morning Foods, like Snacks, our margin expansion efforts are clearly bearing fruit. Project K savings and ZBB efficiencies contributed to an expansion in operating profit margin of nearly 4 points, an acceleration from Q1's strong performance. In cereal, the category came back to flat after a down Q1, which is encouraging. Our share was up slightly in the quarter mainly due to the timing of promotional activity that our core 6 brands held firm and remain up in share year-to-date. Toaster pastries, meanwhile, continued to perform well, growing consumption by 5%, with good contribution from the new soda flavors. 
As we look to the second half of the year, we continue to expect improvement in top line performance, particularly the timing of promotions, like the Olympics. We feel good about our business, and strong profit margin expansion should continue to drive profit growth. 
U.S. Specialty Channels is shown on Slide 20. This segment posted another quarter of growth in sales, profit and profit margins in Q2. In Foodservice, we sustained strong growth in cereal, crackers, veggie and wholesome snacks, all categories with leading shares. In Convenience, we gained share in cereal, salty snacks and crackers. Innovation continues to perform well, and we feel good about the momentum we have in our business. 
We also feel good about our profit margin performance, which continued in Q2. Good price realization and the early benefits of zero-based budgeting are resulting in improved profitability. We expect this to continue in the second half. 
Rounding out North America, on Slide 21 is our North America Other segment. During Q2, our North America Other segment posted the lowest sales and profit as each of its component businesses progressed through transitions. The U.S. Frozen Foods is an example of a portfolio in transition as we have reshaped the portfolio for Eggo and transitioned to new packaging across the entire Morningstar Farms line. Even as we've made these major moves, this business posted improvement in profit margins, driven by Project K and zero-based budgeting. 
Kashi has also commenced [ph] a major overhaul of its portfolio. We are investing heavily in our food. During the quarter, we completed an overhaul of our portfolio, making every product non-GMO verified. We also launched several new products. In fact, we believe this is the most innovation launched in Kashi's history. And finally, we have redesigned our packaging across our Kashi portfolio. 
In Canada, we leaned into the price realization in order to cover the transactional currency impact on our cost of goods. This caused some elasticity impact on consumption in the quarter, but it will help us better offset our adverse cost going forward. The good news is that we continue to see share gains in our renovated and repositioned Special K. So the North America Other segment is clearly in transition, and we expect to see gradual improvement in sales and profit margins in the second half. 
Turning to Slide 22 and Europe. We've been expecting sequential improvement in sales and profit in Europe. We saw that in Q2. Sales were flat following Q1's slight decline, and our operating profit margin expansion led to better profit growth. We're extremely pleased with our Pringles business, which grew at a double-digit rate. 
Wholesome snacks also had another good quarter, growing at a mid-single-digit rate, led by U.K.'s 5.5% consumption growth and broad-based improvement in trends in most markets. Cereal, though, was disappointing in Q2, mainly in the U.K. The category there remains very soft in a difficult economic and retail environment, and we lost share. Management [ph] work to reposition and renovate Special K. While our efforts to renovate Special K's food and new inner strength positioning are ongoing and while new Nourish is doing well, this recovery may take some time. The good news is that in our other cereal markets, including France/Benelux, Southern Europe and Northern Europe, we did see sequential improvement, and we continued to generate double-digit growth in Russia. 
As we look to the second half, we continue to expect sequential improvement in Europe in sales and profit, which will require progress in stabilizing U.K. Cereal. We have plans in place to address this, including an exciting Olympics program and the Inner Strength campaign for Special K in the U.K. and big Back to School insert programs across the region. And of course, we'll continue to improve our profit margins across Europe. 
Slide 23 highlights the performance of our Latin American business in the second quarter. We continue to manage well through a difficult business environment. Obviously, Venezuela presents a unique set of challenges, and we're managing that well. We're also operating in a challenging economic environment throughout the region. We're working through these challenges, and in Q2, we realized sequential improvement in sales and profit. And our consumption performance, particularly in cereal, remains solid, with good growth in Mexico and share gains in key markets like Brazil and Colombia. Our Copa America Soccer promotion did well, and innovations like Special K Protein cereal are helping to stabilize that key brand. 
We are realizing price across the region, particularly as we cope with adverse transactional foreign exchange. And while we saw initial price elasticity impact on volumes in Q2, this should help sales and profit in the second half. It's never easy in Latin America, but the team there is managing through the volatility and should see sales and profit growth in the second half. 
Let's look at Slide 24 and our Asia-Pacific business. Our Q2 net sales growth accelerated from Q1 and increased our operating profit margin as well. Our Australia business continued to improve, posting slight sales growth in cereal in the quarter. Of note has been the turnaround in our biggest cereal brand in Australia, Nutri-Grain. In fact, across the entire cereal portfolio, we improved the penetration and gained share in the quarter. 
In Asia, growth was led by distribution gains in Southeast Asia and strong commercial activation in Korea. Our business in Sub-Saharan Africa continues to outpace the cereal category. Pringles in Asia-Pacific grew at a high single-digit rate in Q2, accelerating from Q1. 
It's important not to overlook our joint ventures. The results are not consolidated into our recorded results, but they represent a key element to our emerging markets growth strategy. On a pro forma basis, if they were included in Asia-Pacific's net sales, our growth in Q2 would have been nearly 12% year-on-year. We're generating double-digit growth in China, led by granola cereals, and our West Africa JV also posted strong double-digit growth in spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We expect continued growth in Asia-Pacific in the second half, with added growth from our JVs. 
And now let's wrap up our prepared remarks with a quick summary on Slide 25. Regarding Q2, we continue to make progress on our key priorities for this year, investing in our food, expanding Pringles, enhancing our sales capabilities and executing our savings initiatives. And we're seeing stabilization in key cereal markets like the U.S., Canada and Australia, and we're putting a greater focus on profit margins. We're moving [ph] our productivity initiatives that posted earnings that were slightly better than our expectations. 
As for our 2016 outlook, on a currency-neutral comparable basis, our earnings outlook improves on the strength of inflationary Venezuela. But just as importantly, our operating profit outlook excluding Venezuela, now looks to come in at the higher end of our guidance range, reflecting the rapid expansion of our ZBB effort. And on our longer-term outlook, new initiatives and accelerated programs are giving us better visibility into how we can improve our profitability going forward. This is going to boost our profit margins even as we reshape our portfolio to better align sales to consumer as we continue to expand our footprint and grow markets around the world. We have more to share on this in coming months. 
We'd also take this opportunity to thank our employees around the world for their dedicated service to our company. 
With that, let's open up the line for Q&A."

So even if we assume some incremental savings on international ZBB, right now, the formal cost savings seem to give you visibility to about half to 2/3 of the margin that you're targeting if that all kind of flows through to the bottom line. So can you just talk about the other factors that you've mentioned, like improving mix, revenue management, how those bridge the gap to get you to the 18% target? And are you comfortable that there's enough margin for error in your model and in your sort of cost savings pipeline that you can definitely reach that target, even in the event of weaker volumes or higher inflation?"

And let me just run through some of the elements of that 350 basis points of margin expansion. And remember, that's off of a 2015 base. And it's also important to note that, that expansion is based on essentially a flat sales expectation. So of course, we have a continuation of Project K savings, and we've talked about this before. As we look at 2017, 2018, we have in the range of $130 million to $150 million worth of savings. Our zero-based budgeting program, we communicated for 2016 $150 million to $180 million. We now have visibility for both North America and our international businesses of savings over that period of $450 million to $500 million. So that's over a 3-year period, 2016 through 2018. The other thing, as we discussed, we're doing is we're putting a more concerted effort behind revenue growth management to generate stronger price and mix improvement. So we have a very good line of sight to achieve that margin expansion goal on essentially a flat sales expectation. Of course, our goal would be to do a little bit better on sales. If we do, then 18%, the 350 basis point expansion, is not a ceiling. It's a target or a goal at this point in time, and we have a strong plan and good visibility to get there."

As we do that and we apply zero-based budgeting to our principles to that work, we're finding, one, we can do some of the nonworking activity at a lower cost without impacting the amount of activity that we actually do. And secondly, by changing the mix, we can actually get a better impact and potentially at lower cost. So I'm not going to give you guidance over the next few years as where brand building will go, but I think it's fair to say that we probably can see our brand building come down a bit from where it is and continue to drive very strong brands into the future."

We are giving a sales guidance here the next couple of years of flat. And that's less than what we would normally do. A couple of reasons for that. One is what we're saying is from an economic model perspective, from an analyst perspective, if you put in flat sales and the 350 basis points of margin expansion, we think that's a good way of modeling the company. Quite frankly, we will shoot to do better than that and actually go to top line from an internal perspective, but we're not relying upon that to get to the operating margin expansion. The margin expansion is coming more from productivity and price/mix realization rather than, say, volume-type growth. In addition to all of that, as we go through next few years, you might see some elasticity as we improve price realization. And we might see some parts of the portfolio that is lower profit that we deemphasize as we continue to grow other parts of our business such as Pringles, which is being grown mid- to high single digits the last couple of years."

I'm happy to say that if you look at the U.S., Canada and Australia, if you look at the measured data, you can see the categories are stable. And our share is stable across those 3 businesses. The U.K. continues to be work in progress. That's why we're not happy with its performance, but we expect to see improving results in the back half of the year in the U.K. So core cereal is looking a lot better, than it was, say a couple of years ago. Special K has been a major drag. In fact, pretty much all the loss of sales the companies had over the last few years has been in Special K. And what you're seeing business in markets like Canada and the U.S., particularly in cereal, that business has stabilized. And we still have some more to do with some snacks extensions of Special K, but we're doing better there. And so we do think that the growth from Pringles and so on will keep coming through. An element of why we're being cautious and saying flat sales again is because, one, we've been, I think, prudent from a modeling perspective. And clearly, if we can get our sales growth, it will give us even more flexibility in the P&L, sort of one. I think we're trying to avoid sort of overstating expectations or cooking expectations. So being prudent on the economics. And secondly, as we do drive for more price realization, as we do deemphasize some more profit elements of the portfolio, we might see some drag on the top line. But it's a drag that I wouldn't be concerned about because we're building a stronger core business over time with a better growth profile.

We can turn the marketing program on the back half of the year. We had a very strong slate of innovation go through here at the middle of the year. So we expect to see Kashi return to growth in the back half of the year. Now there were some parts of the Kashi business, some frozen pizza, items and some other items that we've culled out in the portfolio, so that might continue to drag on the business, but that will be ultimately lower-margin segments of the portfolio anyway. So we feel good about where we are in Kashi in terms of positioning it for long-term growth. If I could just stay on K in Other because that is a part of the portfolio that did drag in the second quarter. So a few quick comments more broadly on that segment. Three businesses in there. One is Frozen Foods. In Frozen Foods, Eggo is actually doing reasonably well when you add in nonmeasured channels. Morningstar Farms has gone through a very difficult packaging transition that's now complete, turning on the marketing in the back half of the business -- back half year of that [ph] business. And also, we did cull some SKUs on the Eggo business at the end of the last year. So when you add all that together, it's had a bit of a rough first half, but we do expect Frozen Foods to return to growth in the second half of the year. Canada, we've had significant transactional foreign exchange issues in Canada. We've increased our promotional price points. That's going to lead to some disruption in the market. That's going to -- sort of settle its way in. So I think Canada will have a tough year. It's the right long-term decision, but it's going to come with a little bit short-term pain as we go through that. And then Kashi, as I said, we do expect Kashi to return to growth in the back half of year. We feel better about it. So in the back half of year, we have 2 of the 3 businesses within North America Other returning to growth, and we think that the sentiment will be better in the back half than the front half."

I'm happy to report Q3 profit and earnings that came in ahead of our expectations. A lower tax rate was positive over [ph] delivery, but so is broad-based profit margin expansion that exceeded our expectations. Candidly, top line growth did not come in as we had hoped, and there were specific factors behind that, which we'll discuss in a moment. But we did see growth and sequential improvement in many parts of our business. 
Behind the numbers, there's great progress being made not only against our strategy, as represented by our 2020 Growth Plan, but also against the key business priorities we laid out for you 1 year ago at our Day at K investor event. These efforts should continue to yield sequential improvement in our results. We saw it in Q3 and we'll see it again in Q4, finishing the year largely as we originally expected in [ph] operating profit, albeit to more by margin expansion and less by net sales growth. And this improvement will continue into 2017 as we continue to believe we have the right plans to bring sales at least to flat and enough productivity initiatives to drive us well on our way to a 350 basis point improvement goal we have set for 2015 to 2018 on a currency-neutral comparable basis, excluding Venezuela. 
Today, Ron, the Region Presidents and I will take you through our results, progress and outlook. And we use as a basis for measurement the priorities we shared with you back at Day at K.
I will start by reminding you of the 2020 Growth Plan, which we unveiled to you at last November's Day at K investor event and which is shown on Slide 5. There are 2 important points to make here. First, that this growth plan is informing our investment decisions, and our 2016 priorities were all geared toward delivering on this strategy. As we discuss our progress against our 2016 priorities, we are really discussing our progress against this 2020 Growth Plan. 
The second point is that our acceleration of profit margin expansion is by no means a change in strategy. OP margin expansion has always sat [ph] front and center of our 2020 Growth Plan. And there's more to this profit margin expansion than simply executing initiatives. A couple of months ago, we told you about how we are refreshing our Volume to Value operating model for today's environment. Volume to Value is being embraced and measured throughout the organization. This should give you another reason to believe in our 2018 margin expansion target. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's walk through our progress against our strategy. On Slide 6, we recount the 2016 priorities we shared with you at Day at K 1 year ago. Clearly, there is tangible progress being made. We set to stabilize our 4 largest cereal markets: U.S., Canada, Australia and U.K. We have invested in food, repositioned Special K, focused our marketing resources behind highest ROI brands and activities, and we have made substantial progress in all but the U.K., which is a work in progress. 
Expanding Pringles worldwide has been a priority for this year. And in Q3, we continue to see good growth in that brand. Emerging markets have been dramatically scaled up through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we've grown organically in these emerging markets as well. 
Enhancing our sales capabilities was another priority, and we've rolled out revenue growth management disciplines, processes and tools around the world. We said this was necessary for price realization, and we've seen our price realization go from being down slightly in the first half to being flat in Q3, with an expectation of slightly positive price realization in Q4. 
Also regarding sales capabilities, we just announced our biggest ever acquisition in Latin America, which will not only give us much needed scale in Brazil, but also gives us the ability to leverage a very strong reach into high-frequency stores. 
Increasing earnings visibility through [ph] deep productivity and savings initiatives has been a key priority for us this year, and it's already showing up in our results, with Q3 recording yet another year-on-year gain in OP margin. We're delivering on our productivity initiatives, we're shifting our brand building to higher ROI brands and investments, and we're starting [ph] to turn around our price realization. So good progress is being made even if our top line has not yet reflected it. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ron, who will talk you through our financial results, risk [ph] and outlook."

Slide #7 shows highlights of the financial results for the third quarter. In describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. The appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on our GAAP and non-GAAP performance.
Third quarter net sales decreased modestly and came in short of our expectations, but our operating profit increased, driven by savings from Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting as well as by price increases in Venezuela. This exceeded our expectations, and we generated this solid profit growth and margin expansion across all of our regions, making good progress toward our 2018 operating margin expansion goal. Earnings per share exceeded our expectations, not only because of profit margin expansion, but also due to a lower effective tax rate. This performance included $0.04 of currency headwind or about 4 to 5 percentage points of EPS growth impact. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and the components of the third quarter sales. Our currency-neutral comparable net sales declined in the third quarter, and this included unexpected trade inventory decreases in U.S. Cereal and Pop-Tarts, continued softness in U.K. Cereal and a more prolonged transition on shelf for our overhauled [ph] Kashi and Morningstar Farms portfolios. The good news is we saw growth in several businesses, including U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty Channels, Asia Pacific and Latin America, both with and without Venezuela. And we continue to post good growth in Pringles across the globe.
Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was up 60 basis points in the quarter and a bit less for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting initiatives all delivered savings as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America where our gross profit margin improved year-on-year even despite investment in food, adverse transactional foreign currency impact in Canada and adverse mix in snacks, driven by softness in our wholesome snacks business. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance were gross margin declines in our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by adverse transactional foreign currency impact on dollar-based commodities and other inputs as well as a deflationary retailer environment in Europe. But they also reflected adverse country and category mix. Project K, Zero-Based Budgeting and the rollout of revenue growth management are designed to address our gross profit margin performance going forward. 
Slide 10 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating margin, excluding Venezuela, for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by nearly a full percentage point in the third quarter. And by Zero-Based Budgeting and Project K efforts, we generated substantial efficiencies in our SG&A expenses. It's important to note that Q3's margin expansion was broad-based, with operating margin up year-on-year in all 4 of our regions. 
Slide 11 shows our cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow to the third quarter was more than 10% higher than that of the year-ago period. And recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by $97 million after tax. Importantly, we continued to improve our core working capital as a percent of sales, both sequentially and year-on-year. We're still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital spending. And full year capital spending should come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of $525 million to $625 million, reflecting greater efficiency and the prioritization of projects. 
Slide 12 shows how we expect to end the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis so that we can remove volatility from currency translation and mark-to-market adjustments. We expect sequential improvement in our x Venezuela net sales performance in the fourth quarter. The current trends had led us to adjust our outlook. So instead of finishing flat on sales for the year, as was our previous guidance, we now believe sales will be a little less than that, probably down about 1%. 
Our operating profit guidance remains unchanged at the high end of the 4% to 6% growth range, excluding Venezuela, thanks to our productivity efforts and our savings performance. We should see our operating margin exceed 15% in 2016, putting us well on the path toward our goal of increasing our margin by 350 basis points between 2015 and 2018. 
On earnings per share, we are raising our guidance both on a comparable and currency-neutral comparable basis. This reflects the tax rate favorability we recorded in the third quarter, which should more than offset any increase in our average shares outstanding as we curb share repurchases in the fourth quarter to fund our acquisition in Brazil. 
A couple of words on the financial impact of the Parati acquisition, which we expect to close later this year. that [ph] the acquisition is neutral to our comparable basis earnings per share in 2016, even after the effect of curbing share buybacks in the quarter in order to maintain current debt levels. Integration costs are expected to amount to roughly $0.01 per share in 2016, but this merely puts us at the top end of our previously announced range of $0.02 to $0.03 for the company this year. 
Slide 13 shows some additional elements of our 2016 guidance, and I'll just highlight where there have been changes. First, the currency impact is roughly $0.01 better than previous guidance based on current rates. Our comparable tax rate will now be approximately 25%, reflecting favorability, primarily from the adoption of a new standard on accounting for stock-based compensation at the beginning of the year. Share buybacks should be approximately $450 million to $550 million. And as I mentioned, we're curbing repurchases for the time being to fund the acquisition we are making in Brazil. And full year integration costs are now anticipated to be at the high end of our previous estimate of $0.02 to $0.03 net of tax, and this now does incorporate the roughly $0.01 of closing in integration costs for the Brazil acquisition. 
Slide 14 offers a preliminary view of 2017. As we shared with you previously, we are forecasting net sales to be approximately flat in 2017. In effect, this consists of lower volume, offset by higher price/mix performance as we employ revenue growth management initiatives and adhere to our Volume to Value principles. This flat outlook is prudent in our view even as we strive to do better than flat. Our operating profit should increase at a high single-digit rate in 2017 as our operating margin expansion makes up about half of the remaining basis points of our 350 basis point challenge through 2018. 
As discussed previously, the key drivers of the expansion will be the following: our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity designed to mitigate input cost inflation, revenue growth management to improve our price/mix contribution, Project K savings and Zero-Based Budgeting efficiencies. We believe these initiatives give us good visibility into our margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. 
Slide 15 shows our 350 basis point profit margin expansion target through 2018, and it shows how this shapes up across our 4 regions. This is essentially an update of a chart we showed at Day at K last year, only accelerated forward to 2018 from previously 2020. As you can see, we are taking a prudent view towards net sales growth, particularly in the more developed North America and Europe regions. We believe this is the right way to forecast net sales growth, particularly in the current environment, but we aspire to do better than this. Our operating profit margin expansion skews heavily towards North America and Europe. These are our bigger businesses with strong productivity savings opportunities. In Latin America and Asia Pacific, we will be pursuing similar initiatives, but the impact isn't quite as large, as we are still on early stages of scaling up emerging markets [ph] in these regions. 
Before I pass the call over to the regions, let's briefly take a look at Slide 16. This is a recap versus what we shared with you at Day at K, focusing on our financial goals. Simply put, in 2016, we're delivering on everything we said we would, with the exception of net sales growth. We are on track to come in at the high end of our operating profit goal and exceeding our goal on currency-neutral comparable earnings per share. We have accelerated our target for operating margin expansion, expecting to reach it 2 years earlier. We're delivering on our productivity and Project K savings and have expanded our Zero-Based Budgeting program. And we've made acquisitions that perfectly fit our strategic imperatives, while being fiscally prudent and continuing to deliver strong cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility. So we made good progress towards our financial goals. 
We're now going to turn it over to each of our Region Presidents, who will give you a closer look at the results, priorities and outlooks for their respective businesses. We'll start with Paul Norman, our President of North America."

No question that 2016 has been a busy year for us here in North America. Admittedly, the results have been a bit mixed, with top line not recovering as quickly as I'd hoped, but profit margin expansion exceeding our expectations. There's been a lot more progress than our top line would suggest. 
If we turn to Slide 18, we can see the priorities we set out for ourselves for 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K investor event. Stabilizing our Cereal business was our priority. While the category was held at a 1% rate of decline, this is significantly better than in recent years. We have invested in food. We prioritized investment behind our core brands, and we've gained share as a result. And we're particularly pleased with how we stabilized Special K.
We also said we have to revitalize our Snacks business. The consumption data shows that our efforts to prioritize investment behind our most important and on-trend brands are working. We're growing our big 3 cracker brands, we're growing Pringles and we're growing Rice Krispies Treats. And across our portfolio, consumption is up double digit in on-the-go offerings. 
Frozen and Kashi are still works in progress. Much of the heavy-lifting has been done, with packaging overhauls now largely behind us in Frozen, and Kashi's transformation of its portfolio already contribution -- contributing, sorry, to stabilization in Cereal. We have plans to stabilize our other Kashi categories, too.
Fuel for growth refers to all the things we're doing to improve our profit margins. From executing our Project K network restructuring and shared services model to delivering on Zero-Based Budgeting, we are generating fuel for growth, and you can see it in our increased profit margins this year. We've also launched a more comprehensive approach to revenue growth management, which is already showing positive signs. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's discuss each of our North America segments in turn, starting with our 2016 results and then looking ahead to 2017. We'll start with Morning Foods on Slide #19. Morning Foods posted another quarter of solid operating profit growth, with improvements in our margins coming from our productivity efforts [ph] under ZBB and Project K. Top line came in a little lighter than we had expected, and this was due to an unexpected reduction in trade inventories. Our Cereal consumption was down about 1% and in line with our year-to-date trend. Now Pop-Tarts consumption was actually up about 1%, so shipments clearly lacked consumption in the quarter. 
Our underlying progress is clear. We gained 20 basis points of share in cereal and 50 basis points of share in toaster pastries. Our core 6 cereal brands continue to benefit from focused investment, leading our share gain. Year-to-date, Kellogg has most of the highest velocity 2016 innovations in ready-to-eat cereal, maintaining innovation share leadership, led by Special K Nourish, S'Mores and our Finding Dory-licensed cereal.
We executed well during the Back to School period, which coincided with our Olympics activation. This year's Olympics program generated over 1.8 billion impressions at 30% less cost than our prior Summer Olympics programs. This was driven by a greater focus on social activation, and it demonstrates our new marketing model at work. So we continue to improve the underlying fundamentals on our business. As we look to Q4, we expect to see Morning Foods sales down slightly again, but down less than we saw in Q3. And we expect to see continued margin expansion resulting in strong operating profit growth. 
Slide 20 offers a few thoughts on 2017 for Morning Foods. We will look to build momentum, expecting to see sequential improvement in top line and another year of strong profit margin expansion. Our plan to achieve this revolves around the 4 ingredients Craig Bahner outlined a year ago. Firstly, ensuring we have food that rocks through great innovation and value-adding renovation against our second priority, brands that matter, namely our core 6 cereal brands and Pop-Tarts. Thirdly, we will continue to drive excitement through events and properties that drive category engagement and fun in store. Helping this will be the recent completion of a further expansion of our sales force, adding more feet to the street. Fourth and finally, we will continue to expand margins through Project K, ZBB discipline, revenue growth management and a higher return on investment on every marketing dollar we invest. This should keep us on the path towards the 2018 goals that Ron shared a moment ago. 
If I were to highlight a couple of examples of initiatives coming early in 2017 on cereal, I would point to some exciting innovations behind Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran Crunch as well as a core food improvement initiative on one of our biggest brands, Mini-Wheats. We also place continuing focus on driving Special K through the expansion of the Nourish franchise and the renovation of [ph] and round. On Pop-Tarts, following the success of A&W Root Beer and Orange Crush flavors, we have 2 new great Dunkin' Donuts-inspired flavors launching in Q1. 
Let's now turn to Snacks on Slide 21. We saw strong progress in Snacks in the quarter. We continue to realize strong profit margin expansion, thanks to Project K and ZBB. We had planned to stabilize sales, and we did just that. We saw good growth in Q3 by almost all of our focused brands. Let's start with crackers where our big 3 cracker brands, Cheez-It, Club and Town House continue to collectively grow sales and gain share in the quarter. Pringles also grew consumption in the quarter. Rice Krispies Treats continue to grow sales and share, and Nutri-Grain also picked up share. Single-serve, a key element to our Snacks growth strategy, posted double-digit consumption gains in cookies and cracker caddy packs as well as in Pringles Snack Stacks. Legacy weight management offerings, particularly our Special K bars and cracker chips, remained a drag in the quarter, just as we said they would be as we go into more aggressive portfolio actions in early 2017. But even with this drag, the Snacks segment saw good sequential improvement in net sales. 
So Snacks is starting to turn the corner for us. In Q4, we expect to see sequential improvement again in net sales to slight growth. With continued Project K and ZBB efforts as well as the work we're doing on revenue growth management, we expect to generate margin expansion and strong operating profit growth, too. 
Turning to 2017 on Slide 22. For Snacks, our goal next year is to return to top line growth while further improving our margins. Deanie Elsner and her team will continue to drive the agenda they began this year, focusing behind our core brands like Cheez-It, Pringles and Rice Krispies Treats. And they'll continue to do this through a combination of more impactful brand building, innovation and renovation of food and packaging, in-store excitement and small formats to drive consumption in new locations through expanded distribution. Initiatives of note coming early next year are new flavors of Cheez-It Duoz and Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers as well as the launch of a new line of variants under Pringles called Loud. We will also continue to expand single-serve caddy packs and small-format offerings, which we know are highly incremental. 
Our other significant goal next year is to stabilize wholesome snacks. In the first quarter, we will be executing a comprehensive restage of Special K bars [ph] behind new food packaging and communication and bringing significant renovation and innovation to Nutri-Grain also. Revenue growth management will be a key element for us in Snacks. We kicked it off with the Cheez-It brand in late 2015 and are still in the process of expanding it across our whole product line. These efforts, along with continued savings from Project K and ZBB, should boost our Snacks margins again in 2017, keeping us well on pace for our 2018 margin goals. 
Now let's turn to our U.S. Specialty Channels business on Slide 23. This is a critical business for us when it comes to our strategic priority of winning where the shopper shops. And I'm happy to report that this segment continues to turn in steady growth in sales, margins and operating profit. In Q3, we once again delivered growth in all 3 of our core channels: Foodservice, vending and convenience. We held or gained share in 4 of 7 categories in Foodservice; in 3 of 5 in vending; and in 5 of 7 in convenience. This impressive performance was driven by increased distribution, effective promotions around the Olympics, Pringles Summer Jam and a limited time offering of Pop-Tarts as well as strong innovation performance in K-12, including items like wholegrain Rice Krispies Treats and Cheez-It. Meanwhile, revenue growth management and ZBB continue to improve our profit margins in this important business. And we expect more of the same in Q4 with a strong finish to the year across all channels. 
Slide 24 shows some of our expectations for 2017. For Specialty in 2017, Wendy Davidson and her team expect continued top and bottom line momentum across our channels. We plan to take advantage of category growth trends and to further leverage new food and packaging formats to drive brand ubiquity and reach across our core channels. We'll leverage emerging channels to test and learn, just as we've been doing this year with Bear Naked Custom [ph] Granola in direct-to-consumer and in partnered innovation with restaurant chains. We'll also continue to generate margin expansion through revenue growth management and ZBB, with KNA's 2018 profit margin goal squarely in our sights. So we expect another good performance from Specialty in 2017. 
Lastly, we'll discuss our North America [ph] Other segment, which comprise of U.S. Frozen Foods, Canada and Kashi and shown on Slide 25. In truth, I'm disappointed with the results of this segment in the third quarter. Canadian results where [ph] as we had expected. We experienced adverse volume impact in reaction to our increased list prices and feature [ph] prices. These pricing actions were necessary to help offset higher input costs due to significant transactional foreign exchange pressure. The rest of North America Other is undergoing big transformations in food, packaging and SKU lineups. We thought these transitions will be fully behind us by Q3, but they are taking longer than we had expected. 
In Frozen, we recorded good profit margin expansion, but disappointed on the top line. Eggo posted sales growth, with particular success in the quarter behind the Disney-licensed products. But this was more than offset by the impact of distribution loss on Morningstar Farms as we transitioned over the past few quarters to new packaging. 
At Kashi, we're encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in cereal [ph] share in measured channels as well as the plus-5% growth in the natural channel. It means our substantial innovation and renovation efforts are starting to take hold, and we really haven't turned on global-scale [ph] consumer communication yet. So cereal is on its way even if it is still down year-on-year. However, wholesome snacks is proving to be a much bigger drag on sales than we had anticipated. Consumption has declined sharply as distribution losses have continued prior to renovation and innovation interventions coming in 2017. 
Let's look ahead to 2017 on Slide 26. For the North America Other segment, we expect improved sales and profit growth as the Kashi, Frozen and Canadian teams reap the awards of their work to reset in 2016. Overall, we expect to see top line growth in this North America Other segment. Meanwhile, RGM and ZBB as well as lapping some heavy investment in food should lift profit margins strongly. This will get us back on track towards our 2018 margin goals. 
Our Kashi cereal portfolio is poised to return to growth as distribution is stabilized and our innovation pipeline is strong. The recently launched Dark Cocoa Karma Wheat Biscuit Cereal is going very well, and we have an excellent new GOLEAN variant coming in January. Acceptance so far from our customers has been strong. Our largest challenge in 2017 on Kashi will continue to be wholesome snacks. We have renovation and innovation coming earlier [ph] in the year, which will significantly change the trend we have been experiencing. However, I doubt we will get the wholesome snacks part of this business back to growth on the full year. 
In Frozen Foods, our focus is on driving core Eggo, with new taste-oriented [ph] communication breaking in January as well as significant renovation with the removal of artificials from all of our waffles in the first quarter. On Morningstar Farms, we are focused on reactivating communication now that the packaging is on shelf and we have significant innovation building in the first half of the year.  Finally, in Canada, we will be lapping our pricing interventions from this year. And as foreign exchange issues moderate, we expect to see a stabilization of sales and a return to margin expansion. 
So in summary, there's been a ton of work behind the scenes this year in Kellogg North America, all aimed at getting our portfolio more on trend, in-housing our capabilities and execution, and improving profitability. While our top line growth hasn't consistently reflected these efforts yet, it is coming, and we are seeing sequential improvement to go with impressive margin expansion. We are making definitive progress towards the 400 to 450 basis points of operating margin improvement we're targeting through 2018. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Chris Hood, President of Kellogg Europe."
283356,378975174,1068094,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva. For Kellogg Europe, 2016 will be viewed as a year in which we improved our profitability and got most of our business back on track. We've continued to accelerate the growth of Pringles. We've re",967,"Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva. For Kellogg Europe, 2016 will be viewed as a year in which we improved our profitability and got most of our business back on track. We've continued to accelerate the growth of Pringles. We've returned wholesome snacks to growth. We've stabilized our Cereal business in most of the region, and we're growing net sales in 5 of our 6 geographic clusters. The one exception is U.K. Cereal, which makes up just over 20% of our total sales.
U.K. is a market where a sluggish economy and a difficult retail environment have resulted in net price deflation. We've underperformed in our premium adult portfolio, most notably Special K and All-Bran. And this has resulted in sharp sales declines year-to-date in this important market. But it's important not to overlook the good progress we've made elsewhere in the region. 
A good way to assess this progress is Slide #28, where we can compare against the priorities we set out for Kellogg Europe in 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K event. Cereal is stabilizing, with over half of our markets holding or growing share, a significant improvement versus last year. Needless to say, our primary focus right now and into 2017 will be on stabilizing the U.K. business and getting Special K back on track. But we are showing improvement in the rest of Europe, and that was a priority for this year. 
Pringles has been a big success since we acquired this brand in 2012. We're seeing continued, high single-digit growth with broad-based share growth across almost all markets. This marks 4 years in a row of high single-digit growth in this brand, and we're doing this by strengthening the core of the brand and assessing -- accessing new locations and new markets via [ph] additional sizes and geographic expansion. 
Wholesome snacks has returned to growth across Europe in 2016, driven by investing in the renovation of Special K bars and innovation like Kellogg-branded fruit and nut bars. Our emerging markets of Russia and Arabia have made substantial progress despite difficult operating conditions. Our Russian business is up strongly year-to-date. And our acquisitions in Egypt, Bisco Misr and Mass Food, are both growing at a rapid clip as well. As discussed last year, e-commerce is a big channel for us in Europe. This channel represents over $100 million of our sales, $100 million, and we enjoy share premiums in our categories compared to the total market. 
And last, we continue to drive transformational change within our cost structure behind Project K, implementation of shared services, getting started with Zero-Based Budgeting where we're about a year behind North America, and implementing revenue growth management to improve net price realization. We've increased our operating profit margin by 70 basis points already this year and by over 400 basis points over the last 4 years. So there's good progress being made across Europe on the priorities we established last November. Unfortunately, the growth progress is being somewhat masked by difficult market conditions in the U.K. on our Cereal business. Looking forward, we expect to stabilize top line sales and continue to drive strong profit expansion. 
Slide 29 discusses our 2016 results and outlook. As you can see, we posted strong profit growth in Q3. Our sales were up slightly, almost solely due to our Cereal business in the U.K. In the rest of Europe, we posted sales growth in virtually all of our subregions. France Benelux grew high single digits. Southern Europe and the Mediterranean Middle East posted low single-digit growth, and Russia recorded a strong double-digit gain. And we are holding or growing share in over half of our cereal markets while sustaining strong Pringles momentum. 
As we go into Q4, we'll work to drive sequential share improvement on our core brands, and we should post another quarter of margin expansion and profit growth. We will finish 2016 with a slight decline in net sales, but significant profit expansion due to all of our productivity initiatives. 
Turning to Slide #30. Here's how we're thinking about 2017. In combination across Cereal and Snacks, we expect total Europe 2017 sales to be flat to down slightly. We're making good progress on stabilizing our Cereal business in most of Europe. There's already quite a bit of work going on in turning around the U.K. We're simplifying and focusing our operations to drive a stronger core business. We're accelerating the repositioning of the Special K brand behind recently launched on-trend offerings like Special K Nourish, which has been successful elsewhere in the world. We're crafting a better, more balanced commercial plan and we're using revenue growth management to get our prices and pack formats right in order to reverse the deflation that we've been experiencing. 
With all of these plans, we are expecting sequential improvement on U.K. Cereal during 2017, with continued decline, albeit at a moderated pace. 
Pringles still have plenty of room to grow. Food renovation, commercial innovation and geographic expansion will all continue in 2017, and executing our productivity initiatives will continue to be a focus, delivering our expected savings from Project K, global business services and zero-based budgeting are all critical to enabling the investment in food renovation and covering Brexit-related transactional currency impact. 
In summary, we have more work to do, but we are seeing some green shoots of sales recovery, and we are confident that we can bring stability to our European Cereal business while continuing to grow snacks. Meanwhile, we'll continue to boost productivity to drive profitable growth, staying on course toward our 2018 operating profit margin goal of 300 to 350 incremental basis points. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Maria Fernanda Mejia, President of Kellogg Latin America."
283356,378975174,1068094,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone.

Latin America continues to be an important growth opportunity for Kellogg, a key element to the company's 2020 growth than. Our programs are fully aligned to this growth plan, and we're prioritizing investment behind markets like Mexico, Caribbean Central America and Andean, strengthening our leadership in cereal, while expanding our Snacks footprint, and we're building scale in more emerging markets like Brazil. But as you know, nothing is ever simple in Latin America. We have to manage very carefully through an extremely challenging external environment. 
When we met last November during Day at K, we outlined our strategy and key areas of focus for 2016. A year later, I'm pleased to share with you the tremendous progress as shown on Slide 32. Leading category growth is evident from our share growth in many core cereal markets. Our record shares in Wholesome Snacks in Brazil and Colombia and our double-digit growth on Pringles in markets like Mexico. Driving this growth has been innovation. We've expanded our offerings under the Kellogg's parent brand, growing double digit and our most recent introductions for Special K, protein cereal and nut bars are exceeding our expectations. We continue to drive our distribution and sales coverage in high-frequency stores while improving our in-store execution by tailoring our regional commercial programs by retail environment. And we've continued to increase our supply chain network utilization significantly over the past 3 years. We've enabled our innovation platforms, strengthened our packaging capabilities and evolved our business models through partnerships with co-manufacturers, enhancing our speed to market. And we delivered margin improvement through efficiency programs like Project K, KIM and ZBB, all of which are combining with price realization to offset foreign exchange headwinds. So great progress being made across our priorities. 
A driver of market expansion will be M&A, and one of the most exciting transformational components of our growth plan can be seen on Slide 33, our recently announced acquisition of Parati, which we hope to close in the fourth quarter, completely changes the game for us in Brazil, a market where we have been present and where we've been growing for a number of years, but where we've lacked critical scale. With Parati, we more than doubled our size in the high-growth potential Mercosur region, bringing it from just over 10% of Kellogg Latin America sales to over 25%. And we substantially increased our overall presence in Snacks, taking it roughly from 20% of Kellogg Latin America sales to about 1/3. This is a company that plays in attractive categories, with strong brand and a track record of growth. It's largely regional with its foothold in the South, so there is geographic expansion opportunity. It's in high-frequency stores will be leveraged across our Kellogg brand. 
Slide 34 summarizes our performance in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. After a relatively soft first half, driven by region-wide economic slowdown and FX impact, we returned to growth in quarter 3. We saw growth in both cereal and in snacks, and the growth was broad based. Mexico, Mercosur, Caribbean Central America all posted sales growth in the quarter, aided by price realization. For the region, excluding volatile Venezuela, we've held our shares for the Cereal category flat year-to-date, with gains in markets like Brazil, Colombia and Puerto Rico. And in the recent periods, we have seen Mexico regain some share it lost earlier in the year. Snacks is showing strong momentum across the region, both on wholesome and salty. 
Meanwhile, our productivity efforts and price realization are starting to flow through to profit margin, which improved strongly in the third quarter. The team continues to manage well through very difficult economic and currency conditions. And we should not overlook the very good work done to manage through continuous crisis in Venezuela. We are expecting another quarter of sequential acceleration in net sales in the fourth quarter on improved price realization, stronger commercial plans and relevant innovation across categories hitting the stores. And this despite a difficult economic environment in Brazil. Profit margin in the fourth quarter should continue to move higher due to price realization and additional efficiencies generated through our recently launched ZBB initiative. 
On Slide 35, we show our priorities for 2017, and everything starts with our largest market, Mexico. The sequential improvements we're seeing in the second half of 2016 will continue into 2017, with exciting innovation to grow consumption in cereal, continued expansion into the HFS channel, effective brand building and exciting opportunities behind our growing snacks businesses. The integration of Parati in Brazil will be executed flawlessly given our proven success with integrating Pringles several years ago, coupled with our common cultures and complementary businesses. Revenue growth is critical to driving profitable growth, executing our portfolio by retail environment and implementing the right price and size, effective promotions while driving mix will help us generate sales and profitability. And we'll continue our path [indiscernible] supply chain optimization with step changes ahead. 
So in summary, a laser-sharp focus on these priorities should allow us to better manage through current regional volatility and deliver good low single-digit growth and expanded profit margins in 2017. This will put us well on our way toward our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with this, I'll turn it over to Amit Banati, President of Asia Pacific, currently in Singapore."
283356,378975174,1068094,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Maria Fernando, and good morning, well, evening for me in Singapore. We are having a good year in Kellogg Asia Pacific. Our top line growth has been consistent, led by Pringles in emerging market. And our joint ventures are also growing strongly.",824,"Thanks, Maria Fernando, and good morning, well, evening for me in Singapore. We are having a good year in Kellogg Asia Pacific. Our top line growth has been consistent, led by Pringles in emerging market. And our joint ventures are also growing strongly. Profit margins have moved higher, and we have plans to increase them further. And most importantly, we have continued to make progress in our key strategic initiatives, and this will make Asia Pacific a sustainable growth engine for Kellogg for years to come. 
On Slide 37, we show the priorities for Asia Pacific that have been communicated at Day at K last year. In 2016, we continued to make strong progress against our priorities to transform the region. We have a more balanced portfolio. Asia and Africa now account for about 2/3 of the region sales. Snacks now account for about 1/3 of the region sales. We have made good progress in stabilizing our Australian business, particularly in cereal, where we are seeing much better category and share trends. Pringles has delivered strong growth in 2016. 
After 2 years of double-digit growth in Asia, we have seen growth moderate in 2016, primarily due to challenging market conditions in India in the first half of the year. But we are growing overall, and India is recovering in the second half. And in South Africa, we have seen strong growth in both our wholly-owned operations and our joint venture in Nigeria. 
Slide 38 discusses our quarter 3 performance and how we see quarter 4 shaping up. We continue to post increased sales in quarter 3, with Pringles and emerging markets driving the growth. We are seeing our Australian Cereal business stabilize in 2016, with improved consumption and share trends in the Cereal category. The drivers of improved performance include a renovation to 4-star foods of our biggest brand Nutri-Grain, which is now in growth; the launch of a gluten-free range, which is the #1 innovation in the Cereal category year-to-date; and improved execution in stores. 
Our Pringles business had a strong quarter 3, growing sales at a double-digit rate. Growth was driven by distribution expansion in emerging markets and new innovation, expanding the Pringles portfolio such as the introduction of sweet flavors in Korea and the launch of Tortilla across the region. Emerging markets remain a source of growth for the region, with Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia key highlights for us in quarter 3. Quarter 3 sales growth was impacted by Korea lapping the year-ago supply disruption of a major competitor. Growth was also impacted by challenging economic and regulatory conditions in India in the first half, and our snacks business in Australia has remained soft. We have seen sequential improvement in our performance in India and Australia snacks each quarter. As a result, we expect growth to accelerate in quarter 4. This will result in full year sales growth in the low single-digit range. 
Again, it is important not to forget our unconsolidated joint ventures shown on Slide 39. These are a key element of our emerging markets growth strategy. Year-to-date, our joint venture in China and our joint venture and investment stake in Nigeria are both growing at a strong double-digit rate despite operating in very challenging business environments. When you consider that our share of these businesses net sales is equivalent to roughly half the size of our Asia Pacific region, you can understand how significantly they would add to our overall growth if they were consolidated into our results. 
We have strong plans for 2017, represented on Slide 40. We will build on our progress on stabilizing our Australian Cereal business. Turning around our Wholesome Snacks business in Australia will be a key priority. We recently launched Special K Protein bites and Nutri-Grain edge bars, and they are both off to a good start. We have also relaunched the natural brand with new food and packaging. 
Emerging markets will continue to be a growth driver across both cereal and snacks. In cereals, we continue to drive category development in emerging markets, and we will also launch Wholesome Snacks in North Korea and Southeast Asia. We continue to expect strong growth on Pringles behind innovation and distribution expansion in emerging markets as we expand offerings at affordable price points. Small cans now account for 20% of our Pringles sales in the region. 
2017 will also see an increased focus on driving operating margin expansion as we roll out zero-based budgeting and revenue growth management. In terms of outlook, we expect net sales growth in the low single-digit range for Kellogg Asia Pacific in 2017, with sales from our joint ventures in effect bringing that pace of growth much higher. Meanwhile, profit margins should expand, driving higher profit and putting us closer to our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to John Bryant for some final remarks."

That's what Paul was referring to in terms of spending more in digital and less on, say, traditional TV-type advertising program. So we're absolutely committed to driving strong brands, and we think we can do it more efficiently and effectively over time."

We're trying to be, as Ron said, cautious and not planning to come back necessarily in the front [ph] part of the year. Regarding the core 6, our strategy is to drive the core 6 hard, and that means investment in food. That means investment-grade ideas and that means really working our core assorments across all retail environments extremely hard so that we get the maximum amount of those brands. We also need to back to growth next year as well. If we do those things, I think we can be optimistic about the sequential improvement track in front of us in cereals as a company and in cereals as a category back towards flat or better in 2017."

We clearly saw investment in our core foods around say Special K Red Berries, which is a significant part of our lineup, turned the business back to positive growth on a year-to-date basis this year. Case growing and growing share. We see Rice Krispies do extremely well this year, not because of necessarily innovation or renovation because of consumer engagement around recipe usage and versatility, and I think that's driving that brand. Frosted Flakes is another brand that's growing well against teens and tweens this year. So and that again I would say, is driven by in-store activation behind big properties, properties like Finding Dory or the Olympics event. So it's not the same ingredients behind every brand. When it comes to ZBB reinvestment, we have put some money back in the business this year. We're putting it that in our sales force again to drive greater activation right through to the point-of-purchase. So sometimes it's behind a brand. Sometimes is focusing on getting the assortment right and the perfect shelf at store and that takes resources at the store level to do that. We did choose to reinvest in Keebler this year, which obviously isn't a cereal, but that was the choice coming out of ZBB we investment and we've seen positive returns on that. So I do think it comes down to core 6 brands. And the one thing we can do better next year, I believe, is get Kashi back to growth. Kashi responds to many needs out there that some of the Kellogg traditional legacy brands can't. It's growing in the natural channel, 4%, 5%. We need to get it beyond stable to growth in measure channels as well next year. We do that plus the core 6, I think you'll see the categories flatten our and maybe get into growth."

There's no issue with consumer. A lot of the food, we just -- we missed it here and our focused very much in getting back to growth. I foresee growth for Morningstar Farms next year as we go forward.

I'm happy to report Q3 profit and earnings that came in ahead of our expectations. A lower tax rate was positive over delivery, but so is broad-based profit margin expansion that exceeded our expectations. Candidly, top line growth did not come in as we had hoped, and there were specific factors behind that, which we'll discuss in a moment. But we did see growth and sequential improvement in many parts of our business. 
Behind the numbers, there's great progress being made not only against our strategy, as represented by our 2020 Growth Plan, but also against the key business priorities we laid out for you 1 year ago at our Day at K investor event. These efforts should continue to yield sequential improvement in our results. We saw it in Q3 and we'll see it again in Q4, finishing the year largely as we originally expected in operating profit, albeit to more by margin expansion and less by net sales growth. And this improvement will continue into 2017 as we continue to believe we have the right plans to bring sales at least to flat and enough productivity initiatives to drive us well on our way to a 350 basis point improvement goal we have set for 2015 to 2018 on a currency-neutral comparable basis, excluding Venezuela. 
Today, Ron, the Region Presidents and I will take you through our results, progress and outlook. And we use as a basis for measurement the priorities we shared with you back at Day at K.
I will start by reminding you of the 2020 Growth Plan, which we unveiled to you at last November's Day at K investor event and which is shown on Slide 5. There are 2 important points to make here. First, that this growth plan is informing our investment decisions, and our 2016 priorities were all geared toward delivering on this strategy. As we discuss our progress against our 2016 priorities, we are really discussing our progress against this 2020 Growth Plan. 
The second point is that our acceleration of profit margin expansion is by no means a change in strategy. OP margin expansion has always sat front and center of our 2020 Growth Plan. And there's more to this profit margin expansion than simply executing initiatives. A couple of months ago, we told you about how we are refreshing our Volume to Value operating model for today's environment. Volume to Value is being embraced and measured throughout the organization. This should give you another reason to believe in our 2018 margin expansion target. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's walk through our progress against our strategy. On Slide 6, we recount the 2016 priorities we shared with you at Day at K 1 year ago. Clearly, there is tangible progress being made. We set to stabilize our 4 largest cereal markets: U.S., Canada, Australia and U.K. We have invested in food, repositioned Special K, focused our marketing resources behind highest ROI brands and activities, and we have made substantial progress in all but the U.K., which is a work in progress. 
Expanding Pringles worldwide has been a priority for this year. And in Q3, we continue to see good growth in that brand. Emerging markets have been dramatically scaled up through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we've grown organically in these emerging markets as well. 
Enhancing our sales capabilities was another priority, and we've rolled out revenue growth management disciplines, processes and tools around the world. We said this was necessary for price realization, and we've seen our price realization go from being down slightly in the first half to being flat in Q3, with an expectation of slightly positive price realization in Q4. 
Also regarding sales capabilities, we just announced our biggest ever acquisition in Latin America, which will not only give us much needed scale in Brazil, but also gives us the ability to leverage a very strong reach into high-frequency stores. 
Increasing earnings visibility through deep productivity and savings initiatives has been a key priority for us this year, and it's already showing up in our results, with Q3 recording yet another year-on-year gain in OP margin. We're delivering on our productivity initiatives, we're shifting our brand building to higher ROI brands and investments, and we're starting to turn around our price realization. So good progress is being made even if our top line has not yet reflected it. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ron, who will talk you through our financial results, progress and outlook."

Slide #7 shows highlights of the financial results for the third quarter. In describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. The appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on our GAAP and non-GAAP performance.
Third quarter net sales decreased modestly and came in short of our expectations, but our operating profit increased, driven by savings from Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting as well as by price increases in Venezuela. This exceeded our expectations, and we generated this solid profit growth and margin expansion across all of our regions, making good progress toward our 2018 operating margin expansion goal. Earnings per share exceeded our expectations, not only because of profit margin expansion, but also due to a lower effective tax rate. This performance included $0.04 of currency headwind or about 4 to 5 percentage points of EPS growth impact. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and the components of the third quarter sales. Our currency-neutral comparable net sales declined in the third quarter, and this included unexpected trade inventory decreases in U.S. Cereal and Pop-Tarts, continued softness in U.K. Cereal and a more prolonged transition on shelf for our overhauled Kashi and Morningstar Farms portfolios. The good news is we saw growth in several businesses, including U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty Channels, Asia Pacific and Latin America, both with and without Venezuela. And we continue to post good growth in Pringles across the globe.
Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was up 60 basis points in the quarter and a bit less for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting initiatives all delivered savings as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America where our gross profit margin improved year-on-year even despite investment in food, adverse transactional foreign currency impact in Canada and adverse mix in snacks, driven by softness in our wholesome snacks business. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance were gross margin declines in our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by adverse transactional foreign currency impact on dollar-based commodities and other inputs as well as a deflationary retailer environment in Europe. But they also reflected adverse country and category mix. Project K, Zero-Based Budgeting and the rollout of revenue growth management are designed to address our gross profit margin performance going forward. 
Slide 10 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating margin, excluding Venezuela, for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by nearly a full percentage point in the third quarter. And by Zero-Based Budgeting and Project K efforts, we generated substantial efficiencies in our SG&A expenses. It's important to note that Q3's margin expansion was broad-based, with operating margin up year-on-year in all 4 of our regions. 
Slide 11 shows our cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow to the third quarter was more than 10% higher than that of the year-ago period. And recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by $97 million after tax. Importantly, we continued to improve our core working capital as a percent of sales, both sequentially and year-on-year. We're still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital spending. And full year capital spending should come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of $525 million to $625 million, reflecting greater efficiency and the prioritization of projects. 
Slide 12 shows how we expect to end the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis so that we can remove volatility from currency translation and mark-to-market adjustments. We expect sequential improvement in our x Venezuela net sales performance in the fourth quarter. The current trends had led us to adjust our outlook. So instead of finishing flat on sales for the year, as was our previous guidance, we now believe sales will be a little less than that, probably down about 1%. 
Our operating profit guidance remains unchanged at the high end of the 4% to 6% growth range, excluding Venezuela, thanks to our productivity efforts and our savings performance. We should see our operating margin exceed 15% in 2016, putting us well on the path toward our goal of increasing our margin by 350 basis points between 2015 and 2018. 
On earnings per share, we are raising our guidance both on a comparable and currency-neutral comparable basis. This reflects the tax rate favorability we recorded in the third quarter, which should more than offset any increase in our average shares outstanding as we curb share repurchases in the fourth quarter to fund our acquisition in Brazil. 
A couple of words on the financial impact of the Parati acquisition, which we expect to close later this year. The acquisition is neutral to a comparable basis earnings per share in 2016, even after the effect of curbing share buybacks in the quarter in order to maintain current debt levels. Integration costs are expected to amount to roughly $0.01 per share in 2016, but this merely puts us at the top end of our previously announced range of $0.02 to $0.03 for the company this year. 
Slide 13 shows some additional elements of our 2016 guidance, and I'll just highlight where there have been changes. First, the currency impact is roughly $0.01 better than previous guidance based on current rates. Our comparable tax rate will now be approximately 25%, reflecting favorability, primarily from the adoption of a new standard on accounting for stock-based compensation at the beginning of the year. Share buybacks should be approximately $450 million to $550 million. And as I mentioned, we're curbing repurchases for the time being to fund the acquisition we are making in Brazil. And full year integration costs are now anticipated to be at the high end of our previous estimate of $0.02 to $0.03 net of tax, and this now does incorporate the roughly $0.01 of closing in integration costs for the Brazil acquisition. 
Slide 14 offers a preliminary view of 2017. As we shared with you previously, we are forecasting net sales to be approximately flat in 2017. In effect, this consists of lower volume, offset by higher price/mix performance as we employ revenue growth management initiatives and adhere to our Volume to Value principles. This flat outlook is prudent in our view even as we strive to do better than flat. Our operating profit should increase at a high single-digit rate in 2017 as our operating margin expansion makes up about half of the remaining basis points of our 350 basis point challenge through 2018. 
As discussed previously, the key drivers of the expansion will be the following: our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity designed to mitigate input cost inflation, revenue growth management to improve our price/mix contribution, Project K savings and Zero-Based Budgeting efficiencies. We believe these initiatives give us good visibility into our margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. 
Slide 15 shows our 350 basis point profit margin expansion target through 2018, and it shows how this shapes up across our 4 regions. This is essentially an update of a chart we showed at Day at K last year, only accelerated forward to 2018 from previously 2020. As you can see, we are taking a prudent view towards net sales growth, particularly in the more developed North America and Europe regions. We believe this is the right way to forecast net sales growth, particularly in the current environment, but we aspire to do better than this. Our operating profit margin expansion skews heavily towards North America and Europe. These are our bigger businesses with strong productivity savings opportunities. In Latin America and Asia Pacific, we will be pursuing similar initiatives, but the impact isn't quite as large, as we are still on early stages of scaling up emerging markets in these regions. 
Before I pass the call over to the regions, let's briefly take a look at Slide 16. This is a recap versus what we shared with you at Day at K, focusing on our financial goals. Simply put, in 2016, we're delivering on everything we said we would, with the exception of net sales growth. We are on track to come in at the high end of our operating profit goal and exceeding our goal on currency-neutral comparable earnings per share. We have accelerated our target for operating margin expansion, expecting to reach it 2 years earlier. We're delivering on our productivity and Project K savings and have expanded our Zero-Based Budgeting program. And we've made acquisitions that perfectly fit our strategic imperatives, while being fiscally prudent and continuing to deliver strong cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility. So we made good progress towards our financial goals. 
We're now going to turn it over to each of our Region Presidents, who will give you a closer look at the results, priorities and outlooks for their respective businesses. We'll start with Paul Norman, our President of North America."

No question that 2016 has been a busy year for us here in North America. Admittedly, the results have been a bit mixed, with top line not recovering as quickly as I'd hoped, but profit margin expansion exceeding our expectations. There's been a lot more progress than our top line would suggest. 
If we turn to Slide 18, we can see the priorities we set out for ourselves for 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K investor event. Stabilizing our Cereal business was our priority. While the category was held at a 1% rate of decline, this is significantly better than in recent years. We have invested in food. We prioritized investment behind our core brands, and we've gained share as a result. And we're particularly pleased with how we stabilized Special K.
We also said we have to revitalize our Snacks business. The consumption data shows that our efforts to prioritize investment behind our most important and on-trend brands are working. We're growing our big 3 cracker brands, we're growing Pringles and we're growing Rice Krispies Treats. And across our portfolio, consumption is up double digit in on-the-go offerings. 
Frozen and Kashi are still works in progress. Much of the heavy-lifting has been done, with packaging overhauls now largely behind us in Frozen, and Kashi's transformation of its portfolio already contribution -- contributing, sorry, to stabilization in Cereal. We have plans to stabilize our other Kashi categories, too.
Fuel for growth refers to all the things we're doing to improve our profit margins. From executing our Project K network restructuring and shared services model to delivering on Zero-Based Budgeting, we are generating fuel for growth, and you can see it in our increased profit margins this year. We've also launched a more comprehensive approach to revenue growth management, which is already showing positive signs. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's discuss each of our North America segments in turn, starting with our 2016 results and then looking ahead to 2017. We'll start with Morning Foods on Slide #19. Morning Foods posted another quarter of solid operating profit growth, with improvements in our margins coming from our productivity efforts under ZBB and Project K. Top line came in a little lighter than we had expected, and this was due to an unexpected reduction in trade inventories. Our Cereal consumption was down about 1% and in line with our year-to-date trend. Now Pop-Tarts consumption was actually up about 1%, so shipments clearly lacked consumption in the quarter. 
Our underlying progress is clear. We gained 20 basis points of share in cereal and 50 basis points of share in toaster pastries. Our core 6 cereal brands continue to benefit from focused investment, leading our share gain. Year-to-date, Kellogg has most of the highest velocity 2016 innovations in ready-to-eat cereal, maintaining innovation share leadership, led by Special K Nourish, S'Mores and our Finding Dory-licensed cereal.
We executed well during the Back to School period, which coincided with our Olympics activation. This year's Olympics program generated over 1.8 billion impressions at 30% less cost than our prior Summer Olympics programs. This was driven by a greater focus on social activation, and it demonstrates our new marketing model at work. So we continue to improve the underlying fundamentals on our business. As we look to Q4, we expect to see Morning Foods sales down slightly again, but down less than we saw in Q3. And we expect to see continued margin expansion resulting in strong operating profit growth. 
Slide 20 offers a few thoughts on 2017 for Morning Foods. We will look to build momentum, expecting to see sequential improvement in top line and another year of strong profit margin expansion. Our plan to achieve this revolves around the 4 ingredients Craig Bahner outlined a year ago. Firstly, ensuring we have food that rocks through great innovation and value-adding renovation against our second priority, brands that matter, namely our core 6 cereal brands and Pop-Tarts. Thirdly, we will continue to drive excitement through events and properties that drive category engagement and fun in store. Helping this will be the recent completion of a further expansion of our sales force, adding more feet to the street. Fourth and finally, we will continue to expand margins through Project K, ZBB discipline, revenue growth management and a higher return on investment on every marketing dollar we invest. This should keep us on the path towards the 2018 goals that Ron shared a moment ago. 
If I were to highlight a couple of examples of initiatives coming early in 2017 on cereal, I would point to some exciting innovations behind Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran Crunch as well as a core food improvement initiative on one of our biggest brands, Mini-Wheats. We also place continuing focus on driving Special K through the expansion of the Nourish franchise and the renovation of fit enrollment [ph]. On Pop-Tarts, following the success of A&W Root Beer and Orange Crush flavors, we have 2 new great Dunkin' Donuts-inspired flavors launching in Q1. 
Let's now turn to Snacks on Slide 21. We saw strong progress in Snacks in the quarter. We continue to realize strong profit margin expansion, thanks to Project K and ZBB. We had planned to stabilize sales, and we did just that. We saw good growth in Q3 by almost all of our focused brands. Let's start with crackers where our big 3 cracker brands, Cheez-It, Club and Town House continue to collectively grow sales and gain share in the quarter. Pringles also grew consumption in the quarter. Rice Krispies Treats continue to grow sales and share, and Nutri-Grain also picked up share. Single-serve, a key element to our Snacks growth strategy, posted double-digit consumption gains in cookies and cracker caddy packs as well as in Pringles Snack Stacks. Legacy weight management offerings, particularly our Special K bars and cracker chips, remained a drag in the quarter, just as we said they would be as we go into more aggressive portfolio actions in early 2017. But even with this drag, the Snacks segment saw good sequential improvement in net sales. 
So Snacks is starting to turn the corner for us. In Q4, we expect to see sequential improvement again in net sales to slight growth. With continued Project K and ZBB efforts as well as the work we're doing on revenue growth management, we expect to generate margin expansion and strong operating profit growth, too. 
Turning to 2017 on Slide 22. For Snacks, our goal next year is to return to top line growth while further improving our margins. Deanie Elsner and her team will continue to drive the agenda they began this year, focusing behind our core brands like Cheez-It, Pringles and Rice Krispies Treats. And they'll continue to do this through a combination of more impactful brand building, innovation and renovation of food and packaging, in-store excitement and small formats to drive consumption in new locations through expanded distribution. Initiatives of note coming early next year are new flavors of Cheez-It Duoz and Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers as well as the launch of a new line of variants under Pringles called Loud. We will also continue to expand single-serve caddy packs and small-format offerings, which we know are highly incremental. 
Our other significant goal next year is to stabilize wholesome snacks. In the first quarter, we will be executing a comprehensive restage of Special K bars behind new food packaging and communication and bringing significant renovation and innovation to Nutri-Grain also. Revenue growth management will be a key element for us in Snacks. We kicked it off with the Cheez-It brand in late 2015 and are still in the process of expanding it across our whole product line. These efforts, along with continued savings from Project K and ZBB, should boost our Snacks margins again in 2017, keeping us well on pace for our 2018 margin goals. 
Now let's turn to our U.S. Specialty Channels business on Slide 23. This is a critical business for us when it comes to our strategic priority of winning where the shopper shops. And I'm happy to report that this segment continues to turn in steady growth in sales, margins and operating profit. In Q3, we once again delivered growth in all 3 of our core channels: Foodservice, vending and convenience. We held or gained share in 4 of 7 categories in Foodservice; in 3 of 5 in vending; and in 5 of 7 in convenience. This impressive performance was driven by increased distribution, effective promotions around the Olympics, Pringles Summer Jam and a limited time offering of Pop-Tarts as well as strong innovation performance in K-12, including items like wholegrain Rice Krispies Treats and Cheez-It. Meanwhile, revenue growth management and ZBB continue to improve our profit margins in this important business. And we expect more of the same in Q4 with a strong finish to the year across all channels. 
Slide 24 shows some of our expectations for 2017. For Specialty in 2017, Wendy Davidson and her team expect continued top and bottom line momentum across our channels. We plan to take advantage of category growth trends and to further leverage new food and packaging formats to drive brand ubiquity and reach across our core channels. We'll leverage emerging channels to test and learn, just as we've been doing this year with Bear Naked Custom Granola in direct-to-consumer and in partnered innovation with restaurant chains. We'll also continue to generate margin expansion through revenue growth management and ZBB, with KNA's 2018 profit margin goal squarely in our sights. So we expect another good performance from Specialty in 2017. 
Lastly, we'll discuss our North America Other segment, which comprise of U.S. Frozen Foods, Canada and Kashi and shown on Slide 25. In truth, I'm disappointed with the results of this segment in the third quarter. Canadian results were as we had expected. We experienced adverse volume impact in reaction to our increased list prices and future prices. These pricing actions were necessary to help offset higher input costs due to significant transactional foreign exchange pressure. The rest of North America Other is undergoing big transformations in food, packaging and SKU lineups. We thought these transitions will be fully behind us by Q3, but they are taking longer than we had expected. 
In Frozen, we recorded good profit margin expansion, but disappointed on the top line. Eggo posted sales growth, with particular success in the quarter behind the Disney-licensed products. But this was more than offset by the impact of distribution loss on Morningstar Farms as we transitioned over the past few quarters to new packaging. 
At Kashi, we're encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in cereal share in measured channels as well as the plus-5% growth in the natural channel. It means our substantial innovation and renovation efforts are starting to take hold, and we really haven't turned on global-scale consumer communication yet. So cereal is on its way even if it is still down year-on-year. However, wholesome snacks is proving to be a much bigger drag on sales than we had anticipated. Consumption has declined sharply as distribution losses have continued prior to renovation and innovation interventions coming in 2017. 
Let's look ahead to 2017 on Slide 26. For the North America Other segment, we expect improved sales and profit growth as the Kashi, Frozen and Canadian teams reap the awards of their work to reset in 2016. Overall, we expect to see top line growth in this North America Other segment. Meanwhile, RGM and ZBB as well as lapping some heavy investment in food should lift profit margins strongly. This will get us back on track towards our 2018 margin goals. 
Our Kashi cereal portfolio is poised to return to growth as distribution is stabilized and our innovation pipeline is strong. The recently launched Dark Cocoa Karma Wheat Biscuit Cereal is going very well, and we have an excellent new GOLEAN variant coming in January. Acceptance so far from our customers has been strong. Our largest challenge in 2017 on Kashi will continue to be wholesome snacks. We have renovation and innovation coming early in the year, which will significantly change the trend we have been experiencing. However, I doubt we will get the wholesome snacks part of this business back to growth on the full year. 
In Frozen Foods, our focus is on driving core Eggo, with new taste-oriented communication breaking in January as well as significant renovation with the removal of artificials from all of our waffles in the first quarter. On Morningstar Farms, we are focused on reactivating communication now that the packaging is on shelf and we have significant innovation building in the first half of the year.  Finally, in Canada, we will be lapping our pricing interventions from this year. And as foreign exchange issues moderate, we expect to see a stabilization of sales and a return to margin expansion. 
So in summary, there's been a ton of work behind the scenes this year in Kellogg North America, all aimed at getting our portfolio more on trend, in-housing our capabilities and execution, and improving profitability. While our top line growth hasn't consistently reflected these efforts yet, it is coming, and we are seeing sequential improvement to go with impressive margin expansion. We are making definitive progress towards the 400 to 450 basis points of operating margin improvement we're targeting through 2018. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Chris Hood, President of Kellogg Europe."
283356,378975174,1068564,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva.

For Kellogg Europe, 2016 will be viewed as a year in which we improved our profitability and got most of our business back on track. We've continued to accelerate the growth of Pringles. We've returned wholesome snacks to growth. We've stabilized our Cereal business in most of the region, and we're growing net sales in 5 of our 6 geographic clusters. The one exception is U.K. Cereal, which makes up just over 20% of our total sales.
U.K. is a market where a sluggish economy and a difficult retail environment have resulted in net price deflation. We've underperformed in our premium adult portfolio, most notably Special K and All-Bran. And this has resulted in sharp sales declines year-to-date in this important market. But it's important not to overlook the good progress we've made elsewhere in the region. 
A good way to assess this progress is Slide #28, where we can compare against the priorities we set out for Kellogg Europe in 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K event. Cereal is stabilizing, with over half of our markets holding or growing share, a significant improvement versus last year. Needless to say, our primary focus right now and into 2017 will be on stabilizing the U.K. business and getting Special K back on track. But we are showing improvement in the rest of Europe, and that was a priority for this year. 
Pringles has been a big success since we acquired this brand in 2012. We're seeing continued, high single-digit growth with broad-based share growth across almost all markets. This marks 4 years in a row of high single-digit growth in this brand, and we're doing this by strengthening the core of the brand and assessing -- accessing new locations and new markets, the additional sizes and geographic expansion. 
Wholesome snacks has returned to growth across Europe in 2016, driven by investing in the renovation of Special K bars and innovation like Kellogg-branded fruit and nut bars. Our emerging markets of Russia and Arabia have made substantial progress despite difficult operating conditions. Our Russian business is up strongly year-to-date. And our acquisitions in Egypt, Bisco Misr and Mass Food, are both growing at a rapid clip as well. As discussed last year, e-commerce is a big channel for us in Europe. This channel represents over $100 million of our sales, $100 million, and we enjoy share premiums in our categories compared to the total market. 
And last, we continue to drive transformational change within our cost structure behind Project K, implementation of shared services, getting started with Zero-Based Budgeting where we're about a year behind North America, and implementing revenue growth management to improve net price realization. We've increased our operating profit margin by 70 basis points already this year and by over 400 basis points over the last 4 years. So there's good progress being made across Europe on the priorities we established last November. Unfortunately, the growth progress is being somewhat masked by difficult market conditions in the U.K. on our Cereal business. Looking forward, we expect to stabilize top line sales and continue to drive strong profit expansion. 
Slide 29 discusses our 2016 results and outlook. As you can see, we posted strong profit growth in Q3. Our sales were up slightly, almost solely due to our Cereal business in the U.K. In the rest of Europe, we posted sales growth in virtually all of our subregions. France Benelux grew high single digits. Southern Europe and the Mediterranean Middle East posted low single-digit growth, and Russia recorded a strong double-digit gain. And we are holding or growing share in over half of our cereal markets while sustaining strong Pringles momentum. As we go into Q4, we'll work to drive sequential share improvement on our core brands, and we should post another quarter of margin expansion and profit growth. We will finish 2016 with a slight decline in net sales, but significant profit expansion due to all of our productivity initiatives. 
Turning to Slide #30. Here's how we're thinking about 2017. In combination across Cereal and Snacks, we expect total Europe 2017 sales to be flat to down slightly. We're making good progress on stabilizing our Cereal business in most of Europe. There's already quite a bit of work going on in turning around the U.K. We're simplifying and focusing our operations to drive a stronger core business. We're accelerating the repositioning of the Special K brand behind recently launched on-trend offerings, like Special K Nourish, which has been successful elsewhere in the world. We're crafting a better, more balanced commercial plan. And we're using revenue growth management to get our prices and pack formats right in order to reverse the deflation that we've been experiencing.  With all of these plans, we are expecting sequential improvement on U.K. Cereal during 2017, with continued decline albeit at a moderated pace. 
Pringles still have plenty of room to grow. Food renovation, commercial innovation and geographic expansion will all continue in 2017. And executing our productivity initiatives will continue to be a focus. Delivering our expected savings from Project K, global business services and Zero-Based Budgeting are all critical to enabling the investment in food renovation and covering Brexit-related transactional currency impact. 
In summary, we have more work to do, but we are seeing some green shoots to sales recovery, and we are confident that we can bring stability to our European Cereal business while continuing to grow Snacks. Meanwhile, we'll continue to boost productivity to drive profitable growth, staying on course toward our 2018 operating profit margin goal of 300 to 350 incremental basis points. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Maria Fernanda Mejia, President of Kellogg Latin America."
283356,378975174,1068564,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone.

Latin America continues to be an important growth opportunity for Kellogg, a key element to the company's 2020 Growth Plan. Our programs are fully aligned to this growth plan. And we're prioritizing investment behind markets like Mexico, Caribbean Central America and Andean, strengthening our leadership in Cereal, while expanding our Snacks footprint. And we're building scale in more emerging markets like Brazil. But as you know, nothing is ever simple in Latin America. We have to manage very carefully through an extremely challenging external environment. 
When we met last November during Day at K, we outlined our strategy and key areas of focus for 2016. A year later, I'm pleased to share with you the tremendous progress, as shown on Slide 32. Leading category growth is evident from our share growth in many core cereal markets, our record shares in wholesome snacks in Brazil and Colombia, and our double-digit growth on Pringles in markets like Mexico. Driving this growth has been innovation. We've expanded our offerings under the Kellogg's parent brand growing double digit. And our most recent introductions for Special K protein cereal and nut bars are exceeding our expectations.
We continue to drive our distribution and sales coverage in high-frequency stores, while improving our in-store execution by tailoring our regional commercial programs by retail environment. And we've continued to increase our supply chain network utilization significantly over the past 3 years. We've enabled our innovation platforms, strengthened our packaging capabilities and evolved our business models through partnerships with co-manufacturers, enhancing our speed to market. And we delivered margin improvement through efficiency programs like Project K, KIM [ph] and ZBB, all of which are combining with price realization to offset foreign exchange headwinds. So great progress being made across our priorities. 
A driver of market expansion will be M&A. And one of the most exciting transformational components of our growth plan can be seen on Slide 33. Our recently announced acquisition of Parati, which we hope to close in the fourth quarter, completely changes the game for us in Brazil, a market where we have been present and where we've been growing for a number of years, but where we've lacked critical scale. With Parati, we more than double our size in the high-growth potential Mercosur region, bringing it from just over 10% of Kellogg Latin America sales to over 25%. And we substantially increased our overall presence in Snacks, taking it roughly from 20% of Kellogg Latin America sales to about 1/3. This is a company that plays in attractive categories with strong brands and a track record of growth. It's largely regional with its foothold in the South, so there is geographic expansion opportunity. It's link in high-frequency stores will be leveraged across our Kellogg brand. 
Slide 34 summarizes our performance in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. After a relatively soft first half, driven by region-wide economic slowdown and FX impact, we returned to growth in quarter 3. We saw growth in both Cereal and in Snacks, and the growth was broad-based. Mexico, Mercosur, Caribbean Central America all posted sales growth in the quarter, aided by price realization. For the region, excluding volatile Venezuela, we've held our shares for the Cereal category flat year-to-date, with gains in markets like Brazil, Colombia and Puerto Rico. And in the recent periods, we have seen Mexico regain some share it lost earlier in the year. Snacks is showing strong momentum across the region, both on wholesome and salty. 
Meanwhile, our productivity efforts and price realization are starting to flow through to profit margin, which improved strongly in the third quarter. The team continues to manage well through very difficult economic and currency conditions. And we should not overlook the very good work done to manage through continuous crisis in Venezuela. We are expecting another quarter of sequential acceleration in net sales in the fourth quarter on improved price realization, stronger commercial plans and relevant innovation across categories hitting the stores, and this despite a difficult economic environment in Brazil. Profit margin in the fourth quarter should continue to move higher due to price realization and additional efficiencies generated through our recently launched ZBB initiative.
On Slide 35, we show our priorities for 2017, and everything starts with our largest market, Mexico. The sequential improvements we're seeing in the second half of 2016 will continue into 2017, with exciting innovation to grow consumption in cereal, continued expansion into the HFS channel, effective brand building and exciting opportunities behind our growing snacks businesses. The integration of Parati in Brazil will be executed flawlessly given our proven success with integrating Pringles several years ago, coupled with our common cultures and complementary businesses. Revenue growth is critical to driving profitable growth, executing our portfolio by retail environment and implementing the right price and size, effective promotions while driving mix will help us generate sales and profitability. And we'll continue our path with supply chain optimization with step changes ahead. 
So in summary, a laser-sharp focus on these priorities should allow us to better manage through current regional volatility and deliver good low single-digit growth and expanded profit margins in 2017. This will put us well on our way toward our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with this, I'll turn it over to Amit Banati, President of Asia Pacific, currently in Singapore."

Our top line growth has been consistent, led by Pringles and emerging market. And our joint ventures are also growing strongly. Profit margins have moved higher, and we have plans to increase them further. And most importantly, we have continued to make progress in our key strategic initiatives, and these will make Asia Pacific a sustainable growth engine for Kellogg for years to come. 
On Slide 37, we show the priorities for Asia Pacific that have been communicated at Day at K last year. In 2016, we continued to make strong progress against our priorities to transform the region. We have a more balanced portfolio. Asia and Africa now account for about 2/3 of the region sales. Snacks now account for about 1/3 of the region sales. We have made good progress in stabilizing our Australian business, particularly in cereal, where we are seeing much better category and share trends. Pringles has delivered strong growth in 2016. 
After 2 years of double-digit growth in Asia, we have seen growth moderate in 2016, primarily due to challenging market conditions in India in the first half of the year. But we are growing overall, and India is recovering in the second half. And in South Africa, we have seen strong growth in both our wholly-owned operations and our joint venture in Nigeria. 
Slide 38 discusses our quarter 3 performance and how we see quarter 4 shaping up. We continued to post increased sales in quarter 3, with Pringles and emerging markets driving the growth. We are seeing our Australian Cereal business stabilize in 2016, with improved consumption and share trends in the Cereal category. The drivers of improved performance include a renovation to 4-star foods of our biggest brand Nutri-Grain, which is now in growth; the launch of a gluten-free range, which is the #1 innovation in the Cereal category year-to-date; and improved execution in stores. 
Our Pringles business had a strong quarter 3, growing sales at a double-digit rate. Growth was driven by distribution expansion in emerging markets and new innovation expanding the Pringles portfolio such as the introduction of sweet flavors in Korea and the launch of Tortilla across the region. Emerging markets remain a source of growth for the region, with Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia key highlights for us in quarter 3. Quarter 3 sales growth was impacted by Korea lapping the year-ago supply disruption of a major competitor. Growth was also impacted by challenging economic and regulatory conditions in India in the first half, and our snacks business in Australia has remained soft. We have seen sequential improvement in our performance in India and Australia snacks each quarter. As a result, we expect growth to accelerate in quarter 4. This will result in full year sales growth in the low single-digit range.
Again, it is important not to forget our unconsolidated joint ventures shown on Slide 39. These are a key element of our emerging markets growth strategy. Year-to-date, our joint venture in China and our joint venture and investment stake in Nigeria are both growing at a strong double-digit rate despite operating in very challenging business environments. When you consider that our share of these businesses net sales is equivalent to roughly half the size of our Asia Pacific region, you can understand how significantly they would add to our overall growth if they were consolidated into our results.
We have strong plans for 2017, represented on Slide 40. We will build on our progress on stabilizing our Australian Cereal business. Turning around our Wholesome Snacks business in Australia will be a key priority. We recently launched Special K Protein bites and Nutri-Grain edge bars, and they are both off to a strong good start. We have also relaunched the natural brand with new food and packaging. 
Emerging markets will continue to be a growth driver across both cereal and snacks. In cereals, we continue to drive category development in emerging markets, and we will also launch Wholesome Snacks in North Korea and Southeast Asia. We continue to expect strong growth on Pringles behind innovation and distribution expansion in emerging markets as we expand offerings at affordable price points. Small cans now account for 20% of our Pringles sales in the region. 
2017 will also see an increased focus on driving operating margin expansion as we roll out zero-based budgeting and revenue growth management. In terms of outlook, we expect net sales growth in the low single-digit range for Kellogg Asia Pacific in 2017, with sales from our joint ventures in effect bringing that pace of growth much higher. Meanwhile, profit margins should expand, driving higher profit and putting us closer to our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to John Bryant for some final remarks."

Sometimes that's removing things people want less out sometimes that's putting more what people want more of like Red Berries, for example, in Special K. Those are the things that allow branded companies like ours and our big brands to compete and play effectively for consumers pocketbooks in the marketplace. So my focus is very much in improving our foods, bigger and better ideas and driving investment behind those things.

Now we're heading more towards the top end of that range, maybe even a little bit above that range as we look at our most recent outlook for the year. So we're seeing very good performance from zero-based budgeting. As we move back into 2017, and I did provide an update at the Barclays conference. If you want to refer to some charts there, you'll see it on the charts as well. But Project K, balance of the program to hit the $425 million to $475 million worth of savings. So roughly $140 million to $190 million of savings over the next couple years, '17 and '18, to hit that range. And we have said that more than half of that savings would come in 2017.

So what makes one brand react might be different from another. We clearly saw a reinvestment in our core foods around, say, Special K Red Berries, which is a significant part of our lineup, turned the business back to positive growth on a year-to-date basis this year -- K's growing and growing share. We see Rice Krispies do extremely well this year, not because of necessarily innovation or renovation because of consumer engagement around recipe usage and versatility, and I think that's driving that brand. Frosted Flakes is another brand that's growing well against teens and tweens this year. So -- and that again I would say, is driven by in-store activation behind big properties, properties like Finding Dory or the Olympics event. So it's not the same ingredients behind every brand. When it comes to ZBB reinvestment, we have put some money back in the business this year. We put it back in our sales force again to drive greater activation right through to the point-of-purchase. So sometimes it's behind a brand, sometimes is focusing on getting the assortment right and the perfect shelf at store and that takes resources at the store level to do that. We did choose to reinvest in Keebler this year, which obviously isn't a cereal, but that was the choice coming out of ZBB reinvestment, and we've seen positive returns on that. So I do think it comes down to core 6 brands. And the one thing we can do better next year, I believe, is get Kashi back to growth. Kashi responds to many needs out there that some of the Kellogg traditional legacy brands can't. It's growing in the natural channel, 4%, 5%. We need to get it beyond stable to growth in mainstream measure channels as well next year. We do that plus the core 6. I think you'll see the category flatten out and maybe tip into growth."

So we have completely renovated all of our foods to be nonGMO project verified and about 30% to 40% of our portfolio is now organic.

We have consumer validated and qualified packaging that we feel very good about. We, with any disruptive innovation, sometimes things get disruptive. And we have not executed through to the shelf at the pace we expected to be able to execute. So I do think this is a case of execution, unfortunately, in the Morningstar Farms. As I looked across our business, I look at cereal, I look at snacks, we've seen some very good execution. Kashi will be one area or Morningstar Farms where I think we have opportunity to improve. The good news is, like I say, our packaging is consumer validated. We are now in a place where our distribution is back to normal and where it needs to be. I have visibility to a great pipeline of news coming earlier in the year, and we are now completely focused on communication and regenerating trial. There's no issue with the food. There's no issue with consumer. A lot of the food, we just -- we missed it here and now we're focused very much on getting back to growth. I foresee growth for Morningstar Farms next year as we go forward. We did lose one item, which shows through the numbers, unfortunately, negative, but as we did lose a big item in the truck channel, one of our best sellers and we're working hard to get that item back in the organic format. When we get that item back, the top business is big for this business. So we're cautiously optimistic that's coming back as well, and that will be a driver of our growth for this business next year."

I'm happy to report Q3 profit and earnings that came in ahead of our expectations. A lower tax rate was positive over delivery, but so was broad-based profit margin expansion that exceeded our expectations. Candidly, top line growth did not come in as we had hoped, and there were specific factors behind that, which we'll discuss in a moment. But we did see growth and sequential improvement in many parts of our business. 
Behind the numbers, there's great progress being made not only against our strategy, as represented by our 2020 Growth Plan, but also against the key business priorities we laid out for you 1 year ago at our Day at K investor event. These efforts should continue to yield sequential improvement in our results. We saw it in Q3 and we'll see it again in Q4, finishing the year largely as we originally expected in operating profit, albeit due more by margin expansion and less by net sales growth. And this improvement will continue into 2017 as we continue to believe we have the right plans to bring sales at least to flat and enough productivity initiatives to drive us well on our way to a 350 basis point improvement goal we have set for 2015 to 2018 on a currency-neutral comparable basis, excluding Venezuela. 
Today, Ron, the Region Presidents and I will take you through our results, progress and outlook. And we use as a basis for measurement the priorities we shared with you back at Day at K.
I will start by reminding you of the 2020 Growth Plan, which we unveiled to you at last November's Day at K investor event and which is shown on Slide 5. There are 2 important points to make here. First, that this growth plan is informing our investment decisions, and our 2016 priorities were all geared toward delivering on this strategy. As we discuss our progress against our 2016 priorities, we are really discussing our progress against this 2020 Growth Plan. 
The second point is that our acceleration of profit margin expansion is by no means a change in strategy. OP margin expansion has always sat front and center of our 2020 Growth Plan. And there's more to this profit margin expansion than simply executing initiatives. A couple of months ago, we told you about how we are refreshing our Volume to Value operating model for today's environment. Volume to Value is being embraced and measured throughout the organization. This should give you another reason to believe in our 2018 margin expansion target. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's walk through our progress against our strategy. On Slide 6, we recount the 2016 priorities we shared with you at Day at K 1 year ago. Clearly, there is tangible progress being made. We set to stabilize our 4 largest cereal markets: U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. We have invested in food, repositioned Special K, focused our marketing resources behind highest ROI brands and activities, and we have made substantial progress in all but the U.K., which is a work in progress. 
Expanding Pringles worldwide has been a priority for this year. And in Q3, we continue to see good growth in that brand. Emerging markets have been dramatically scaled up through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we've grown organically in these emerging markets as well. 
Enhancing our sales capabilities was another priority, and we've rolled out revenue growth management disciplines, processes and tools around the world. We said this was necessary for price realization, and we've seen our price realization go from being down slightly in the first half to being flat in Q3, with an expectation of slightly positive price realization in Q4. 
Also regarding sales capabilities, we just announced our biggest ever acquisition in Latin America, which will not only give us much needed scale in Brazil, but also gives us the ability to leverage a very strong reach into high-frequency stores. 
Increasing earnings visibility through deep productivity and savings initiatives has been a key priority for us this year, and it's already showing up in our results, with Q3 recording yet another year-on-year gain in OP margin. We're delivering on our productivity initiatives, we're shifting our brand building to higher ROI brands and investments, and we're starting to turn around our price realization. So good progress is being made even if our top line has not yet reflected it. 
With that, let me turn it to Ron, who will talk you through our financial results, progress and outlook."
283356,378975174,1068646,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, all.

Slide #7 shows highlights of the financial results for the third quarter. In describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. The appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on our GAAP and non-GAAP performance.
Third quarter net sales decreased modestly and came in short of our expectations, but our operating profit increased, driven by savings from Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting as well as by price increases in Venezuela. This exceeded our expectations, and we generated this solid profit growth and margin expansion across all of our regions, making good progress toward our 2018 operating margin expansion goal. Earnings per share exceeded our expectations, not only because of profit margin expansion, but also due to a lower effective tax rate. This performance included $0.04 of currency headwind or about 4 to 5 percentage points of EPS growth impact. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and the components of the third quarter sales. Our currency-neutral comparable net sales declined in the third quarter, and this included unexpected trade inventory decreases in U.S. Cereal and Pop-Tarts, continued softness in U.K. Cereal and a more prolonged transition on shelf for our overhauled Kashi and Morningstar Farms portfolios. The good news is we saw growth in several businesses, including U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty Channels, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, both with and without Venezuela. And we continue to post good growth in Pringles across the globe.
Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was up 60 basis points in the quarter and a bit less for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting initiatives all delivered savings as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America, where our gross profit margin improved year-on-year even despite investment in food, adverse transactional foreign currency impact in Canada and adverse mix in snacks, driven by softness in our wholesome snacks business. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance were gross margin declines in our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by adverse transactional foreign currency impact on dollar-based commodities and other inputs as well as a deflationary retailer environment in Europe. But they also reflected adverse country and category mix. Project K, Zero-Based Budgeting and the rollout of revenue growth management are designed to address our gross profit margin performance going forward. 
Slide 10 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating margin, excluding Venezuela, for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by nearly a full percentage point in the third quarter. And by Zero-Based Budgeting and Project K efforts, we generated substantial efficiencies in our SG&A expenses. It's important to note that Q3's margin expansion was broad-based, with operating margin up year-on-year in all 4 of our regions. 
Slide 11 shows our cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow through the third quarter was more than 10% higher than that of the year-ago period. And recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by $97 million after tax. Importantly, we continued to improve our core working capital as a percent of sales, both sequentially and year-on-year. We're still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital spending. And full year capital spending should come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of $525 million to $625 million, reflecting greater efficiency and the prioritization of projects. 
Slide 12 shows how we expect to end the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis so that we can remove volatility from currency translation and mark-to-market adjustments. We expect sequential improvement in our x Venezuela net sales performance in the fourth quarter. The current trends had led us to adjust our outlook. So instead of finishing flat on sales for the year, as was our previous guidance, we now believe sales will be a little less than that, probably down about 1%. 
Our operating profit guidance remains unchanged at the high end of the 4% to 6% growth range, excluding Venezuela, thanks to our productivity efforts and our savings performance. We should see our operating margin exceed 15% in 2016, putting us well on the path toward our goal of increasing our margin by 350 basis points between 2015 and 2018. 
On earnings per share, we are raising our guidance both on a comparable and currency-neutral comparable basis. This reflects the tax rate favorability we recorded in the third quarter, which should more than offset any increase in our average shares outstanding as we curb share repurchases in the fourth quarter to fund our acquisition in Brazil. 
A couple of words on the financial impact of the Parati acquisition, which we expect to close later this year. Net the acquisition is neutral to a comparable basis earnings per share in 2016, even after the effect of curbing share buybacks in the quarter in order to maintain current debt levels. Integration costs are expected to amount to roughly $0.01 per share in 2016, but this merely puts us at the top end of our previously announced range of $0.02 to $0.03 for the company this year. 
Slide 13 shows some additional elements of our 2016 guidance, and I'll just highlight where there have been changes. First, the currency impact is roughly $0.01 better than previous guidance based on current rates. Our comparable tax rate will now be approximately 25%, reflecting favorability, primarily from the adoption of a new standard on accounting for stock-based compensation at the beginning of the year. Share buybacks should be approximately $450 million to $550 million. And as I mentioned, we're curbing repurchases for the time being to fund the acquisition we are making in Brazil. And full year integration costs are now anticipated to be at the high end of our previous estimate of $0.02 to $0.03 net of tax, and this now does incorporate the roughly $0.01 of closing in integration costs for the Brazil acquisition. 
Slide 14 offers a preliminary view of 2017. As we shared with you previously, we are forecasting net sales to be approximately flat in 2017. In effect, this consists of lower volume, offset by higher price/mix performance as we employ revenue growth management initiatives and adhere to our Volume to Value principles. This flat outlook is prudent in our view even as we strive to do better than flat. Our operating profit should increase at a high single-digit rate in 2017 as our operating margin expansion makes up about half of the remaining basis points of our 350 basis point challenge through 2018. 
As discussed previously, the key drivers of the expansion will be the following: our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity designed to mitigate input cost inflation, revenue growth management to improve our price/mix contribution, Project K savings and Zero-Based Budgeting efficiencies. We believe these initiatives give us good visibility into our margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. 
Slide 15 shows our 350 basis point profit margin expansion target through 2018, and it shows how this shapes up across our 4 regions. This is essentially an update of a chart we showed at Day at K last year, only accelerated forward to 2018 from previously 2020. As you can see, we are taking a prudent view towards net sales growth, particularly in the more developed North America and Europe regions. We believe this is the right way to forecast net sales growth, particularly in the current environment, but we aspire to do better than this. Our operating profit margin expansion skews heavily towards North America and Europe. These are our bigger businesses with strong productivity savings opportunities. In Latin America and Asia-Pacific, we will be pursuing similar initiatives, but the impact isn't quite as large, as we are still on early stages of scaling up emerging markets in these regions. 
Before I pass the call over to the regions, let's briefly take a look at Slide 16. This is a recap versus what we shared with you at Day at K, focusing on our financial goals. Simply put, in 2016, we're delivering on everything we said we would, with the exception of net sales growth. We are on track to come in at the high end of our operating profit goal and exceeding our goal on currency-neutral comparable earnings per share. We have accelerated our target for operating margin expansion, expecting to reach it 2 years earlier. We're delivering on our productivity and Project K savings and have expanded our Zero-Based Budgeting program. And we've made acquisitions that perfectly fit our strategic imperatives, while being fiscally prudent and continuing to deliver strong cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility. So we made good progress towards our financial goals. 
We're now going to turn it over to each of our Region Presidents, who will give you a closer look at the results, priorities and outlooks for their respective businesses. We'll start with Paul Norman, our President of North America."

No question that 2016 has been a busy year for us here in North America. Admittedly, the results have been a bit mixed, with top line not recovering as quickly as I'd hoped, but profit margin expansion exceeding our expectations. There's been a lot more progress than our top line would suggest. 
If we turn to Slide 18, we can see the priorities we set out for ourselves for 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K investor event. Stabilizing our Cereal business was our priority. While the category was held at a 1% rate of decline, this is significantly better than in recent years. We have invested in food. We prioritized investment behind our core brands, and we've gained share as a result. And we're particularly pleased with how we stabilized Special K.
We also said we have to revitalize our Snacks business. The consumption data shows that our efforts to prioritize investment behind our most important and on-trend brands are working. We're growing our big 3 cracker brands, we're growing Pringles and we're growing Rice Krispies Treats. And across our portfolio, consumption is up double digit in on-the-go offerings. 
Frozen and Kashi are still works in progress. Much of the heavy-lifting has been done, with packaging overhauls now largely behind us in Frozen, and Kashi's transformation of its portfolio already contribution -- contributing, sorry, to stabilization in Cereal. We have plans to stabilize our other Kashi categories, too.
Fuel for growth refers to all the things we're doing to improve our profit margins. From executing our Project K network restructuring and shared services model to delivering on Zero-Based Budgeting, we are generating fuel for growth, and you can see it in our increased profit margins this year. We've also launched a more comprehensive approach to revenue growth management, which is already showing positive signs. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's discuss each of our North America segments in turn, starting with our 2016 results and then looking ahead to 2017. We'll start with Morning Foods on Slide #19. Morning Foods posted another quarter of solid operating profit growth, with improvements in our margins coming from our productivity efforts under ZBB and Project K. Top line came in a little lighter than we had expected, and this was due to an unexpected reduction in trade inventories. Our Cereal consumption was down about 1% and in line with our year-to-date trend. Now Pop-Tarts consumption was actually up about 1%, so shipments clearly lacked consumption in the quarter. 
Our underlying progress is clear. We gained 20 basis points of share in cereal and 50 basis points of share in toaster pastries. Our core 6 cereal brands continue to benefit from focused investment, leading our share gain. Year-to-date, Kellogg has most of the highest velocity 2016 innovations in ready-to-eat cereal, maintaining innovation share leadership, led by Special K Nourish, S'Mores and our Finding Dory-licensed cereal.
We executed well during the Back to School period, which coincided with our Olympics activation. This year's Olympics program generated over 1.8 billion impressions at 30% less cost than our prior Summer Olympics programs. This was driven by a greater focus on social activation, and it demonstrates our new marketing model at work. So we continue to improve the underlying fundamentals on our business. As we look to Q4, we expect to see Morning Foods sales down slightly again, but down less than we saw in Q3. And we expect to see continued margin expansion resulting in strong operating profit growth. 
Slide 20 offers a few thoughts on 2017 for Morning Foods. We will look to build momentum, expecting to see sequential improvement in top line and another year of strong profit margin expansion. Our plan to achieve this revolves around the 4 ingredients Craig Bahner outlined a year ago. Firstly, ensuring we have food that rocks through great innovation and value-adding renovation against our second priority, brands that matter, namely our core 6 cereal brands and Pop-Tarts. Thirdly, we will continue to drive excitement through events and properties that drive category engagement and fun in store. Helping this will be the recent completion of a further expansion of our sales force, adding more feet to the street. Fourth and finally, we will continue to expand margins through Project K, ZBB discipline, revenue growth management and a higher return on investment on every marketing dollar we invest. This should keep us on the path towards the 2018 goals that Ron shared a moment ago. 
If I were to highlight a couple of examples of initiatives coming early in 2017 on cereal, I would point to some exciting innovations behind Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran Crunch as well as a core food improvement initiative on one of our biggest brands, Mini-Wheats. We also place continuing focus on driving Special K through the expansion of the Nourish franchise and the renovation of fit enrollment [ph]. On Pop-Tarts, following the success of A&W Root Beer and Orange Crush flavors, we have 2 new great Dunkin' Donuts-inspired flavors launching in Q1. 
Let's now turn to Snacks on Slide 21. We saw strong progress in Snacks in the quarter. We continue to realize strong profit margin expansion, thanks to Project K and ZBB. We had planned to stabilize sales, and we did just that. We saw good growth in Q3 by almost all of our focused brands. Let's start with crackers where our big 3 cracker brands, Cheez-It, Club and Town House, continue to collectively grow sales and gain share in the quarter. Pringles also grew consumption in the quarter. Rice Krispies Treats continued to grow sales and share, and Nutri-Grain also picked up share. Single-serve, a key element to our Snacks growth strategy, posted double-digit consumption gains in cookies and cracker caddy packs as well as in Pringles Snack Stacks. Legacy weight management offerings, particularly our Special K bars and cracker chips, remained a drag in the quarter, just as we said they would be as we go into more aggressive portfolio actions in early 2017. But even with this drag, the Snacks segment saw good sequential improvement in net sales. 
So Snacks is starting to turn the corner for us. In Q4, we expect to see sequential improvement again in net sales to slight growth. With continued Project K and ZBB efforts as well as the work we're doing on revenue growth management, we expect to generate margin expansion and strong operating profit growth, too. 
Turning to 2017 on Slide 22. For Snacks, our goal next year is to return to top line growth while further improving our margins. Deanie Elsner and her team will continue to drive the agenda they began this year, focusing behind our core brands like Cheez-It, Pringles and Rice Krispies Treats. And they'll continue to do this through a combination of more impactful brand building, innovation and renovation of food and packaging, in-store excitement and small formats to drive consumption in new locations through expanded distribution. Initiatives of note coming early next year are new flavors of Cheez-It Duoz and Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers as well as the launch of a new line of variants under Pringles called Loud. We will also continue to expand single-serve caddy packs and small-format offerings, which we know are highly incremental. 
Our other significant goal next year is to stabilize wholesome snacks. In the first quarter, we will be executing a comprehensive restage of Special K bars behind new food, packaging and communication and bringing significant renovation and innovation to Nutri-Grain also. Revenue growth management will be a key element for us in Snacks. We kicked it off with the Cheez-It brand in late 2015 and are still in the process of expanding it across our whole product line. These efforts, along with continued savings from Project K and ZBB, should boost our Snacks margins again in 2017, keeping us well on pace for our 2018 margin goals. 
Now let's turn to our U.S. Specialty Channels business on Slide 23. This is a critical business for us when it comes to our strategic priority of winning where the shopper shops. And I'm happy to report that this segment continues to turn in steady growth in sales, margins and operating profit. In Q3, we once again delivered growth in all 3 of our core channels: Foodservice, vending and convenience. We held or gained share in 4 of 7 categories in Foodservice; in 3 of 5 in vending; and in 5 of 7 in convenience. This impressive performance was driven by increased distribution, effective promotions around the Olympics, Pringles Summer Jam and a limited time offering of Pop-Tarts as well as strong innovation performance in K-12, including items like wholegrain Rice Krispies Treats and Cheez-It. Meanwhile, revenue growth management and ZBB continue to improve our profit margins in this important business. And we expect more of the same in Q4, with a strong finish to the year across all channels. 
Slide 24 shows some of our expectations for 2017. For Specialty in 2017, Wendy Davidson and her team expect continued top and bottom line momentum across our channels. We plan to take advantage of category growth trends and to further leverage new food and packaging formats to drive brand ubiquity and reach across our core channels. We'll leverage emerging channels to test and learn, just as we've been doing this year with Bear Naked Custom Granola in direct-to-consumer and in partnered innovation with restaurant chains. We'll also continue to generate margin expansion through revenue growth management and ZBB, with KNA's 2018 profit margin goal squarely in our sights. So we expect another good performance from Specialty in 2017. 
Lastly, we'll discuss our North America Other segment, which comprise of U.S. Frozen Foods, Canada and Kashi and shown on Slide 25. In truth, I'm disappointed with the results of this segment in the third quarter. Canadian results were as we had expected. We experienced adverse volume impact in reaction to our increased list prices and future prices. These pricing actions were necessary to help offset higher input costs due to significant transactional foreign exchange pressure. The rest of North America Other is undergoing big transformations in food, packaging and SKU lineups. We thought these transitions will be fully behind us by Q3, but they are taking longer than we had expected. 
In Frozen, we recorded good profit margin expansion, but disappointed on the top line. Eggo posted sales growth, with particular success in the quarter behind the Disney-licensed products. But this was more than offset by the impact of distribution loss on Morningstar Farms as we transitioned over the past few quarters to new packaging. 
At Kashi, we're encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in cereal share in measured channels as well as the plus-5% growth in the natural channel. It means our substantial innovation and renovation efforts are starting to take hold, and we really haven't turned on global-scale consumer communication yet. So cereal is on its way even if it is still down year-on-year. However, wholesome snacks is proving to be a much bigger drag on sales than we had anticipated. Consumption has declined sharply as distribution losses have continued prior to renovation and innovation interventions coming in 2017. 
Let's look ahead to 2017 on Slide 26. For the North America Other segment, we expect improved sales and profit growth as the Kashi, Frozen and Canadian teams reap the awards of their work to reset in 2016. Overall, we expect to see top line growth in this North America Other segment. Meanwhile, RGM and ZBB as well as lapping some heavy investment in food should lift profit margins strongly. This will get us back on track towards our 2018 margin goals. 
Our Kashi cereal portfolio is poised to return to growth as distribution has stabilized and our innovation pipeline is strong. The recently launched Dark Cocoa Karma Wheat Biscuit Cereal is going very well, and we have an excellent new GOLEAN variant coming in January. Acceptance so far from our customers has been strong. Our largest challenge in 2017 on Kashi will continue to be wholesome snacks. We have renovation and innovation coming early in the year, which will significantly change the trend we have been experiencing. However, I doubt we will get the wholesome snacks part of this business back to growth on the full year. 
In Frozen Foods, our focus is on driving core Eggo, with new taste-oriented communication breaking in January as well as significant renovation with the removal of artificials from all of our waffles in the first quarter. On Morningstar Farms, we are focused on reactivating communication now that the packaging is on shelf and we have significant innovation building in the first half of the year.  Finally, in Canada, we will be lapping our pricing interventions from this year. And as foreign exchange issues moderate, we expect to see a stabilization of sales and a return to margin expansion. 
So in summary, there's been a ton of work behind the scenes this year in Kellogg North America, all aimed at getting our portfolio more on trend in helping our capabilities and execution, and improving profitability. While our top line growth hasn't consistently reflected these efforts yet, it is coming, and we are seeing sequential improvement to go with impressive margin expansion. We are making definitive progress towards the 400 to 450 basis points of operating margin improvement we're targeting through 2018. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Chris Hood, President of Kellogg Europe."
283356,378975174,1068646,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva. For Kellogg Europe, 2016 will be viewed as a year in which we improved our profitability and got most of our business back on track. We've continued to accelerate the growth of Pringles. We've re",966,"Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva. For Kellogg Europe, 2016 will be viewed as a year in which we improved our profitability and got most of our business back on track. We've continued to accelerate the growth of Pringles. We've returned wholesome snacks to growth. We've stabilized our Cereal business in most of the region, and we're growing net sales in 5 of our 6 geographic clusters. The one exception is U.K. Cereal, which makes up just over 20% of our total sales.
U.K. is a market where a sluggish economy and a difficult retail environment have resulted in net price deflation. We've underperformed in our premium adult portfolio, most notably Special K and All-Bran. And this has resulted in sharp sales declines year-to-date in this important market. But it's important not to overlook the good progress we've made elsewhere in the region. 
A good way to assess this progress is Slide #28, where we can compare against the priorities we set out for Kellogg Europe in 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K event. Cereal is stabilizing, with over half of our markets holding or growing share, a significant improvement versus last year. Needless to say, our primary focus right now and into 2017 will be on stabilizing the U.K. business and getting Special K back on track. But we are showing improvement in the rest of Europe, and that was a priority for this year. 
Pringles has been a big success since we acquired this brand in 2012. We're seeing continued, high single-digit growth, with broad-based share growth across almost all markets. This marks 4 years in a row of high single-digit growth in this brand, and we're doing this by strengthening the core of the brand and assessing -- accessing new locations and new markets, the additional sizes and geographic expansion. 
Wholesome snacks has returned to growth across Europe in 2016, driven by investing in the renovation of Special K bars and innovation like Kellogg-branded fruit and nut bars. Our emerging markets of Russia and Arabia have made substantial progress despite difficult operating conditions. Our Russian business is up strongly year-to-date. And our acquisitions in Egypt, Bisco Misr and Mass Food, are both growing at a rapid clip as well. As discussed last year, e-commerce is a big channel for us in Europe. This channel represents over $100 million of our sales, $100 million, and we enjoy share premiums in our categories compared to the total market. 
And last, we continue to drive transformational change within our cost structure behind Project K; implementation of shared services; getting started with Zero-Based Budgeting, where we're about a year behind North America; and implementing revenue growth management to improve net price realization. We've increased our operating profit margin by 70 basis points already this year and by over 400 basis points over the last 4 years. So there's good progress being made across Europe on the priorities we established last November. Unfortunately, the growth progress is being somewhat masked by difficult market conditions in the U.K. on our Cereal business. Looking forward, we expect to stabilize top line sales and continue to drive strong profit expansion. 
Slide 29 discusses our 2016 results and outlook. As you can see, we posted strong profit growth in Q3. Our sales were off slightly, almost solely due to our Cereal business in the U.K. In the rest of Europe, we posted sales growth in virtually all of our subregions. France Benelux grew high single digits. Southern Europe and the Mediterranean Middle East posted low single-digit growth, and Russia recorded a strong double-digit gain. And we are holding or growing share in over half of our cereal markets while sustaining strong Pringles momentum. As we go into Q4, we'll work to drive sequential share improvement on our core brands, and we should post another quarter of margin expansion and profit growth. We will finish 2016 with a slight decline in net sales, but significant profit expansion due to all of our productivity initiatives. 
Turning to Slide #30. Here's how we're thinking about 2017. In combination across Cereal and Snacks, we expect total Europe 2017 sales to be flat to down slightly. We're making good progress on stabilizing our Cereal business in most of Europe. There's already quite a bit of work going on in turning around the U.K. We're simplifying and focusing our operations to drive a stronger core business. We're accelerating the repositioning of the Special K brand behind recently launched on-trend offerings, like Special K Nourish, which has been successful elsewhere in the world. We're crafting a better, more balanced commercial plan. And we're using revenue growth management to get our prices and pack formats right in order to reverse the deflation that we've been experiencing. With all of these plans, we are expecting sequential improvement on U.K. Cereal during 2017, with continued decline albeit at a moderated pace. 
Pringles still has plenty of room to grow. Food renovation, commercial innovation and geographic expansion will all continue in 2017. And executing our productivity initiatives will continue to be a focus. Delivering our expected savings from Project K, global business services and Zero-Based Budgeting are all critical to enabling the investments in food renovation and covering Brexit-related transactional currency impact. 
In summary, we have more work to do, but we are seeing some green shoots of sales recovery, and we are confident that we can bring stability to our European Cereal business while continuing to grow Snacks. Meanwhile, we'll continue to boost productivity to drive profitable growth, staying on course toward our 2018 operating profit margin goal of 300 to 350 incremental basis points. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Maria Fernanda Mejia, President of Kellogg Latin America."
283356,378975174,1068646,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Latin America continues to be an important growth opportunity for Kellogg, a key element to the company's 2020 Growth Plan. Our programs are fully aligned to this growth plan.

Latin America continues to be an important growth opportunity for Kellogg, a key element to the company's 2020 Growth Plan. Our programs are fully aligned to this growth plan. And we're prioritizing investment behind markets like Mexico, Caribbean Central America and Andean, strengthening our leadership in Cereal, while expanding our Snacks footprint. And we're building scale in more emerging markets like Brazil. But as you know, nothing is ever simple in Latin America. We have to manage very carefully through an extremely challenging external environment. 
When we met last November during Day at K, we outlined our strategy and key areas of focus for 2016. A year later, I'm pleased to share with you the tremendous progress, as shown on Slide 32. Leading category growth is evident from our share growth in many core cereal markets, our record shares in wholesome snacks in Brazil and Colombia, and our double-digit growth on Pringles in markets like Mexico. Driving this growth has been innovation. We've expanded our offerings under the Kellogg's parent brand growing double digit. And our most recent introductions for Special K, protein cereal and nut bars, are exceeding our expectations.
We continue to drive our distribution and sales coverage in high-frequency stores, while improving our in-store execution by tailoring our regional commercial programs by retail environment. And we've continued to increase our supply chain network utilization significantly over the past 3 years. We've enabled our innovation platforms, strengthened our packaging capabilities and evolved our business models through partnerships with co-manufacturers, enhancing our speed to market. And we delivered margin improvement through efficiency programs like Project K, KIM [ph] and ZBB, all of which are combining with price realization to offset foreign exchange headwinds. So great progress being made across our priorities. 
A driver of market expansion will be M&A. And one of the most exciting transformational components of our growth plan can be seen on Slide 33. Our recently announced acquisition of Parati, which we hope to close in the fourth quarter, completely changes the game for us in Brazil, a market where we have been present and where we've been growing for a number of years, but where we've lacked critical scale. With Parati, we more than doubled our size in the high-growth potential Mercosur region, bringing it from just over 10% of Kellogg Latin America sales to over 25%. And we substantially increased our overall presence in Snacks, taking it roughly from 20% of Kellogg Latin America sales to about 1/3. This is a company that plays in attractive categories, with strong brands and a track record of growth. It's largely regional, with its foothold in the South, so there is geographic expansion opportunity. It's link in high-frequency stores will be leveraged across our Kellogg brand. 
Slide 34 summarizes our performance in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. After a relatively soft first half, driven by region-wide economic slowdown and FX impact, we returned to growth in quarter 3. We saw growth in both Cereal and in Snacks, and the growth was broad-based. Mexico, Mercosur, Caribbean Central America all posted sales growth in the quarter, aided by price realization. For the region, excluding volatile Venezuela, we've held our shares for the Cereal category flat year-to-date, with gains in markets like Brazil, Colombia and Puerto Rico. And in the recent periods, we have seen Mexico regain some share it lost earlier in the year. Snacks is showing strong momentum across the region, both on wholesome and salty. 
Meanwhile, our productivity efforts and price realization are starting to flow through to profit margin, which improved strongly in the third quarter. The team continues to manage well through very difficult economic and currency conditions. And we should not overlook the very good work done to manage through continuous crisis in Venezuela. We are expecting another quarter of sequential acceleration in net sales in the fourth quarter on improved price realization, stronger commercial plans and relevant innovation across categories hitting the stores, and this despite a difficult economic environment in Brazil. Profit margins in the fourth quarter should continue to move higher due to price realization and additional efficiencies generated through our recently launched ZBB initiative.
On Slide 35, we show our priorities for 2017, and everything starts with our largest market, Mexico. The sequential improvements we're seeing in the second half of 2016 will continue into 2017, with exciting innovation to grow consumption in cereal, continued expansion into the HFS channel, effective brand building and exciting opportunities behind our growing snacks businesses. The integration of Parati in Brazil will be executed flawlessly given our proven success with integrating Pringles several years ago, coupled with our common cultures and complementary businesses. Revenue growth is critical to driving profitable growth, executing our portfolio by retail environment and implementing the right price and size, effective promotions, while driving mix will help us generate sales and profitability. And we'll continue our path with supply chain optimization with step changes ahead. 
So in summary, a laser-sharp focus on these priorities should allow us to better manage through current regional volatility and deliver good low single-digit growth and expanded profit margins in 2017. This will put us well on our way toward our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with this, I'll turn it over to Amit Banati, President of Asia-Pacific, currently in Singapore."
283356,378975174,1068646,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Maria Fernando, and good morning, well, evening for me from Singapore. We are having a good year in Kellogg Asia-Pacific. Our top line growth has been consistent, led by Pringles and emerging markets. And our joint ventures are also growing strong",821,"Thanks, Maria Fernando, and good morning, well, evening for me from Singapore. We are having a good year in Kellogg Asia-Pacific. Our top line growth has been consistent, led by Pringles and emerging markets. And our joint ventures are also growing strongly. Profit margins have moved higher, and we have plans to increase them further. And most importantly, we have continued to make progress in our key strategic initiatives, and these will make Asia-Pacific a sustainable growth engine for Kellogg for years to come. 
On Slide 37, we show the priorities for Asia-Pacific that have been communicated at Day at K last year. In 2016, we continued to make strong progress against our priorities to transform the region. We have a more balanced portfolio. Asia and Africa now account for about 2/3 of the region sales. Snacks now account for about 1/3 of the region sales. We have made good progress in stabilizing our Australian business, particularly in cereal, where we are seeing much better category and share trends. Pringles has delivered strong growth in 2016. 
After 2 years of double-digit growth in Asia, we have seen growth moderate in 2016, primarily due to challenging market conditions in India in the first half of the year. But we are growing overall, and India is recovering in the second half. And in South Africa, we have seen strong growth in both our wholly-owned operations and our joint venture in Nigeria. 
Slide 38 discusses our quarter 3 performance and how we see quarter 4 shaping up. We continued to post increased sales in quarter 3, with Pringles and emerging markets driving the growth. We are seeing our Australian Cereals business stabilize in 2016, with improved consumption and share trends in the Cereals category. The drivers of improved performance include a renovation to 4-star foods of our biggest brand Nutri-Grain, which is now in growth; the launch of a gluten-free range, which is the #1 innovation in the Cereal category year-to-date; and improved execution in stores. 
Our Pringles business had a strong quarter 3, growing sales at a double-digit rate. Growth was driven by distribution expansion in emerging markets and new innovations expanding the Pringles portfolio such as the introduction of sweet flavors in Korea and the launch of Tortilla across the region. Emerging markets remain a source of growth for the region, with Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia key highlights for us in quarter 3. Quarter 3 sales growth was impacted by Korea, lapping the year-ago supply disruption of a major competitor. Growth was also impacted by challenging economic and regulatory conditions in India in the first half, and our snacks business in Australia has remained soft. We have seen sequential improvement in our performance in India and Australia snacks each quarter. As a result, we expect growth to accelerate in quarter 4. This will result in full year sales growth in the low single-digit range.
Again, it is important not to forget our unconsolidated joint ventures shown on Slide 39. These are a key element of our emerging markets growth strategy. Year-to-date, our joint venture in China and our joint venture and investment stake in Nigeria are both growing at a strong double-digit rate despite operating in very challenging business environments. When you consider that our share of these businesses net sales is equivalent to roughly half the size of our Asia-Pacific region, you can understand how significantly they would add to our overall growth if they were consolidated into our results.
We have strong plans for 2017, represented on Slide 40. We will build on our progress on stabilizing our Australian Cereal business. Turning around our Wholesome Snacks business in Australia will be a key priority. We recently launched Special K Protein bites and Nutri-Grain edge bars, and they are both off to a strong good start. We have also relaunched the Be Natural brand with new food and packaging. 
Emerging markets will continue to be a growth driver across both cereal and snacks. In cereals, we continue to drive category development in emerging markets, and we will also launch Wholesome Snacks in South Korea and Southeast Asia. We continue to expect strong growth on Pringles behind innovation and distribution expansion in emerging markets as we expand offerings at affordable price points. Small cans now account for 20% of our Pringles sales in the region. 
2017 will also see an increased focus on driving operating margin expansion as we roll out zero-based budgeting and revenue growth management. In terms of outlook, we expect net sales growth in the low single-digit range for Kellogg Asia-Pacific in 2017, with sales from our joint ventures in effect bringing that pace of growth much higher. Meanwhile, profit margins should expand, driving higher profit and putting us closer to our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to John Bryant for some final remarks."

All these elements help us build a larger emerging market footprint within our company. It's also worth highlighting that Pringles has changed the nature of our emerging markets business from being focused on cereal; those having the ability to drive snacks expansion. The emerging market has certainly helped us -- sorry, Pringles has certainly helped us make that a reality within emerging markets. As we go forward, we think we're increasingly well positioned to get better growth, both on the top line and on margin expansion, as you heard from the international area presidents here this morning."

If you want to refer to some charts there, you'll see it on the charts as well. But Project K, balance of the program to hit the $425 million to $475 million worth of savings. So roughly $140 million to $190 million of savings over the next couple years, '17 and '18, to hit that range. And we have said that more than half of that savings would come in 2017.

If we rewind the clock back a few quarters and think about how you and Mills and a few of the other guys in the industry were thinking about category growth rate at the start of the year? But I've said something about like flat to low single digits, driven by gluten-free, artificial-free, all these different forms of incremental innovation. What do you think at the end of the day stopped us short reaching that goal? Was it food deflation? Something consumer behavior? But bottom line, what do we need to see to bring incremental users at the category?"

And a part of that was the improvement we've seen over the last 3 or 4 years in consumption trends in cereal, particularly in our business. And if you look at consumption in 2017, we're going to end up down about 1%. That's actually a significant improvement of the prior year's, not quite where I'd hope we'd get to, but we're certainly trending in the right direction. Our shipments might have been 100, 200 basis points less than that, because we are expecting a full year trade inventory reduction in the Cereal business based than what we saw in the third quarter. So I think we're heading in the right direction with a little bit maybe too optimistic we'd get there in 2016? Perhaps. But I think, as Paul said, for 2017, we expect to see the continued improvement and it's going to come through by engaging consumers of great food, engaging them with the brands, bringing it to life in store, a whole variety of factors that we know historically have driven the Cereal business performance."

So what makes one brand react might be different from another. We clearly saw a reinvestment in our core foods around, say, Special K Red Berries, which is a significant part of our lineup, turned the business back to positive growth on a year-to-date basis this year. K's growing and growing share. We see Rice Krispies do extremely well this year, not because of necessarily innovation or renovation but because of consumer engagement around recipe usage and versatility, and I think that's driving that brand. Frosted Flakes is another brand that's growing well against teens and tweens this year. So -- and that, again, I would say, is driven by in-store activation behind big properties, properties like Finding Dory or the Olympics events. So it's not the same ingredients behind every brand. When it comes to ZBB reinvestment, we have put some money back in the business this year. We put it back in our sales force again to drive greater activation right through to the point-of-purchase. So sometimes it's behind a brand, sometimes is focusing on getting the assortment right and the perfect shelf at store and that takes resources at the store level to do that. We did choose to reinvest in Keebler this year, which obviously isn't a cereal, but that was the choice coming out of ZBB reinvestment, and we've seen positive returns on that. So I do think it comes down to core 6 brands. And the one thing we can do better next year, I believe, is get Kashi back to growth. Kashi responds to many needs out there that some of the Kellogg traditional legacy brands can't. It's growing in the natural channel, 4%, 5%. We need to get it beyond stable to growth in mainstream measure channels as well next year. We do that plus the core 6. I think you'll see the category flatten out and maybe chip into growth."

I did expect a little more progress than we got. We started, as you know, 18 months ago. We put our team back out in California, and that team has been extremely focused on getting our food right. So we have completely renovated all of our foods to be nonGMO product verified and about 30% to 40% of our portfolio is now organic. So we've done a lot of the fundamentals of getting the food right, in particular in our biggest business. We then decided to exit some categories, frozen pizzas, for example. And that's -- we're getting out of things that we don't think were a good fit for the Kashi brand. And we turned our attention to innovating and renovating aggressively on our Wholesome Snacks business, which, as John mentioned earlier, Wholesome Snacks is again all about getting the food right. As we look at consumer reaction to Kashi, we're getting good reaction. A lot of positive social reaction to the brand, which means I feel confident about the equity. I think our foods are all getting back on trend. I think -- and this is the important bit, you're right, with great execution which I think we can improve on. We will return this business to growth. So I think there's a journey we're on here and we need to turn up execution, because I think all the other elements are coming together. We have brand-new communication about to hit early next year. We would've been great if we could have got that out a bit earlier, but we're getting to where we want to get to, we just need to execute now."

There's no issue with consumer. A lot of the food, we just -- we missed it here and now we're focused very much on getting back to growth. I foresee growth for Morningstar Farms next year as we go forward. We did lose one item, which shows through in the numbers, unfortunately, negatively, is we did lose a big item in the club channel, one of our best sellers, and we're working hard to get that item back in the organic format.

I'm happy to report Q3 profit and earnings that came in ahead of our expectations. A lower tax rate was positive over delivery, but so was broad-based profit margin expansion that exceeded our expectations. Candidly, top line growth did not come in as we had hoped, and there were specific factors behind that, which we'll discuss in a moment. But we did see growth and sequential improvement in many parts of our business. 
Behind the numbers, there's great progress being made not only against our strategy, as represented by our 2020 Growth Plan, but also against the key business priorities we laid out for you 1 year ago at our Day at K investor event. These efforts should continue to yield sequential improvement in our results. We saw it in Q3 and we'll see it again in Q4, finishing the year largely as we originally expected in operating profit, albeit due more by margin expansion and less by net sales growth. And this improvement will continue into 2017 as we continue to believe we have the right plans to bring sales at least to flat and enough productivity initiatives to drive us well on our way to a 350 basis point improvement goal we have set for 2015 to 2018 on a currency-neutral comparable basis, excluding Venezuela. 
Today, Ron, the Region Presidents and I will take you through our results, progress and outlook. And we use as a basis for measurement the priorities we shared with you back at Day at K.
I will start by reminding you of the 2020 Growth Plan, which we unveiled to you at last November's Day at K investor event and which is shown on Slide 5. There are 2 important points to make here. First, that this growth plan is informing our investment decisions, and our 2016 priorities were all geared toward delivering on this strategy. As we discuss our progress against our 2016 priorities, we are really discussing our progress against this 2020 Growth Plan. 
The second point is that our acceleration of profit margin expansion is by no means a change in strategy. OP margin expansion has always sat front and center of our 2020 Growth Plan. And there's more to this profit margin expansion than simply executing initiatives. A couple of months ago, we told you about how we are refreshing our Volume to Value operating model for today's environment. Volume to Value is being embraced and measured throughout the organization. This should give you another reason to believe in our 2018 margin expansion target. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's walk through our progress against our strategy. On Slide 6, we recount the 2016 priorities we shared with you at Day at K 1 year ago. Clearly, there is tangible progress being made. We set to stabilize our 4 largest cereal markets: U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. We have invested in food, repositioned Special K, focused our marketing resources behind highest ROI brands and activities, and we have made substantial progress in all but the U.K., which is a work in progress. 
Expanding Pringles worldwide has been a priority for this year. And in Q3, we continue to see good growth in that brand. Emerging markets have been dramatically scaled up through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we've grown organically in these emerging markets as well. 
Enhancing our sales capabilities was another priority, and we've rolled out revenue growth management disciplines, processes and tools around the world. We said this was necessary for price realization, and we've seen our price realization go from being down slightly in the first half to being flat in Q3, with an expectation of slightly positive price realization in Q4. 
Also regarding sales capabilities, we just announced our biggest ever acquisition in Latin America, which will not only give us much needed scale in Brazil, but also gives us the ability to leverage a very strong reach into high-frequency stores. 
Increasing earnings visibility through deep productivity and savings initiatives has been a key priority for us this year, and it's already showing up in our results, with Q3 recording yet another year-on-year gain in OP margin. We're delivering on our productivity initiatives, we're shifting our brand building to higher ROI brands and investments, and we're starting to turn around our price realization. So good progress is being made even if our top line has not yet reflected it. 
With that, let me turn it to Ron, who will talk you through our financial results, progress and outlook."

Slide #7 shows highlights of the financial results for the third quarter.

And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. The appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on our GAAP and non-GAAP performance.
Third quarter net sales decreased modestly and came in short of our expectations, but our operating profit increased, driven by savings from Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting as well as by price increases in Venezuela. This exceeded our expectations, and we generated this solid profit growth and margin expansion across all of our regions, making good progress toward our 2018 operating margin expansion goal. Earnings per share exceeded our expectations, not only because of profit margin expansion, but also due to a lower effective tax rate. This performance included $0.04 of currency headwind or about 4 to 5 percentage points of EPS growth impact. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and the components of the third quarter sales. Our currency-neutral comparable net sales declined in the third quarter, and this included unexpected trade inventory decreases in U.S. Cereal and Pop-Tarts, continued softness in U.K. Cereal and a more prolonged transition on shelf for our overhauled Kashi and Morningstar Farms portfolios. The good news is we saw growth in several businesses, including U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty Channels, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, both with and without Venezuela. And we continue to post good growth in Pringles across the globe.
Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was up 60 basis points in the quarter and a bit less for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting initiatives all delivered savings as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America, where our gross profit margin improved year-on-year even despite investment in food, adverse transactional foreign currency impact in Canada and adverse mix in snacks, driven by softness in our wholesome snacks business. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance were gross margin declines in our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by adverse transactional foreign currency impact on dollar-based commodities and other inputs as well as a deflationary retailer environment in Europe. But they also reflected adverse country and category mix. Project K, Zero-Based Budgeting and the rollout of revenue growth management are designed to address our gross profit margin performance going forward. 
Slide 10 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating margin, excluding Venezuela, for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by nearly a full percentage point in the third quarter. And by Zero-Based Budgeting and Project K efforts, we generated substantial efficiencies in our SG&A expenses. It's important to note that Q3's margin expansion was broad-based, with operating margin up year-on-year in all 4 of our regions. 
Slide 11 shows our cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow through the third quarter was more than 10% higher than that of the year-ago period. And recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by $97 million after tax. Importantly, we continued to improve our core working capital as a percent of sales, both sequentially and year-on-year. We're still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital spending. And full year capital spending should come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of $525 million to $625 million, reflecting greater efficiency and the prioritization of projects. 
Slide 12 shows how we expect to end the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis so that we can remove volatility from currency translation and mark-to-market adjustments. We expect sequential improvement in our x Venezuela net sales performance in the fourth quarter. The current trends had led us to adjust our outlook. So instead of finishing flat on sales for the year, as was our previous guidance, we now believe sales will be a little less than that, probably down about 1%. 
Our operating profit guidance remains unchanged at the high end of the 4% to 6% growth range, excluding Venezuela, thanks to our productivity efforts and our savings performance. We should see our operating margin exceed 15% in 2016, putting us well on the path toward our goal of increasing our margin by 350 basis points between 2015 and 2018. 
On earnings per share, we are raising our guidance both on a comparable and currency-neutral comparable basis. This reflects the tax rate favorability we recorded in the third quarter, which should more than offset any increase in our average shares outstanding as we curb share repurchases in the fourth quarter to fund our acquisition in Brazil. 
A couple of words on the financial impact of the Parati acquisition, which we expect to close later this year. Net the acquisition is neutral to a comparable basis earnings per share in 2016, even after the effect of curbing share buybacks in the quarter in order to maintain current debt levels. Integration costs are expected to amount to roughly $0.01 per share in 2016, but this merely puts us at the top end of our previously announced range of $0.02 to $0.03 for the company this year. 
Slide 13 shows some additional elements of our 2016 guidance, and I'll just highlight where there have been changes. First, the currency impact is roughly $0.01 better than previous guidance based on current rates. Our comparable tax rate will now be approximately 25%, reflecting favorability, primarily from the adoption of a new standard on accounting for stock-based compensation at the beginning of the year. Share buybacks should be approximately $450 million to $550 million. And as I mentioned, we're curbing repurchases for the time being to fund the acquisition we are making in Brazil. And full year integration costs are now anticipated to be at the high end of our previous estimate of $0.02 to $0.03 net of tax, and this now does incorporate the roughly $0.01 of closing in integration costs for the Brazil acquisition. 
Slide 14 offers a preliminary view of 2017. As we shared with you previously, we are forecasting net sales to be approximately flat in 2017. In effect, this consists of lower volume, offset by higher price/mix performance as we employ revenue growth management initiatives and adhere to our Volume to Value principles. This flat outlook is prudent in our view even as we strive to do better than flat. Our operating profit should increase at a high single-digit rate in 2017 as our operating margin expansion makes up about half of the remaining basis points of our 350 basis point challenge through 2018. 
As discussed previously, the key drivers of the expansion will be the following: our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity designed to mitigate input cost inflation, revenue growth management to improve our price/mix contribution, Project K savings and Zero-Based Budgeting efficiencies. We believe these initiatives give us good visibility into our margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. 
Slide 15 shows our 350 basis point profit margin expansion target through 2018, and it shows how this shapes up across our 4 regions. This is essentially an update of a chart we showed at Day at K last year, only accelerated forward to 2018 from previously 2020. As you can see, we are taking a prudent view towards net sales growth, particularly in the more developed North America and Europe regions. We believe this is the right way to forecast net sales growth, particularly in the current environment, but we aspire to do better than this. Our operating profit margin expansion skews heavily towards North America and Europe. These are our bigger businesses with strong productivity savings opportunities. In Latin America and Asia-Pacific, we will be pursuing similar initiatives, but the impact isn't quite as large, as we are still on early stages of scaling up emerging markets in these regions. 
Before I pass the call over to the regions, let's briefly take a look at Slide 16. This is a recap versus what we shared with you at Day at K, focusing on our financial goals. Simply put, in 2016, we're delivering on everything we said we would, with the exception of net sales growth. We are on track to come in at the high end of our operating profit goal and exceeding our goal on currency-neutral comparable earnings per share. We have accelerated our target for operating margin expansion, expecting to reach it 2 years earlier. We're delivering on our productivity and Project K savings and have expanded our Zero-Based Budgeting program. And we've made acquisitions that perfectly fit our strategic imperatives, while being fiscally prudent and continuing to deliver strong cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility. So we made good progress towards our financial goals. 
We're now going to turn it over to each of our Region Presidents, who will give you a closer look at the results, priorities and outlooks for their respective businesses. We'll start with Paul Norman, our President of North America."

No question that 2016 has been a busy year for us here in North America. Admittedly, the results have been a bit mixed, with top line not recovering as quickly as I'd hoped, but profit margin expansion exceeding our expectations. There's been a lot more progress than our top line would suggest. 
If we turn to Slide 18, we can see the priorities we set out for ourselves for 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K investor event. Stabilizing our Cereal business was our priority. While the category was held at a 1% rate of decline, this is significantly better than in recent years. We have invested in food. We prioritized investment behind our core brands, and we've gained share as a result. And we're particularly pleased with how we stabilized Special K.
We also said we have to revitalize our Snacks business. The consumption data shows that our efforts to prioritize investment behind our most important and on-trend brands are working. We're growing our big 3 cracker brands, we're growing Pringles and we're growing Rice Krispies Treats. And across our portfolio, consumption is up double digit in on-the-go offerings. 
Frozen and Kashi are still works in progress. Much of the heavy-lifting has been done, with packaging overhauls now largely behind us in Frozen, and Kashi's transformation of its portfolio already contribution -- contributing, sorry, to stabilization in Cereal. We have plans to stabilize our other Kashi categories, too.
Fuel for growth refers to all the things we're doing to improve our profit margins. From executing our Project K network restructuring and shared services model to delivering on Zero-Based Budgeting, we are generating fuel for growth, and you can see it in our increased profit margins this year. We've also launched a more comprehensive approach to revenue growth management, which is already showing positive signs. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's discuss each of our North America segments in turn, starting with our 2016 results and then looking ahead to 2017. We'll start with Morning Foods on Slide #19. Morning Foods posted another quarter of solid operating profit growth, with improvements in our margins coming from our productivity efforts under ZBB and Project K. Top line came in a little lighter than we had expected, and this was due to an unexpected reduction in trade inventories. Our Cereal consumption was down about 1% and in line with our year-to-date trend. Now Pop-Tarts consumption was actually up about 1%, so shipments clearly lacked consumption in the quarter. 
Our underlying progress is clear. We gained 20 basis points of share in cereal and 50 basis points of share in toaster pastries. Our core 6 cereal brands continue to benefit from focused investment, leading our share gain. Year-to-date, Kellogg has most of the highest velocity 2016 innovations in ready-to-eat cereal, maintaining innovation share leadership, led by Special K Nourish, S'Mores and our Finding Dory-licensed cereal.
We executed well during the Back to School period, which coincided with our Olympics activation. This year's Olympics program generated over 1.8 billion impressions at 30% less cost than our prior Summer Olympics programs. This was driven by a greater focus on social activation, and it demonstrates our new marketing model at work. So we continue to improve the underlying fundamentals on our business. As we look to Q4, we expect to see Morning Foods sales down slightly again, but down less than we saw in Q3. And we expect to see continued margin expansion resulting in strong operating profit growth. 
Slide 20 offers a few thoughts on 2017 for Morning Foods. We will look to build momentum, expecting to see sequential improvement in top line and another year of strong profit margin expansion. Our plan to achieve this revolves around the 4 ingredients Craig Bahner outlined a year ago. Firstly, ensuring we have food that rocks through great innovation and value-adding renovation against our second priority, brands that matter, namely our core 6 cereal brands and Pop-Tarts. Thirdly, we will continue to drive excitement through events and properties that drive category engagement and fun in store. Helping this will be the recent completion of a further expansion of our sales force, adding more feet to the street. Fourth and finally, we will continue to expand margins through Project K, ZBB discipline, revenue growth management and a higher return on investment on every marketing dollar we invest. This should keep us on the path towards the 2018 goals that Ron shared a moment ago. 
If I were to highlight a couple of examples of initiatives coming early in 2017 on cereal, I would point to some exciting innovations behind Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran Crunch as well as a core food improvement initiative on one of our biggest brands, Mini-Wheats. We also place continuing focus on driving Special K through the expansion of the Nourish franchise and the renovation of fit enrollment [ph]. On Pop-Tarts, following the success of A&W Root Beer and Orange Crush flavors, we have 2 new great Dunkin' Donuts-inspired flavors launching in Q1. 
Let's now turn to Snacks on Slide 21. We saw strong progress in Snacks in the quarter. We continue to realize strong profit margin expansion, thanks to Project K and ZBB. We had planned to stabilize sales, and we did just that. We saw good growth in Q3 by almost all of our focused brands. Let's start with crackers where our big 3 cracker brands, Cheez-It, Club and Town House, continue to collectively grow sales and gain share in the quarter. Pringles also grew consumption in the quarter. Rice Krispies Treats continued to grow sales and share, and Nutri-Grain also picked up share. Single-serve, a key element to our Snacks growth strategy, posted double-digit consumption gains in cookies and cracker caddy packs as well as in Pringles Snack Stacks. Legacy weight management offerings, particularly our Special K bars and cracker chips, remained a drag in the quarter, just as we said they would be as we go into more aggressive portfolio actions in early 2017. But even with this drag, the Snacks segment saw good sequential improvement in net sales. 
So Snacks is starting to turn the corner for us. In Q4, we expect to see sequential improvement again in net sales to slight growth. With continued Project K and ZBB efforts as well as the work we're doing on revenue growth management, we expect to generate margin expansion and strong operating profit growth, too. 
Turning to 2017 on Slide 22. For Snacks, our goal next year is to return to top line growth while further improving our margins. Deanie Elsner and her team will continue to drive the agenda they began this year, focusing behind our core brands like Cheez-It, Pringles and Rice Krispies Treats. And they'll continue to do this through a combination of more impactful brand building, innovation and renovation of food and packaging, in-store excitement and small formats to drive consumption in new locations through expanded distribution. Initiatives of note coming early next year are new flavors of Cheez-It Duoz and Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers as well as the launch of a new line of variants under Pringles called Loud. We will also continue to expand single-serve caddy packs and small-format offerings, which we know are highly incremental. 
Our other significant goal next year is to stabilize wholesome snacks. In the first quarter, we will be executing a comprehensive restage of Special K bars behind new food, packaging and communication and bringing significant renovation and innovation to Nutri-Grain also. Revenue growth management will be a key element for us in Snacks. We kicked it off with the Cheez-It brand in late 2015 and are still in the process of expanding it across our whole product line. These efforts, along with continued savings from Project K and ZBB, should boost our Snacks margins again in 2017, keeping us well on pace for our 2018 margin goals. 
Now let's turn to our U.S. Specialty Channels business on Slide 23. This is a critical business for us when it comes to our strategic priority of winning where the shopper shops. And I'm happy to report that this segment continues to turn in steady growth in sales, margins and operating profit. In Q3, we once again delivered growth in all 3 of our core channels: Foodservice, vending and convenience. We held or gained share in 4 of 7 categories in Foodservice; in 3 of 5 in vending; and in 5 of 7 in convenience. This impressive performance was driven by increased distribution, effective promotions around the Olympics, Pringles Summer Jam and a limited time offering of Pop-Tarts as well as strong innovation performance in K-12, including items like wholegrain Rice Krispies Treats and Cheez-It. Meanwhile, revenue growth management and ZBB continue to improve our profit margins in this important business. And we expect more of the same in Q4, with a strong finish to the year across all channels. 
Slide 24 shows some of our expectations for 2017. For Specialty in 2017, Wendy Davidson and her team expect continued top and bottom line momentum across our channels. We plan to take advantage of category growth trends and to further leverage new food and packaging formats to drive brand ubiquity and reach across our core channels. We'll leverage emerging channels to test and learn, just as we've been doing this year with Bear Naked Custom Granola in direct-to-consumer and in partnered innovation with restaurant chains. We'll also continue to generate margin expansion through revenue growth management and ZBB, with KNA's 2018 profit margin goal squarely in our sights. So we expect another good performance from Specialty in 2017. 
Lastly, we'll discuss our North America Other segment, which comprise of U.S. Frozen Foods, Canada and Kashi and shown on Slide 25. In truth, I'm disappointed with the results of this segment in the third quarter. Canadian results were as we had expected. We experienced adverse volume impact in reaction to our increased list prices and future prices. These pricing actions were necessary to help offset higher input costs due to significant transactional foreign exchange pressure. The rest of North America Other is undergoing big transformations in food, packaging and SKU lineups. We thought these transitions will be fully behind us by Q3, but they are taking longer than we had expected. 
In Frozen, we recorded good profit margin expansion, but disappointed on the top line. Eggo posted sales growth, with particular success in the quarter behind the Disney-licensed products. But this was more than offset by the impact of distribution loss on Morningstar Farms as we transitioned over the past few quarters to new packaging. 
At Kashi, we're encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in cereal share in measured channels as well as the plus-5% growth in the natural channel. It means our substantial innovation and renovation efforts are starting to take hold, and we really haven't turned on global-scale consumer communication yet. So cereal is on its way even if it is still down year-on-year. However, wholesome snacks is proving to be a much bigger drag on sales than we had anticipated. Consumption has declined sharply as distribution losses have continued prior to renovation and innovation interventions coming in 2017. 
Let's look ahead to 2017 on Slide 26. For the North America Other segment, we expect improved sales and profit growth as the Kashi, Frozen and Canadian teams reap the awards of their work to reset in 2016. Overall, we expect to see top line growth in this North America Other segment. Meanwhile, RGM and ZBB as well as lapping some heavy investment in food should lift profit margins strongly. This will get us back on track towards our 2018 margin goals. 
Our Kashi cereal portfolio is poised to return to growth as distribution has stabilized and our innovation pipeline is strong. The recently launched Dark Cocoa Karma Wheat Biscuit Cereal is going very well, and we have an excellent new GOLEAN variant coming in January. Acceptance so far from our customers has been strong. Our largest challenge in 2017 on Kashi will continue to be wholesome snacks. We have renovation and innovation coming early in the year, which will significantly change the trend we have been experiencing. However, I doubt we will get the wholesome snacks part of this business back to growth on the full year. 
In Frozen Foods, our focus is on driving core Eggo, with new taste-oriented communication breaking in January as well as significant renovation with the removal of artificials from all of our waffles in the first quarter. On Morningstar Farms, we are focused on reactivating communication now that the packaging is on shelf and we have significant innovation building in the first half of the year.  Finally, in Canada, we will be lapping our pricing interventions from this year. And as foreign exchange issues moderate, we expect to see a stabilization of sales and a return to margin expansion. 
So in summary, there's been a ton of work behind the scenes this year in Kellogg North America, all aimed at getting our portfolio more on trend in helping our capabilities and execution, and improving profitability. While our top line growth hasn't consistently reflected these efforts yet, it is coming, and we are seeing sequential improvement to go with impressive margin expansion. We are making definitive progress towards the 400 to 450 basis points of operating margin improvement we're targeting through 2018. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Chris Hood, President of Kellogg Europe."
283356,378975174,1068949,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva.

For Kellogg Europe, 2016 will be viewed as a year in which we improved our profitability and got most of our business back on track. We've continued to accelerate the growth of Pringles. We've returned wholesome snacks to growth. We've stabilized our Cereal business in most of the region, and we're growing net sales in 5 of our 6 geographic clusters. The one exception is U.K. Cereal, which makes up just over 20% of our total sales.
U.K. is a market where a sluggish economy and a difficult retail environment have resulted in net price deflation. We've underperformed in our premium adult portfolio, most notably Special K and All-Bran. And this has resulted in sharp sales declines year-to-date in this important market. But it's important not to overlook the good progress we've made elsewhere in the region. 
A good way to assess this progress is Slide #28, where we can compare against the priorities we set out for Kellogg Europe in 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K event. Cereal is stabilizing, with over half of our markets holding or growing share, a significant improvement versus last year. Needless to say, our primary focus right now and into 2017 will be on stabilizing the U.K. business and getting Special K back on track. But we are showing improvement in the rest of Europe, and that was a priority for this year. 
Pringles has been a big success since we acquired this brand in 2012. We're seeing continued, high single-digit growth, with broad-based share growth across almost all markets. This marks 4 years in a row of high single-digit growth in this brand, and we're doing this by strengthening the core of the brand and assessing -- accessing new locations and new markets, the additional sizes and geographic expansion. 
Wholesome snacks has returned to growth across Europe in 2016, driven by investing in the renovation of Special K bars and innovation like Kellogg-branded fruit and nut bars. Our emerging markets of Russia and Arabia have made substantial progress despite difficult operating conditions. Our Russian business is up strongly year-to-date. And our acquisitions in Egypt, Bisco Misr and Mass Food, are both growing at a rapid clip as well. As discussed last year, e-commerce is a big channel for us in Europe. This channel represents over $100 million of our sales, $100 million, and we enjoy share premiums in our categories compared to the total market. 
And last, we continue to drive transformational change within our cost structure behind Project K; implementation of shared services; getting started with Zero-Based Budgeting, where we're about a year behind North America; and implementing revenue growth management to improve net price realization. We've increased our operating profit margin by 70 basis points already this year and by over 400 basis points over the last 4 years. So there's good progress being made across Europe on the priorities we established last November. Unfortunately, the growth progress is being somewhat masked by difficult market conditions in the U.K. on our Cereal business. Looking forward, we expect to stabilize top line sales and continue to drive strong profit expansion. 
Slide 29 discusses our 2016 results and outlook. As you can see, we posted strong profit growth in Q3. Our sales were off slightly, almost solely due to our Cereal business in the U.K. In the rest of Europe, we posted sales growth in virtually all of our subregions. France Benelux grew high single digits. Southern Europe and the Mediterranean Middle East posted low single-digit growth, and Russia recorded a strong double-digit gain. And we are holding or growing share in over half of our cereal markets while sustaining strong Pringles momentum. As we go into Q4, we'll work to drive sequential share improvement on our core brands, and we should post another quarter of margin expansion and profit growth. We will finish 2016 with a slight decline in net sales, but significant profit expansion due to all of our productivity initiatives. 
Turning to Slide #30. Here's how we're thinking about 2017. In combination across Cereal and Snacks, we expect total Europe 2017 sales to be flat to down slightly. We're making good progress on stabilizing our Cereal business in most of Europe. There's already quite a bit of work going on in turning around the U.K. We're simplifying and focusing our operations to drive a stronger core business. We're accelerating the repositioning of the Special K brand behind recently launched on-trend offerings, like Special K Nourish, which has been successful elsewhere in the world. We're crafting a better, more balanced commercial plan. And we're using revenue growth management to get our prices and pack formats right in order to reverse the deflation that we've been experiencing. With all of these plans, we are expecting sequential improvement on U.K. Cereal during 2017, with continued decline albeit at a moderated pace. 
Pringles still has plenty of room to grow. Food renovation, commercial innovation and geographic expansion will all continue in 2017. And executing our productivity initiatives will continue to be a focus. Delivering our expected savings from Project K, global business services and Zero-Based Budgeting are all critical to enabling the investments in food renovation and covering Brexit-related transactional currency impact. 
In summary, we have more work to do, but we are seeing some green shoots of sales recovery, and we are confident that we can bring stability to our European Cereal business while continuing to grow Snacks. Meanwhile, we'll continue to boost productivity to drive profitable growth, staying on course toward our 2018 operating profit margin goal of 300 to 350 incremental basis points. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Maria Fernanda Mejia, President of Kellogg Latin America."
283356,378975174,1068949,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone.

Latin America continues to be an important growth opportunity for Kellogg, a key element to the company's 2020 Growth Plan. Our programs are fully aligned to this growth plan. And we're prioritizing investment behind markets like Mexico, Caribbean Central America and Andean, strengthening our leadership in Cereal, while expanding our Snacks footprint. And we're building scale in more emerging markets like Brazil. But as you know, nothing is ever simple in Latin America. We have to manage very carefully through an extremely challenging external environment. 
When we met last November during Day at K, we outlined our strategy and key areas of focus for 2016. A year later, I'm pleased to share with you the tremendous progress, as shown on Slide 32. Leading category growth is evident from our share growth in many core cereal markets, our record shares in wholesome snacks in Brazil and Colombia, and our double-digit growth on Pringles in markets like Mexico. Driving this growth has been innovation. We've expanded our offerings under the Kellogg's parent brand growing double digit. And our most recent introductions for Special K, protein cereal and nut bars, are exceeding our expectations.
We continue to drive our distribution and sales coverage in high-frequency stores, while improving our in-store execution by tailoring our regional commercial programs by retail environment. And we've continued to increase our supply chain network utilization significantly over the past 3 years. We've enabled our innovation platforms, strengthened our packaging capabilities and evolved our business models through partnerships with co-manufacturers, enhancing our speed to market. And we delivered margin improvement through efficiency programs like Project K, KIM [ph] and ZBB, all of which are combining with price realization to offset foreign exchange headwinds. So great progress being made across our priorities. 
A driver of market expansion will be M&A. And one of the most exciting transformational components of our growth plan can be seen on Slide 33. Our recently announced acquisition of Parati, which we hope to close in the fourth quarter, completely changes the game for us in Brazil, a market where we have been present and where we've been growing for a number of years, but where we've lacked critical scale. With Parati, we more than doubled our size in the high-growth potential Mercosur region, bringing it from just over 10% of Kellogg Latin America sales to over 25%. And we substantially increased our overall presence in Snacks, taking it roughly from 20% of Kellogg Latin America sales to about 1/3. This is a company that plays in attractive categories, with strong brands and a track record of growth. It's largely regional, with its foothold in the South, so there is geographic expansion opportunity. It's link in high-frequency stores will be leveraged across our Kellogg brand. 
Slide 34 summarizes our performance in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. After a relatively soft first half, driven by region-wide economic slowdown and FX impact, we returned to growth in quarter 3. We saw growth in both Cereal and in Snacks, and the growth was broad-based. Mexico, Mercosur, Caribbean Central America all posted sales growth in the quarter, aided by price realization. For the region, excluding volatile Venezuela, we've held our shares for the Cereal category flat year-to-date, with gains in markets like Brazil, Colombia and Puerto Rico. And in the recent periods, we have seen Mexico regain some share it lost earlier in the year. Snacks is showing strong momentum across the region, both on wholesome and salty. 
Meanwhile, our productivity efforts and price realization are starting to flow through to profit margin, which improved strongly in the third quarter. The team continues to manage well through very difficult economic and currency conditions. And we should not overlook the very good work done to manage through continuous crisis in Venezuela. We are expecting another quarter of sequential acceleration in net sales in the fourth quarter on improved price realization, stronger commercial plans and relevant innovation across categories hitting the stores, and this despite a difficult economic environment in Brazil. Profit margins in the fourth quarter should continue to move higher due to price realization and additional efficiencies generated through our recently launched ZBB initiative.
On Slide 35, we show our priorities for 2017, and everything starts with our largest market, Mexico. The sequential improvements we're seeing in the second half of 2016 will continue into 2017, with exciting innovation to grow consumption in cereal, continued expansion into the HFS channel, effective brand building and exciting opportunities behind our growing snacks businesses. The integration of Parati in Brazil will be executed flawlessly given our proven success with integrating Pringles several years ago, coupled with our common cultures and complementary businesses. Revenue growth is critical to driving profitable growth, executing our portfolio by retail environment and implementing the right price and size, effective promotions, while driving mix will help us generate sales and profitability. And we'll continue our path with supply chain optimization with step changes ahead. 
So in summary, a laser-sharp focus on these priorities should allow us to better manage through current regional volatility and deliver good low single-digit growth and expanded profit margins in 2017. This will put us well on our way toward our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points.

Our top line growth has been consistent, led by Pringles and emerging markets. And our joint ventures are also growing strongly. Profit margins have moved higher, and we have plans to increase them further. And most importantly, we have continued to make progress in our key strategic initiatives, and these will make Asia-Pacific a sustainable growth engine for Kellogg for years to come. 
On Slide 37, we show the priorities for Asia-Pacific that have been communicated at Day at K last year. In 2016, we continued to make strong progress against our priorities to transform the region. We have a more balanced portfolio. Asia and Africa now account for about 2/3 of the region sales. Snacks now account for about 1/3 of the region sales. We have made good progress in stabilizing our Australian business, particularly in cereal, where we are seeing much better category and share trends. Pringles has delivered strong growth in 2016. 
After 2 years of double-digit growth in Asia, we have seen growth moderate in 2016, primarily due to challenging market conditions in India in the first half of the year. But we are growing overall, and India is recovering in the second half. And in South Africa, we have seen strong growth in both our wholly-owned operations and our joint venture in Nigeria. 
Slide 38 discusses our quarter 3 performance and how we see quarter 4 shaping up. We continued to post increased sales in quarter 3, with Pringles and emerging markets driving the growth. We are seeing our Australian Cereals business stabilize in 2016, with improved consumption and share trends in the Cereals category. The drivers of improved performance include a renovation to 4-star foods of our biggest brand Nutri-Grain, which is now in growth; the launch of a gluten-free range, which is the #1 innovation in the Cereal category year-to-date; and improved execution in stores. 
Our Pringles business had a strong quarter 3, growing sales at a double-digit rate. Growth was driven by distribution expansion in emerging markets and new innovations expanding the Pringles portfolio such as the introduction of sweet flavors in Korea and the launch of Tortilla across the region. Emerging markets remain a source of growth for the region, with Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia key highlights for us in quarter 3. Quarter 3 sales growth was impacted by Korea, lapping the year-ago supply disruption of a major competitor. Growth was also impacted by challenging economic and regulatory conditions in India in the first half, and our snacks business in Australia has remained soft. We have seen sequential improvement in our performance in India and Australia snacks each quarter. As a result, we expect growth to accelerate in quarter 4. This will result in full year sales growth in the low single-digit range.
Again, it is important not to forget our unconsolidated joint ventures shown on Slide 39. These are a key element of our emerging markets growth strategy. Year-to-date, our joint venture in China and our joint venture and investment stake in Nigeria are both growing at a strong double-digit rate despite operating in very challenging business environments. When you consider that our share of these businesses net sales is equivalent to roughly half the size of our Asia-Pacific region, you can understand how significantly they would add to our overall growth if they were consolidated into our results.
We have strong plans for 2017, represented on Slide 40. We will build on our progress on stabilizing our Australian Cereal business. Turning around our Wholesome Snacks business in Australia will be a key priority. We recently launched Special K Protein bites and Nutri-Grain edge bars, and they are both off to a strong good start. We have also relaunched the Be Natural brand with new food and packaging. 
Emerging markets will continue to be a growth driver across both cereal and snacks. In cereals, we continue to drive category development in emerging markets, and we will also launch Wholesome Snacks in South Korea and Southeast Asia. We continue to expect strong growth on Pringles behind innovation and distribution expansion in emerging markets as we expand offerings at affordable price points. Small cans now account for 20% of our Pringles sales in the region. 
2017 will also see an increased focus on driving operating margin expansion as we roll out zero-based budgeting and revenue growth management. In terms of outlook, we expect net sales growth in the low single-digit range for Kellogg Asia-Pacific in 2017, with sales from our joint ventures in effect bringing that pace of growth much higher. Meanwhile, profit margins should expand, driving higher profit and putting us closer to our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to John Bryant for some final remarks."

We're doing what we said we'd do, and this will lead to continued improvement in our financial performance. We're disappointed by our recent sales performance, but improving underlying fundamentals point to sequential improvement in Q4 and 2017. We have unprecedented earnings visibility. That's because of our productivity programs like Project K and ZBB. It's because of revenue growth management and it's because of a refreshed volume-to-value operating model. And we have increased confidence that we can achieve our goal of raising our operating profit margin by 350 basis points from 2015 through 2018.

I mean, our focus is clearly on investing in our brands, first and foremost, so you probably heard me say it on several occasions. Investing behind our biggest brands, be that our big 3 crackers, our core 6 cereals, Rice Krispies Treats, the Eggo brand, the Pop-Tart brand, investing in the food in ways that continuously improve our offerings, sometimes that's removing things people want less out sometimes that's putting more what people want more of like Red Berries, for example, in Special K. Those are the things that allow branded companies like ours and our big brands to compete and play effectively for consumers' pocketbooks in the marketplace. So my focus is very much in improving our foods, bigger and better ideas and driving our investment behind those things. Now how do we invest whether it's old-school television or whether it's more socially driven, I think that's what all of us are working towards. So it doesn't mean that you invest like you always did to get the return you always got. You can be more efficient and effective in the ways you go forward."

We've made significant investments in Nigeria, hoping to open up in Africa. We made 2 acquisitions in Egypt, helping us expand the Mediterranean release region, and we've made a very important acquisition in Brazil earlier this year, which transforms that marketplace for us. All these elements help us build a larger emerging market footprint within our company. It's also worth highlighting that Pringles has changed the nature of our emerging markets business from being focused on cereal; those having the ability to drive snacks expansion. The emerging market has certainly helped us -- sorry, Pringles has certainly helped us make that a reality within emerging markets.

Now we are heading more towards the top end of that range, maybe even a little bit above that range, as we look at our most recent outlook for the year. So we're seeing very good performance from zero-based budgeting. As we move back into 2017, and I did provide an update at the Barclays conference. If you want to refer to some charts there, you'll see it on the charts as well. But Project K, balance of the program to hit the $425 million to $475 million worth of savings. So roughly $140 million to $190 million of savings over the next couple years, '17 and '18, to hit that range. And we have said that more than half of that savings would come in 2017.

So what makes one brand react might be different from another. We clearly saw a reinvestment in our core foods around, say, Special K Red Berries, which is a significant part of our lineup, turned the business back to positive growth on a year-to-date basis this year. K's growing and growing share. We see Rice Krispies do extremely well this year, not because of necessarily innovation or renovation but because of consumer engagement around recipe usage and versatility, and I think that's driving that brand. Frosted Flakes is another brand that's growing well against teens and tweens this year. So -- and that, again, I would say, is driven by in-store activation behind big properties, properties like Finding Dory or the Olympics events. So it's not the same ingredients behind every brand. When it comes to ZBB reinvestment, we have put some money back in the business this year. We put it back in our sales force again to drive greater activation right through to the point-of-purchase. So sometimes it's behind a brand, sometimes is focusing on getting the assortment right and the perfect shelf at store and that takes resources at the store level to do that. We did choose to reinvest in Keebler this year, which obviously isn't a cereal, but that was the choice coming out of ZBB reinvestment, and we've seen positive returns on that. So I do think it comes down to core 6 brands. And the one thing we can do better next year, I believe, is get Kashi back to growth. Kashi responds to many needs out there that some of the Kellogg traditional legacy brands can't. It's growing in the natural channel, 4%, 5%. We need to get it beyond stable to growth in mainstream measure channels as well next year. We do that plus the core 6. I think you'll see the category flatten out and maybe chip into growth."

So we have completely renovated all of our foods to be nonGMO product verified and about 30% to 40% of our portfolio is now organic. So we've done a lot of the fundamentals of getting the food right, in particular in our biggest business. We then decided to exit some categories, frozen pizzas, for example. And that's -- we're getting out of things that we don't think were a good fit for the Kashi brand. And we turned our attention to innovating and renovating aggressively on our Wholesome Snacks business, which, as John mentioned earlier, Wholesome Snacks is again all about getting the food right. As we look at consumer reaction to Kashi, we're getting good reaction. A lot of positive social reaction to the brand, which means I feel confident about the equity. I think our foods are all getting back on trend. I think -- and this is the important bit, you're right, with great execution which I think we can improve on. We will return this business to growth.

We have consumer validated and qualified packaging that we feel very good about. We, with any disruptive innovation, sometimes things can get disruptive. And we have not executed through to the shelf at the pace we expected to be able to execute. So I do think this is a case of execution, unfortunately, in the Morningstar Farms business. If I looked across our business, I look at cereal, I look at snacks, we've seen some very good execution. Kashi will be one area or Morningstar Farms where I think we have opportunity to improve. The good news is, like I say, our packaging is consumer validated. We are now in a place where our distribution is back to normal and where it needs to be. I have visibility to a great pipeline of news coming earlier in the year, and we are now completely focused on communication and regenerating trial. There's no issue with the food. There's no issue with consumer. A lot of the food, we just -- we missed it here and now we're focused very much on getting back to growth. I foresee growth for Morningstar Farms next year as we go forward. We did lose one item, which shows through in the numbers, unfortunately, negatively, is we did lose a big item in the club channel, one of our best sellers, and we're working hard to get that item back in the organic format. When we get that item back, the club business is big for this business. So we're cautiously optimistic that's coming back as well, and that will be a driver of growth for this business next year."

I'm happy to report Q3 profit and earnings that came in ahead of our expectations. A lower tax rate was positive over delivery, but so was broad-based profit margin expansion that exceeded our expectations. Candidly, top line growth did not come in as we had hoped, and there were specific factors behind that, which we'll discuss in a moment. But we did see growth and sequential improvement in many parts of our business. 
Behind the numbers, there's great progress being made not only against our strategy, as represented by our 2020 Growth Plan, but also against the key business priorities we laid out for you 1 year ago at our Day at K investor event. These efforts should continue to yield sequential improvement in our results. We saw it in Q3 and we'll see it again in Q4, finishing the year largely as we originally expected in operating profit, albeit due more by margin expansion and less by net sales growth. And this improvement will continue into 2017 as we continue to believe we have the right plans to bring sales at least to flat and enough productivity initiatives to drive us well on our way to a 350 basis point improvement goal we have set for 2015 to 2018 on a currency-neutral comparable basis, excluding Venezuela. 
Today, Ron, the Region Presidents and I will take you through our results, progress and outlook. And we use as a basis for measurement the priorities we shared with you back at Day at K.
I will start by reminding you of the 2020 Growth Plan, which we unveiled to you at last November's Day at K investor event and which is shown on Slide 5. There are 2 important points to make here. First, that this growth plan is informing our investment decisions, and our 2016 priorities were all geared toward delivering on this strategy. As we discuss our progress against our 2016 priorities, we are really discussing our progress against this 2020 Growth Plan. 
The second point is that our acceleration of profit margin expansion is by no means a change in strategy. OP margin expansion has always sat front and center of our 2020 Growth Plan. And there's more to this profit margin expansion than simply executing initiatives. A couple of months ago, we told you about how we are refreshing our Volume to Value operating model for today's environment. Volume to Value is being embraced and measured throughout the organization. This should give you another reason to believe in our 2018 margin expansion target. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's walk through our progress against our strategy. On Slide 6, we recount the 2016 priorities we shared with you at Day at K 1 year ago. Clearly, there is tangible progress being made. We set to stabilize our 4 largest cereal markets: U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. We have invested in food, repositioned Special K, focused our marketing resources behind highest ROI brands and activities, and we have made substantial progress in all but the U.K., which is a work in progress. 
Expanding Pringles worldwide has been a priority for this year. And in Q3, we continue to see good growth in that brand. Emerging markets have been dramatically scaled up through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we've grown organically in these emerging markets as well. 
Enhancing our sales capabilities was another priority, and we've rolled out revenue growth management disciplines, processes and tools around the world. We said this was necessary for price realization, and we've seen our price realization go from being down slightly in the first half to being flat in Q3, with an expectation of slightly positive price realization in Q4. 
Also regarding sales capabilities, we just announced our biggest ever acquisition in Latin America, which will not only give us much needed scale in Brazil, but also gives us the ability to leverage a very strong reach into high-frequency stores. 
Increasing earnings visibility through deep productivity and savings initiatives has been a key priority for us this year, and it's already showing up in our results, with Q3 recording yet another year-on-year gain in OP margin. We're delivering on our productivity initiatives, we're shifting our brand building to higher ROI brands and investments, and we're starting to turn around our price realization. So good progress is being made even if our top line has not yet reflected it. 
With that, let me turn it to Ron, who will talk you through our financial results, progress and outlook."
283356,378975174,1069393,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, all.

Slide #7 shows highlights of the financial results for the third quarter. In describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. The appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on our GAAP and non-GAAP performance.
Third quarter net sales decreased modestly and came in short of our expectations, but our operating profit increased, driven by savings from Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting as well as by price increases in Venezuela. This exceeded our expectations, and we generated this solid profit growth and margin expansion across all of our regions, making good progress toward our 2018 operating margin expansion goal. Earnings per share exceeded our expectations, not only because of profit margin expansion, but also due to a lower effective tax rate. This performance included $0.04 of currency headwind or about 4 to 5 percentage points of EPS growth impact. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and the components of the third quarter sales. Our currency-neutral comparable net sales declined in the third quarter, and this included unexpected trade inventory decreases in U.S. Cereal and Pop-Tarts, continued softness in U.K. Cereal and a more prolonged transition on shelf for our overhauled Kashi and Morningstar Farms portfolios. The good news is we saw growth in several businesses, including U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty Channels, Asia Pacific and Latin America, both with and without Venezuela. And we continue to post good growth in Pringles across the globe.
Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was up 60 basis points in the quarter and a bit less for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting initiatives all delivered savings as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America, where our gross profit margin improved year-on-year even despite investment in food, adverse transactional foreign currency impact in Canada and adverse mix in snacks, driven by softness in our wholesome snacks business. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance were gross margin declines in our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by adverse transactional foreign currency impact on dollar-based commodities and other inputs as well as a deflationary retailer environment in Europe. But they also reflected adverse country and category mix. Project K, Zero-Based Budgeting and the rollout of revenue growth management are designed to address our gross profit margin performance going forward. 
Slide 10 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating margin, excluding Venezuela, for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by nearly a full percentage point in the third quarter. And by Zero-Based Budgeting and Project K efforts, we generated substantial efficiencies in our SG&A expenses. It's important to note that Q3's margin expansion was broad-based, with operating margin up year-on-year in all 4 of our regions. 
Slide 11 shows our cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow through the third quarter was more than 10% higher than that of the year-ago period. And recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by $97 million after tax. Importantly, we continued to improve our core working capital as a percent of sales, both sequentially and year-on-year. We're still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital spending. And full year capital spending should come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of $525 million to $625 million, reflecting greater efficiency and the prioritization of projects. 
Slide 12 shows how we expect to end the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis so that we can remove volatility from currency translation and mark-to-market adjustments. We expect sequential improvement in our x Venezuela net sales performance in the fourth quarter. The current trends had led us to adjust our outlook. So instead of finishing flat on sales for the year, as was our previous guidance, we now believe sales will be a little less than that, probably down about 1%. 
Our operating profit guidance remains unchanged at the high end of the 4% to 6% growth range, excluding Venezuela, thanks to our productivity efforts and our savings performance. We should see our operating margin exceed 15% in 2016, putting us well on the path toward our goal of increasing our margin by 350 basis points between 2015 and 2018. 
On earnings per share, we are raising our guidance both on a comparable and currency-neutral comparable basis. This reflects the tax rate favorability we recorded in the third quarter, which should more than offset any increase in our average shares outstanding as we curb share repurchases in the fourth quarter to fund our acquisition in Brazil. 
A couple of words on the financial impact of the Parati acquisition, which we expect to close later this year. Net the acquisition is neutral to a comparable basis earnings per share in 2016, even after the effect of curbing share buybacks in the quarter in order to maintain current debt levels. Integration costs are expected to amount to roughly $0.01 per share in 2016, but this merely puts us at the top end of our previously announced range of $0.02 to $0.03 for the company this year. 
Slide 13 shows some additional elements of our 2016 guidance, and I'll just highlight where there have been changes. First, the currency impact is roughly $0.01 better than previous guidance based on current rates. Our comparable tax rate will now be approximately 25%, reflecting favorability, primarily from the adoption of a new standard on accounting for stock-based compensation at the beginning of the year. Share buybacks should be approximately $450 million to $550 million. And as I mentioned, we're curbing repurchases for the time being to fund the acquisition we are making in Brazil. And full year integration costs are now anticipated to be at the high end of our previous estimate of $0.02 to $0.03 net of tax, and this now does incorporate the roughly $0.01 of closing in integration costs for the Brazil acquisition. 
Slide 14 offers a preliminary view of 2017. As we shared with you previously, we are forecasting net sales to be approximately flat in 2017. In effect, this consists of lower volume, offset by higher price/mix performance as we employ revenue growth management initiatives and adhere to our Volume to Value principles. This flat outlook is prudent in our view even as we strive to do better than flat. Our operating profit should increase at a high single-digit rate in 2017 as our operating margin expansion makes up about half of the remaining basis points of our 350 basis point challenge through 2018. 
As discussed previously, the key drivers of the expansion will be the following: our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity designed to mitigate input cost inflation, revenue growth management to improve our price/mix contribution, Project K savings and Zero-Based Budgeting efficiencies. We believe these initiatives give us good visibility into our margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. 
Slide 15 shows our 350 basis point profit margin expansion target through 2018, and it shows how this shapes up across our 4 regions. This is essentially an update of a chart we showed at Day at K last year, only accelerated forward to 2018 from previously 2020. As you can see, we are taking a prudent view towards net sales growth, particularly in the more developed North America and Europe regions. We believe this is the right way to forecast net sales growth, particularly in the current environment, but we aspire to do better than this. Our operating profit margin expansion skews heavily towards North America and Europe. These are our bigger businesses with strong productivity savings opportunities. In Latin America and Asia Pacific, we will be pursuing similar initiatives, but the impact isn't quite as large, as we are still on early stages of scaling up emerging markets in these regions. 
Before I pass the call over to the regions, let's briefly take a look at Slide 16. This is a recap versus what we shared with you at Day at K, focusing on our financial goals. Simply put, in 2016, we're delivering on everything we said we would, with the exception of net sales growth. We are on track to come in at the high end of our operating profit goal and exceeding our goal on currency-neutral comparable earnings per share. We have accelerated our target for operating margin expansion, expecting to reach it 2 years earlier. We're delivering on our productivity and Project K savings and have expanded our Zero-Based Budgeting program. And we've made acquisitions that perfectly fit our strategic imperatives, while being fiscally prudent and continuing to deliver strong cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility. So we made good progress towards our financial goals. 
We're now going to turn it over to each of our Region Presidents, who will give you a closer look at the results, priorities and outlooks for their respective businesses. We'll start with Paul Norman, our President of North America."

No question that 2016 has been a busy year for us here in North America. Admittedly, the results have been a bit mixed, with top line not recovering as quickly as I'd hoped, but profit margin expansion exceeding our expectations. There's been a lot more progress than our top line would suggest. 
If we turn to Slide 18, we can see the priorities we set out for ourselves for 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K investor event. Stabilizing our Cereal business was our priority. While the category was held at a 1% rate of decline, this is significantly better than in recent years. We have invested in food. We prioritized investment behind our core brands, and we've gained share as a result. And we're particularly pleased with how we stabilized Special K.
We also said we have to revitalize our Snacks business. The consumption data shows that our efforts to prioritize investment behind our most important and on-trend brands are working. We're growing our big 3 cracker brands, we're growing Pringles and we're growing Rice Krispies Treats. And across our portfolio, consumption is up double digit in on-the-go offerings. 
Frozen and Kashi are still works in progress. Much of the heavy-lifting has been done, with packaging overhauls now largely behind us in Frozen, and Kashi's transformation of its portfolio already contribution -- contributing, sorry, to stabilization in Cereal. We have plans to stabilize our other Kashi categories, too.
Fuel for growth refers to all the things we're doing to improve our profit margins. From executing our Project K network restructuring and shared services model to delivering on Zero-Based Budgeting, we are generating fuel for growth, and you can see it in our increased profit margins this year. We've also launched a more comprehensive approach to revenue growth management, which is already showing positive signs. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's discuss each of our North America segments in turn, starting with our 2016 results and then looking ahead to 2017. We'll start with Morning Foods on Slide #19. Morning Foods posted another quarter of solid operating profit growth, with improvements in our margins coming from our productivity efforts under ZBB and Project K. Top line came in a little lighter than we had expected, and this was due to an unexpected reduction in trade inventories. Our Cereal consumption was down about 1% and in line with our year-to-date trend. Now Pop-Tarts consumption was actually up about 1%, so shipments clearly lacked consumption in the quarter. 
Our underlying progress is clear. We gained 20 basis points of share in cereal and 50 basis points of share in toaster pastries. Our core 6 cereal brands continue to benefit from focused investment, leading our share gain. Year-to-date, Kellogg has most of the highest velocity 2016 innovations in ready-to-eat cereal, maintaining innovation share leadership, led by Special K Nourish, S’mores and our Finding Dory-licensed cereal.
We executed well during the Back to School period, which coincided with our Olympics activation. This year's Olympics program generated over 1.8 billion impressions at 30% less cost than our prior Summer Olympics programs. This was driven by a greater focus on social activation, and it demonstrates our new marketing model at work. So we continue to improve the underlying fundamentals on our business. As we look to Q4, we expect to see Morning Foods sales down slightly again, but down less than we saw in Q3. And we expect to see continued margin expansion resulting in strong operating profit growth. 
Slide 20 offers a few thoughts on 2017 for Morning Foods. We will look to build momentum, expecting to see sequential improvement in top line and another year of strong profit margin expansion. Our plan to achieve this revolves around the 4 ingredients Craig Bahner outlined a year ago. Firstly, ensuring we have food that rocks through great innovation and value-adding renovation against our second priority, brands that matter, namely our core 6 cereal brands and Pop-Tarts. Thirdly, we will continue to drive excitement through events and properties that drive category engagement and fun in store. Helping this will be the recent completion of a further expansion of our sales force, adding more feet to the street. Fourth and finally, we will continue to expand margins through Project K, ZBB discipline, revenue growth management and a higher return on investment on every marketing dollar we invest. This should keep us on the path towards the 2018 goals that Ron shared a moment ago. 
If I were to highlight a couple of examples of initiatives coming early in 2017 on cereal, I would point to some exciting innovations behind Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran Crunch as well as a core food improvement initiative on one of our biggest brands, Mini-Wheats. We also place continuing focus on driving Special K through the expansion of the Nourish franchise and the renovation of fit enrollment [ph]. On Pop-Tarts, following the success of A&W Root Beer and Orange Crush flavors, we have 2 new great Dunkin' Donuts-inspired flavors launching in Q1. 
Let's now turn to Snacks on Slide 21. We saw strong progress in Snacks in the quarter. We continue to realize strong profit margin expansion, thanks to Project K and ZBB. We had planned to stabilize sales, and we did just that. We saw good growth in Q3 by almost all of our focused brands. Let's start with crackers where our big 3 cracker brands, Cheez-It, Club and Town House, continue to collectively grow sales and gain share in the quarter. Pringles also grew consumption in the quarter. Rice Krispies Treats continued to grow sales and share, and Nutri-Grain also picked up share. Single-serve, a key element to our Snacks growth strategy, posted double-digit consumption gains in cookies and cracker caddy packs as well as in Pringles Snack Stacks. Legacy weight management offerings, particularly our Special K bars and cracker chips, remained a drag in the quarter, just as we said they would be as we go into more aggressive portfolio actions in early 2017. But even with this drag, the Snacks segment saw good sequential improvement in net sales. 
So Snacks is starting to turn the corner for us. In Q4, we expect to see sequential improvement again in net sales to slight growth. With continued Project K and ZBB efforts as well as the work we're doing on revenue growth management, we expect to generate margin expansion and strong operating profit growth, too. 
Turning to 2017 on Slide 22. For Snacks, our goal next year is to return to top line growth while further improving our margins. Deanie Elsner and her team will continue to drive the agenda they began this year, focusing behind our core brands like Cheez-It, Pringles and Rice Krispies Treats. And they'll continue to do this through a combination of more impactful brand building, innovation and renovation of food and packaging, in-store excitement and small formats to drive consumption in new locations through expanded distribution. Initiatives of note coming early next year are new flavors of Cheez-It Duoz and Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers as well as the launch of a new line of variants under Pringles called Loud. We will also continue to expand single-serve caddy packs and small-format offerings, which we know are highly incremental. 
Our other significant goal next year is to stabilize wholesome snacks. In the first quarter, we will be executing a comprehensive restage of Special K bars behind new food, packaging and communication and bringing significant renovation and innovation to Nutri-Grain also. Revenue growth management will be a key element for us in Snacks. We kicked it off with the Cheez-It brand in late 2015 and are still in the process of expanding it across our whole product line. These efforts, along with continued savings from Project K and ZBB, should boost our Snacks margins again in 2017, keeping us well on pace for our 2018 margin goals. 
Now let's turn to our U.S. Specialty Channels business on Slide 23. This is a critical business for us when it comes to our strategic priority of winning where the shopper shops. And I'm happy to report that this segment continues to turn in steady growth in sales, margins and operating profit. In Q3, we once again delivered growth in all 3 of our core channels: Foodservice, vending and convenience. We held or gained share in 4 of 7 categories in Foodservice; in 3 of 5 in vending; and in 5 of 7 in convenience. This impressive performance was driven by increased distribution, effective promotions around the Olympics, Pringles Summer Jam and a limited time offering of Pop-Tarts as well as strong innovation performance in K-12, including items like wholegrain Rice Krispies Treats and Cheez-It. Meanwhile, revenue growth management and ZBB continue to improve our profit margins in this important business. And we expect more of the same in Q4, with a strong finish to the year across all channels. 
Slide 24 shows some of our expectations for 2017. For Specialty in 2017, Wendy Davidson and her team expect continued top and bottom line momentum across our channels. We plan to take advantage of category growth trends and to further leverage new food and packaging formats to drive brand ubiquity and reach across our core channels. We'll leverage emerging channels to test and learn, just as we've been doing this year with Bear Naked Custom Granola in direct-to-consumer and in partnered innovation with restaurant chains. We'll also continue to generate margin expansion through revenue growth management and ZBB, with KNA's 2018 profit margin goal squarely in our sights. So we expect another good performance from Specialty in 2017. 
Lastly, we'll discuss our North America Other segment, which comprise of U.S. Frozen Foods, Canada and Kashi and shown on Slide 25. In truth, I'm disappointed with the results of this segment in the third quarter. Canadian results were as we had expected. We experienced adverse volume impact in reaction to our increased list prices and future prices. These pricing actions were necessary to help offset higher input costs due to significant transactional foreign exchange pressure. The rest of North America Other is undergoing big transformations in food, packaging and SKU lineups. We thought these transitions will be fully behind us by Q3, but they are taking longer than we had expected. 
In Frozen, we recorded good profit margin expansion, but disappointed on the top line. Eggo posted sales growth, with particular success in the quarter behind the Disney-licensed products. But this was more than offset by the impact of distribution loss on Morningstar Farms as we transitioned over the past few quarters to new packaging. 
At Kashi, we're encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in cereal share in measured channels as well as the plus-5% growth in the natural channel. It means our substantial innovation and renovation efforts are starting to take hold, and we really haven't turned on global-scale consumer communication yet. So cereal is on its way even if it is still down year-on-year. However, wholesome snacks is proving to be a much bigger drag on sales than we had anticipated. Consumption has declined sharply as distribution losses have continued prior to renovation and innovation interventions coming in 2017. 
Let's look ahead to 2017 on Slide 26. For the North America Other segment, we expect improved sales and profit growth as the Kashi, Frozen and Canadian teams reap the awards of their work to reset in 2016. Overall, we expect to see top line growth in this North America Other segment. Meanwhile, RGM and ZBB as well as lapping some heavy investment in food should lift profit margins strongly. This will get us back on track towards our 2018 margin goals. 
Our Kashi cereal portfolio is poised to return to growth as distribution has stabilized and our innovation pipeline is strong. The recently launched Dark Cocoa Karma Wheat Biscuit Cereal is going very well, and we have an excellent new GOLEAN variant coming in January. Acceptance so far from our customers has been strong. Our largest challenge in 2017 on Kashi will continue to be wholesome snacks. We have renovation and innovation coming early in the year, which will significantly change the trend we have been experiencing. However, I doubt we will get the wholesome snacks part of this business back to growth on the full year. 
In Frozen Foods, our focus is on driving core Eggo, with new taste-oriented communication breaking in January as well as significant renovation with the removal of artificials from all of our waffles in the first quarter. On Morningstar Farms, we are focused on reactivating communication now that the packaging is on shelf and we have significant innovation building in the first half of the year. Finally, in Canada, we will be lapping our pricing interventions from this year. And as foreign exchange issues moderate, we expect to see a stabilization of sales and a return to margin expansion. 
So in summary, there's been a ton of work behind the scenes this year in Kellogg North America, all aimed at getting our portfolio more on trend in helping our capabilities and execution, and improving profitability. While our top line growth hasn't consistently reflected these efforts yet, it is coming, and we are seeing sequential improvement to go with impressive margin expansion. We are making definitive progress towards the 400 to 450 basis points of operating margin improvement we're targeting through 2018. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Chris Hood, President of Kellogg Europe."
283356,378975174,1069393,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva.

We've re",966,"Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva. For Kellogg Europe, 2016 will be viewed as a year in which we improved our profitability and got most of our business back on track. We've continued to accelerate the growth of Pringles. We've returned wholesome snacks to growth. We've stabilized our Cereal business in most of the region, and we're growing net sales in 5 of our 6 geographic clusters. The one exception is U.K. Cereal, which makes up just over 20% of our total sales.
U.K. is a market where a sluggish economy and a difficult retail environment have resulted in net price deflation. We've underperformed in our premium adult portfolio, most notably Special K and All-Bran. And this has resulted in sharp sales declines year-to-date in this important market. But it's important not to overlook the good progress we've made elsewhere in the region. 
A good way to assess this progress is Slide #28, where we can compare against the priorities we set out for Kellogg Europe in 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K event. Cereal is stabilizing, with over half of our markets holding or growing share, a significant improvement versus last year. Needless to say, our primary focus right now and into 2017 will be on stabilizing the U.K. business and getting Special K back on track. But we are showing improvement in the rest of Europe, and that was a priority for this year. 
Pringles has been a big success since we acquired this brand in 2012. We're seeing continued, high single-digit growth, with broad-based share growth across almost all markets. This marks 4 years in a row of high single-digit growth in this brand, and we're doing this by strengthening the core of the brand and assessing -- accessing new locations and new markets, the additional sizes and geographic expansion. 
Wholesome snacks has returned to growth across Europe in 2016, driven by investing in the renovation of Special K bars and innovation like Kellogg-branded fruit and nut bars. Our emerging markets of Russia and Arabia have made substantial progress despite difficult operating conditions. Our Russian business is up strongly year-to-date. And our acquisitions in Egypt, Bisco Misr and Mass Food, are both growing at a rapid clip as well. As discussed last year, e-commerce is a big channel for us in Europe. This channel represents over $100 million of our sales, $100 million, and we enjoy share premiums in our categories compared to the total market. 
And last, we continue to drive transformational change within our cost structure behind Project K; implementation of shared services; getting started with Zero-Based Budgeting, where we're about a year behind North America; and implementing revenue growth management to improve net price realization. We've increased our operating profit margin by 70 basis points already this year and by over 400 basis points over the last 4 years. So there's good progress being made across Europe on the priorities we established last November. Unfortunately, the growth progress is being somewhat masked by difficult market conditions in the U.K. on our Cereal business. Looking forward, we expect to stabilize top line sales and continue to drive strong profit expansion. 
Slide 29 discusses our 2016 results and outlook. As you can see, we posted strong profit growth in Q3. Our sales were off slightly, almost solely due to our Cereal business in the U.K. In the rest of Europe, we posted sales growth in virtually all of our subregions. France Benelux grew high single digits. Southern Europe and the Mediterranean Middle East posted low single-digit growth, and Russia recorded a strong double-digit gain. And we are holding or growing share in over half of our cereal markets while sustaining strong Pringles momentum. As we go into Q4, we'll work to drive sequential share improvement on our core brands, and we should post another quarter of margin expansion and profit growth. We will finish 2016 with a slight decline in net sales, but significant profit expansion due to all of our productivity initiatives. 
Turning to Slide #30. Here's how we're thinking about 2017. In combination across Cereal and Snacks, we expect total Europe 2017 sales to be flat to down slightly. We're making good progress on stabilizing our Cereal business in most of Europe. There's already quite a bit of work going on in turning around the U.K. We're simplifying and focusing our operations to drive a stronger core business. We're accelerating the repositioning of the Special K brand behind recently launched on-trend offerings, like Special K Nourish, which has been successful elsewhere in the world. We're crafting a better, more balanced commercial plan. And we're using revenue growth management to get our prices and pack formats right in order to reverse the deflation that we've been experiencing. With all of these plans, we are expecting sequential improvement on U.K. Cereal during 2017, with continued decline albeit at a moderated pace. 
Pringles still has plenty of room to grow. Food renovation, commercial innovation and geographic expansion will all continue in 2017. And executing our productivity initiatives will continue to be a focus. Delivering our expected savings from Project K, global business services and Zero-Based Budgeting are all critical to enabling the investments in food renovation and covering Brexit-related transactional currency impact. 
In summary, we have more work to do, but we are seeing some green shoots of sales recovery, and we are confident that we can bring stability to our European Cereal business while continuing to grow Snacks. Meanwhile, we'll continue to boost productivity to drive profitable growth, staying on course toward our 2018 operating profit margin goal of 300 to 350 incremental basis points. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Maria Fernanda Mejia, President of Kellogg Latin America."
283356,378975174,1069393,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Latin America continues to be an important growth opportunity for Kellogg, a key element to the company's 2020 Growth Plan. Our programs are fully aligned to this growth plan.

Latin America continues to be an important growth opportunity for Kellogg, a key element to the company's 2020 Growth Plan. Our programs are fully aligned to this growth plan. And we're prioritizing investment behind markets like Mexico, Caribbean Central America and Andean, strengthening our leadership in Cereal, while expanding our Snacks footprint. And we're building scale in more emerging markets like Brazil. But as you know, nothing is ever simple in Latin America. We have to manage very carefully through an extremely challenging external environment. 
When we met last November during Day at K, we outlined our strategy and key areas of focus for 2016. A year later, I'm pleased to share with you the tremendous progress, as shown on Slide 32. Leading category growth is evident from our share growth in many core cereal markets, our record shares in wholesome snacks in Brazil and Colombia, and our double-digit growth on Pringles in markets like Mexico. Driving this growth has been innovation. We've expanded our offerings under the Kellogg's parent brand growing double digit. And our most recent introductions for Special K, protein cereal and nut bars, are exceeding our expectations.
We continue to drive our distribution and sales coverage in high-frequency stores, while improving our in-store execution by tailoring our regional commercial programs by retail environment. And we've continued to increase our supply chain network utilization significantly over the past 3 years. We've enabled our innovation platforms, strengthened our packaging capabilities and evolved our business models through partnerships with co-manufacturers, enhancing our speed to market. And we delivered margin improvement through efficiency programs like Project K, KIM [ph] and ZBB, all of which are combining with price realization to offset foreign exchange headwinds. So great progress being made across our priorities. 
A driver of market expansion will be M&A. And one of the most exciting transformational components of our growth plan can be seen on Slide 33. Our recently announced acquisition of Parati, which we hope to close in the fourth quarter, completely changes the game for us in Brazil, a market where we have been present and where we've been growing for a number of years, but where we've lacked critical scale. With Parati, we more than doubled our size in the high-growth potential Mercosur region, bringing it from just over 10% of Kellogg Latin America sales to over 25%. And we substantially increased our overall presence in Snacks, taking it roughly from 20% of Kellogg Latin America sales to about 1/3. This is a company that plays in attractive categories, with strong brands and a track record of growth. It's largely regional, with its foothold in the South, so there is geographic expansion opportunity. It's link in high-frequency stores will be leveraged across our Kellogg brand. 
Slide 34 summarizes our performance in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. After a relatively soft first half, driven by region-wide economic slowdown and FX impact, we returned to growth in quarter 3. We saw growth in both Cereal and in Snacks, and the growth was broad-based. Mexico, Mercosur, Caribbean Central America all posted sales growth in the quarter, aided by price realization. For the region, excluding volatile Venezuela, we've held our shares for the Cereal category flat year-to-date, with gains in markets like Brazil, Colombia and Puerto Rico. And in the recent periods, we have seen Mexico regain some share it lost earlier in the year. Snacks is showing strong momentum across the region, both on wholesome and salty. 
Meanwhile, our productivity efforts and price realization are starting to flow through to profit margin, which improved strongly in the third quarter. The team continues to manage well through very difficult economic and currency conditions. And we should not overlook the very good work done to manage through continuous crisis in Venezuela. We are expecting another quarter of sequential acceleration in net sales in the fourth quarter on improved price realization, stronger commercial plans and relevant innovation across categories hitting the stores, and this despite a difficult economic environment in Brazil. Profit margins in the fourth quarter should continue to move higher due to price realization and additional efficiencies generated through our recently launched ZBB initiative.
On Slide 35, we show our priorities for 2017, and everything starts with our largest market, Mexico. The sequential improvements we're seeing in the second half of 2016 will continue into 2017, with exciting innovation to grow consumption in cereal, continued expansion into the HFS channel, effective brand building and exciting opportunities behind our growing snacks businesses. The integration of Parati in Brazil will be executed flawlessly given our proven success with integrating Pringles several years ago, coupled with our common cultures and complementary businesses. Revenue growth is critical to driving profitable growth, executing our portfolio by retail environment and implementing the right price and size, effective promotions, while driving mix will help us generate sales and profitability. And we'll continue our path with supply chain optimization with step changes ahead. 
So in summary, a laser-sharp focus on these priorities should allow us to better manage through current regional volatility and deliver good low single-digit growth and expanded profit margins in 2017. This will put us well on our way toward our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with this, I'll turn it over to Amit Banati, President of Asia Pacific, currently in Singapore."
283356,378975174,1069393,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Maria Fernando, and good morning, well, evening for me from Singapore.

Our top line growth has been consistent, led by Pringles and emerging markets. And our joint ventures are also growing strongly. Profit margins have moved higher, and we have plans to increase them further. And most importantly, we have continued to make progress in our key strategic initiatives, and these will make Asia Pacific a sustainable growth engine for Kellogg for years to come. 
On Slide 37, we show the priorities for Asia Pacific that have been communicated at Day at K last year. In 2016, we continued to make strong progress against our priorities to transform the region. We have a more balanced portfolio. Asia and Africa now account for about 2/3 of the region sales. Snacks now account for about 1/3 of the region sales. We have made good progress in stabilizing our Australian business, particularly in cereal, where we are seeing much better category and share trends. Pringles has delivered strong growth in 2016. 
After 2 years of double-digit growth in Asia, we have seen growth moderate in 2016, primarily due to challenging market conditions in India in the first half of the year. But we are growing overall, and India is recovering in the second half. And in South Africa, we have seen strong growth in both our wholly-owned operations and our joint venture in Nigeria. 
Slide 38 discusses our quarter 3 performance and how we see quarter 4 shaping up. We continued to post increased sales in quarter 3, with Pringles and emerging markets driving the growth. We are seeing our Australian Cereals business stabilize in 2016, with improved consumption and share trends in the Cereals category. The drivers of improved performance include a renovation to 4-star foods of our biggest brand Nutri-Grain, which is now in growth; the launch of a gluten-free range, which is the #1 innovation in the Cereal category year-to-date; and improved execution in stores. 
Our Pringles business had a strong quarter 3, growing sales at a double-digit rate. Growth was driven by distribution expansion in emerging markets and new innovations expanding the Pringles portfolio such as the introduction of sweet flavors in Korea and the launch of Tortilla across the region. Emerging markets remain a source of growth for the region, with Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia key highlights for us in quarter 3. Quarter 3 sales growth was impacted by Korea, lapping the year-ago supply disruption of a major competitor. Growth was also impacted by challenging economic and regulatory conditions in India in the first half, and our snacks business in Australia has remained soft. We have seen sequential improvement in our performance in India and Australia snacks each quarter. As a result, we expect growth to accelerate in quarter 4. This will result in full year sales growth in the low single-digit range.
Again, it is important not to forget our unconsolidated joint ventures shown on Slide 39. These are a key element of our emerging markets growth strategy. Year-to-date, our joint venture in China and our joint venture and investment stake in Nigeria are both growing at a strong double-digit rate despite operating in very challenging business environments. When you consider that our share of these businesses net sales is equivalent to roughly half the size of our Asia Pacific region, you can understand how significantly they would add to our overall growth if they were consolidated into our results.
We have strong plans for 2017, represented on Slide 40. We will build on our progress on stabilizing our Australian Cereal business. Turning around our Wholesome Snacks business in Australia will be a key priority. We recently launched Special K Protein bites and Nutri-Grain edge bars, and they are both off to a strong good start. We have also relaunched the Be Natural brand with new food and packaging. 
Emerging markets will continue to be a growth driver across both cereal and snacks. In cereals, we continue to drive category development in emerging markets, and we will also launch Wholesome Snacks in South Korea and Southeast Asia. We continue to expect strong growth on Pringles behind innovation and distribution expansion in emerging markets as we expand offerings at affordable price points. Small cans now account for 20% of our Pringles sales in the region. 
2017 will also see an increased focus on driving operating margin expansion as we roll out zero-based budgeting and revenue growth management. In terms of outlook, we expect net sales growth in the low single-digit range for Kellogg Asia Pacific in 2017, with sales from our joint ventures in effect bringing that pace of growth much higher. Meanwhile, profit margins should expand, driving higher profit and putting us closer to our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to John Bryant for some final remarks."

But I've said something about like flat to low single digits, driven by gluten-free, artificial-free, all these different forms of incremental innovation. What do you think at the end of the day stopped us short reaching that goal? Was it food deflation? Something consumer behavior? But bottom line, what do we need to see to bring incremental users at the category?"

And a part of that was the improvement we've seen over the last 3 or 4 years in consumption trends in cereal, particularly in our business. And if you look at consumption in 2017, we're going to end up down about 1%. That's actually a significant improvement of the prior years, not quite where I'd hope we'd get to, but we're certainly trending in the right direction. Our shipments might have been 100, 200 basis points less than that, because we are expecting a full year trade inventory reduction in the Cereal business based than what we saw in the third quarter. So I think we're heading in the right direction with a little bit maybe too optimistic we'd get there in 2016? Perhaps. But I think, as Paul said, for 2017, we expect to see the continued improvement and it's going to come through by engaging consumers of great food, engaging them with the brands, bringing it to life in store, a whole variety of factors that we know historically have driven the Cereal business performance."

So what makes one brand react might be different from another. We clearly saw a reinvestment in our core foods around, say, Special K Red Berries, which is a significant part of our lineup, turned the business back to positive growth on a year-to-date basis this year. K's growing and growing share. We see Rice Krispies do extremely well this year, not because of necessarily innovation or renovation but because of consumer engagement around recipe usage and versatility, and I think that's driving that brand. Frosted Flakes is another brand that's growing well against teens and tweens this year. So -- and that, again, I would say, is driven by in-store activation behind big properties, properties like Finding Dory or the Olympics events. So it's not the same ingredients behind every brand. When it comes to ZBB reinvestment, we have put some money back in the business this year. We put it back in our sales force again to drive greater activation right through to the point-of-purchase. So sometimes it's behind a brand, sometimes is focusing on getting the assortment right and the perfect shelf at store and that takes resources at the store level to do that. We did choose to reinvest in Keebler this year, which obviously isn't a cereal, but that was the choice coming out of ZBB reinvestment, and we've seen positive returns on that. So I do think it comes down to core 6 brands. And the one thing we can do better next year, I believe, is get Kashi back to growth. Kashi responds to many needs out there that some of the Kellogg traditional legacy brands can't. It's growing in the natural channel, 4%, 5%. We need to get it beyond stable to growth in mainstream measure channels as well next year. We do that plus the core 6. I think you'll see the category flatten out and maybe chip into growth."

I did expect a little more progress than we got. We started, as you know, 18 months ago. We put our team back out in California, and that team has been extremely focused on getting our food right. So we have completely renovated all of our foods to be nonGMO product verified and about 30% to 40% of our portfolio is now organic. So we've done a lot of the fundamentals of getting the food right, in particular in our biggest business. We then decided to exit some categories, frozen pizzas, for example. And that's -- we're getting out of things that we don't think were a good fit for the Kashi brand. And we turned our attention to innovating and renovating aggressively on our Wholesome Snacks business, which, as John mentioned earlier, Wholesome Snacks is again all about getting the food right. As we look at consumer reaction to Kashi, we're getting good reaction. A lot of positive social reaction to the brand, which means I feel confident about the equity. I think our foods are all getting back on trend. I think -- and this is the important bit, you're right, with great execution which I think we can improve on. We will return this business to growth. So I think there's a journey we're on here and we need to turn up execution, because I think all the other elements are coming together. We have brand-new communication about to hit early next year. We would've been great if we could have got that out a bit earlier, but we're getting to where we want to get to, we just need to execute now."

I have visibility to a great pipeline of news coming earlier in the year, and we are now completely focused on communication and regenerating trial. There's no issue with the food. There's no issue with consumer. A lot of the food, we just -- we missed it here and now we're focused very much on getting back to growth. I foresee growth for Morningstar Farms next year as we go forward. We did lose one item, which shows through in the numbers, unfortunately, negatively, is we did lose a big item in the club channel, one of our best sellers, and we're working hard to get that item back in the organic format. When we get that item back, the club business is big for this business. So we're cautiously optimistic that's coming back as well, and that will be a driver of growth for this business next year."

I'm happy to report Q3 profit and earnings that came in ahead of our expectations. A lower tax rate was positive over delivery, but so was broad-based profit margin expansion that exceeded our expectations. Candidly, top line growth did not come in as we had hoped, and there were specific factors behind that, which we'll discuss in a moment. But we did see growth and sequential improvement in many parts of our business. 
Behind the numbers, there's great progress being made not only against our strategy, as represented by our 2020 Growth Plan, but also against the key business priorities we laid out for you 1 year ago at our Day at K investor event. These efforts should continue to yield sequential improvement in our results. We saw it in Q3 and we'll see it again in Q4, finishing the year largely as we originally expected in operating profit, albeit doing more by margin expansion and less by net sales growth. And this improvement will continue into 2017 as we continue to believe we have the right plans to bring sales at least to flat and enough productivity initiatives to drive us well on our way to a 350 basis point improvement goal we have set for 2015 to 2018 on a currency-neutral comparable basis, excluding Venezuela. 
Today, Ron, the Region Presidents and I will take you through our results, progress and outlook. And we use as a basis for measurement the priorities we shared with you back at Day at K.
I will start by reminding you of the 2020 Growth Plan, which we unveiled to you at last November's Day at K investor event and which is shown on Slide 5. There are 2 important points to make here. First, that this growth plan is informing our investment decisions, and our 2016 priorities were all geared toward delivering on this strategy. As we discuss our progress against our 2016 priorities, we are really discussing our progress against this 2020 Growth Plan. 
The second point is that our acceleration of profit margin expansion is by no means a change in strategy. OP margin expansion has always sat front and center of our 2020 Growth Plan. And there's more to this profit margin expansion than simply executing initiatives. A couple of months ago, we told you about how we are refreshing our Volume to Value operating model for today's environment. Volume to Value is being embraced and measured throughout the organization. This should give you another reason to believe in our 2018 margin expansion target. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's walk through our progress against our strategy. On Slide 6, we recount the 2016 priorities we shared with you at Day at K 1 year ago. Clearly, there is tangible progress being made. We set to stabilize our 4 largest cereal markets: U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. We have invested in food, repositioned Special K, focused our marketing resources behind highest ROI brands and activities, and we have made substantial progress in all but the U.K., which is a work in progress. 
Expanding Pringles worldwide has been a priority for this year. And in Q3, we continue to see good growth in that brand. Emerging markets have been dramatically scaled up through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we've grown organically in these emerging markets as well. 
Enhancing our sales capabilities was another priority, and we've rolled out revenue growth management disciplines, processes and tools around the world. We said this was necessary for price realization, and we've seen our price realization go from being down slightly in the first half to being flat in Q3, with an expectation of slightly positive price realization in Q4. 
Also regarding sales capabilities, we just announced our biggest ever acquisition in Latin America, which will not only give us much needed scale in Brazil, but also gives us the ability to leverage a very strong reach into high-frequency stores. 
Increasing earnings visibility through deep productivity and savings initiatives has been a key priority for us this year, and it's already showing up in our results, with Q3 recording yet another year-on-year gain in OP margin. We're delivering on our productivity initiatives, we're shifting our brand building to higher ROI brands and investments, and we're starting to turn around our price realization. So good progress is being made even if our top line has not yet reflected it. 
With that, let me turn it to Ron, who will talk you through our financial results, progress and outlook."
283356,378975174,1105414,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, John, and good morning, all.

Slide #7 shows highlights of the financial results for the third quarter. In describing our results and outlook, we will be referring to them on a currency-neutral comparable basis unless otherwise noted. And in many cases, we'll also give you the same metrics, excluding Venezuela. The appendices to our presentation provide you with the detail on our GAAP and non-GAAP performance.
Third quarter net sales decreased modestly and came in short of our expectations, but our operating profit increased, driven by savings from Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting as well as by price increases in Venezuela. This exceeded our expectations, and we generated this solid profit growth and margin expansion across all of our regions, making good progress toward our 2018 operating margin expansion goal. Earnings per share exceeded our expectations, not only because of profit margin expansion, but also due to a lower effective tax rate. This performance included $0.04 of currency headwind or about 4 to 5 percentage points of EPS growth impact. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and the components of the third quarter sales. Our currency-neutral comparable net sales declined in the third quarter, and this included unexpected trade inventory decreases in U.S. Cereal and Pop-Tarts, continued softness in U.K. Cereal and a more prolonged transition on shelf for our overhauled Kashi and Morningstar Farms portfolios. The good news is we saw growth in several businesses, including U.S. Snacks, U.S. Specialty Channels, Asia Pacific and Latin America, both with and without Venezuela. And we continue to post good growth in Pringles across the globe.
Slide 9 shows our currency-neutral comparable gross profit margin for the quarter. Excluding Venezuela, our gross profit margin was up 60 basis points in the quarter and a bit less for the year-to-date period. Our productivity, Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting initiatives all delivered savings as planned in the quarter. This was most evident in North America, where our gross profit margin improved year-on-year even despite investment in food, adverse transactional foreign currency impact in Canada and adverse mix in snacks, driven by softness in our wholesome snacks business. 
Offsetting the strong North America performance were gross margin declines in our international businesses. These declines were primarily driven by adverse transactional foreign currency impact on dollar-based commodities and other inputs as well as a deflationary retailer environment in Europe. But they also reflected adverse country and category mix. Project K, Zero-Based Budgeting and the rollout of revenue growth management are designed to address our gross profit margin performance going forward. 
Slide 10 shows the currency-neutral comparable operating margin, excluding Venezuela, for the quarter. And on that basis, operating margin increased by nearly a full percentage point in the third quarter. And by Zero-Based Budgeting and Project K efforts, we generated substantial efficiencies in our SG&A expenses. It's important to note that Q3's margin expansion was broad-based, with operating margin up year-on-year in all 4 of our regions. 
Slide 11 shows our cash flow. Our year-to-date cash flow through the third quarter was more than 10% higher than that of the year-ago period. And recall that our first quarter cash flow included the impact of a bond tender offer, which lowered cash flow by $97 million after tax. Importantly, we continued to improve our core working capital as a percent of sales, both sequentially and year-on-year. We're still on track to deliver our targeted $1.1 billion of full year operating cash flow after capital spending. And full year capital spending should come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of $525 million to $625 million, reflecting greater efficiency and the prioritization of projects. 
Slide 12 shows how we expect to end the year, again, on a currency-neutral comparable basis so that we can remove volatility from currency translation and mark-to-market adjustments. We expect sequential improvement in our x Venezuela net sales performance in the fourth quarter. The current trends had led us to adjust our outlook. So instead of finishing flat on sales for the year, as was our previous guidance, we now believe sales will be a little less than that, probably down about 1%. 
Our operating profit guidance remains unchanged at the high end of the 4% to 6% growth range, excluding Venezuela, thanks to our productivity efforts and our savings performance. We should see our operating margin exceed 15% in 2016, putting us well on the path toward our goal of increasing our margin by 350 basis points between 2015 and 2018. 
On earnings per share, we are raising our guidance both on a comparable and currency-neutral comparable basis. This reflects the tax rate favorability we recorded in the third quarter, which should more than offset any increase in our average shares outstanding as we curb share repurchases in the fourth quarter to fund our acquisition in Brazil. 
A couple of words on the financial impact of the Parati acquisition, which we expect to close later this year. Net the acquisition is neutral to a comparable basis earnings per share in 2016, even after the effect of curbing share buybacks in the quarter in order to maintain current debt levels. Integration costs are expected to amount to roughly $0.01 per share in 2016, but this merely puts us at the top end of our previously announced range of $0.02 to $0.03 for the company this year. 
Slide 13 shows some additional elements of our 2016 guidance, and I'll just highlight where there have been changes. First, the currency impact is roughly $0.01 better than previous guidance based on current rates. Our comparable tax rate will now be approximately 25%, reflecting favorability, primarily from the adoption of a new standard on accounting for stock-based compensation at the beginning of the year. Share buybacks should be approximately $450 million to $550 million. And as I mentioned, we're curbing repurchases for the time being to fund the acquisition we are making in Brazil. And full year integration costs are now anticipated to be at the high end of our previous estimate of $0.02 to $0.03 net of tax, and this now does incorporate the roughly $0.01 of closing in integration costs for the Brazil acquisition. 
Slide 14 offers a preliminary view of 2017. As we shared with you previously, we are forecasting net sales to be approximately flat in 2017. In effect, this consists of lower volume, offset by higher price/mix performance as we employ revenue growth management initiatives and adhere to our Volume to Value principles. This flat outlook is prudent in our view even as we strive to do better than flat. Our operating profit should increase at a high single-digit rate in 2017 as our operating margin expansion makes up about half of the remaining basis points of our 350 basis point challenge through 2018. 
As discussed previously, the key drivers of the expansion will be the following: our ongoing 3% to 4% productivity designed to mitigate input cost inflation, revenue growth management to improve our price/mix contribution, Project K savings and Zero-Based Budgeting efficiencies. We believe these initiatives give us good visibility into our margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. 
Slide 15 shows our 350 basis point profit margin expansion target through 2018, and it shows how this shapes up across our 4 regions. This is essentially an update of a chart we showed at Day at K last year, only accelerated forward to 2018 from previously 2020. As you can see, we are taking a prudent view towards net sales growth, particularly in the more developed North America and Europe regions. We believe this is the right way to forecast net sales growth, particularly in the current environment, but we aspire to do better than this. Our operating profit margin expansion skews heavily towards North America and Europe. These are our bigger businesses with strong productivity savings opportunities. In Latin America and Asia Pacific, we will be pursuing similar initiatives, but the impact isn't quite as large, as we are still on early stages of scaling up emerging markets in these regions. 
Before I pass the call over to the regions, let's briefly take a look at Slide 16. This is a recap versus what we shared with you at Day at K, focusing on our financial goals. Simply put, in 2016, we're delivering on everything we said we would, with the exception of net sales growth. We are on track to come in at the high end of our operating profit goal and exceeding our goal on currency-neutral comparable earnings per share. We have accelerated our target for operating margin expansion, expecting to reach it 2 years earlier. We're delivering on our productivity and Project K savings and have expanded our Zero-Based Budgeting program. And we've made acquisitions that perfectly fit our strategic imperatives, while being fiscally prudent and continuing to deliver strong cash flow to maintain our financial flexibility. So we made good progress towards our financial goals. 
We're now going to turn it over to each of our Region Presidents, who will give you a closer look at the results, priorities and outlooks for their respective businesses. We'll start with Paul Norman, our President of North America."

No question that 2016 has been a busy year for us here in North America. Admittedly, the results have been a bit mixed, with top line not recovering as quickly as I'd hoped, but profit margin expansion exceeding our expectations. There's been a lot more progress than our top line would suggest. 
If we turn to Slide 18, we can see the priorities we set out for ourselves for 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K investor event. Stabilizing our Cereal business was our priority. While the category was held at a 1% rate of decline, this is significantly better than in recent years. We have invested in food. We prioritized investment behind our core brands, and we've gained share as a result. And we're particularly pleased with how we stabilized Special K.
We also said we have to revitalize our Snacks business. The consumption data shows that our efforts to prioritize investment behind our most important and on-trend brands are working. We're growing our big 3 cracker brands, we're growing Pringles and we're growing Rice Krispies Treats. And across our portfolio, consumption is up double digit in on-the-go offerings. 
Frozen and Kashi are still works in progress. Much of the heavy-lifting has been done, with packaging overhauls now largely behind us in Frozen, and Kashi's transformation of its portfolio already contribution -- contributing, sorry, to stabilization in Cereal. We have plans to stabilize our other Kashi categories, too.
Fuel for growth refers to all the things we're doing to improve our profit margins. From executing our Project K network restructuring and shared services model to delivering on Zero-Based Budgeting, we are generating fuel for growth, and you can see it in our increased profit margins this year. We've also launched a more comprehensive approach to revenue growth management, which is already showing positive signs. 
So with that as a backdrop, let's discuss each of our North America segments in turn, starting with our 2016 results and then looking ahead to 2017. We'll start with Morning Foods on Slide #19. Morning Foods posted another quarter of solid operating profit growth, with improvements in our margins coming from our productivity efforts under ZBB and Project K. Top line came in a little lighter than we had expected, and this was due to an unexpected reduction in trade inventories. Our Cereal consumption was down about 1% and in line with our year-to-date trend. Now Pop-Tarts consumption was actually up about 1%, so shipments clearly lacked consumption in the quarter. 
Our underlying progress is clear. We gained 20 basis points of share in cereal and 50 basis points of share in toaster pastries. Our core 6 cereal brands continue to benefit from focused investment, leading our share gain. Year-to-date, Kellogg has most of the highest velocity 2016 innovations in ready-to-eat cereal, maintaining innovation share leadership, led by Special K Nourish, S’mores and our Finding Dory-licensed cereal.
We executed well during the Back to School period, which coincided with our Olympics activation. This year's Olympics program generated over 1.8 billion impressions at 30% less cost than our prior Summer Olympics programs. This was driven by a greater focus on social activation, and it demonstrates our new marketing model at work. So we continue to improve the underlying fundamentals on our business. As we look to Q4, we expect to see Morning Foods sales down slightly again, but down less than we saw in Q3. And we expect to see continued margin expansion resulting in strong operating profit growth. 
Slide 20 offers a few thoughts on 2017 for Morning Foods. We will look to build momentum, expecting to see sequential improvement in top line and another year of strong profit margin expansion. Our plan to achieve this revolves around the 4 ingredients Craig Bahner outlined a year ago. Firstly, ensuring we have food that rocks through great innovation and value-adding renovation against our second priority, brands that matter, namely our core 6 cereal brands and Pop-Tarts. Thirdly, we will continue to drive excitement through events and properties that drive category engagement and fun in store. Helping this will be the recent completion of a further expansion of our sales force, adding more feet to the street. Fourth and finally, we will continue to expand margins through Project K, ZBB discipline, revenue growth management and a higher return on investment on every marketing dollar we invest. This should keep us on the path towards the 2018 goals that Ron shared a moment ago. 
If I were to highlight a couple of examples of initiatives coming early in 2017 on cereal, I would point to some exciting innovations behind Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran Crunch as well as a core food improvement initiative on one of our biggest brands, Mini-Wheats. We also place continuing focus on driving Special K through the expansion of the Nourish franchise and the renovation of fit enrollment [ph]. On Pop-Tarts, following the success of A&W Root Beer and Orange Crush flavors, we have 2 new great Dunkin' Donuts-inspired flavors launching in Q1. 
Let's now turn to Snacks on Slide 21. We saw strong progress in Snacks in the quarter. We continue to realize strong profit margin expansion, thanks to Project K and ZBB. We had planned to stabilize sales, and we did just that. We saw good growth in Q3 by almost all of our focused brands. Let's start with crackers where our big 3 cracker brands, Cheez-It, Club and Town House, continue to collectively grow sales and gain share in the quarter. Pringles also grew consumption in the quarter. Rice Krispies Treats continued to grow sales and share, and Nutri-Grain also picked up share. Single-serve, a key element to our Snacks growth strategy, posted double-digit consumption gains in cookies and cracker caddy packs as well as in Pringles Snack Stacks. Legacy weight management offerings, particularly our Special K bars and cracker chips, remained a drag in the quarter, just as we said they would be as we go into more aggressive portfolio actions in early 2017. But even with this drag, the Snacks segment saw good sequential improvement in net sales. 
So Snacks is starting to turn the corner for us. In Q4, we expect to see sequential improvement again in net sales to slight growth. With continued Project K and ZBB efforts as well as the work we're doing on revenue growth management, we expect to generate margin expansion and strong operating profit growth, too. 
Turning to 2017 on Slide 22. For Snacks, our goal next year is to return to top line growth while further improving our margins. Deanie Elsner and her team will continue to drive the agenda they began this year, focusing behind our core brands like Cheez-It, Pringles and Rice Krispies Treats. And they'll continue to do this through a combination of more impactful brand building, innovation and renovation of food and packaging, in-store excitement and small formats to drive consumption in new occasion through expanded distribution. Initiatives of note coming early next year are new flavors of Cheez-It Duoz and Cheez-It Sandwich Crackers as well as the launch of a new line of variants under Pringles called Loud. We will also continue to expand single-serve caddy packs and small-format offerings, which we know are highly incremental. 
Our other significant goal next year is to stabilize wholesome snacks. In the first quarter, we will be executing a comprehensive restage of Special K bars behind new food, packaging and communication and bringing significant renovation and innovation to Nutri-Grain also. Revenue growth management will be a key element for us in Snacks. We kicked it off with the Cheez-It brand in late 2015 and are still in the process of expanding it across our whole product line. These efforts, along with continued savings from Project K and ZBB, should boost our Snacks margins again in 2017, keeping us well on pace for our 2018 margin goals. 
Now let's turn to our U.S. Specialty Channels business on Slide 23. This is a critical business for us when it comes to our strategic priority of winning where the shopper shops. And I'm happy to report that this segment continues to turn in steady growth in sales, margins and operating profit. In Q3, we once again delivered growth in all 3 of our core channels: Foodservice, vending and convenience. We held or gained share in 4 of 7 categories in Foodservice; in 3 of 5 in vending; and in 5 of 7 in convenience. This impressive performance was driven by increased distribution, effective promotions around the Olympics, Pringles Summer Jam and a limited time offering of Pop-Tarts as well as strong innovation performance in K-12, including items like wholegrain Rice Krispies Treats and Cheez-It. Meanwhile, revenue growth management and ZBB continue to improve our profit margins in this important business. And we expect more of the same in Q4, with a strong finish to the year across all channels. 
Slide 24 shows some of our expectations for 2017. For Specialty in 2017, Wendy Davidson and her team expect continued top and bottom line momentum across our channels. We plan to take advantage of category growth trends and to further leverage new food and packaging formats to drive brand ubiquity and reach across our core channels. We'll leverage emerging channels to test and learn, just as we've been doing this year with Bear Naked Custom Granola in direct-to-consumer and in partnered innovation with restaurant chains. We'll also continue to generate margin expansion through revenue growth management and ZBB, with KNA's 2018 profit margin goal squarely in our sights. So we expect another good performance from Specialty in 2017. 
Lastly, we'll discuss our North America Other segment, which comprise of U.S. Frozen Foods, Canada and Kashi and shown on Slide 25. In truth, I'm disappointed with the results of this segment in the third quarter. Canadian results were as we had expected. We experienced adverse volume impact in reaction to our increased list prices and future prices. These pricing actions were necessary to help offset higher input costs due to significant transactional foreign exchange pressure. The rest of North America Other is undergoing big transformations in food, packaging and SKU lineups. We thought these transitions will be fully behind us by Q3, but they are taking longer than we had expected. 
In Frozen, we recorded good profit margin expansion, but disappointed on the top line. Eggo posted sales growth, with particular success in the quarter behind the Disney-licensed products. But this was more than offset by the impact of distribution loss on Morningstar Farms as we transitioned over the past few quarters to new packaging. 
At Kashi, we're encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in cereal share in measured channels as well as the plus-5% growth in the natural channel. It means our substantial innovation and renovation efforts are starting to take hold, and we really haven't turned on global-scale consumer communication yet. So cereal is on its way even if it is still down year-on-year. However, wholesome snacks is proving to be a much bigger drag on sales than we had anticipated. Consumption has declined sharply as distribution losses have continued prior to renovation and innovation interventions coming in 2017. 
Let's look ahead to 2017 on Slide 26. For the North America Other segment, we expect improved sales and profit growth as the Kashi, Frozen and Canadian teams reap the rewards of their work to reset in 2016. Overall, we expect to see top line growth in this North America Other segment. Meanwhile, RGM and ZBB as well as lapping some heavy investment in food should lift profit margins strongly. This will get us back on track towards our 2018 margin goals. 
Our Kashi cereal portfolio is poised to return to growth as distribution has stabilized and our innovation pipeline is strong. The recently launched Dark Cocoa Karma Wheat Biscuit Cereal is going very well, and we have an excellent new GOLEAN variant coming in January. Acceptance so far from our customers has been strong. Our largest challenge in 2017 on Kashi will continue to be wholesome snacks. We have renovation and innovation coming early in the year, which will significantly change the trend we have been experiencing. However, I doubt we will get the wholesome snacks part of this business back to growth on the full year. 
In Frozen Foods, our focus is on driving core Eggo, with new taste-oriented communication breaking in January as well as significant renovation with the removal of artificials from all of our waffles in the first quarter. On Morningstar Farms, we are focused on reactivating communication now that the packaging is on shelf and we have significant innovation building in the first half of the year. Finally, in Canada, we will be lapping our pricing interventions from this year. And as foreign exchange issues moderate, we expect to see a stabilization of sales and a return to margin expansion. 
So in summary, there's been a ton of work behind the scenes this year in Kellogg North America, all aimed at getting our portfolio more on trend enhancing our capabilities and execution, and improving profitability. While our top line growth hasn't consistently reflected these efforts yet, it is coming, and we are seeing sequential improvement to go with impressive margin expansion. We are making definitive progress towards the 400 to 450 basis points of operating margin improvement we're targeting through 2018. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Chris Hood, President of Kellogg Europe."
283356,378975174,1105414,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and greetings, everyone, from here in Geneva.

For Kellogg Europe, 2016 will be viewed as a year in which we improved our profitability and got most of our business back on track. We've continued to accelerate the growth of Pringles. We've returned wholesome snacks to growth. We've stabilized our Cereal business in most of the region, and we're growing net sales in 5 of our 6 geographic clusters. The one exception is U.K. Cereal, which makes up just over 20% of our total sales.
U.K. is a market where a sluggish economy and a difficult retail environment have resulted in net price deflation. We've underperformed in our premium adult portfolio, most notably Special K and All-Bran. And this has resulted in sharp sales declines year-to-date in this important market. But it's important not to overlook the good progress we've made elsewhere in the region. 
A good way to assess this progress is Slide #28, where we can compare against the priorities we set out for Kellogg Europe in 2016 and shared with you 1 year ago at the Day at K event. Cereal is stabilizing, with over half of our markets holding or growing share, a significant improvement versus last year. Needless to say, our primary focus right now and into 2017 will be on stabilizing the U.K. business and getting Special K back on track. But we are showing improvement in the rest of Europe, and that was a priority for this year. 
Pringles has been a big success since we acquired this brand in 2012. We're seeing continued, high single-digit growth, with broad-based share growth across almost all markets. This marks 4 years in a row of high single-digit growth in this brand, and we're doing this by strengthening the core of the brand and assessing -- accessing new locations and new markets, the additional sizes and geographic expansion. 
Wholesome snacks has returned to growth across Europe in 2016, driven by investing in the renovation of Special K bars and innovation like Kellogg-branded fruit and nut bars. Our emerging markets of Russia and Arabia have made substantial progress despite difficult operating conditions. Our Russian business is up strongly year-to-date. And our acquisitions in Egypt, Bisco Misr and Mass Food, are both growing at a rapid clip as well. As discussed last year, e-commerce is a big channel for us in Europe. This channel represents over $100 million of our sales, $100 million, and we enjoy share premiums in our categories compared to the total market. 
And last, we continue to drive transformational change within our cost structure behind Project K; implementation of shared services; getting started with Zero-Based Budgeting, where we're about a year behind North America; and implementing revenue growth management to improve net price realization. We've increased our operating profit margin by 70 basis points already this year and by over 400 basis points over the last 4 years. So there's good progress being made across Europe on the priorities we established last November. Unfortunately, the growth progress is being somewhat masked by difficult market conditions in the U.K. on our Cereal business. Looking forward, we expect to stabilize top line sales and continue to drive strong profit expansion. 
Slide 29 discusses our 2016 results and outlook. As you can see, we posted strong profit growth in Q3. Our sales were off slightly, almost solely due to our Cereal business in the U.K. In the rest of Europe, we posted sales growth in virtually all of our subregions. France Benelux grew high single digits. Southern Europe and the Mediterranean Middle East posted low single-digit growth, and Russia recorded a strong double-digit gain. And we are holding or growing share in over half of our cereal markets while sustaining strong Pringles momentum. As we go into Q4, we'll work to drive sequential share improvement on our core brands, and we should post another quarter of margin expansion and profit growth. We will finish 2016 with a slight decline in net sales, but significant profit expansion due to all of our productivity initiatives. 
Turning to Slide #30. Here's how we're thinking about 2017. In combination across Cereal and Snacks, we expect total Europe 2017 sales to be flat to down slightly. We're making good progress on stabilizing our Cereal business in most of Europe. There's already quite a bit of work going on in turning around the U.K. We're simplifying and focusing our operations to drive a stronger core business. We're accelerating the repositioning of the Special K brand behind recently launched on-trend offerings, like Special K Nourish, which has been successful elsewhere in the world. We're crafting a better, more balanced commercial plan. And we're using revenue growth management to get our prices and pack formats right in order to reverse the deflation that we've been experiencing. With all of these plans, we are expecting sequential improvement on U.K. Cereal during 2017, with continued decline albeit at a moderated pace. 
Pringles still has plenty of room to grow. Food renovation, commercial innovation and geographic expansion will all continue in 2017. And executing our productivity initiatives will continue to be a focus. Delivering our expected savings from Project K, global business services and Zero-Based Budgeting are all critical to enabling the investments in food renovation and covering Brexit-related transactional currency impact. 
In summary, we have more work to do, but we are seeing some green shoots of sales recovery, and we are confident that we can bring stability to our European Cereal business while continuing to grow Snacks. Meanwhile, we'll continue to boost productivity to drive profitable growth, staying on course toward our 2018 operating profit margin goal of 300 to 350 incremental basis points. 
With that, let me turn the phone over to Maria Fernanda Mejia, President of Kellogg Latin America."
283356,378975174,1105414,"Kellogg Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Kellanova","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone.

Latin America continues to be an important growth opportunity for Kellogg, a key element to the company's 2020 Growth Plan. Our programs are fully aligned to this growth plan. And we're prioritizing investment behind markets like Mexico, Caribbean Central America and Andean, strengthening our leadership in Cereal, while expanding our Snacks footprint. And we're building scale in more emerging markets like Brazil. But as you know, nothing is ever simple in Latin America. We have to manage very carefully through an extremely challenging external environment. 
When we met last November during Day at K, we outlined our strategy and key areas of focus for 2016. A year later, I'm pleased to share with you the tremendous progress, as shown on Slide 32. Leading category growth is evident from our share growth in many core cereal markets, our record shares in wholesome snacks in Brazil and Colombia, and our double-digit growth on Pringles in markets like Mexico. Driving this growth has been innovation. We've expanded our offerings under the Kellogg's parent brand growing double digit. And our most recent introductions for Special K, protein cereal and nut bars, are exceeding our expectations.
We continue to drive our distribution and sales coverage in high-frequency stores, while improving our in-store execution by tailoring our regional commercial programs by retail environment. And we've continued to increase our supply chain network utilization significantly over the past 3 years. We've enabled our innovation platforms, strengthened our packaging capabilities and evolved our business models through partnerships with co-manufacturers, enhancing our speed to market. And we delivered margin improvement through efficiency programs like Project K, KIM [ph] and ZBB, all of which are combining with price realization to offset foreign exchange headwinds. So great progress being made across our priorities. 
A driver of market expansion will be M&A. And one of the most exciting transformational components of our growth plan can be seen on Slide 33. Our recently announced acquisition of Parati, which we hope to close in the fourth quarter, completely changes the game for us in Brazil, a market where we have been present and where we've been growing for a number of years, but where we've lacked critical scale. With Parati, we more than doubled our size in the high-growth potential Mercosur region, bringing it from just over 10% of Kellogg Latin America sales to over 25%. And we substantially increased our overall presence in Snacks, taking it roughly from 20% of Kellogg Latin America sales to about 1/3. This is a company that plays in attractive categories, with strong brands and a track record of growth. It's largely regional, with its foothold in the South, so there is geographic expansion opportunity. It's link in high-frequency stores will be leveraged across our Kellogg brand. 
Slide 34 summarizes our performance in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. After a relatively soft first half, driven by region-wide economic slowdown and FX impact, we returned to growth in quarter 3. We saw growth in both Cereal and in Snacks, and the growth was broad-based. Mexico, Mercosur, Caribbean Central America all posted sales growth in the quarter, aided by price realization. For the region, excluding volatile Venezuela, we've held our shares for the Cereal category flat year-to-date, with gains in markets like Brazil, Colombia and Puerto Rico. And in the recent periods, we have seen Mexico regain some share it lost earlier in the year. Snacks is showing strong momentum across the region, both on wholesome and salty. 
Meanwhile, our productivity efforts and price realization are starting to flow through to profit margin, which improved strongly in the third quarter. The team continues to manage well through very difficult economic and currency conditions. And we should not overlook the very good work done to manage through continuous crisis in Venezuela. We are expecting another quarter of sequential acceleration in net sales in the fourth quarter on improved price realization, stronger commercial plans and relevant innovation across categories hitting the stores, and this despite a difficult economic environment in Brazil. Profit margins in the fourth quarter should continue to move higher due to price realization and additional efficiencies generated through our recently launched ZBB initiative.
On Slide 35, we show our priorities for 2017, and everything starts with our largest market, Mexico. The sequential improvements we're seeing in the second half of 2016 will continue into 2017, with exciting innovation to grow consumption in cereal, continued expansion into the HFS channel, effective brand building and exciting opportunities behind our growing snacks businesses. The integration of Parati in Brazil will be executed flawlessly given our proven success with integrating Pringles several years ago, coupled with our common cultures and complementary businesses. Revenue growth is critical to driving profitable growth, executing our portfolio by retail environment and implementing the right price and size, effective promotions, while driving mix will help us generate sales and profitability. And we'll continue our path with supply chain optimization with step changes ahead. 
So in summary, a laser-sharp focus on these priorities should allow us to better manage through current regional volatility and deliver good low single-digit growth and expanded profit margins in 2017. This will put us well on our way toward our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with this, I'll turn it over to Amit Banati, President of Asia Pacific, currently in Singapore."

Our top line growth has been consistent, led by Pringles and emerging markets. And our joint ventures are also growing strongly. Profit margins have moved higher, and we have plans to increase them further. And most importantly, we have continued to make progress in our key strategic initiatives, and these will make Asia Pacific a sustainable growth engine for Kellogg for years to come. 
On Slide 37, we show the priorities for Asia Pacific that have been communicated at Day at K last year. In 2016, we continued to make strong progress against our priorities to transform the region. We have a more balanced portfolio. Asia and Africa now account for about 2/3 of the region sales. Snacks now account for about 1/3 of the region sales. We have made good progress in stabilizing our Australian business, particularly in cereal, where we are seeing much better category and share trends. Pringles has delivered strong growth in 2016. 
After 2 years of double-digit growth in Asia, we have seen growth moderate in 2016, primarily due to challenging market conditions in India in the first half of the year. But we are growing overall, and India is recovering in the second half. And in South Africa, we have seen strong growth in both our wholly-owned operations and our joint venture in Nigeria. 
Slide 38 discusses our quarter 3 performance and how we see quarter 4 shaping up. We continued to post increased sales in quarter 3, with Pringles and emerging markets driving the growth. We are seeing our Australian Cereals business stabilize in 2016, with improved consumption and share trends in the Cereals category. The drivers of improved performance include a renovation to 4-star foods of our biggest brand Nutri-Grain, which is now in growth; the launch of a gluten-free range, which is the #1 innovation in the Cereal category year-to-date; and improved execution in stores. 
Our Pringles business had a strong quarter 3, growing sales at a double-digit rate. Growth was driven by distribution expansion in emerging markets and new innovations expanding the Pringles portfolio such as the introduction of sweet flavors in Korea and the launch of Tortilla across the region. Emerging markets remain a source of growth for the region, with Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia key highlights for us in quarter 3. Quarter 3 sales growth was impacted by Korea, lapping the year-ago supply disruption of a major competitor. Growth was also impacted by challenging economic and regulatory conditions in India in the first half, and our snacks business in Australia has remained soft. We have seen sequential improvement in our performance in India and Australia snacks each quarter. As a result, we expect growth to accelerate in quarter 4. This will result in full year sales growth in the low single-digit range.
Again, it is important not to forget our unconsolidated joint ventures shown on Slide 39. These are a key element of our emerging markets growth strategy. Year-to-date, our joint venture in China and our joint venture and investment stake in Nigeria are both growing at a strong double-digit rate despite operating in very challenging business environments. When you consider that our share of these businesses net sales is equivalent to roughly half the size of our Asia Pacific region, you can understand how significantly they would add to our overall growth if they were consolidated into our results.
We have strong plans for 2017, represented on Slide 40. We will build on our progress on stabilizing our Australian Cereal business. Turning around our Wholesome Snacks business in Australia will be a key priority. We recently launched Special K Protein bites and Nutri-Grain edge bars, and they are both off to a strong good start. We have also relaunched the Be Natural brand with new food and packaging. 
Emerging markets will continue to be a growth driver across both cereal and snacks. In cereals, we continue to drive category development in emerging markets, and we will also launch Wholesome Snacks in South Korea and Southeast Asia. We continue to expect strong growth on Pringles behind innovation and distribution expansion in emerging markets as we expand offerings at affordable price points. Small cans now account for 20% of our Pringles sales in the region. 
2017 will also see an increased focus on driving operating margin expansion as we roll out zero-based budgeting and revenue growth management. In terms of outlook, we expect net sales growth in the low single-digit range for Kellogg Asia Pacific in 2017, with sales from our joint ventures in effect bringing that pace of growth much higher. Meanwhile, profit margins should expand, driving higher profit and putting us closer to our 2018 margin expansion target of 100 to 200 basis points. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to John Bryant for some final remarks."

We're disappointed by our recent sales performance, but improving underlying fundamentals point to sequential improvement in Q4 and 2017. We have unprecedented earnings visibility. That's because of our productivity programs like Project K and ZBB. It's because of revenue growth management and it's because of a refreshed volume-to-value operating model. And we have increased confidence that we can achieve our goal of raising our operating profit margin by 350 basis points from 2015 through 2018.

Investing behind our biggest brands, be that our big 3 crackers, our core 6 cereals, Rice Krispies Treats, the Eggo brand, the Pop-Tart brand, investing in the food in ways that continuously improve our offerings, sometimes that's removing things people want less out sometimes that's putting more what people want more of like Red Berries, for example, in Special K. Those are the things that allow branded companies like ours and our big brands to compete and play effectively for consumers' pocketbooks in the marketplace. So my focus is very much in improving our foods, bigger and better ideas and driving our investment behind those things. Now how do we invest whether it's old-school television or whether it's more socially driven, I think that's what all of us are working towards.

Now we are heading more towards the top end of that range, maybe even a little bit above that range, as we look at our most recent outlook for the year. So we're seeing very good performance from zero-based budgeting. As we move back into 2017, and I did provide an update at the Barclays conference. If you want to refer to some charts there, you'll see it on the charts as well. But Project K, balance of the program to hit the $425 million to $475 million worth of savings. So roughly $140 million to $190 million of savings over the next couple years, '17 and '18, to hit that range. And we have said that more than half of that savings would come in 2017.

So what makes one brand react might be different from another. We clearly saw a reinvestment in our core foods around, say, Special K Red Berries, which is a significant part of our lineup, turned the business back to positive growth on a year-to-date basis this year. K's growing and growing share. We see Rice Krispies do extremely well this year, not because of necessarily innovation or renovation but because of consumer engagement around recipe usage and versatility, and I think that's driving that brand. Frosted Flakes is another brand that's growing well against teens and tweens this year. So -- and that, again, I would say, is driven by in-store activation behind big properties, properties like Finding Dory or the Olympics events. So it's not the same ingredients behind every brand. When it comes to ZBB reinvestment, we have put some money back in the business this year. We put it back in our sales force again to drive greater activation right through to the point-of-purchase. So sometimes it's behind a brand, sometimes is focusing on getting the assortment right and the perfect shelf at store and that takes resources at the store level to do that. We did choose to reinvest in Keebler this year, which obviously isn't a cereal, but that was the choice coming out of ZBB reinvestment, and we've seen positive returns on that. So I do think it comes down to core 6 brands. And the one thing we can do better next year, I believe, is get Kashi back to growth. Kashi responds to many needs out there that some of the Kellogg traditional legacy brands can't. It's growing in the natural channel, 4%, 5%. We need to get it beyond stable to growth in mainstream measure channels as well next year. We do that plus the core 6. I think you'll see the category flatten out and maybe chip into growth."

So we have completely renovated all of our foods to be nonGMO product verified and about 30% to 40% of our portfolio is now organic. So we've done a lot of the fundamentals of getting the food right, in particular in our biggest business. We then decided to exit some categories, frozen pizzas, for example. And that's -- we're getting out of things that we don't think were a good fit for the Kashi brand. And we turned our attention to innovating and renovating aggressively on our Wholesome Snacks business, which, as John mentioned earlier, Wholesome Snacks is again all about getting the food right. As we look at consumer reaction to Kashi, we're getting good reaction. A lot of positive social reaction to the brand, which means I feel confident about the equity. I think our foods are all getting back on trend. I think -- and this is the important bit, you're right, with great execution which I think we can improve on. We will return this business to growth.

Can you comment a little bit more specifically on what's driving that? Is it the retailers aren't responding to new packaging? Or is it just the new packaging using available? So they're essentially not taking orders at this time? And then maybe from a longer-term perspective, this is a pretty on-trend category. Are you expecting a fairly quick return to growth once the packaging situation resolves?"

We have consumer validated and qualified packaging that we feel very good about. We, with any disruptive innovation, sometimes things can get disruptive. And we have not executed through to the shelf at the pace we expected to be able to execute. So I do think this is a case of execution, unfortunately, in the Morningstar Farms business. If I looked across our business, I look at cereal, I look at snacks, we've seen some very good execution. Kashi will be one area or Morningstar Farms where I think we have opportunity to improve. The good news is, like I say, our packaging is consumer validated. We are now in a place where our distribution is back to normal and where it needs to be. I have visibility to a great pipeline of news coming earlier in the year, and we are now completely focused on communication and regenerating trial. There's no issue with the food. There's no issue with consumer. A lot of the food, we just -- we missed it here and now we're focused very much on getting back to growth. I foresee growth for Morningstar Farms next year as we go forward. We did lose one item, which shows through in the numbers, unfortunately, negatively, is we did lose a big item in the club channel, one of our best sellers, and we're working hard to get that item back in the organic format. When we get that item back, the club business is big for this business. So we're cautiously optimistic that's coming back as well, and that will be a driver of growth for this business next year."
