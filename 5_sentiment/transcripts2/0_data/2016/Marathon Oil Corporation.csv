Our $1.4 billion program in",678,"Thanks, Chris. I'd like to extend my welcome to those listening. Last night, we announced a reduced capital program for 2016 that reflects the current challenging environment and our clear objective of balance sheet protection. Our $1.4 billion program in 2016 is over 50% lower than last year's program and 75% lower than 2014.
As the chart illustrates, we have responded as oil prices have fallen dramatically, and are doing the same in 2016 with our capital program calibrated to a view of WTI in the upper 30s and assume success in our noncore asset sales program.
Our business planning and budgeting are not static but rather, decisions are being made in realtime, in large part facilitated by the optionality afforded by our short cycle investments. We have designed our 2016 programs to maximize capital allocation to the short cycle investments in our U.S. resource plays, complete long cycle projects that contribute production and minimize allocation to conventional exploration. Guided by these principles of the foundation of our plan, production volumes were, by design and outcome, not an objective, and we are forecasting a total company production decline of 6% to 8% year-over-year adjusted for divestitures.
This program provides us the optionality to further adjust our short cycle investments if needed based on commodity prices and the outcome of our noncore asset sales.
Last year, we achieved over $300 million of noncore asset sales toward our original goal of at least $500 million. When we set that original target, we were transparent that the noncore assets under consideration far exceeded $500 million. Based on the transactions announced today as well as progress on the remaining assets, we've increased our target to a range of $750 million to $1 billion. This year's capital allocation is designed to position the company for a sustained period of low commodity prices while maintaining the capability to be flexible in a dynamic environment.
Slide 4 illustrates the allocation of our 2016 program in a bit more detail. As I mentioned, the majority of our 2016 program, about 70% will be directed to the Eagle Ford, SCOOP STACK and Bakken. For each of our 3 core resource plays, we have set a specific objectives for our 2016 investment. Namely, maintaining the efficiencies our Eagle Ford team has worked so hard to capture, protecting our leasehold in the STACK while continuing to improve our understanding of the Oklahoma Resource Basin and focusing on our base business in the Bakken with operated D&C greatly reduce. All of this, of course, while continuing to focus on sustainable cost reduction that will be maintained through the commodity cycle. Across the remainder of the portfolio, we will be completing several long cycle projects in 2016. Most notably, our operated compression project in EG. This project will extend plateau production from the Alba Field by an additional 2 years and allow us to develop in excess of $130 million netball equivalent barrels of proven reserves.
In addition to the EG compression project, we expect first oil this year from investments in 2 outside operated projects, Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico and Atrush in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We're forecasting about $40 million of sustaining CapEx toward our nonoperated working interest in the oil sands this year. We, along with the operator and other JV partner, are intensely focused on building upon the structural cost improvements and better uptime reliability achieved in 2015.
Finally, we've significantly reduced our conventional exploration CapEx this year to $30 million, down about 90% from last year, following the strategic decision we made last fall to scale back in this space. This year spend is largely limited to existing commitments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gabon, with no new exploration wells planned in 2016.
As we enter another year with reduced capital investment, we again look to our short cycle U.S. resource plays to continue providing the operational flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions.
With that, I'll turn it over to Lance to review the resource plays in a bit more detail."

I'll continue with the broad overview of the 2016 program for U.S. resource plays on Slide 5. Consistent with our focus on prioritizing the balance sheet this year, our allocation to the resource plays is anticipated at $1 billion, down about 50% from 2015. As Lee said, the short cycle nature of these assets allows us to be flexible in a volatile commodity market. If needed, we have the option to reduce spending down further with substantially all of our acreage held by production in the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and in the SCOOP Woodford. We also have relatively few leases with continuing pulling obligations and no long-term rig commitments in these plays.
The pie charts on the slide depict our operated drilling and completions, our nonoperated drilling and completions and other spend across each basin. Through the budget planning process, our intent was to maximize the allocation to drilling and completions opportunities. The nonoperated drilling and completions component of the budget is our current best estimate of the spend based on recent engagement with partners. In the current commodity environment, we are closely scrutinizing each project proposal for costs and returns. When prudent, we will not consent discretionary projects that do not deliver adequate returns. Given the continuing decline in industry rig counts across our 3 basins, the expected bias in the non-operated estimates is lower. For reference, the other spend category broadly consist of diverse nondiscretionary items for direct support and development activity such as centralized facilities expansions, data gathering and other items not directly included in drilling and completions costs but essential parts of an operation.
Turning to the Eagle Ford, we are down to 7 rigs, and we'll be scaling down further to 5 rigs near the end of the first quarter. Additionally, we will be racing to a single Phrack crew for much of the year that will match drilling activity. Consistent with our past practices, we plan to maintain sufficient inventory to keep the completion crew operationally efficient. This activity level retains our execution capability and core competencies, allowing us to continue codeveloping the highest value, Austin Chalk, Upper and Lower Eagle Ford Horizons across our core acreage position. A continued focus on enhancing well productivity through stimulation design and technology application has recently yielded encouraging early results in our high GOR oil areas. As this activity matures, we anticipate sharing more details throughout the year. 
In the Oklahoma resource basins, our capital spend will focus on retaining term leases in the core of the STACK Meramec as we continue to delineate the rich condensate window and optimize stimulation designs. While maintaining leases will be our primary objective across Oklahoma this year, based on the success of our first operated Springer oil well in the fourth quarter in the SCOOP, we will also continue to progress limited Springer activity to delineate the down dip aerial extent of this play.
In the Bakken, we are focused on the base business where we will complete our ongoing water gathering system later this year to further reduce our largest single expense, water handling. Based on the current commodity price environment, we recently released our last operated rig in the Bakken, and plan to have intermittent development activity later in the year, primarily to address continuing drilling obligations. With this reduced level of activity and at recent reprising, we anticipate Bakken achieves cash flow neutrality and 2016.
The $75 million earmarked for outside operated activity in Bakken is our current best estimate of AFEs we expect to receive from partners this year, and each will be scrutinized closely given the current low commodity environment.
Despite reduced resource play activity, we continue to balance our current actions with the need to be responsive when more constructive pricing occurs.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mitch to review capital activities outside the resource plays."

Starting with our OSM",444,"Thank you, Lance. Referring to Slide 6, I'll provide a brief overview of 2016 activities across our remaining portfolio, where we continue to moderate capital spend, while delivering profitable long cycle projects during the year. 
Starting with our OSM segment, we've achieved a step-change reduction in sustaining capital levels and our 2016 CapEx at about $40 million as well below historical averages. Along with the operator and our JV partner, our focus remains on maintaining the improved reliability, while lowering operating and sustaining capital costs to reposition the business for profitable operation within the current environment. Despite challenging pricing in the third and fourth quarters last year, OSM was cash flow positive, thanks to offering cost that averaged less than $30 per barrel of synthetic crude oil for the 2 consecutive quarters. But the more consistent operations, our 3 highest net production quarters in the history of the operation occurred last year, leading to 2015 annual production volumes net of royalty at an all-time high while unplanned downtime with an all-time low.
Outside of OSM, we expect to complete 3 long cycle projects in 2016, bringing incremental cash flow is starting in the second half of the year. Beginning with our operated business in EG, we completed a successful and incident free installation campaign of the combined 10,000 tons jacket and topsides for the album v3 Compression Project in mid-January. The project remains on budget and on schedule. Following hookup and commissioning activities, we expect a midyear startup of the new facility. The installation will have 72,000-horsepower of compression and associated processing equipment facilities, which allow us to significantly extend Alba Field life to beyond 2030 with minimal future capital requirements.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect startup of the outside operated Gunflint, 2 well subsea development also by midyear.
Finally, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, developments are progressing within the Atrush and Sarsang outside operated blocks. 
In the Atrush block, installations of the Phase I 30,000-barrel per day facility is progressing with first oil expected later this year. 4 existing wells will feed the facility and future development decisions will be evaluated following the assessment from well and reservoir performance.
In late 2015, a second well and wellsite production facility were brought online in the Sarsang block. 2016 activity is focused on bringing additional wells online to utilize existing facility capacity while further expansion will be evaluated in light of the current macro environment.
Across the portfolio, we continue to focus on cost management and delivering high operational availability in an effort to defend margins within the challenging commodity price environment.
With that brief summary, I'll pass it back to Lee."

Capital discipline and balance sheet protection have driven the decision supporting our reduced 2016 capital program and slide 7 provides our production guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we're forecasting total company production in 2016 to decline 6% to 8% from 2015, adjusted for our divestitures in the Gulf of Mexico and East Texas, North Louisiana.
For the first quarter 2016, our total E&P guidance includes 2 extraordinary downtime events. First, we expect downtime in EG of approximately 20,000 net BOE per day associated with the installation of the jacket and topsides for the ALBA compression project as well as planned maintenance. Installation was completed in January and the ALBA field and on sure plants returned to a full production earlier this month.
Second, late December, the Brae off insulation experienced a pipe failure and first quarter totally E&P production guidance includes the impact of the approximately 7,000 net BOE per day of U.K. production that remains shut-in while repairs are underway. Resumption of full production is expected in the second quarter.
Wrapping up on slide 8. We anticipate 2016 will require a similar level of flexibility to adapt to the uncertain macro environment as is last year. In 2015, we lowered production in G&A expenses over $435 million, we reduced our workforce by over 20%, which will generate about $160 million of annualized net savings and we decreased our quarterly dividend as women increasing annual free cash flow on more than $425 million. We've became even more efficient operators in each of our basins, decreasing completed well costs everywhere through a combination of commercial savings and execution of efficiency.
2016 where a request same level of focus and discipline, and our $1.4 billion capital program is designed with balance sheet protection as our top priority. The plan continues to direct the lion's share of capital to our short cycle resource plays, which provide the most flexibility. The remainder of the portfolio includes completely long cycle projects that contribute production volumes to the company as well as keeping committed capital obligations to a minimal level.
We will continue lowering our cost structure, enhancing operational productivity and progressing toward our newly revised noncore asset sales target of $750 million to $1 billion.
Finally, our $4.2 billion in liquidity at year-end, which includes $1.2 billion in cash in end undrawn $3 billion revolving credit facility, positions us well for the reality of sustained low commodity prices.
That concludes our remarks, and I will now hand back to Chris."

I think there are a few of those in my opening remarks, but the adjustment to the dividend, I think even the reduction in our capital budget last year of about $500 million, the strong steps that we took earlier in the cycle in both production expenses and G&A costs, including a basically a 700 reduction in our workforce, all of these, I think, are demonstrative of the action that we are prepared to take to ensure that we are putting balance sheet protection first and foremost.

And what I'll say is, based on our progress to date, the transactions that we've been able to complete and the quality as well as the diversity of the identified noncore assets that we still have in the hopper, we're comfortable increasing that target to that $750 million to $1 billion. The way I would kind of describe the asset add is that they're primarily U.S. upstream and midstream. They are both operated and nonoperated, but the list is very diverse and we are very satisfied taking some singles and doubles. Some will be bigger, but there's quite a few that will be smaller. And thus far, the market has shown an ability to digest some of those smaller transactions quite readily.

And just to maybe level set a little bit, at the kind of current contango in the strip, that would equate to us to about $500 million of incremental free cash flow in 2017. And then at that point, as incremental cash flow might be realized, it would be capital allocation decision based on the highest and best use as to whether that goes to balance sheet strengthening or and/or into organic investment. I don't see those 2 as necessarily being mutually exclusive. The other thing that I would add to is that although we do have some long cycle projects that Mitch addressed rolling off in 2016, we do have a little bit of an offset.

As for the outstanding rating evaluation, honestly, Evan, I don't know what they're going to define as what it means to be an investment-grade anymore. Remember what it used to be throughout most of my career. And based on my historical understanding, I would say we still meet the metrics that they used to lay out there. But honestly, those are changing. And so I just -- anyone to predict what they will ultimately do. But at the end of the day, I'm still investment-grade, I'm still going to be part of the IG indices from a bond trading standpoint. There really isn't any significant impact on us if that 1 rating agency were to not rate us investment grade. I mean, clearly, there's going to be cost issue and in periods that are highly volatile and access issue, but all of that is completely manageable."

So historically, I've always tried to focus on liquidity when you're at the bottom of the cycle. And again, historically, that was the way it was measured. It's whether or not you have enough liquidity to get you through the bottom of the cycle. As Lee indicated in his remarks, our goal here in 2016 is free cash flow neutrality. So to be able to manage the outspend with the success in the noncore asset sale program and not add debt to the balance sheet. And as I indicated, we're going to maintain ample liquidity to support the business. And in addition, I want to make sure, in not only liquidity but the cash component of that liquidity to maintain the option associated with just delevering the balance sheet in late '17 when we have a relatively modest amount of debt that becomes due, about $700 million. So clearly, I think we've said multiple times, the noncore asset sale program and the flexibility of the capital program are really going to be the key levers on that. But one thing I do want to go to on this issue of leverage metrics and what really highlight what Lee said before, just the embedded oil price leverage and the impact the cash flows, and candidly the leverage metrics is significant. And we just set them if just assuming the forward contango that exists today, so whatever that is from a current standpoint, probably about $7, sometime around there, it's about $500 million of free cash flow and a significant step change in what you're leverage would be on a net debt-to-EBITDA standpoint. So we're focus on managing through the cycle and again, I as indicated to Evan, really destroyed to make the decisions are in the best interest of the business."

I think you should think about those acres that we're constantly looking particularly in Oklahoma, which is in a cycle in the play relative to others to vote as you describe, core op that position and secure resources. We were very successful over the last year primarily, organically, through a small local auction processes in the BIA and the CLO and other organization as well as just doing small leasing opportunities with peers and accumulated 14,000 acres in Oklahoma, the overwhelming majority of that is in the STACK play focused in the core, primarily Blaine County. What we found over the balance of that year is that the core of the Meramec has shifted in the western direction, which is where most of that acreage was acquired and we managed to secure all that for about $3,000 an acre, which is very competitive. Referencing where we would go in terms of activity and allocate the capital, I think we're always going to take that broadly within our overall capital allocation process. We certainly want to be able to continue to delineate Oklahoma because we have more to learn there perhaps than other basins. I think we're going to have to wait and see how the commodity market really evolves before we can make those capital allocations beyond 2016."

Candidly, I'm very thankful for the early moves that we did with regard to showing up that liquidity, the early moves we did with regard to extending debt maturities and feel like we're well situated for both '16 and '17 on the liquidity front, but it is interesting that the anomalies that we're seeing in the new ones as compared to previous market corrections."

I'd like to extend my welcome to those listening.

Last night, we announced a reduced capital program for 2016 that reflects the current challenging environment and our clear objective of balance sheet protection. Our $1.4 billion program in 2016 is over 50% lower than last year's program and 75% lower than 2014.
As the chart illustrates, we have responded as oil prices have fallen dramatically, and are doing the same in 2016 with our capital program calibrated to a view of WTI in the upper 30s and assume success in our noncore asset sale program.
Our business planning and budgeting are not static but rather, decisions are being made in realtime, in large part facilitated by the optionality afforded by our short cycle investments. We have designed our 2016 programs to maximize capital allocation to the short cycle investments in our U.S. resource plays, complete long cycle projects that contribute production and minimize allocation to conventional exploration. Guided by these principles as the foundation of our plan, production volumes were, by design and outcome, not an objective, and we are forecasting a total company production decline of 6% to 8% year-over-year adjusted for divestitures.
This program provides us the optionality to further adjust our short cycle investments if needed based on commodity prices and the outcome of our noncore asset sales.
Last year, we achieved over $300 million of noncore asset sales toward our original goal of at least $500 million. When we set that original target, we were transparent that the noncore assets under consideration far exceeded $500 million. Based on the transactions announced today as well as progress on the remaining assets, we've increased our target to a range of $750 million to $1 billion. This year's capital allocation is designed to position the company for a sustained period of low commodity prices while maintaining the capability to be flexible in a dynamic environment.
Slide 4 illustrates the allocation of our 2016 program in a bit more detail. As I mentioned, the majority of our 2016 program, about 70% will be directed to the Eagle Ford, SCOOP STACK and Bakken. For each of our 3 core resource plays, we have set specific objectives for our 2016 investment. Namely, maintaining the efficiencies our Eagle Ford team has worked so hard to capture; protecting our leasehold in the STACK while continuing to improve our understanding of the Oklahoma Resource Basin; and focusing on our base business in the Bakken with operated D&C greatly reduced. All of these, of course, while continuing to focus on sustainable cost reduction that will be maintained through the commodity cycle. Across the remainder of the portfolio, we will be completing several long cycle projects in 2016. Most notably, our operated compression project in EG. This project will extend plateau production from the Alba Field by an additional 2 years and allow us to develop in excess of $130 million netball equivalent barrels of proven reserves.
In addition to the EG compression project, we expect first oil this year from investments in 2 outside operated projects: Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico; and Atrush in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We're forecasting about $40 million of sustaining CapEx toward our nonoperated working interest in the oil sands this year. We, along with the operator and other JV partner, are intensely focused on building upon the structural cost improvements and better uptime reliability achieved in 2015.
Finally, we've significantly reduced our conventional exploration CapEx this year to $30 million, down about 90% from last year, following the strategic decision we made last fall to scale back in this space. This year's spend is largely limited to existing commitments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gabon, with no new exploration wells planned in 2016.
As we enter another year with reduced capital investment, we again look to our short cycle U.S. resource plays to continue providing the operational flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions.
With that, I'll turn it over to Lance to review the resource plays in a bit more detail."

I'll continue with the broad overview of the 2016 program for U.S. resource plays on Slide 5.

I'll continue with the broad overview of the 2016 program for U.S. resource plays on Slide 5. Consistent with our focus on prioritizing the balance sheet this year, our allocation to the resource plays is anticipated at $1 billion, down about 50% from 2015. As Lee said, the short cycle nature of these assets allows us to be flexible in a volatile commodity market. If needed, we have the option to reduce spending down further with substantially all of our acreage held by production in the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and in the SCOOP Woodford. We also have relatively few leases with continuing drilling obligations and no long-term rig commitments in these plays.
The pie charts on the slide depict our operated drilling and completions, our nonoperated drilling and completions and other spend across each basin. Through the budget planning process, our intent was to maximize the allocation to drilling and completions opportunities. The nonoperated drilling and completions component of the budget is our current best estimate of the spend based on recent engagement with partners. In the current commodity environment, we are closely scrutinizing each project proposal for costs and returns. When prudent, we will not consent discretionary projects that do not deliver adequate returns. 
Given the continuing decline in industry rig counts across our 3 basins, the expected bias in the non-operated estimates is lower. For reference, the other spend category broadly consist of diverse, nondiscretionary items for direct support and development activity, such as centralized facilities expansions, data gathering and other items not directly included in drilling and completions costs but essential parts of an operation.
Turning to the Eagle Ford, we are down to 7 rigs, and we'll be scaling down further to 5 rigs near the end of the first quarter. Additionally, we will be racing to a single frac crew for much of the year that will match drilling activity. Consistent with our past practices, we plan to maintain sufficient inventory to keep the completion crew operationally efficient. This activity level retains our execution capability and core competencies, allowing us to continue codeveloping the highest value Austin Chalk, Upper and Lower Eagle Ford horizons across our core acreage position. 
A continued focus on enhancing well productivity through stimulation design and technology application has recently yielded encouraging early results in our high GOR oil areas. As this activity matures, we anticipate sharing more details throughout the year. 
In the Oklahoma resource basins, our capital spend will focus on retaining term leases in the core of the STACK Meramec as we continue to delineate the rich condensate window and optimize stimulation designs. While maintaining leases will be our primary objective across Oklahoma this year, based on the success of our first operated Springer oil well in the fourth quarter in the SCOOP, we will also continue to progress limited Springer activity to delineate the down dip aerial extent of this play.
In the Bakken, we will focus on the base business where we will complete our ongoing water gathering system later this year to further reduce our largest single expense, water handling. Based on the current commodity price environment, we recently released our last operated rig in the Bakken and plan to have intermittent development activity later in the year, primarily to address continuing drilling obligations. With this reduced level of activity and at recent strip pricing, we anticipate Bakken achieves cash flow neutrality in 2016.
The $75 million earmarked for outside operated activity in Bakken is our current best estimate of AFEs we expect to receive from partners this year, and each will be scrutinized closely given the current low commodity environment.
Despite reduced resource play activity, we continue to balance our current actions with the need to be responsive when more constructive pricing occurs.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mitch to review capital activities outside the resource plays."

Starting with our OSM",445,"Thank you, Lance. Referring to Slide 6, I'll provide a brief overview of 2016 activities across our remaining portfolio, where we continue to moderate capital spend, while delivering profitable long cycle projects during the year. 
Starting with our OSM segment. We've achieved a step-change reduction in sustaining capital levels, and our 2016 CapEx at about $40 million is well below historical averages. Along with the operator and other JV partner, our focus remains on maintaining the improved reliability, while lowering operating and sustaining capital costs to reposition the business for profitable operation within the current environment. Despite challenging pricing in the third and fourth quarters last year, OSM was cash flow positive, thanks to operating cost that averaged less than $30 per barrel of synthetic crude oil for the 2 consecutive quarters. 
With the more consistent operations, our 3 highest net production quarters in the history of the operation occurred last year, leading to 2015 annual production volumes net of royalty at an all-time high, while unplanned downtime was at an all-time low.
Outside of OSM, we expect to complete 3 long cycle projects in 2016, bringing incremental cash flow starting in the second half of the year. Beginning with our operated business in EG, we completed a successful and incident free installation campaign of the combined 10,000-ton jacket and topsides for the Alba B3 compression project in mid-January. The project remains on budget and on schedule. Following hook-up and commissioning activities, we expect a midyear startup of the new facility. The installation will add 72,000 horsepower of compression and associated process equipment and utilities, which allow us to significantly extend Alba Field life to beyond 2030 with minimal future capital requirements.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect startup of the outside operated Gunflint, 2 well subsea development also by midyear.
Finally, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, developments are progressing within the Atrush and Sarsang outside operated blocks. In the Atrush block, installations of the Phase 1 30,000-barrel per day facility is progressing with first oil expected later this year. 4 existing wells will feed the facility and future development decisions will be evaluated following the assessment from well and reservoir performance.
In late 2015, a second well and wellsite production facility were brought online in the Sarsang block. 2016 activity is focused on bringing additional wells online to utilize existing facility capacity, while further expansion will be evaluated in light of the current macro environment.
Across the portfolio, we continue to focus on cost management and delivering high operational availability in an effort to defend margins within the challenging commodity price environment.
With that brief summary, I'll pass it back to Lee."

Capital discipline and balance sheet protection have driven the decision supporting our reduced 2016 capital program and slide 7 provides our production guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we're forecasting total company production in 2016 to decline 6% to 8% from 2015, adjusted for our divestitures in the Gulf of Mexico and East Texas, North Louisiana.
For the first quarter 2016, our total E&P guidance includes 2 extraordinary downtime events. First, we expect downtime in EG of approximately 20,000 net BOE per day associated with the installation of the jacket and topsides for the Alba compression project as well as planned maintenance. Installation was completed in January in the Alba Field and on-shore plants returned to full production earlier this month.
Second, late December, the Brae off insulation experienced a process pipe failure, and first quarter total E&P production guidance includes the impact of the approximately 7,000 net BOE per day of U.K. production that remains shut-in while repairs are underway. Resumption of full production is expected in the second quarter.
Wrapping up on slide 8. We anticipate 2016 will require a similar level of flexibility to adapt to the uncertain macro environment as with last year. In 2015, we lowered production in G&A expenses over $435 million; we reduced our workforce by over 20%, which will generate about $160 million of annualized net savings; and we decreased our quarterly dividend, increasing annual free cash flow by more than $425 million. We became even more efficient operators in each of our basins, decreasing completed well costs everywhere through a combination of commercial savings and execution efficiencies.
2016 will require that same level of focus and discipline, and our $1.4 billion capital program is designed with balance sheet protection as our top priority. The plan continues to direct the lion's share of capital to our short cycle resource plays, which provide the most flexibility. The remainder of the portfolio includes completing long cycle projects that contribute production volumes to the company as well as keeping committed capital obligations to a minimal level.
We will continue lowering our cost structure, enhancing operational productivity and progressing toward our newly revised noncore asset sales target of $750 million to $1 billion.
Finally, our $4.2 billion in liquidity at year end, which includes $1.2 billion in cash in an undrawn $3 billion revolving credit facility, positions us well for the reality of sustained low commodity prices.
That concludes our remarks, and I will now hand back to Chris."

I think we demonstrated last year our, certainly, our willingness to use every lever available to us to ensure that we do in fact protect the balance sheet. I ticked through a few of those in my opening remarks, but the adjustment to the dividend, I think even the reduction in our capital budget last year of about $500 million, the strong steps that we took early in the cycle on both production expenses and G&A costs, including a basically a 700 reduction in our workforce, all of these, I think, are demonstrative of the actions that we are prepared to take to ensure that we are putting balance sheet protection first and foremost.

There's no question that the sales market is much more challenging than it was even last year. But I'll go back and say, as a reminder, when we initially set our noncore asset target last year, we stated that we had identified a pretty broad pool of noncore assets that were well in excess of that original $500 million. And what I'll say is, based on our progress to date, the transactions that we've been able to complete and the quality as well as the diversity of the identified noncore assets that we still have in the hopper, we're comfortable increasing that target to that $750 million to $1 billion. The way I would kind of describe the asset add is that they're primarily U.S. upstream and midstream. They're both operated and nonoperated, but the list is very diverse and we are very satisfied taking some singles and doubles. Some will be bigger, but there's quite a few that will be smaller. And thus far, the market has shown an ability to digest some of those smaller transactions quite readily. Timing for us, we would expect to progress toward our revised target, really through the balance of 2016."

And as such, that still gives us a great deal of flexibility within our capital program and our capital spend. That activity, though, is going to largely depend upon where commodity prices are. And just to maybe level set a little bit, at the kind of current contango in the strip, that would equate to us to about $500 million of incremental free cash flow in 2017. And then at that point, as incremental cash flow might be realized, it would be capital allocation decision based on the highest and best use as to whether that goes to balance sheet strengthening or and/or into organic investment. I don't see those 2 as necessarily being mutually exclusive. The other thing that I would add, too, is that although we do have some long cycle projects, that Mitch addressed, rolling off in 2016, we do have a little bit of an offset and that we do have a remaining Deepwater GOM commitment, recommitment that will come back to us in 2017.

And again, historically, that was the way it was measured, is whether or not you have enough liquidity to get you through the bottom of the cycle. As Lee indicated in his remarks, our goal here in 2016 is free cash flow neutrality. So to be able to manage the outspend with the success in the noncore asset sale program and not add debt to the balance sheet. And as I indicated, we're going to maintain ample liquidity to support the business. And in addition, I want to make sure in not only liquidity but the cash component of that liquidity to maintain the option associated with just delevering the balance sheet in late '17 when we have a relatively modest amount of debt that becomes due, about $700 million. So clearly, I think we've said multiple times, the noncore asset sale program and the flexibility of the capital program are really going to be the key levers on that. But one thing I do want to go to on this issue of leverage metrics and what really highlight what Lee said before, just the embedded oil price leverage and the impact to cash flows and candidly the leverage metrics is significant. And Lee just said if just assuming the forward contango that exists today, so whatever that is from a current standpoint, probably about $7, sometime around there, is about $500 million of free cash flow and a significant step change in what your leverage would be on a net debt-to-EBITDA standpoint. So to me, we're focused on managing through the cycle and again, as I indicated to Evan, really just trying to make decisions that are in the best interest of the business."

What we found over the balance of that year is that the core of the Meramec has shifted western, in the western direction, which is where most of that acreage was acquired and we managed to secure all that for about $3,000 an acre, which is very competitive. Referencing where we would go in terms of activity and allocate that capital, I think we're always going to take that broadly within our overall capital allocation process. We certainly want to be able to continue to delineate Oklahoma because we have more to learn there perhaps than other basins.

I think perhaps as we articulated in the capital deck and the remarks this morning that were prepared that we're already moving into the activity reductions in Eagle Ford. We actually released our first rig recently this month down at the end of this quarter, we'll be down to 5 rigs and then we're going to stay at that flat activity level moving forward. I think as a desire as we look at the balance sheet prioritization overall, we want to take those decisions early in the year and we have. And so you'll see us go down that level and then maintain that activity level moving forward. And from quarter-to-quarter, you'll see those net 2 wells to sales moderate up or down a little bit as we have diverse working interest across it, but it will be relatively level from that point forward. Similarly, we're going to continue to run effectively the 2 rigs we had all in 2015 through Oklahoma, the managed lease obligations, and continue to delineate and learn in the Springer, the things we need to. And then reiterate, I think, the one I mentioned earlier, so we've actually released our Bakken activity challenged by returns currently with that price and so we're going to have limited activity for the rest of the year in the Bakken."

As I stated and so you noted that this is primarily U.S. assets that are both upstream and downstream. But if you look at the characteristics of what we already moved out of the portfolio, you can get a sense for just the diversity and even some of the scale of some of those actions that might occur in going forward. For instance, the East Texas North Louisiana deal was on the order of 4,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. The GOM assets, were on the order of about 10,000-ish barrels a day. So those are kind of the ballparks now. Those are some of the kind of small to midsize assets we might talk about now. There could be some larger, more material assets that do ultimately come into play. And of course, the midstream assets, the advantage there is that there really is no volumetric impact per se but you have, to, of course, be absolutely concerned about making sure that you have the right operational transition there to ensure security of your barrels.

And so it just becomes a matter of what's the capital we're going to allocate to it, and then the production is the outcome from it in this case. I think it's pretty clear that we've taken the activity down both in 2015 and 2016. There have to be decline in there. I think importantly, in the Eagle Ford, for example from Q3 to Q4, we held flat with effectively flat wells to sales, which indicates all the horizons we've been developing there are producing well and meet our expectations. And then I think you should think of the resource plays from annual '15 to annual '16 are going to have an overall decline in the low teens."

And what we found are 2 different distinct areas where it's been tested today. It's sort of a northern core and a southern core. The well -- the newbie well we drilled and brought online last quarter was in that southern core area, where there's probably the most data. We expected that to be oil biased in that area. I think we had a lot of confidence going in, the results so far had borne that out. The performance from that well has been very strong to begin with and it actually is similar to the underlying Woodford, elevated reservoir pressure, the accumulative 30, 60 day production tend to be relatively flat. That same production behavior has been borne out in the Springer thus far. So it's actually very consistent with our expectations, that's why we're excited about it. What we also see is the opportunity to delineate this play down dip from the core oil areas that we explored and others have looked at today into a rich condensate window, perhaps. So you'll see us continue to test that in a limited way, the Springer, across 2016."

When we think about capital allocation organically, certainly, our ability to maintain the scale efficiencies in the Eagle Ford and the strong economics there would make it a viable candidate for that incremental capital. But strategically, because of its role in our future growth driving more capital as well into Oklahoma, would be one of our preferred pathways also. From an execution capacity and a competency standpoint, we feel that we're more than prepared to take that step in the event that, that incremental cash flow comes available for investment."

As has become our custom, we released prepared remarks last night in connection with the earnings release. You can find those remarks on the associated slides on our website at marathonoil.com. We will begin this morning with additional prepared remarks discussing our 2016 capital program. We issued a separate press release detailing our 2016 capital program last evening. We posted a second slide presentation earlier today for the company's this morning's prepared remarks that can also be found on our website.
After our remarks, the remainder of the call will be available for Q&A. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. 
Slide 2 contains a discussion of forward-looking statements and other information included in this presentation. Our review will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
We have identified, in our latest annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a number of important factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in those forward-looking statements.

Last night, we announced a reduced capital program for 2016 that reflects the current challenging environment and our clear objective of balance sheet protection. Our $1.4 billion program in 2016 is over 50% lower than last year's program and 75% lower than 2014.
As the chart illustrates, we have responded as oil prices have fallen dramatically, and are doing the same in 2016 with our capital program calibrated to a view of WTI in the upper 30s and assume success in our noncore asset sale program.
Our business planning and budgeting are not static but rather, decisions are being made in realtime, in large part facilitated by the optionality afforded by our short cycle investments. We have designed our 2016 programs to maximize capital allocation to the short cycle investments in our U.S. resource plays, complete long cycle projects that contribute production and minimize allocation to conventional exploration. Guided by these principles as the foundation of our plan, production volumes were, by design and outcome, not an objective, and we are forecasting a total company production decline of 6% to 8% year-over-year adjusted for divestitures.
This program provides us the optionality to further adjust our short cycle investments if needed based on commodity prices and the outcome of our noncore asset sales.
Last year, we achieved over $300 million of noncore asset sales toward our original goal of at least $500 million. When we set that original target, we were transparent that the noncore assets under consideration far exceeded $500 million. Based on the transactions announced today as well as progress on the remaining assets, we've increased our target to a range of $750 million to $1 billion. This year's capital allocation is designed to position the company for a sustained period of low commodity prices while maintaining the capability to be flexible in a dynamic environment.
Slide 4 illustrates the allocation of our 2016 program in a bit more detail. As I mentioned, the majority of our 2016 program, about 70% will be directed to the Eagle Ford, SCOOP STACK and Bakken. For each of our 3 core resource plays, we have set specific objectives for our 2016 investment. Namely, maintaining the efficiencies our Eagle Ford team has worked so hard to capture; protecting our leasehold in the STACK while continuing to improve our understanding of the Oklahoma Resource Basin; and focusing on our base business in the Bakken with operated D&C greatly reduced. All of these, of course, while continuing to focus on sustainable cost reduction that will be maintained through the commodity cycle. Across the remainder of the portfolio, we will be completing several long cycle projects in 2016. Most notably, our operated compression project in EG. This project will extend plateau production from the Alba Field by an additional 2 years and allow us to develop in excess of $130 million netball equivalent barrels of proven reserves.
In addition to the EG compression project, we expect first oil this year from investments in 2 outside operated projects: Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico; and Atrush in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We're forecasting about $40 million of sustaining CapEx toward our nonoperated working interest in the oil sands this year. We, along with the operator and other JV partner, are intensely focused on building upon the structural cost improvements and better uptime reliability achieved in 2015.
Finally, we've significantly reduced our conventional exploration CapEx this year to $30 million, down about 90% from last year, following the strategic decision we made last fall to scale back in this space. This year's spend is largely limited to existing commitments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gabon, with no new exploration wells planned in 2016.
As we enter another year with reduced capital investment, we again look to our short cycle U.S. resource plays to continue providing the operational flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions.
With that, I'll turn it over to Lance to review the resource plays in a bit more detail."

I'll continue with the broad overview of the 2016 program for U.S. resource plays on Slide 5. Consistent with our focus on prioritizing the balance sheet this year, our allocation to the resource plays is anticipated at $1 billion, down about 50% from 2015. As Lee said, the short cycle nature of these assets allows us to be flexible in a volatile commodity market. If needed, we have the option to reduce spending down further with substantially all of our acreage held by production in the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and in the SCOOP Woodford. We also have relatively few leases with continuing drilling obligations and no long-term rig commitments in these plays.
The pie charts on the slide depict our operated drilling and completions, our nonoperated drilling and completions and other spend across each basin. Through the budget planning process, our intent was to maximize the allocation to drilling and completions opportunities. The nonoperated drilling and completions component of the budget is our current best estimate of the spend based on recent engagement with partners. In the current commodity environment, we are closely scrutinizing each project proposal for costs and returns. When prudent, we will not consent discretionary projects that do not deliver adequate returns. 
Given the continuing decline in industry rig counts across our 3 basins, the expected bias in the non-operated estimates is lower. For reference, the other spend category broadly consist of diverse, nondiscretionary items for direct support and development activity, such as centralized facilities expansions, data gathering and other items not directly included in drilling and completions costs but essential parts of an operation.
Turning to the Eagle Ford, we are down to 7 rigs, and we'll be scaling down further to 5 rigs near the end of the first quarter. Additionally, we will be racing to a single frac crew for much of the year that will match drilling activity. Consistent with our past practices, we plan to maintain sufficient inventory to keep the completion crew operationally efficient. This activity level retains our execution capability and core competencies, allowing us to continue codeveloping the highest value Austin Chalk, Upper and Lower Eagle Ford horizons across our core acreage position. 
A continued focus on enhancing well productivity through stimulation design and technology application has recently yielded encouraging early results in our high GOR oil areas. As this activity matures, we anticipate sharing more details throughout the year. 
In the Oklahoma resource basins, our capital spend will focus on retaining term leases in the core of the STACK Meramec as we continue to delineate the rich condensate window and optimize stimulation designs. While maintaining leases will be our primary objective across Oklahoma this year, based on the success of our first operated Springer oil well in the fourth quarter in the SCOOP, we will also continue to progress limited Springer activity to delineate the down dip aerial extent of this play.
In the Bakken, we will focus on the base business where we will complete our ongoing water gathering system later this year to further reduce our largest single expense, water handling. Based on the current commodity price environment, we recently released our last operated rig in the Bakken and plan to have intermittent development activity later in the year, primarily to address continuing drilling obligations. With this reduced level of activity and at recent strip pricing, we anticipate Bakken achieves cash flow neutrality in 2016.
The $75 million earmarked for outside operated activity in Bakken is our current best estimate of AFEs we expect to receive from partners this year, and each will be scrutinized closely given the current low commodity environment.
Despite reduced resource play activity, we continue to balance our current actions with the need to be responsive when more constructive pricing occurs.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mitch to review capital activities outside the resource plays."

Starting with our OSM",445,"Thank you, Lance. Referring to Slide 6, I'll provide a brief overview of 2016 activities across our remaining portfolio, where we continue to moderate capital spend, while delivering profitable long cycle projects during the year. 
Starting with our OSM segment. We've achieved a step-change reduction in sustaining capital levels, and our 2016 CapEx at about $40 million is well below historical averages. Along with the operator and other JV partner, our focus remains on maintaining the improved reliability, while lowering operating and sustaining capital costs to reposition the business for profitable operation within the current environment. Despite challenging pricing in the third and fourth quarters last year, OSM was cash flow positive, thanks to operating cost that averaged less than $30 per barrel of synthetic crude oil for the 2 consecutive quarters. 
With the more consistent operations, our 3 highest net production quarters in the history of the operation occurred last year, leading to 2015 annual production volumes net of royalty at an all-time high, while unplanned downtime was at an all-time low.
Outside of OSM, we expect to complete 3 long cycle projects in 2016, bringing incremental cash flow starting in the second half of the year. Beginning with our operated business in EG, we completed a successful and incident free installation campaign of the combined 10,000-ton jacket and topsides for the Alba B3 compression project in mid-January. The project remains on budget and on schedule. Following hook-up and commissioning activities, we expect a midyear startup of the new facility. The installation will add 72,000 horsepower of compression and associated process equipment and utilities, which allow us to significantly extend Alba Field life to beyond 2030 with minimal future capital requirements.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect startup of the outside operated Gunflint, 2 well subsea development also by midyear.
Finally, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, developments are progressing within the Atrush and Sarsang outside operated blocks. In the Atrush block, installations of the Phase 1 30,000-barrel per day facility is progressing with first oil expected later this year. 4 existing wells will feed the facility and future development decisions will be evaluated following the assessment from well and reservoir performance.
In late 2015, a second well and wellsite production facility were brought online in the Sarsang block. 2016 activity is focused on bringing additional wells online to utilize existing facility capacity, while further expansion will be evaluated in light of the current macro environment.
Across the portfolio, we continue to focus on cost management and delivering high operational availability in an effort to defend margins within the challenging commodity price environment.
With that brief summary, I'll pass it back to Lee."

Capital discipline and balance sheet protection have driven the decision supporting our reduced 2016 capital program and slide 7 provides our production guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we're forecasting total company production in 2016 to decline 6% to 8% from 2015, adjusted for our divestitures in the Gulf of Mexico and East Texas, North Louisiana.
For the first quarter 2016, our total E&P guidance includes 2 extraordinary downtime events. First, we expect downtime in EG of approximately 20,000 net BOE per day associated with the installation of the jacket and topsides for the Alba compression project as well as planned maintenance. Installation was completed in January in the Alba Field and on-shore plants returned to full production earlier this month.
Second, late December, the Brae off insulation experienced a process pipe failure, and first quarter total E&P production guidance includes the impact of the approximately 7,000 net BOE per day of U.K. production that remains shut-in while repairs are underway. Resumption of full production is expected in the second quarter.
Wrapping up on slide 8. We anticipate 2016 will require a similar level of flexibility to adapt to the uncertain macro environment as with last year. In 2015, we lowered production in G&A expenses over $435 million; we reduced our workforce by over 20%, which will generate about $160 million of annualized net savings; and we decreased our quarterly dividend, increasing annual free cash flow by more than $425 million. We became even more efficient operators in each of our basins, decreasing completed well costs everywhere through a combination of commercial savings and execution efficiencies.
2016 will require that same level of focus and discipline, and our $1.4 billion capital program is designed with balance sheet protection as our top priority. The plan continues to direct the lion's share of capital to our short cycle resource plays, which provide the most flexibility. The remainder of the portfolio includes completing long cycle projects that contribute production volumes to the company as well as keeping committed capital obligations to a minimal level.
We will continue lowering our cost structure, enhancing operational productivity and progressing toward our newly revised noncore asset sales target of $750 million to $1 billion.
Finally, our $4.2 billion in liquidity at year end, which includes $1.2 billion in cash in an undrawn $3 billion revolving credit facility, positions us well for the reality of sustained low commodity prices.
That concludes our remarks, and I will now hand back to Chris."

I think we demonstrated last year our, certainly, our willingness to use every lever available to us to ensure that we do in fact protect the balance sheet. I ticked through a few of those in my opening remarks, but the adjustment to the dividend, I think even the reduction in our capital budget last year of about $500 million, the strong steps that we took early in the cycle on both production expenses and G&A costs, including a basically a 700 reduction in our workforce, all of these, I think, are demonstrative of the actions that we are prepared to take to ensure that we are putting balance sheet protection first and foremost.

First, maybe I'll just acknowledge that the market no doubt has softened since we embarked on our noncore asset program. There's no question that the sales market is much more challenging than it was even last year. But I'll go back and say, as a reminder, when we initially set our noncore asset target last year, we stated that we had identified a pretty broad pool of noncore assets that were well in excess of that original $500 million. And what I'll say is, based on our progress to date, the transactions that we've been able to complete and the quality as well as the diversity of the identified noncore assets that we still have in the hopper, we're comfortable increasing that target to that $750 million to $1 billion. The way I would kind of describe the asset add is that they're primarily U.S. upstream and midstream.

Getting a little depressing about recession risks, they are clearly rising, we'll see if one actually occurs. But you'll end up with, say, $1.2 billion or maybe whatever the number is at the end of the year, depending on the asset sales program and the reduction in capital.

But as we have looked ahead to 2017, there's no question, Ed, that the majority of our capital will still be directed to the short cycle investments. And as such, that still gives us a great deal of flexibility within our capital program and our capital spend. That activity, though, is going to largely depend upon where commodity prices are. And just to maybe level set a little bit, at the kind of current contango in the strip, that would equate to us to about $500 million of incremental free cash flow in 2017. And then at that point, as incremental cash flow might be realized, it would be capital allocation decision based on the highest and best use as to whether that goes to balance sheet strengthening or and/or into organic investment. I don't see those 2 as necessarily being mutually exclusive. The other thing that I would add, too, is that although we do have some long cycle projects, that Mitch addressed, rolling off in 2016, we do have a little bit of an offset and that we do have a remaining Deepwater GOM commitment, recommitment that will come back to us in 2017.

So historically, I've always tried to focus on liquidity when you're at the bottom of the cycle. And again, historically, that was the way it was measured, is whether or not you have enough liquidity to get you through the bottom of the cycle. As Lee indicated in his remarks, our goal here in 2016 is free cash flow neutrality. So to be able to manage the outspend with the success in the noncore asset sale program and not add debt to the balance sheet. And as I indicated, we're going to maintain ample liquidity to support the business. And in addition, I want to make sure in not only liquidity but the cash component of that liquidity to maintain the option associated with just delevering the balance sheet in late '17 when we have a relatively modest amount of debt that becomes due, about $700 million. So clearly, I think we've said multiple times, the noncore asset sale program and the flexibility of the capital program are really going to be the key levers on that. But one thing I do want to go to on this issue of leverage metrics and what really highlight what Lee said before, just the embedded oil price leverage and the impact to cash flows and candidly the leverage metrics is significant. And Lee just said if just assuming the forward contango that exists today, so whatever that is from a current standpoint, probably about $7, sometime around there, is about $500 million of free cash flow and a significant step change in what your leverage would be on a net debt-to-EBITDA standpoint. So to me, we're focused on managing through the cycle and again, as I indicated to Evan, really just trying to make decisions that are in the best interest of the business."

This is Lance. I think you should think about those acres that we're constantly looking particularly in Oklahoma, which is early cycle in the play relative to the others to vote, as you describe, core op that position and just secure additional resources. And we are very successful over the last year primarily, organically, through a small local auction processes in the BIA and the CLO and other organization as well as just doing small leasing opportunities with peers and accumulated 14,000 acres in Oklahoma, the overwhelming majority of that is in the STACK play focused in the core, primarily Blaine County. What we found over the balance of that year is that the core of the Meramec has shifted western, in the western direction, which is where most of that acreage was acquired and we managed to secure all that for about $3,000 an acre, which is very competitive. Referencing where we would go in terms of activity and allocate that capital, I think we're always going to take that broadly within our overall capital allocation process. We certainly want to be able to continue to delineate Oklahoma because we have more to learn there perhaps than other basins. I think we're going to have to wait and see how the commodity market really evolves before we can make those capital allocations beyond 2016."

And as you described, we've looked at a number of scenarios across the resource plays for activity in that and they all have their own implicit declines depending on the new wells coming to sales. I think, individually, in each of the basins, we have a lot of confidence and understanding of the decline profiles of the areas. And so it just becomes a matter of what's the capital we're going to allocate to it, and then the production is the outcome from it in this case. I think it's pretty clear that we've taken the activity down both in 2015 and 2016. There have to be decline in there. I think importantly, in the Eagle Ford, for example from Q3 to Q4, we held flat with effectively flat wells to sales, which indicates all the horizons we've been developing there are producing well and meet our expectations. And then I think you should think of the resource plays from annual '15 to annual '16 are going to have an overall decline in the low teens."

And what we found are 2 different distinct areas where it's been tested today. It's sort of a northern core and a southern core. The well -- the newbie well we drilled and brought online last quarter was in that southern core area, where there's probably the most data. We expected that to be oil biased in that area. I think we had a lot of confidence going in, the results so far had borne that out. The performance from that well has been very strong to begin with and it actually is similar to the underlying Woodford, elevated reservoir pressure, the accumulative 30, 60 day production tend to be relatively flat. That same production behavior has been borne out in the Springer thus far. So it's actually very consistent with our expectations, that's why we're excited about it. What we also see is the opportunity to delineate this play down dip from the core oil areas that we explored and others have looked at today into a rich condensate window, perhaps. So you'll see us continue to test that in a limited way, the Springer, across 2016."

I'd like to extend my welcome to those listening.

Our $1.4 billion program in",674,"Thanks, Chris. I'd like to extend my welcome to those listening. Last night, we announced a reduced capital program for 2016 that reflects the current challenging environment and our clear objective of balance sheet protection. Our $1.4 billion program in 2016 is over 50% lower than last year's program and 75% lower than 2014.
As the chart illustrates, we have responded as oil prices have fallen dramatically, and are doing the same in 2016 with our capital program calibrated to a view of WTI in the upper 30s and assume success in our noncore asset sale program.
Our business planning and budgeting are not static but rather, decisions are being made in real time, in large part facilitated by the optionality afforded by our short-cycle investments. We have designed our 2016 programs to maximize capital allocation to the short-cycle investments in our U.S. resource plays, complete long-cycle projects that contribute production and minimize allocation to conventional exploration. Guided by these principles as the foundation of our plan, production volumes were, by design and outcome, not an objective, and we are forecasting a total company production decline of 6% to 8% year-over-year adjusted for divestitures.
This program provides us the optionality to further adjust our short-cycle investments if needed based on commodity prices and the outcome of our noncore asset sales.
Last year, we achieved over $300 million of noncore asset sales toward our original goal of at least $500 million. When we set that original target, we were transparent that the noncore assets under consideration far exceeded $500 million. Based on the transactions announced today as well as progress on the remaining assets, we've increased our target to a range of $750 million to $1 billion. This year's capital allocation is designed to position the company for a sustained period of low commodity prices while maintaining the capability to be flexible in a dynamic environment.
Slide 4 illustrates the allocation of our 2016 program in a bit more detail. As I mentioned, the majority of our 2016 program, about 70%, will be directed to the Eagle Ford, SCOOP STACK and Bakken. For each of our 3 core resource plays, we have set specific objectives for our 2016 investment. Namely, maintaining the efficiencies our Eagle Ford team has worked so hard to capture; protecting our leasehold in the STACK while continuing to improve our understanding of the Oklahoma Resource Basins; and focusing on our base business in the Bakken with operated D&C greatly reduced. All of this, of course, while continuing to focus on sustainable cost reduction that will be maintained through the commodity cycle. Across the remainder of the portfolio, we will be completing several long-cycle projects in 2016. Most notably, our operated compression project in EG. This project will extend plateau production from the Alba Field by an additional 2 years and allow us to develop in excess of $130 million net oil equivalent barrels of proven reserves.
In addition to the EG compression project, we expect first oil this year from investments in 2 outside operated projects: Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico and Atrush in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We're forecasting about $40 million of sustaining CapEx toward our nonoperated working interest in the oil sands this year. We, along with the operator and other JV partner, are intensely focused on building upon the structural cost improvements and better uptime reliability achieved in 2015.
Finally, we've significantly reduced our conventional exploration CapEx this year to $30 million, down about 90% from last year, following the strategic decision we made last fall to scale back in this space. This year's spend is largely limited to existing commitments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gabon, with no new exploration wells planned in 2016.
As we enter another year with reduced capital investment, we again look to our short cycle U.S. resource plays to continue providing the operational flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions.
With that, I'll turn it over to Lance to review the resource plays in a bit more detail."

If needed, we have the option to reduce spending down further with substantially all of our acreage held by production in the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and in the SCOOP Woodford. We also have relatively few leases with continuing drilling obligations and no long-term rig commitments in these plays.
The pie charts on the slide depict our operated drilling and completions, our nonoperated drilling and completions and other spend across each basin. Through the budget planning process, our intent was to maximize the allocation to drilling and completions opportunities. The nonoperated drilling and completions component of the budget is our current best estimate of the spend based on recent engagement with partners. In the current commodity environment, we are closely scrutinizing each project proposal for costs and returns. When prudent, we will non-consent discretionary projects that do not deliver adequate returns. 
Given the continuing decline in industry rig counts across our 3 basins, the expected bias in the nonoperated estimates is lower. For reference, the other spend category broadly consist of diverse, nondiscretionary items for direct support and development activity, such as centralized facilities expansions, data gathering and other items not directly included in drilling and completions costs but essential parts of an operation.
Turning to the Eagle Ford, we are down to 7 rigs, and we'll be scaling down further to 5 rigs near the end of the first quarter. Additionally, we will be reducing to a single frac crew for much of the year that will match drilling activity. Consistent with our past practices, we plan to maintain sufficient inventory to keep the completion crew operationally efficient. This activity level retains our execution capability and core competencies, allowing us to continue codeveloping the highest value Austin Chalk, Upper and Lower Eagle Ford horizons across our core acreage position. 
A continued focus on enhancing well productivity through stimulation design and technology application has recently yielded encouraging early results in our high GOR oil areas. As this activity matures, we anticipate sharing more details throughout the year. 
In the Oklahoma resource basins, our capital spend will focus on retaining term leases in the core of the STACK Meramec as we continue to delineate the rich condensate window and optimize stimulation designs. While maintaining leases will be our primary objective across Oklahoma this year, based on the success of our first operated Springer oil well in the fourth quarter in the SCOOP, we will also continue to progress limited Springer activity to delineate the down dip aerial extent of this play.
In the Bakken, we will focus on the base business where we will complete our ongoing water gathering system later this year to further reduce our largest single expense, water handling. Based on the current commodity price environment, we recently released our last operated rig in the Bakken and plan to have intermittent development activity later in the year, primarily to address continuing drilling obligations. With this reduced level of activity and at recent strip pricing, we anticipate Bakken achieves cash flow neutrality in 2016.
The $75 million earmarked for outside operated activity in Bakken is our current best estimate of AFEs we expect to receive from partners this year, and each will be scrutinized closely given the current low commodity environment.
Despite reduced resource play activity, we continue to balance our current actions with the need to be responsive when more constructive pricing occurs.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mitch to review capital activities outside the resource plays."

Referring to Slide 6, I'll provide a brief overview of 2016 activities across our remaining portfolio, where we continue to moderate capital spend, while delivering profitable long-cycle projects during the year. Starting with our OSM",444,"Thank you, Lance. Referring to Slide 6, I'll provide a brief overview of 2016 activities across our remaining portfolio, where we continue to moderate capital spend, while delivering profitable long-cycle projects during the year. 
Starting with our OSM segment. We've achieved a step-change reduction in sustaining capital levels, and our 2016 CapEx at about $40 million is well below historical averages. Along with the operator and other JV partner, our focus remains on maintaining the improved reliability, while lowering operating and sustaining capital costs to reposition the business for profitable operation within the current environment. Despite challenging pricing in the third and fourth quarters last year, OSM was cash flow positive, thanks to operating costs that averaged less than $30 per barrel of synthetic crude oil for the 2 consecutive quarters. 
With the more consistent operations, our 3 highest net production quarters in the history of the operation occurred last year, leading to 2015 annual production volumes net of royalty at an all-time high, while unplanned downtime was at an all-time low.
Outside of OSM, we expect to complete 3 long cycle projects in 2016, bringing incremental cash flow starting in the second half of the year. Beginning with our operated business in EG, we completed a successful and incident free installation campaign of the combined 10,000-ton jacket and topsides for the Alba B3 compression project in mid-January. The project remains on budget and on schedule. Following hook-up and commissioning activities, we expect a midyear startup of the new facility. The installation will add 72,000 horsepower of compression and associated process equipment and utilities, which allow us to significantly extend Alba Field life to beyond 2030 with minimal future capital requirements.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect startup of the outside operated Gunflint 2 well subsea development also by midyear.
Finally, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, developments are progressing within the Atrush and Sarsang outside operated blocks. In the Atrush block, installations of the Phase 1 30,000-barrel per day facility is progressing with first oil expected later this year. 4 existing wells will feed the facility and future development decisions will be evaluated following the assessment from well and reservoir performance.
In late 2015, a second well and wellsite production facility were brought online in the Sarsang block. 2016 activity is focused on bringing additional wells online to utilize existing facility capacity, while further expansion will be evaluated in light of the current macro environment.
Across the portfolio, we continue to focus on cost management and delivering high operational availability in an effort to defend margins within the challenging commodity price environment.
With that brief summary, I'll pass it back to Lee."

Capital discipline and balance sheet protection have driven the decision supporting our reduced 2016 capital program, and Slide 7 provides our production guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we're forecasting total company",416,"All right. Well, thank you, Mitch. Capital discipline and balance sheet protection have driven the decision supporting our reduced 2016 capital program, and Slide 7 provides our production guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we're forecasting total company production in 2016 to decline 6% to 8% from 2015, adjusted for our divestitures in the Gulf of Mexico and East Texas/North Louisiana.
For the first quarter 2016, our total E&P guidance includes 2 extraordinary downtime events. First, we expect downtime in EG of approximately 20,000 net BOE per day associated with the installation of the jacket and topsides for the Alba compression project as well as planned maintenance. Installation was completed in January in the Alba Field and onshore plants returned to full production earlier this month.
Second, late December, the Brae off insulation experienced a process pipe failure, and first quarter total E&P production guidance includes the impact of the approximately 7,000 net BOE per day of U.K. production that remains shut-in while repairs are under way. Resumption of full production is expected in the second quarter.
Wrapping up on Slide 8. We anticipate 2016 will require a similar level of flexibility to adapt to the uncertain macro environment, as did last year. In 2015, we lowered production in G&A expenses over $435 million; we reduced our workforce by over 20%, which will generate about $160 million of annualized net savings; and we decreased our quarterly dividend, increasing annual free cash flow by more than $425 million. We became even more efficient operators in each of our basins, decreasing completed well costs everywhere through a combination of commercial savings and execution efficiencies.
2016 will require that same level of focus and discipline, and our $1.4 billion capital program is designed with balance sheet protection as our top priority. The plan continues to direct the lion's share of capital to our short-cycle resource plays, which provide the most flexibility. The remainder of the portfolio includes completing long-cycle projects that contribute production volumes to the company as well as keeping committed capital obligations to a minimal level.
We will continue lowering our cost structure, enhancing operational productivity and progressing toward our newly revised noncore asset sales target of $750 million to $1 billion.
Finally, our $4.2 billion in liquidity at year end, which includes $1.2 billion in cash and an undrawn $3 billion revolving credit facility, positions us well for the reality of sustained low commodity prices.
That concludes our remarks, and I will now hand back to Chris."

There's no question that the sales market is much more challenging than it was even last year. But I'll go back and say, as a reminder, when we initially set our noncore asset target last year, we stated that we had identified a pretty broad pool of noncore assets that were well in excess of that original $500 million. And what I'll say is, based on our progress to date, the transactions that we've been able to complete and the quality as well as the diversity of the identified noncore assets that we still have in the hopper, we're comfortable increasing that target to that $750 million to $1 billion. The way I would kind of describe the asset, Ed, is that they're primarily U.S. upstream and midstream. They're both operated and nonoperated, but the list is very diverse and we are very satisfied taking some singles and doubles. Some will be bigger, but there's quite a few that will be smaller. And thus far, the market has shown an ability to digest some of those smaller transactions quite readily.

And just to maybe level set a little bit, at the kind of current contango in the strip, that would equate to us to about $500 million of incremental free cash flow in 2017. And then at that point, as incremental cash flow might be realized, it would be capital allocation decision based on the highest and best use as to whether that goes to balance sheet strengthening or and/or into organic investment. I don't see those 2 as necessarily being mutually exclusive. The other thing that I would add, too, is that although we do have some long-cycle projects, that Mitch addressed, rolling off in 2016, we do have a little bit of an offset and that we do have a remaining Deepwater GOM commitment, recommitment that will come back to us in 2017.

As Lee indicated in his remarks, our goal here in 2016 is free cash flow neutrality. So to be able to manage the outspend with the success in the noncore asset sale program and not add debt to the balance sheet. And as I indicated, we're going to maintain ample liquidity to support the business. And in addition, I want to make sure in not only liquidity but the cash component of that liquidity to maintain the option associated with just delevering the balance sheet in late '17 when we have a relatively modest amount of debt that becomes due, about $700 million. So clearly, I think we've said multiple times, the noncore asset sale program and the flexibility of the capital program are really going to be the key levers on that. But one thing I do want to go to on this issue of leverage metrics and what to really highlight what Lee said before, just the embedded oil price leverage and the impact to cash flows and candidly the leverage metrics is significant. And Lee just said if just assuming the forward contango that exists today, so whatever that is from a current standpoint, probably about $7, sometime around there, is about $500 million of free cash flow and a significant step change in what your leverage would be on a net debt-to-EBITDA standpoint. So to me, we're focused on managing through the cycle and again, as I indicated to Evan, really just trying to make decisions that are in the best interest of the business."

And we are very successful over the last year, primarily organically, through a small local auction processes in the BIA and the CLO and other organization as well as just doing small leasing opportunities with peers and accumulated 14,000 acres in Oklahoma. The overwhelming majority of that is in the STACK play focused in the core, primarily Blaine County. What we found over the balance of that year is that the core of the Meramec has shifted western, in the western direction, which is where most of that acreage was acquired and we managed to secure all that for about $3,000 an acre, which is very competitive. Referencing where we would go in terms of activity and allocate that capital, I think we're always going to take that broadly within our overall capital allocation process. We certainly want to be able to continue to delineate Oklahoma because we have more to learn there perhaps than other basins. I think we're going to have to wait and see how the commodity market really evolves before we can make those capital allocations beyond 2016."

To the extent you raise additional capital from your noncore asset sales or other means, how do you think about deploying that? I mean, is it more about maximizing liquidity right now? Or when you look at where your bonds are trading, you've got some bonds particularly out the curve trading at a pretty chunky discount to par. So do you think there are some opportunities to maybe reduce debt that way, and take advantage of the discount clearly in the market?"

I mean, I would approach that the same way Lance was talking about whether we'd allocate capital to Oklahoma to buy acreage. It really is each one of these investment opportunities are measured against themselves, whether it's drill-bit capital, whether it's acquiring additional acres in Oklahoma or whether it's even considering buying back some debt at a discount. So we're going to measure all of those capital allocation decisions and determine which ones make the best sense for the enterprise. Clearly, you've got to do that, you've got to do that thoughtfully. That's a great example in response to some of the earlier questions where that might be in the best interest of the company, rating agencies may view that transaction differently in terms of the way an investment-grade company should manage their business with the fundamental premise is that your debtholders be paid off at par.

And so you'll see us go down to that level and then maintain that activity level moving forward. And from quarter-to-quarter, you'll see those net wells to sales moderate up or down a little bit as we have diverse working interest across it, but it will be relatively level from that point forward. Similarly, we're going to continue to run effectively the 2 rigs we had all in 2015 through Oklahoma to manage lease obligations, and continue to delineate and learn in the Springer, the things we need to.

I think it's pretty clear that we've taken the activity down both in 2015 and 2016. There have to be decline in there. I think importantly, in the Eagle Ford, for example from Q3 to Q4, we held flat with effectively flat wells to sales, which indicates all the horizons we've been developing there are producing well and meet our expectations.

The well -- the newbie well we drilled and brought online last quarter was in that southern core area, where there's probably the most data. We expected that to be oil biased in that area. I think we had a lot of confidence going in, the results so far have borne that out. The performance from that well has been very strong to begin with and it actually is similar to the underlying Woodford, elevated reservoir pressure, the cumulative 30, 60 day production tend to be relatively flat. That same production behavior has been borne out in the Springer thus far. So it's actually very consistent with our expectations, that's why we're excited about it. What we also see is the opportunity to delineate this play down dip from the core oil areas that we explored and others have looked at today into a rich condensate window, perhaps.

I'd like to take a few moments here to just offer some opening comments before we start taking your questions. Our first quarter results highlight our continued focus on resetting our cost structure across all",633,"Thanks, Chris. Let me add my good morning. I'd like to take a few moments here to just offer some opening comments before we start taking your questions. 
Our first quarter results highlight our continued focus on resetting our cost structure across all elements of our business, reducing our capital program consistent with our plan and delivering production at the upper end of our guidance. Our capital program remains squarely focused on maximizing allocation to our lower risk, higher return U.S. resource play. 
In the Eagle Ford, we continue to see well performance uplift from tighter state spacing in our high, GOR oil wells while driving completed well cost down by about $2 million last year. 
In the Bakken, we released our remaining rig but base production outperformed our expectations supported by 2015 enhanced well completions all while decreasing production expense for oil equivalent barrel 35% year-over-year. 
And in Oklahoma, we progressed our operated drilling program for leasehold protection and delineation. 
Outside the U.S., the jacket and topsides for the EG compression project were successfully installed ahead of schedule and we remain on track for first production midyear. At OSM, the asset continued to perform well on both the cost and reliability fronts. On that subject, our thoughts go out to Fortenberry community today where wildfires continue to take their toll. Though not currently threatened, operations at the Muscag [ph] river and Jack Pine [ph] mines had been temporarily suspended to support emergency respond efforts. 
This year, we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet, first through the equity offering; and second, through the successful execution of our noncore asset sales program. In April we announced $950 [ph] million worth of noncore asset sales, bringing our total since last summer to $1.3 billion, far exceeding our target and delivering on this commitment early in the year.
With this success, we are on track to achieve our 2016 objective to live within our means inclusive of noncore asset sales. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter. Total company E&P production will be higher with EG and the U.K. Brayfill [ph] back online. We'll bring on twice the number of wells to sales in Oklahoma, 4 in the stack, 3 in the scoop and all in extended laterals. We'll have additional results from completion enhancements in the Eagle Ford, though at a reduced pace. And at the Bakken, we'll have our Clark's Creek pad online in West Myrmidon. 
Everything we've been doing for the last 18 months, lowering costs, workforce reductions, strengthening the balance sheet and executing noncore asset sales has been designed to provide us the flexibility to respond when we see constructive commodity prices and to derisk our business planning through 2017 in what remains an uncertain commodity price environment. 
While some positive trends are occurring, we're not yet confident that global supply and demand fundamentals are not supportive of sustained higher oil prices and we expect volatility to continue. As we strengthening to $50 and above, we are well-positioned to consider increasing activity levels. 
Having quality resource, execution capability and a strong balance sheet puts us in a favorable position beyond our front foot when the time comes. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize Chris Phillips who will retire at the end of the month. Chris joined Marathon Oil in 1984 to help build the North Bray [ph] platform in the U.K. and has served in various roles within the company since, including the last 8 years in Investor Relations. My thanks to Chris for all of his contributions and we wish him all the best in his retirement. And Chris is leaving our IR team in good hands, so please contact Zach Dailey going forward for all IR related matters. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

And then finally, our nonoperated participation in the Atrush [ph] project in the Kurdistan region. So those 3 projects will essentially run their course from a capital program standpoint this year and would not be recurring in 2017. So as you state, that does give us some flexibility. If you think about our 2016 capital program, we have -- of the $1.4 billion budget that we've talked about, about $1 billion of that, of course, is targeting the U.S. resource play, the short cycle investments, and about $400 million is targeting the rest of the portfolio, of which those 3 long cycle projects are a material component of that $400 million. We do still have some commitments in the exploration space, commission exploration space, that will have potentially an offset to that. But largely speaking, those projects will come out and provide us a good deal more flexibility in 2017."

So starting with the EURs, I think the group of wells we released this quarter is really a follow on from the group from the previous quarter. So we've seen consistently that tighter stage spacing, in some cases tighter cluster spacing is also driving well productivity. Most of that activity has been focused in the oil areas as we've looked to try to upgrade or improve the returns in our best acreage as well as lift some of our other acreage up to the highest year of returns, so we started on that, reflecting that if you recall about 60% of our future inventory is in that high GOR oil window. We've also had the opportunity now to move that stage spacing down in the condensate window. And although it's early we're encouraged from the response from the wells. You'll see us continue that. And I think what we'll find is as those wells mature, and speaking out the oil wells over the next months and this year, we expect the EURs to rise. We haven't reflected that yet because the production history is just too immature. But on the consistent response for that, I think its important to note that we effectively move that stage base into the basis of all our oil well completions and continuing to attest even down to 150-foot spacing today. And then on top of the capital, I think, the capital reflects really the focus in the team. They're continuing to drill the wells faster, and be efficient and focused on that. they're continuing to stimulate the wells faster. We average more than 200 stages per month from our primary frac crew in the first quarter, which is the most efficient we've ever been with that equipment set. And so those efficiencies that come to the bottom line helping to drive those cost down even as we spend more and invest more in the completions.

As such, even though I think we have been successful in completing the sales against our published target, you should not deem that as us being finished or complete from a noncore asset standpoint. Yes, we're not putting out a new target. But certainly, the continued optimization of our portfolio is just part of what we want to be doing going forward. It's -- when we began that process, we had identified a population of noncore assets that we considered, did they compete for capital allocation? Could they potentially have higher-value in someone else's portfolio? That population, even on a risk-adjusted basis, allowed us to have confidence in putting that target, first target out there of $500 million and then ultimately, increasing that target to the $750 million, $1 billion mark. So I think what we've seen is that for these quality assets and a great example would be Wyoming, there is still a strong market out there that's willing to compete and pay very strong value for that type of asset. And again, it comes down to matching up very specific assets to very specific buyer pools. And I think that's what created our success this year."

I think you wouldn't be surprised if we articulated that, that target window has evolved over time to be a specific interval from a wider interval. And there would be positive tension on the size of that target versus how fast you can actually drill a well. The team has gotten very consistent and been able to be focused in that target and still deliver the well at a very high efficiency within that. Part of that is repetition. They've had a lot of expense in the basin, a lot of practice if you will. And so they've gotten very effective at it. And we've been consistently in the mid-90% in terms of landing a target over time. I think when we look at it is we made the target smaller over the last quarters and years and they still been able to within that even as they increase the efficiency, which really speaks to the collaboration between the geosciences and the drilling engineering, that collaborative effort to work together to deliver those great results. If we expect to continue to be able to deliver those results consistently even if the efficiency will still drive upwards."

This year we're going to go from 6 operated wells historically in all of the last 2 years in STACK to almost triple that, which will give us a much larger operated data set. Importantly, within that, over half of those wells are excess, which gives us a chance to see long lateral performance as well as short laterals we've had historically in those wells are very much positioned in the core of the play, the highest value part of the STACK to drive results. Similarly in the SCOOP, although we're not entirely held by production, we certainly have more flexibility this year. And so all of our wells will be longer lateral, 1.5 mile plus laterals, and a give us a chance to does that value of that longer lateral.

And I think Lance and I both addressed that we've been very thoughtful in our approach there to ensure that we preserve the internal capabilities and capacities needed to get back into growth mode when we do get that constructive pricing. And we've done that through redeployment to everything from a special projects to field leadership roles to displacement of contractors, so that we do retain those essential skill sets that will be required when we get back into a growth mode. Externally, it's a little bit more complicated in that the service sector has been a bit decimated at least on the labor side from this correction. I do think what will modulate some of that is just many companies will still be in either balance sheet repair or just simply not have the cash flows or the wherewithal to get back on the very fast trend. So I do think the ramp will be self moderated in some ways once we get on it. But I think maintaining those strong relationships with our key service providers, which we have been able to do during the downturn, that's very important. And we're going to leverage those relationships when the kind of -- the bell rings again to get back into growth mode."

When we talk about kind of getting into the maintenance capital and getting back on a growth mode. You really have to talk about it from a common starting point, where are you starting that discussion? So if I kind of fast-forward to the end of this year based on our current plan, and I look at where my resource plays will be exiting at the end of this year, and I think about what type of capital program will not only flatten, but will actually start growing sequentially in 2017. Based on what we know today and again this is not budget outlook, we would probably place that capital program in the resource play in the $1.3 [ph] billion to $1.4 billion. And again, that's not just getting it back to flat, that's actually starting sequential growth again in 2017. So that's kind of a ballpark number. It's one that I think will continue to improve as we, I mean, Lance did a great job describing some of the secular efficiencies we're already creating in the business. The Eagle Ford is a great example of that because we're operating at scale there. And as we take those efficiencies forward, we expect that, that number will even have some downward and construction pressure on it."

This is Lance, I'm happy to address that. I'm pleased that you've noticed that actually. The Bakken seems to have done an effective job of managing that production base over the last year at lower and lower activity. One of the key things is when we have lower activity they've been very focused on the base business, the production efficiency or uptime is really rising, and that's been a focus of theirs, not just the last year but last couple of years and they really improved there. And I think probably more important in that in driving that flattening decline profile you see is that we've made a material shift in our completion practices over the last 1.5 year. And the wells from 2015 are among the best we've ever developed and put online. And the declines from those continue to flattened and so that group is a big part of driving that profile. Those completion practices with more fluid volume, higher density proppant loading, more stages, have all been beneficial and we continue that. I think I certainly sit today lower activity we have less opportunity to demonstrate that. But we look forward to the future There's enormous commodity price leverage in the Bakken and we'll get back to activity we expect to be able to deliver better wells in the future than we have in the past just building on that. I think we've looked forward to say in the second quarter earnings we've been able to talk about the results from the Clark's Creek and West Myrmidon where we'll pump -- what we view as our most sophisticated, most aggressive stimulations today than the Bakken and we expect those results to be compelling."

As we think about that kind of notional budget out in 2017 in the resource plays, the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion we talked about, that's -- that type of spend in 2017 would likely see us ramping into a rig activity that would probably be close to double where we are today. And so we absolutely have the capacity internally and we feel that the vendor and service community could support it as well that, if that scenario did in fact play out and again this is not a 2017 budget discussion.

And needless to say, Chris and Zach has been responding to a lot of questions from folks. And to be honest, first and foremost, I think you were somewhat alluding, its really predominantly driven by the macro conditions in the first quarter being the substantial reductions and realized prices on a fee-and-fee basis, about 25%, and of course, the volumetric implications as well. But when I then just kind of look at the more macro granular lever, there is an item to use the vernacular of some of the reports this morning. The amount of the deferred taxes in the first quarter, the deferred tax benefit in the first quarter, might have been lower as compared to what many people were assuming it to be. And it's really unfortunately, it's really just the methodology we are using for interperiod tax allocation. So how we allocate taxes, we anticipate for the full year, how we allocate them on a quarterly basis. And honestly that, coupled with a couple of nonrecurring items likely accounts, close to $0.07 or $0.08 per share on a cash flow basis. And so I think unfortunately when you're always looking at working cash flow before working capital, you're going to get some anomalies there. We always try of course, for managing total cash flow and look at it on an afterworking capital basis. And when I do that, we did have an additional anomaly in there. we had some nonqualified pension payments that we paid in the first quarter that relates to our [indiscernible] 2015 workforce reduction. And as every company has in the first quarter, we also had the prior years incentive compensation payment. All of those items at together to get us back another, as I said, $0.07 to $0.08 in the aggregate to cash flow per share."

I'd like to take a few moments here to just offer some opening comments before we start taking your questions. 
Our first quarter results highlight our continued focus on resetting our cost structure across all elements of our business, reducing our capital program, consistent with our plan, and delivering production at the upper end of our guidance. Our capital program remains squarely focused on maximizing allocation to our lower-risk, higher-return U.S. resource plays. 
In the Eagle Ford, we continue to see well performance uplift from tighter state spacing in our high GOR oil wells, while driving completed well cost down by about $2 million last year. 
In the Bakken, we released our remaining rig but base production outperformed our expectations, supported by 2015 enhanced well completions, all while decreasing production expense for oil equivalent barrel 35% year-over-year. 
And in Oklahoma, we progressed our operated drilling program for leasehold protection and delineation. 
Outside the U.S., the jacket and topsides for the EG compression project were successfully installed ahead of schedule, and we remain on track for first production midyear. 
At OSM, the asset continued to perform well on both the cost and reliability fronts. On that subject, our thoughts go out to the Fort McMurray community today, where wildfires continue to take their toll. Though not currently threatened, operations at the Muskeg River and Jackpine mines have been temporarily suspended to support emergency respond efforts. 
This year, we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet, first, through the equity offering; and second, through the successful execution of our noncore asset sale program. In April, we announced $950 million worth of noncore asset sales, bringing our total since last summer to $1.3 billion, far exceeding our target and delivering on this commitment early in the year.
With this success, we are on track to achieve our 2016 objective to live within our means, inclusive of noncore asset sales. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, total company E&P production will be higher with EG and the U.K. Brae Field back online. We'll bring on twice the number of wells to sales in Oklahoma: 4 in the STACK, 3 in the SCOOP, and all extended laterals. We'll have additional results from completion enhancements in the Eagle Ford, though at a reduced pace. And in the Bakken, we'll have our Clark's Creek pad online in West Myrmidon. 
Everything we've been doing for the last 18 months, lowering costs, workforce reductions, strengthening the balance sheet and executing noncore asset sales, has been designed to provide us the flexibility to respond when we see constructive commodity prices and to derisk our business plan through 2017 in what remains an uncertain commodity price environment. 
While some positive trends are occurring, we're not yet confident that global supply and demand fundamentals are supportive of sustained higher oil prices, and we expect volatility to continue. As we strengthening to the $50 and above, we are well-positioned to consider increasing activity levels. 
Having quality resource, execution capability and a strong balance sheet puts us in a favorable position beyond our front foot when the time comes. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize Chris Phillips who will retire at the end of the month. Chris joined Marathon Oil in 1984 to help build the North Brae platform in the U.K. and has served in various roles within the company since, including the last 8 years in Investor Relations. My thanks to Chris for all of his contributions, and we wish him all the best in his retirement. And Chris is leaving our IR team in good hands, so please contact Zach Dailey going forward for all IR-related matters. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

And then finally, our nonoperated participation in the Atrush project in the Kurdistan region. So those 3 projects will essentially run their course from a capital program standpoint this year and would not be recurring in 2017. So as you state, that does gives us some flexibility. If you think about our 2016 capital program, we have -- of the $1.4 billion budget that we've talked about, about $1 billion of that, of course, is targeting the U.S. resource plays, the short cycle investments; and about $400 million is targeting the rest of the portfolio. Of which, those 3 long cycle projects are a material component of that $400 million. We do still have some commitments in the exploration space, conventional exploration space, that will have potentially an offset to that.

So starting with the EURs, I think the group of wells we released this quarter is really a follow-on to a group from the previous quarter. So we've seen consistently that tighter stage spacing, in some cases tighter cluster spacing is also driving well productivity. Most of that activity has been focused in the oil areas as we've looked to try to upgrade or improve the returns of our best acreage as well as lift some of our other acreage up to the highest year of returns. So we started on that, reflecting that, if you'll recall, about 60% of our future inventory is in that high GOR oil window. We've also had the opportunity now to move that stage spacing down into the condensate window. And although it's early, we're encouraged with the response from the wells. You'll see us continue that. And I think what we'll find is as those wells mature, speaking out of the oil wells, over the next months and this year, we expect the EURs to rise. We haven't reflected that yet because the production history is just too immature. But on the consistent response for that, I think its important to note that we've effectively moved that stage space into the basis of all our oil well completions and continuing to attest even down to 150-foot stage spacing today. And then on top of the capital, I mean I think the capital reflects, really, the focus in the team. They're continuing to drill the wells faster and be efficient and focus on that. They're continuing to stimulate the wells faster. We average more than 200 stages per month from our primary frac crew in the first quarter, which is the most efficient we've ever been with that equipment set. And so those efficiencies come right to the bottom line and are helping to drive those cost down, even as we spend more, invest more in the completions. And certainly, overall, I think -- I'd say that we're still getting a bit of commercial help. Most of these cost changes recently are driven -- focused by the efficiency drive within the team."

It's -- when we began that process, we had identified a population of noncore assets. Then we considered did they compete for capital allocation? Could they potentially have higher-value in someone else's portfolio? That population, even on a risk-adjusted basis, allowed us to have confidence in putting that target -- first target out there at $500 million. And then ultimately, increasing that target to the $750 million, $1 billion mark. So I think what we've seen is that for these quality assets, and a great example would be Wyoming, there is still a strong market out there that's willing to compete and pay very strong value for that type of asset. And again, it comes down to matching up very specific assets to very specific buyer pools. And I think that's what's created our success this year."

I think you wouldn't be surprised if we, again, articulated that, that target window has evolved over time to be a specific interval from a wider interval. And then there would be positive tension on the size of that target versus how fast you can actually drill a well. The team has gotten very consistent of being able to be focused in that target and still deliver the well at a very high efficiency within that. Part of that is repetition. They've had a lot of expense in the basin, a lot of practice, if you will. And so they've gotten very effective at it. And we've been consistently in the mid-90% in terms of landing a target over time. I think when we looked at it is we made the target smaller over the last quarters and years, and they still been able to within that even as they increase the efficiency, which really speaks to the collaboration between the geosciences and the drilling engineering, that collaborative effort to work together to deliver those great results.

This year, we're going to go from 6 operated wells historically in all of the last 2 years in STACK to almost triple that, which will give us a much larger operated data set. Importantly, within that, over half of those wells are XLs, which gives us a chance to see long lateral performance as well as some of the shorter laterals we've had historically, and those wells are very much positioned in the core of the play, the highest value part of the STACK to drive results. Similarly in the SCOOP, although we're not entirely held by production, we certainly have more flexibility this year. And so all of our wells will be longer laterals, 1.5 mile-plus laterals, and a give us the chance to really test that value of that longer lateral.

It is a question -- when I think about the capacity and execution capacity question, I think of it really in 2 buckets, Paul. One is the internal capacity in competencies. And I think Lance and I have both addressed that. That we've been very thoughtful in our approach there to ensure that we preserve the internal capabilities and capacities needed to get back into growth mode when we do get that constructive pricing. And we've done that through redeployment to everything, from a special projects to field leadership roles to displacement of contractors, so that we do retain those essential skill sets that will be required when we get back into a growth mode. Externally, it's a little bit more complicated, and that the service sector has been a bit decimated, at least on the labor side from this correction. I do think what will modulate some of that is just many companies will still be in either balance sheet repair or will just simply not have the cash flows or the wherewithal to get back on a very fast ramp. So I do think the ramp will be self moderated in some ways once we get on it. But I think maintaining those strong relationships with our key service providers, which we have been able to do during the downturn, that's very important.

When we talk about kind of getting into the maintenance capital and getting back on a growth mode, you really have to talk about it from a common starting point, where are you starting that discussion? So if I kind of fast-forward to the end of this year based on our current plan, and I look at where my resource plays will be exiting at the end of this year, and I think about what type of capital program will not only flatten, but will actually start growing sequentially in 2017. Based on what we know today, and again, this is not budget outlook, we would probably place that capital program in the resource plays in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And again, that's not just getting us back to flat. That's actually starting sequential growth again in 2017. So that's kind of a ballpark number. It's one that I think will continue to improve as we -- I mean, Lance did a great job describing some of the secular efficiencies that we're already creating in the business. The Eagle Ford is a great example of that because we're operating at scale there. And as we take those efficiencies forward, we expect that, that number will even have some downward and constructive pressure on it."

This is Lance, I'm happy to address that. I'm pleased that you've noticed that actually. The Bakken seems to have done a really effective job of managing that production base over the last year at lower and lower activity. One of the key things is, is we had lower activity and they've been very focused on the base business. The production efficiency or uptime is really rising. And that's been a focus of theirs, and not just the last year, but last couple of years, and they've really improved there. And I think probably more important than that in driving that flattening decline profile you see is that we've made a material shift in our completion practices over the last 1.5 year. And the wells from 2015 are among the best we've ever developed and put online. And the declines from those continue to flattened and so that group is a big part of driving that flatter profile. Those completion practices with more fluid volume, higher density proppant loading, more stages, have all been beneficial, and we continue that. I think we're -- I've certainly said today, at lower activity, we have less opportunity to demonstrate that. But we look forward to the future There's enormous commodity price leverage in the Bakken, and when we get back to activity there, we expect to be able to deliver even better wells in the future than we have in the past, just building on that. And I think we even look forward to say in the second quarter earnings and being able to talk about the results from the Clark's Creek pad in West Myrmidon, where we'll have pumped our -- what we view is our most sophisticated, most aggressive stimulations to date in the Bakken, and we expect those results to be compelling."

As we think about that kind of notional budget out in 2017 in the resource plays, that $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion we talked about, that's -- that type of spend in 2017 would likely see us ramping into a rig activity that would probably be close to double of where we are today. And so we absolutely have the capacity internally, and we feel that the vendor and service community could support it as well.

And needless to say, Chris and Zach had been responding to a lot of questions from folks. And to be honest, first and foremost, I think you were somewhat alluding to, it's really predominantly driven by the macro conditions in the first quarter being the substantial reduction and realized prices on a fee-and-fee basis, about 25%, and of course, the volumetric implications as well. But when I then kind of just look at the -- more of the micro granular lever, there is an item to use the vernacular of some of the reports this morning, the amount of the deferred taxes in the first quarter, the deferred tax benefit in the first quarter, might have been lower as compared to what many people were assuming it to be. And it's really -- unfortunately, it's really just the methodology we are using for interperiod tax allocation. So how we allocate taxes we anticipate for the full year, how we allocate them on a quarterly basis. And honestly, that, coupled with a couple of nonrecurring items, likely accounts for close to $0.07 or $0.08 per share on a cash flow basis. And so I think -- unfortunately, when you're always looking at working cash flow before working capital, you're going to get some anomalies there. We always try, of course. We're managing total cash flow, and look at it on an after-working capital basis. And when I do that, we did have an additional anomaly in there. We had some nonqualified pension payments that we paid in the first quarter that relates to our late 2015 workforce reduction. And as every company has in the first quarter, we also had the prior years' incentive compensation payment. And so all of those items actually add together to get us back another, as I said, $0.07 to $0.08 in the aggregate to cash flow per share."

I'd like to take a few moments here to just offer some opening comments before we start taking your questions. 
Our first quarter results highlight our continued focus on resetting our cost structure across all elements of our business, reducing our capital program, consistent with our plan, and delivering production at the upper end of our guidance. Our capital program remains squarely focused on maximizing allocation to our lower-risk, higher-return U.S. resource plays. 
In the Eagle Ford, we continue to see well performance uplift from tighter stage spacing in our high GOR oil wells, while driving completed well cost down by about $2 million from last year. 
In the Bakken, we released our remaining rig but base production outperformed our expectations, supported by 2015 enhanced well completions, all while decreasing production expense per oil equivalent barrel 35% year-over-year. 
And in Oklahoma, we progressed our operated drilling program for leasehold protection and delineation. 
Outside the U.S., the jacket and topsides for the EG compression project were successfully installed ahead of schedule, and we remain on track for first production midyear. 
At OSM, the asset continued to perform well on both the cost and reliability fronts. On that subject, our thoughts go out to the Fort McMurray community today, where wildfires continue to take their toll. Though not currently threatened, operations at the Muskeg River and Jackpine mines have been temporarily suspended to support emergency respond efforts. 
This year, we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet, first, through the equity offering; and second, through the successful execution of our noncore asset sale program. In April, we announced $950 million worth of noncore asset sales, bringing our total since last summer to $1.3 billion, far exceeding our target and delivering on this commitment early in the year.
With this success, we are on track to achieve our 2016 objective to live within our means, inclusive of noncore asset sales. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, total company E&P production will be higher with EG and the U.K. Brae Field back online. We'll bring on twice the number of wells to sales in Oklahoma: 4 in the STACK, 3 in the SCOOP, and all extended laterals. We'll have additional results from completion enhancements in the Eagle Ford, though at a reduced pace. And in the Bakken, we'll have our Clark's Creek pad online in West Myrmidon. 
Everything we've been doing for the last 18 months, lowering costs, workforce reductions, strengthening the balance sheet and executing noncore asset sales, has been designed to provide us the flexibility to respond when we see constructive commodity prices and to derisk our business plan through 2017 in what remains an uncertain commodity price environment. 
While some positive trends are occurring, we're not yet confident that global supply and demand fundamentals are supportive of sustained higher oil prices, and we expect volatility to continue. As we strengthening to the $50 and above, we are well-positioned to consider increasing activity levels. 
Having quality resource, execution capability and a strong balance sheet puts us in a favorable position to be on our front foot when the time comes. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize Chris Phillips who will retire at the end of the month. Chris joined Marathon Oil in 1984 to help build the North Brae platform in the U.K. and has served in various roles within the company since, including the last 8 years in Investor Relations. My thanks to Chris for all of his contributions, and we wish him all the best in his retirement. And Chris is leaving our IR team in good hands, so please contact Zach Dailey going forward for all IR-related matters. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

Secondly, of course, is our involvement in the nonoperated Gunflint project in the Gulf of Mexico, which also will be starting up approximately midyear. And then finally, our nonoperated participation in the Atrush project in the Kurdistan region. So those 3 projects will essentially run their course from a capital program standpoint this year and would not be recurring in 2017. So as you state, that does gives us some flexibility. If you think about our 2016 capital program, we have -- of the $1.4 billion budget that we've talked about, about $1 billion of that, of course, is targeting the U.S. resource plays, the short cycle investments; and about $400 million is targeting the rest of the portfolio. Of which, those 3 long cycle projects are a material component of that $400 million. We do still have some commitments in the exploration space, conventional exploration space, that will have potentially an offset to that. But largely speaking, those projects will come out and provide us a good deal of more flexibility in 2017."

We're largely held in the SCOOP currently, but most of our leasehold activity is directed at the STACK, and of course, our Meramec drilling. In fact 2/3 of the Oklahoma program this year is directed toward the STACK and the Meramec.

So starting with the EURs, I think the group of wells we released this quarter is really a follow-on to a group from the previous quarter. So we've seen consistently that tighter stage spacing, in some cases tighter cluster spacing is also driving well productivity. Most of that activity has been focused in the oil areas as we've looked to try to upgrade or improve the returns of our best acreage as well as lift some of our other acreage up to the highest year of returns. So we started on that, reflecting that, if you'll recall, about 60% of our future inventory is in that high GOR oil window. We've also had the opportunity now to move that stage spacing down into the condensate window. And although it's early, we're encouraged with the response from the wells. So you'll see us continue that. And I think what we'll find is as those wells mature, speaking out of the oil wells, over the next months and this year, we expect the EURs to rise. We haven't reflected that yet because the production history is just too immature. But on the consistent response for that, I think it's important to note that we've effectively moved that stage space into the basis of all our oil well completions and continuing to attest even down to 150-foot stage spacing today. And then on top of the capital, I mean I think the capital reflects, really, the focus in the team. They're continuing to drill the wells faster and be efficient and focus on that. They're continuing to stimulate the wells faster. We average more than 200 stages per month from our primary frac crew in the first quarter, which is the most efficient we've ever been with that equipment set. And so those efficiencies come right to the bottom line and are helping to drive those cost down, even as we spend more, invest more in the completions. And certainly, overall, I think -- I'd say that we're still getting a bit of commercial help. Most of these cost changes recently are driven -- focused by the efficiency drive within the team."

As such, even though I think we have been successful in completing the sales against our published target, you should not deem that as us being finished or complete from a noncore asset standpoint. We're not putting out a new target. But certainly, the continued optimization of our portfolio is just part of what we want to be doing going forward. It's -- when we began that process, we had identified a population of noncore assets. Then we considered did they compete for capital allocation? Could they potentially have higher-value in someone else's portfolio? That population, even on a risk-adjusted basis, allowed us to have confidence in putting that target -- first target out there at $500 million. And then ultimately, increasing that target to the $750 million, $1 billion mark. So I think what we've seen is that for these quality assets, and a great example would be Wyoming, there is still a strong market out there that's willing to compete and pay very strong value for that type of asset. And again, it comes down to matching up very specific assets to very specific buyer pools. And I think that's what's created our success this year."

I think you wouldn't be surprised if we, again, articulated that, that target window has evolved over time to be a specific interval from a wider interval. And then there would be positive tension on the size of that target versus how fast you can actually drill a well. The team has gotten very consistent of being able to be focused in that target and still deliver the well at a very high efficiency within that. Part of that is repetition. They've had a lot of experience in the basin, a lot of practice, if you will. And so they've gotten very effective at it. And we've been consistently in the mid-90% in terms of landing a target over time. I think when we look at it is we made the target smaller over the last quarters and years, and they still been able to within that even as they increase the efficiency, which really speaks to the collaboration between the geosciences and the drilling engineering, that collaborative effort to work together to deliver those great results.

And second to that, we're going to delineate the phase windows within those 2 basins. I think there's some key tertiary parameters we're also going to test that will be important for us this year. This year, we're going to go from 6 operated wells historically in all of the last 2 years in STACK to almost triple that, which will give us a much larger operated data set. Importantly, within that, over half of those wells are XLs, which gives us a chance to see the long lateral performance as well as some of the shorter laterals we've had historically, and those wells are very much positioned in the core of the play, the highest value part of the STACK to drive results. Similarly in the SCOOP, although we're not entirely held by production, we certainly have more flexibility this year. And so all of our wells will be longer laterals, 1.5 mile-plus laterals, and give us the chance to really test that value of that longer lateral. So I think those are all key objectives that we can accomplish this year even at lower activity."

And we -- and we've kind of talked about the $50 or above number as being that signal. And it has to be a signal that also equally supported by the fundamentals of supply and demand. It needs to be something that we have confidence in. We know that we're going to be living with some near-term volatility. But we want to have confidence as we start deploying that first amount of incremental investment. So we are prepared. Everything we've been doing early this year, and actually toward the back end of last year, has been geared toward that ramp-up and activity that we can see a case for potentially in 2017.

That we've been very thoughtful in our approach there to ensure that we preserve the internal capabilities and capacities needed to get back into growth mode when we do get that constructive pricing. And we've done that through redeployment to everything, from special projects to field leadership roles to displacement of contractors, so that we do retain those essential skill sets that will be required when we get back into a growth mode. Externally, it's a little bit more complicated, in that the service sector has been a bit decimated, at least on the labor side from this correction. I do think what will modulate some of that is just many companies will still be in either balance sheet repair or will just simply not have the cash flows or the wherewithal to get back on a very fast ramp. So I do think the ramp will be self moderated in some ways once we get on it.

When we talk about kind of getting to the maintenance capital and getting back on a growth mode, you really have to talk about it from a common starting point. Where are you starting that discussion? So if I kind of fast-forward to the end of this year based on our current plan, and I look at where my resource plays will be exiting at the end of this year, and I think about what type of capital program will not only flatten, but will actually start growing sequentially in 2017. Based on what we know today, and again, this is not a budget outlook, we would probably place that capital program in the resource plays in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And again, that's not just getting us back to flat. That's actually starting sequential growth again in 2017. So that's kind of a ballpark number. It's one that I think will continue to improve as we -- I mean, Lance did a great job describing some of the secular efficiencies that we're already creating in the business. The Eagle Ford is a great example of that because we're operating at scale there.

This is Lance, I'm happy to address that. I'm pleased that you've noticed that actually. The Bakken seems to have done a really effective job of managing that production base over the last year at lower and lower activity. One of the key things is, is we had lower activity and they've been very focused on the base business. The production efficiency or uptime is really rising. And that's been a focus of theirs, and not just the last year, but the last couple of years, and they've really improved there. And I think probably more important than that in driving that flattening decline profile you see is that we've made a material shift in our completion practices over the last 1.5 years. And the wells from 2015 are among the best we've ever developed and put online. And the declines from those continue to flattened, and so that group is a big part of driving that flatter profile. So those completion practices with more fluid volume, higher density proppant loading, more stages, have all been beneficial, and we continue that. I think we're -- I've certainly said today, at lower activity, we have less opportunity to demonstrate that. But we look forward to the future. There's enormous commodity price leverage in the Bakken, and when we get back to activity there, we expect to be able to deliver even better wells in the future than we have in the past, just building on that. And I think we even look forward to say in the second quarter earnings and being able to talk about the results from the Clark's Creek pad in West Myrmidon, where we'll have pumped our -- what we view is our most sophisticated, most aggressive stimulations to date in the Bakken, and we expect those results to be compelling."

The way, I guess, I would address that is going back to my earlier comments about what 2017 might look like in a more constructive environment as we get back on a flat and even a sequential increase or growth in the U.S. resource plays. We're sitting today at right around 7 rigs across all the resource plays. We've got 5 rigs running in the Eagle Ford, 2 rigs running in Oklahoma. As we think about that kind of notional budget out in 2017 in the resource plays, that $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion we talked about, that's -- that type of spend in 2017 would likely see us ramping into a rig activity that would probably be close to double of where we are today. And so we absolutely have the capacity internally, and we feel that the vendor and service community could support it as well. That if that scenario did in fact play out, and again, this is not a 2017 budget discussion, but if that scenario did play out, we would comfortably be able to ramp into that level of activity."

And needless to say, Chris and Zach had been responding to a lot of questions from folks. And to be honest, first and foremost, I think you were somewhat alluding to, it's really predominantly driven by the macro conditions in the first quarter being the substantial reduction and realized prices on a fee-and-fee basis, about 25%, and of course, the volumetric implications as well. But when I then kind of just look at the -- more of the micro granular level, there is an item to use the vernacular of some of the reports this morning, the amount of the deferred taxes in the first quarter, or the deferred tax benefit in the first quarter, might have been lower as compared to what many people were assuming it to be. And it's really -- unfortunately, it's really just the methodology we are using for interperiod tax allocation. So how we allocate taxes we anticipate for the full year, how we allocate them on a quarterly basis. And honestly, that, coupled with a couple other nonrecurring items, likely accounts for close to $0.07 or $0.08 per share on a cash flow basis. And so I think -- unfortunately, when you're always looking at working cash flow before working capital, you're going to get some anomalies there. We always try, of course. We're managing total cash flow, and look at it on an after-working capital basis. And when I do that, we did have an additional anomaly in there. We had some nonqualified pension payments that we paid in the first quarter that relates to our late 2015 workforce reduction. And as every company has in the first quarter, we also had the prior years' incentive compensation payment. And so all of those items actually add together to get us back another, as I said, $0.07 to $0.08 in the aggregate to cash flow per share."

I'd like to take a few moments here to just offer some opening comments before we start taking your questions. 
Our first quarter results highlight our continued focus on resetting our cost structure across all elements of our business, reducing our capital program, consistent with our plan, and delivering production at the upper end of our guidance. Our capital program remains squarely focused on maximizing allocation to our lower-risk, higher-return U.S. resource plays. 
In the Eagle Ford, we continue to see well performance uplift from tighter stage spacing in our high GOR oil wells, while driving completed well cost down by about $2 million from last year. 
In the Bakken, we released our remaining rig but base production outperformed our expectations, supported by 2015 enhanced well completions, all while decreasing production expense per oil equivalent barrel 35% year-over-year. 
And in Oklahoma, we progressed our operated drilling program for leasehold protection and delineation. 
Outside the U.S., the jacket and topsides for the EG compression project were successfully installed ahead of schedule, and we remain on track for first production midyear. 
At OSM, the asset continued to perform well on both the cost and reliability fronts. On that subject, our thoughts go out to the Fort McMurray community today, where wildfires continue to take their toll. Though not currently threatened, operations at the Muskeg River and Jackpine mines have been temporarily suspended to support emergency respond efforts. 
This year, we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet, first, through the equity offering; and second, through the successful execution of our noncore asset sale program. In April, we announced $950 million worth of noncore asset sales, bringing our total since last summer to $1.3 billion, far exceeding our target and delivering on this commitment early in the year.
With this success, we are on track to achieve our 2016 objective to live within our means, inclusive of noncore asset sales. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, total company E&P production will be higher with EG and the U.K. Brae Field back online. We'll bring on twice the number of wells to sales in Oklahoma: 4 in the STACK, 3 in the SCOOP, and all extended laterals. We'll have additional results from completion enhancements in the Eagle Ford, though at a reduced pace. And in the Bakken, we'll have our Clark's Creek pad online in West Myrmidon. 
Everything we've been doing for the last 18 months, lowering costs, workforce reductions, strengthening the balance sheet and executing noncore asset sales, has been designed to provide us the flexibility to respond when we see constructive commodity prices and to derisk our business plan through 2017 in what remains an uncertain commodity price environment. 
While some positive trends are occurring, we're not yet confident that global supply and demand fundamentals are supportive of sustained higher oil prices, and we expect volatility to continue. As we strengthening to the $50 and above, we are well-positioned to consider increasing activity levels. 
Having quality resource, execution capability and a strong balance sheet puts us in a favorable position to be on our front foot when the time comes. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize Chris Phillips who will retire at the end of the month. Chris joined Marathon Oil in 1984 to help build the North Brae platform in the U.K. and has served in various roles within the company since, including the last 8 years in Investor Relations. My thanks to Chris for all of his contributions, and we wish him all the best in his retirement. And Chris is leaving our IR team in good hands, so please contact Zach Dailey going forward for all IR-related matters. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Chris to begin the Q&A."

Secondly, of course, is our involvement in the nonoperated Gunflint project in the Gulf of Mexico, which also will be starting up approximately midyear. And then finally, our nonoperated participation in the Atrush project in the Kurdistan region. So those 3 projects will essentially run their course from a capital program standpoint this year and would not be recurring in 2017. So as you state, that does gives us some flexibility. If you think about our 2016 capital program, we have -- of the $1.4 billion budget that we've talked about, about $1 billion of that, of course, is targeting the U.S. resource plays, the short cycle investments; and about $400 million is targeting the rest of the portfolio. Of which, those 3 long cycle projects are a material component of that $400 million. We do still have some commitments in the exploration space, conventional exploration space, that will have potentially an offset to that. But largely speaking, those projects will come out and provide us a good deal of more flexibility in 2017."

We're largely held in the SCOOP currently, but most of our leasehold activity is directed at the STACK, and of course, our Meramec drilling. In fact 2/3 of the Oklahoma program this year is directed toward the STACK and the Meramec.

So starting with the EURs, I think the group of wells we released this quarter is really a follow-on to a group from the previous quarter. So we've seen consistently that tighter stage spacing, in some cases tighter cluster spacing is also driving well productivity. Most of that activity has been focused in the oil areas as we've looked to try to upgrade or improve the returns of our best acreage as well as lift some of our other acreage up to the highest year of returns. So we started on that, reflecting that, if you'll recall, about 60% of our future inventory is in that high GOR oil window. We've also had the opportunity now to move that stage spacing down into the condensate window. And although it's early, we're encouraged with the response from the wells. So you'll see us continue that. And I think what we'll find is as those wells mature, speaking out of the oil wells, over the next months and this year, we expect the EURs to rise. We haven't reflected that yet because the production history is just too immature. But on the consistent response for that, I think it's important to note that we've effectively moved that stage space into the basis of all our oil well completions and continuing to attest even down to 150-foot stage spacing today. And then on top of the capital, I mean I think the capital reflects, really, the focus in the team. They're continuing to drill the wells faster and be efficient and focus on that. They're continuing to stimulate the wells faster. We average more than 200 stages per month from our primary frac crew in the first quarter, which is the most efficient we've ever been with that equipment set. And so those efficiencies come right to the bottom line and are helping to drive those cost down, even as we spend more, invest more in the completions. And certainly, overall, I think -- I'd say that we're still getting a bit of commercial help. Most of these cost changes recently are driven -- focused by the efficiency drive within the team."

We're not putting out a new target. But certainly, the continued optimization of our portfolio is just part of what we want to be doing going forward. It's -- when we began that process, we had identified a population of noncore assets. Then we considered did they compete for capital allocation? Could they potentially have higher-value in someone else's portfolio? That population, even on a risk-adjusted basis, allowed us to have confidence in putting that target -- first target out there at $500 million. And then ultimately, increasing that target to the $750 million, $1 billion mark. So I think what we've seen is that for these quality assets, and a great example would be Wyoming, there is still a strong market out there that's willing to compete and pay very strong value for that type of asset. And again, it comes down to matching up very specific assets to very specific buyer pools. And I think that's what's created our success this year."

I think you wouldn't be surprised if we, again, articulated that, that target window has evolved over time to be a specific interval from a wider interval. And then there would be positive tension on the size of that target versus how fast you can actually drill a well. The team has gotten very consistent of being able to be focused in that target and still deliver the well at a very high efficiency within that. Part of that is repetition. They've had a lot of experience in the basin, a lot of practice, if you will. And so they've gotten very effective at it. And we've been consistently in the mid-90% in terms of landing a target over time. I think when we look at it is we made the target smaller over the last quarters and years, and they still been able to within that even as they increase the efficiency, which really speaks to the collaboration between the geosciences and the drilling engineering, that collaborative effort to work together to deliver those great results. If we expect to continue to be able to deliver those results consistently, even as the efficiency will still drive upwards."

And second to that, we're going to delineate the phase windows within those 2 basins. I think there's some key tertiary parameters we're also going to test that will be important for us this year. This year, we're going to go from 6 operated wells historically in all of the last 2 years in STACK to almost triple that, which will give us a much larger operated data set. Importantly, within that, over half of those wells are XLs, which gives us a chance to see the long lateral performance as well as some of the shorter laterals we've had historically, and those wells are very much positioned in the core of the play, the highest value part of the STACK to drive results. Similarly in the SCOOP, although we're not entirely held by production, we certainly have more flexibility this year. And so all of our wells will be longer laterals, 1.5 mile-plus laterals, and give us the chance to really test that value of that longer lateral.

For us, Paul, it really starts with what are the risk-adjusted returns that we can generate? And we want our capital allocation, whether it be short cycle or long cycle, directed to those projects and opportunities that offer the highest risk-adjusted returns. We've been very clear, for instance, that we're transitioning out of the conventional exploration space, and that's being driven strictly by capital allocation. We simply did not see those opportunities competing in a relative sense within the very opportunity-rich portfolio that we have here in the U.S. resource plays. Now we still have accretive opportunities that are more mid-cycle and long cycle, for instance, the compression project that's ramping up in Equatorial Guinea. But I think as we continue to transition our portfolio, you should expect to see more and more of our capital allocation going toward our very kind of deep end, very economic U.S. resource play inventory."

And I think Lance and I have both addressed that. That we've been very thoughtful in our approach there to ensure that we preserve the internal capabilities and capacities needed to get back into growth mode when we do get that constructive pricing. And we've done that through redeployment to everything, from special projects to field leadership roles to displacement of contractors, so that we do retain those essential skill sets that will be required when we get back into a growth mode. Externally, it's a little bit more complicated, in that the service sector has been a bit decimated, at least on the labor side from this correction. I do think what will modulate some of that is just many companies will still be in either balance sheet repair or will just simply not have the cash flows or the wherewithal to get back on a very fast ramp. So I do think the ramp will be self moderated in some ways once we get on it. But I think maintaining those strong relationships with our key service providers, which we have been able to do during the downturn, that's very important. And we're going to leverage those relationships when the kind of -- the bell rings again to get back into growth mode."

When we talk about kind of getting to the maintenance capital and getting back on a growth mode, you really have to talk about it from a common starting point. Where are you starting that discussion? So if I kind of fast-forward to the end of this year based on our current plan, and I look at where my resource plays will be exiting at the end of this year, and I think about what type of capital program will not only flatten, but will actually start growing sequentially in 2017. Based on what we know today, and again, this is not a budget outlook, we would probably place that capital program in the resource plays in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And again, that's not just getting us back to flat. That's actually starting sequential growth again in 2017. So that's kind of a ballpark number. It's one that I think will continue to improve as we -- I mean, Lance did a great job describing some of the secular efficiencies that we're already creating in the business. The Eagle Ford is a great example of that because we're operating at scale there.

This is Lance, I'm happy to address that. I'm pleased that you've noticed that actually. The Bakken seems to have done a really effective job of managing that production base over the last year at lower and lower activity. One of the key things is, is we had lower activity and they've been very focused on the base business. The production efficiency or uptime is really rising. And that's been a focus of theirs, and not just the last year, but the last couple of years, and they've really improved there. And I think probably more important than that in driving that flattening decline profile you see is that we've made a material shift in our completion practices over the last 1.5 years. And the wells from 2015 are among the best we've ever developed and put online. And the declines from those continue to flattened, and so that group is a big part of driving that flatter profile. So those completion practices with more fluid volume, higher density proppant loading, more stages, have all been beneficial, and we continue that. I think we're -- I've certainly said today, at lower activity, we have less opportunity to demonstrate that. But we look forward to the future. There's enormous commodity price leverage in the Bakken, and when we get back to activity there, we expect to be able to deliver even better wells in the future than we have in the past, just building on that. And I think we even look forward to say in the second quarter earnings and being able to talk about the results from the Clark's Creek pad in West Myrmidon, where we'll have pumped our -- what we view is our most sophisticated, most aggressive stimulations to date in the Bakken, and we expect those results to be compelling."

And needless to say, Chris and Zach had been responding to a lot of questions from folks. And to be honest, first and foremost, I think you were somewhat alluding to, it's really predominantly driven by the macro conditions in the first quarter being the substantial reduction and realized prices on a fee-and-fee basis, about 25%, and of course, the volumetric implications as well. But when I then kind of just look at the -- more of the micro granular level, there is an item to use the vernacular of some of the reports this morning, the amount of the deferred taxes in the first quarter, or the deferred tax benefit in the first quarter, might have been lower as compared to what many people were assuming it to be. And it's really -- unfortunately, it's really just the methodology we are using for interperiod tax allocation. So how we allocate taxes we anticipate for the full year, how we allocate them on a quarterly basis. And honestly, that, coupled with a couple other nonrecurring items, likely accounts for close to $0.07 or $0.08 per share on a cash flow basis. And so I think -- unfortunately, when you're always looking at working cash flow before working capital, you're going to get some anomalies there. We always try, of course. We're managing total cash flow, and look at it on an after-working capital basis. And when I do that, we did have an additional anomaly in there. We had some nonqualified pension payments that we paid in the first quarter that relates to our late 2015 workforce reduction. And as every company has in the first quarter, we also had the prior years' incentive compensation payment. And so all of those items actually add together to get us back another, as I said, $0.07 to $0.08 in the aggregate to cash flow per share."

I'd like to take a few moments here to just offer some opening comments before we start taking your questions. 
Our first quarter results highlight our continued focus on resetting our cost structure across all elements of our business, reducing our capital program, consistent with our plan, and delivering production at the upper end of our guidance. Our capital program remains squarely focused on maximizing allocation to our lower-risk, higher-return U.S. resource plays. 
In the Eagle Ford, we continue to see well performance uplift from tighter stage spacing in our high GOR oil wells, while driving completed well cost down by about $2 million from last year. 
In the Bakken, we released our remaining rig but base production outperformed our expectations, supported by 2015 enhanced well completions, all while decreasing production expense per oil equivalent barrel 35% year-over-year. 
And in Oklahoma, we progressed our operated drilling program for leasehold protection and delineation. 
Outside the U.S., the jacket and topsides for the EG compression project were successfully installed ahead of schedule, and we remain on track for first production midyear. 
At OSM, the asset continued to perform well on both the cost and reliability fronts. On that subject, our thoughts go out to the Fort McMurray community today, where wildfires continue to take their toll. Though not currently threatened, operations at the Muskeg River and Jackpine mines have been temporarily suspended to support emergency respond efforts. 
This year, we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet, first, through the equity offering; and second, through the successful execution of our noncore asset sale program. In April, we announced $950 million worth of noncore asset sales, bringing our total since last summer to $1.3 billion, far exceeding our target and delivering on this commitment early in the year.
With this success, we are on track to achieve our 2016 objective to live within our means, inclusive of noncore asset sales. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, total company E&P production will be higher with EG and the U.K. Brae Field back online. We'll bring on twice the number of wells to sales in Oklahoma: 4 in the STACK, 3 in the SCOOP, and all extended laterals. We'll have additional results from completion enhancements in the Eagle Ford, though at a reduced pace. And in the Bakken, we'll have our Clark's Creek pad online in West Myrmidon. 
Everything we've been doing for the last 18 months, lowering costs, workforce reductions, strengthening the balance sheet and executing noncore asset sales, has been designed to provide us the flexibility to respond when we see constructive commodity prices and to derisk our business plan through 2017 in what remains an uncertain commodity price environment. 
While some positive trends are occurring, we're not yet confident that global supply and demand fundamentals are supportive of sustained higher oil prices, and we expect volatility to continue. As we strengthening to the $50 and above, we are well-positioned to consider increasing activity levels. 
Having quality resource, execution capability and a strong balance sheet puts us in a favorable position to be on our front foot when the time comes. 
Before I close, I'd like to recognize Chris Phillips who will retire at the end of the month. Chris joined Marathon Oil in 1984 to help build the North Brae platform in the U.K. and has served in various roles within the company since, including the last 8 years in Investor Relations. My thanks to Chris for all of his contributions, and we wish him all the best in his retirement.

Secondly, of course, is our involvement in the nonoperated Gunflint project in the Gulf of Mexico, which also will be starting up approximately midyear. And then finally, our nonoperated participation in the Atrush project in the Kurdistan region. So those 3 projects will essentially run their course from a capital program standpoint this year and would not be recurring in 2017. So as you state, that does gives us some flexibility. If you think about our 2016 capital program, we have -- of the $1.4 billion budget that we've talked about, about $1 billion of that, of course, is targeting the U.S. resource plays, the short cycle investments; and about $400 million is targeting the rest of the portfolio. Of which, those 3 long cycle projects are a material component of that $400 million. We do still have some commitments in the exploration space, conventional exploration space, that will have potentially an offset to that. But largely speaking, those projects will come out and provide us a good deal of more flexibility in 2017."

So starting with the EURs, I think the group of wells we released this quarter is really a follow-on to a group from the previous quarter. So we've seen consistently that tighter stage spacing, in some cases tighter cluster spacing is also driving well productivity. Most of that activity has been focused in the oil areas as we've looked to try to upgrade or improve the returns of our best acreage as well as lift some of our other acreage up to the highest year of returns. So we started on that, reflecting that, if you'll recall, about 60% of our future inventory is in that high GOR oil window. We've also had the opportunity now to move that stage spacing down into the condensate window. And although it's early, we're encouraged with the response from the wells. So you'll see us continue that. And I think what we'll find is as those wells mature, speaking out of the oil wells, over the next months and this year, we expect the EURs to rise. We haven't reflected that yet because the production history is just too immature. But on the consistent response for that, I think it's important to note that we've effectively moved that stage space into the basis of all our oil well completions and continuing to attest even down to 150-foot stage spacing today. And then on top of the capital, I mean I think the capital reflects, really, the focus in the team. They're continuing to drill the wells faster and be efficient and focus on that. They're continuing to stimulate the wells faster. We average more than 200 stages per month from our primary frac crew in the first quarter, which is the most efficient we've ever been with that equipment set. And so those efficiencies come right to the bottom line and are helping to drive those cost down, even as we spend more, invest more in the completions. And certainly, overall, I think -- I'd say that we're still getting a bit of commercial help. Most of these cost changes recently are driven -- focused by the efficiency drive within the team."

As such, even though I think we have been successful in completing the sales against our published target, you should not deem that as us being finished or complete from a noncore asset standpoint. We're not putting out a new target. But certainly, the continued optimization of our portfolio is just part of what we want to be doing going forward. It's -- when we began that process, we had identified a population of noncore assets. Then we considered did they compete for capital allocation? Could they potentially have higher-value in someone else's portfolio? That population, even on a risk-adjusted basis, allowed us to have confidence in putting that target -- first target out there at $500 million. And then ultimately, increasing that target to the $750 million, $1 billion mark. So I think what we've seen is that for these quality assets, and a great example would be Wyoming, there is still a strong market out there that's willing to compete and pay very strong value for that type of asset. And again, it comes down to matching up very specific assets to very specific buyer pools. And I think that's what's created our success this year."

I think you wouldn't be surprised if we, again, articulated that, that target window has evolved over time to be a specific interval from a wider interval. And then there would be positive tension on the size of that target versus how fast you can actually drill a well. The team has gotten very consistent of being able to be focused in that target and still deliver the well at a very high efficiency within that. Part of that is repetition. They've had a lot of experience in the basin, a lot of practice, if you will. And so they've gotten very effective at it. And we've been consistently in the mid-90% in terms of landing a target over time. I think when we look at it is we made the target smaller over the last quarters and years, and they still been able to within that even as they increase the efficiency, which really speaks to the collaboration between the geosciences and the drilling engineering, that collaborative effort to work together to deliver those great results. If we expect to continue to be able to deliver those results consistently, even as the efficiency will still drive upwards."

This year, we're going to go from 6 operated wells historically in all of the last 2 years in STACK to almost triple that, which will give us a much larger operated data set. Importantly, within that, over half of those wells are XLs, which gives us a chance to see the long lateral performance as well as some of the shorter laterals we've had historically, and those wells are very much positioned in the core of the play, the highest value part of the STACK to drive results. Similarly in the SCOOP, although we're not entirely held by production, we certainly have more flexibility this year. And so all of our wells will be longer laterals, 1.5 mile-plus laterals, and give us the chance to really test that value of that longer lateral.

First, just maybe to reprise a bit, when we took the decision on the equity raise, that was a risk management decision that allowed us to derisk our business plans out through 2017. But probably more importantly, beyond strengthening our balance sheet, it also provided us the optionality and the flexibility to be a bit more on the offense when we do see that constructive price signal. And we -- and we've kind of talked about the $50 or above number as being that signal. And it has to be a signal that also equally supported by the fundamentals of supply and demand. It needs to be something that we have confidence in. We know that we're going to be living with some near-term volatility. But we want to have confidence as we start deploying that first amount of incremental investment. So we are prepared. Everything we've been doing early this year, and actually toward the back end of last year, has been geared toward that ramp-up and activity that we can see a case for potentially in 2017. And to the extent that we do see that pricing signal, we're well prepared, and I think Lance said it well, that we've retained the internal competencies and capabilities that would allow us to get on a good, strong ramp-up in 2017 from an activity standpoint that would get us back very quickly into sequential growth mode."

It is a question -- when I think about the capacity and execution capacity question, I think of it really in 2 buckets, Paul. One is the internal capacity and competencies. And I think Lance and I have both addressed that. That we've been very thoughtful in our approach there to ensure that we preserve the internal capabilities and capacities needed to get back into growth mode when we do get that constructive pricing. And we've done that through redeployment to everything, from special projects to field leadership roles to displacement of contractors, so that we do retain those essential skill sets that will be required when we get back into a growth mode. Externally, it's a little bit more complicated, in that the service sector has been a bit decimated, at least on the labor side from this correction. I do think what will modulate some of that is just many companies will still be in either balance sheet repair or will just simply not have the cash flows or the wherewithal to get back on a very fast ramp. So I do think the ramp will be self-moderated in some ways once we get on it.

When we talk about kind of getting to the maintenance capital and getting back on a growth mode, you really have to talk about it from a common starting point. Where are you starting that discussion? So if I kind of fast-forward to the end of this year based on our current plan, and I look at where my resource plays will be exiting at the end of this year, and I think about what type of capital program will not only flatten, but will actually start growing sequentially in 2017. Based on what we know today, and again, this is not a budget outlook, we would probably place that capital program in the resource plays in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And again, that's not just getting us back to flat. That's actually starting sequential growth again in 2017. So that's kind of a ballpark number. It's one that I think will continue to improve as we -- I mean, Lance did a great job describing some of the secular efficiencies that we're already creating in the business.

This is Lance, I'm happy to address that. I'm pleased that you've noticed that actually. The Bakken seems to have done a really effective job of managing that production base over the last year at lower and lower activity. One of the key things is, is we had lower activity and they've been very focused on the base business. The production efficiency or uptime is really rising. And that's been a focus of theirs, and not just the last year, but the last couple of years, and they've really improved there. And I think probably more important than that in driving that flattening decline profile you see is that we've made a material shift in our completion practices over the last 1.5 years. And the wells from 2015 are among the best we've ever developed and put online. And the declines from those continue to flattened, and so that group is a big part of driving that flatter profile. So those completion practices with more fluid volume, higher density proppant loading, more stages, have all been beneficial, and we continue that. I think we're -- I've certainly said today, at lower activity, we have less opportunity to demonstrate that. But we look forward to the future. There's enormous commodity price leverage in the Bakken, and when we get back to activity there, we expect to be able to deliver even better wells in the future than we have in the past, just building on that. And I think we even look forward to say in the second quarter earnings and being able to talk about the results from the Clark's Creek pad in West Myrmidon, where we'll have pumped our -- what we view is our most sophisticated, most aggressive stimulations to date in the Bakken, and we expect those results to be compelling."

And needless to say, Chris and Zach had been responding to a lot of questions from folks. And to be honest, first and foremost, I think you were somewhat alluding to, it's really predominantly driven by the macro conditions in the first quarter being the substantial reduction and realized prices on a fee-and-fee basis, about 25%, and of course, the volumetric implications as well. But when I then kind of just look at the -- more of the micro granular level, there is an item to use the vernacular of some of the reports this morning, the amount of the deferred taxes in the first quarter, or the deferred tax benefit in the first quarter, might have been lower as compared to what many people were assuming it to be. And it's really -- unfortunately, it's really just the methodology we are using for interperiod tax allocation. So how we allocate taxes we anticipate for the full year, how we allocate them on a quarterly basis. And honestly, that, coupled with a couple other nonrecurring items, likely accounts for close to $0.07 or $0.08 per share on a cash flow basis. And so I think -- unfortunately, when you're always looking at working cash flow before working capital, you're going to get some anomalies there. We always try, of course. We're managing total cash flow, and look at it on an after-working capital basis. And when I do that, we did have an additional anomaly in there. We had some nonqualified pension payments that we paid in the first quarter that relates to our late 2015 workforce reduction. And as every company has in the first quarter, we also had the prior years' incentive compensation payment. And so all of those items actually add together to get us back another, as I said, $0.07 to $0.08 in the aggregate to cash flow per share."

I'll make a few brief comments and open the call for questions. Our second quarter headlines. Strong well results, continued cost reduction, successful portfolio management.Our Oklahoma Asset team delivered",604,"Thank you, Zack, and good morning to everyone. I'll make a few brief comments and open the call for questions. Our second quarter headlines. Strong well results, continued cost reduction, successful portfolio management.
Our Oklahoma Asset team delivered 2 outstanding STACK Merrimac wells with oil cuts above 70%, while continuing to balance leased whole demands with acreage delineation. This same team also closed our Payrock acquisition on Monday, just 6 weeks after announcing the deal, and are rapidly integrating that asset into our Oklahoma business. The team actually had a countdown calendar in the office as they marched towards the accelerated close date. Needless to say, they're excited and they're focused efforts will ensure no loss of momentum.
We had an exceptional quarter in the Bakken, delivering a record well on our West Myrmidon acreage through a combination of great reservoir quality and enhanced completion design. The Bakken as a team is really embraced this time of lower activity to prepare for what's next. They dropped their production cost materially and upped their game on well returns to place West Myrmidon in the mix for 2017 capital allocation.
The Eagle Ford continued seeing uplift from tighter state spacing, while feeling the effects of a planned step down in activity and challenging base production declines. And despite their move to higher intensity completions, their completed well costs are down significantly year-over-year.
Winning the production cost battle is hard work and typically measured in numerous but smaller victories. Rest assure that cost management remains front and center with all of our asset teams.
North America E&P production costs are down almost 30% from a year ago, and we dropped their full year guidance by $1 per oil equivalent barrel. We've also reduced 2016 unit production expense guidance for international by $0.50 per oil the equivalent barrel.
Through a combination of capital discipline and efficiency gains across all of our businesses, we'll deliver a 2016 capital program that's $100 million below our original budget. All while funding the incremental 2016 activity associated with our STACK acquisition, including the additional rig we'll add there this quarter.
Oklahoma is getting busy, with the acquisition, we will be doubling our activity in the STACK to 4 rigs in total.
Not to be outdone by a North America success in our international business, we achieved first gas from the B3 compression project in EG in July, on schedule and within budget. The project is fulfilling its mission to extend the Alba Field's production plateau by 2 years and the assets life out 2013. As our capital investment and compression project walls of the EG will contribute significant free cash flow that we can reinvest in our deep inventory of a high return opportunities here in the U.S. resource plays.
On the portfolio management side. Our noncore asset sales program has now achieved over $1 billion year-to-date. And though exceeded our additional target, we aren't done. Expect noncore asset sales to be ongoing as we continue optimizing our capital allocation to the lowest cost, highest margin opportunities.
On the other side of portfolio management, the 61,000 net acres we acquired in the STACK Merrimac oil window ticks all the boxes, quality, scale, value and with further upside not assumed in the purchase price. Through this volatile and commodity price environment, we've been resolute in executing against our playbook. Strengthening our balance sheet, resetting our cost structure, simplifying our portfolio. All with the goal of profitable growth within cash flows when sustainably higher prices give us the confidence to ramp activity. With that, I'll hand it back to Zach to begin the Q&A."

But once you get a better commodity price environment, you've improved the well results, the operational performance I think, significantly. You also made meaningful improvements of the portfolio and your opportunity set. When the time comes, what type of growth rate do you think Marathon is poised to fundamentally deliver longer-term? I'm just trying to understand kind of that framework for longer-term growth."

We've got this great opportunity set that very much competes for capital in the price band. A lot of that, I would say, growth aspiration, though, will be highly dependent upon the pricing that we see. Being a very oil levered company, of course, we have a very strong response in operating cash flows as we see improvements to the oil price. So to the extent that we need to modulate between growth as well as generating free cash flows, we're prepared to do that. But the potential that we've got in the 3 resource play definitely provides as an avenue for moving to a very competitive growth metric in the future. Without getting into specifics there, we have that potential."

We also have, as you might recall, a number of other XL wells in the third quarter and fourth quarter in that same Blaine County area from that heritage we're here to talk about. So when get the breadth of those and they've matured a bit, it'd be a more appropriate time for that. And turning to the Bakken, I think the well results we reported there are really remarkable this quarter. All off in the same pad. That 3 best -- among the 3 best wells put in the basin in the last 3 years, that really demonstrates what technology application, the right landings on the right combination is -- we have inventory like that. Similarly, we like to see those material, but there other wells in that areas, they also perform well, which is why we were aggressive in that area, I think we need to let those mature, but I just eco-sourced upgrade there driven by that. Lastly, Eagle Ford, we continue to be really pleased with the results of tighter staged basin, particularly in the oil areas in the upper and lower Eagle Ford, responding very well.

I think the sector, in general, was struggling with striking the correct balance between wanting to be prepared if they get a strong and sustainable price signal versus getting too far ahead of their headlights and losing, I think, the discipline that had been required during this downturn. So speaking from a Marathon Oil perspective, we do expect to build some momentum going into the fourth quarter, which we think would position us quite favorably in the event we do see more constructive pricing, and I would say that there's probably many others within our space that are looking to do the same. There of course, will always be an element that may have to be more in a balance sheet repair mode as opposed to kind of being on their front foot and looking to drive toward incremental activity.

Our Oklahoma asset team del",604,"Thank you, Zach, and good morning to everyone. I'll make a few brief comments and I'll open the call for questions. 
Our second quarter headlines. Strong well results, continued cost reduction, successful portfolio management. Our Oklahoma asset team delivered 2 outstanding STACK Meramec wells, with oil cuts above 70%, while continuing to balance leased whole demands with acreage delineation. 
This same team also closed our PayRock acquisition on Monday, just 6 weeks after announcing the deal, and are rapidly integrating that asset into our Oklahoma business. The team actually had a countdown calendar in the office as they marched towards the accelerated close date. Needless to say, they are excited and their focused efforts will ensure no loss of momentum.
We had an exceptional quarter in the Bakken, delivering a record well on our West Myrmidon acreage through a combination of great reservoir quality and enhanced completion designs. The Bakken asset team has truly embraced this time of lower activity to prepare for what's next. They dropped their production costs materially and upped their game on well returns to place West Myrmidon in the mix for 2017 capital allocation.
The Eagle Ford continued seeing uplift from tighter stage spacing, while feeling the effects of a planned step down in activity and challenging base production declines. And despite their move to higher intensity completions, their completed well costs are down significantly year-over-year.
Winning the production cost battle is hard work and typically measured in numerous but smaller victories. Rest assured that cost management remains front and center with all of our asset teams.
North America E&P production costs are down almost 30% from a year ago, and we dropped their full year guidance by $1 per oil equivalent barrel. We've also reduced 2016 unit production expense guidance for international by $0.50 per oil equivalent barrel.
Through a combination of capital discipline and efficiency gains across all of our businesses, we'll deliver a 2016 capital program that's $100 million below our original budget, all while funding the incremental 2016 activity associated with our STACK acquisition, including the additional rig we'll add there this quarter.
Oklahoma is getting busy, with the acquisition, we will be doubling our activity in the STACK to 4 rigs in total.
Not to be outdone by North America's success in our international business, we achieved first gas from the B3 compression project in EG in July, on schedule and within budget. The project is fulfilling its mission to extend the Alba Field's production plateau by 2 years and the asset's life out beyond 2030. 
As our capital investment in the compression project falls away, EG will contribute significant free cash flow that we can reinvest in our deep inventory of high-return opportunities here in the U.S. resource plays.
On the portfolio management side. Our noncore asset sales program has now achieved over $1 billion year-to-date. And though we exceeded our initial target, we aren't done. Expect noncore asset sales to be ongoing as we continue optimizing our capital allocation to the lowest cost, highest margin opportunities.
On the other side of portfolio management, the 61,000 net acres we acquired in the STACK Meramec oil window ticks all the boxes: quality, scale, value and with further upside not assumed in the purchase price. Through this volatile and uncertain commodity price environment, we've been resolute in executing against our playbook, strengthening our balance sheet, resetting our cost structure, simplifying our portfolio, all with the goal of profitable growth within cash flows when sustainably higher prices give us the confidence to ramp activity. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Zach to begin the Q&A."

Hey, Ed, this is J.R. As we've talked, I think, on previous calls, even though we're focused here on ultimately being able to get that capital program up to a level to where we can resume the growth path, the balance sheet is still going to be important. I think we've got some maturities coming up here in October of '17 and again in March of '18.

And that's one reason why I think we're maintaining the cash balance that we are today to give us that option.

The 2 rigs are going to be initially focused on protecting that valuable leasehold, but also looking towards continuing strategic, I'll say, delineation around the play as well. But in terms of economics and where those wells fall in our set of opportunities, there's no doubt that the STACK oil opportunities compete at the very top of our Tier 1 inventory.

So for example, in the results we have reported this quarter, we've been transitioning to XL wells in our overpressured area to look at the value there. Those well results have been very compelling and we're very excited about those. We also purchased this acquisition on the oil buy-side based on the fact that they had among the very best productivity on a lateral-adjusted foot basis with very low capital costs, which together, create a great value opportunity for us.

But overall, it's clearly early in the STACK still. I mean, we're delineating the whole acreage, us and peers. Those well results were reported this quarter, the Irven John and Olive June are excellent well results. Other XL wells are performing above that type curve. They're also only about 40 or 50 days into their total production, so I think we're going need to let those run a while. I think we're excited that they're above that curve and so there will be certainly an opportunity for a resource upgrade. We also have, as you might recall, a number of other XL wells in the third quarter and fourth quarter in that same Blaine County area from our heritage acreage we'll get to talk about. So when we get the breadth of those and they've matured a bit, it would be a more appropriate time for that. Turning to the Bakken, I think the well results we reported there are really remarkable this quarter. All off of the same pad, the 3 best -- among the 3 best wells put in the basin in the last 3 years, that really demonstrates what technology application, the right landings on the right combination is and we have inventory like that. Similarly, we like to see those mature, but there other wells in that area that also perform well, which is why we were aggressive in that area. So I think we need to let those mature, but there -- I'd just echo, source upgrade there driven by that. Lastly, Eagle Ford, we continue to be really pleased with the results of tighter stage basin, particularly in the oil areas in the upper and lower Eagle Ford, responding very well. We've got a breath of wells there now, almost 75 wells in that group. So it's maturing, which gives us more confidence. And I think we recognize there will be a need to do a resource update in the not-too-distant future."

So I think we went last year from sort of unconstrained Austin Chalk, very quickly to 40-acre spacing in the Austin Chalk to try to find the balance of productivity of that reservoir. I think what we've discovered over the last few quarters is that at 40-acre spacing, when we've had groups, really, our first groups of Austin Chalk wells together that are constrained, that the reservoir quality is very high. It's got a lot of natural fracturing, which we suspected but weren't certain of. And those wells are communicating laterally a bit. And that overall, we're going to get the best capital efficiency in the Austin Chalk at wider spacing. In that same time frame, we've also been testing the Upper Eagle Ford, really doubled the amount of our delineated acreage over that time in the Upper Eagle Ford. And recognize that it can -- we could backfill some of those Austin Chalk locations with Upper Eagle Ford, but both at wider spacing. They just interact better. But ultimately, we're looking for the highest recovery of hydrocarbon out of that unit at the lowest capital input. So we're trying to optimize the returns at the drilling unit level."

So there was probably a bit more bias to the conventional portfolio in the first half of the year.

So speaking from a Marathon Oil perspective, we do expect to build some momentum going into the fourth quarter, which we think would position us quite favorably in the event we do see more constructive pricing, and I would say that there's probably many others within our space that are looking to do the same. There, of course, will always be an element that may have to be more in a balance sheet repair mode as opposed to kind of being on their front foot and looking to drive toward incremental activity.

So I was trying to just kind of project out kind of where we thought we might exit out of 2017 based on that kind of nominal $1.4 billion type investment, but there will absolutely be a ramp. And I think, too, you have to bear in mind that the rigs today are doing a lot more than the rigs did a year ago. And so we absolutely are take advantage of that efficiency. In fact, in the Eagle Ford, we've actually gone down on rigs in second quarter from 5 to 4 rigs, recognizing just the sheer efficiency of our drilling operations and the ability of our teams to continue to set a very strong pace on the drilling side of the business."

Our second quarter headlines. Strong well results, continued cost reductions, successful portfolio management. Our Oklahoma asset team delivered 2 outstanding STACK Meramec wells, with oil cuts above 70%, while continuing to balance leasehold demands with acreage delineation. 
This same team also closed our PayRock acquisition on Monday, just 6 weeks after announcing the deal, and are rapidly integrating that asset into our Oklahoma business. The team actually had a countdown calendar in the office as they marched towards the accelerated close date. Needless to say, they are excited and their focused efforts will ensure no loss of momentum.
We had an exceptional quarter in the Bakken, delivering a record well on our West Myrmidon acreage through a combination of great reservoir quality and enhanced completion design. The Bakken asset team has truly embraced this time of lower activity to prepare for what's next. They dropped their production costs materially and upped their game on well returns to place West Myrmidon in the mix for 2017 capital allocation.
The Eagle Ford continued seeing uplift from tighter stage spacing, while feeling the effects of a planned step-down in activity and challenging base production declines. And despite their move to higher intensity completions, their completed well costs are down significantly year-over-year.
Winning the production cost battle is hard work and typically measured in numerous but smaller victories. Rest assured that cost management remains front and center with all of our asset teams.
North America E&P production costs are down almost 30% from a year ago, and we've dropped their full year guidance by $1 per oil equivalent barrel. We've also reduced 2016 unit production expense guidance for international by $0.50 per oil equivalent barrel.
Through a combination of capital discipline and efficiency gains across all of our businesses, we'll deliver a 2016 capital program that's $100 million below our original budget, all while funding the incremental 2016 activity associated with our STACK acquisition, including the additional rig we'll add there this quarter.
Oklahoma is getting busy; with the acquisition, we will be doubling our activity in the STACK to 4 rigs in total.
Not to be outdone by North America's success, in our international business we achieved first gas from the B3 compression project in EG in July, on schedule and within budget. The project is fulfilling its mission to extend the Alba Field's production plateau by 2 years and the asset's life out beyond 2030. 
As our capital investment in the compression project falls away, EG will contribute significant free cash flow that we can reinvest in our deep inventory of high-return opportunities here in the U.S. resource plays.
On the portfolio management side. Our noncore asset sales program has now achieved over $1 billion year-to-date. And though we exceeded our initial target, we aren't done. Expect noncore asset sales to be ongoing as we continue optimizing our capital allocation to the lowest cost, highest margin opportunities.
On the other side of portfolio management, the 61,000 net acres we acquired in the STACK Meramec oil window ticks all the boxes: quality, scale, value and with further upside not assumed in the purchase price. Through this volatile and uncertain commodity price environment, we've been resolute in executing against our playbook, strengthening our balance sheet, resetting our cost structure, simplifying our portfolio, all with the goal of profitable growth within cash flows when sustainably higher prices give us the confidence to ramp activity. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Zach to begin the Q&A."

Hey, Ed, this is J.R. As we've talked, I think, on previous calls, even though we're focused here on ultimately being able to get that capital program up to a level to where we can resume the growth path, the balance sheet is still going to be important. I think we've got some maturities coming up here in October of '17 and again in March of '18. Sitting here today, it would appear to be the right allocation of capital might be just to wait, to be able to pay off those maturities when they're due. And that's one reason why I think we're maintaining the cash balance that we are today to give us that option. But we'll continue to look at other opportunities to be able to reduce overall gross debt. But right now, I think we're leaning toward just repaying those maturities when they're due."

And as you've mentioned, we're going to be putting a second rig to work there. The 2 rigs are going to be initially focused on protecting that valuable leasehold, but also looking toward continuing strategic, I'll say, delineation around the play as well. But in terms of economics and where those wells fall in our set of opportunities, there's no doubt that the STACK oil opportunities compete at the very top of our Tier 1 inventory.

We do have a bit of excess capacity there. I think one of the things that you would recognize in our activities to date. So for example, in the results we have reported this quarter, we've been transitioning to XL wells in our overpressured area to look at the value there. Those well results have been very compelling and we're very excited about those. We also purchased this acquisition on the oil-bias side based on the fact that they had among the very best productivity on a lateral-adjusted foot basis with very low capital costs, which together, create a great value opportunity for us.

But overall, it's clearly early in the STACK still. I mean, we're delineating the whole acreage, us and peers. Those well results we reported this quarter, the Irven John and Olive June, are excellent well results. Other XL wells are performing above that type curve. They're also only about 40 or 50 days into their total production, so I think we're going need to let those run a while. I think we're excited that they're above that curve and so there's certainly an opportunity for resource upgrade. We'll also have, as you might recall, a number of other XL wells in the third quarter and fourth quarter in that same Blaine County area from our heritage acreage we get to talk about. So when we get the breadth of those and they've matured a bit, it would be a more appropriate time for that. Turning to the Bakken, I think the well results we reported there are really remarkable this quarter. All off of the same pad, the 3 best -- among the 3 best wells put in the basin in the last 3 years, that really demonstrates what technology application, the right landings on the right combination is and we have inventory like that. Similarly, we like to see those mature, but there are other wells in that area that also perform well, which is why we were aggressive in that area. So I think we need to let those mature, but there -- I'd just echo source [ph] upgrade there driven by that. Lastly, Eagle Ford, we continue to be really pleased with the results of tighter stage basin, particularly in the oil areas in the upper and lower Eagle Ford, responding very well. We've got a breadth of wells there now, almost 75 wells in that group. So it's maturing, which gives us more confidence. And I think we recognize there will be a need to do a resource update in the not-too-distant future."

So I think we went last year from sort of unconstrained Austin Chalk, very quickly to 40-acre spacing in the Austin Chalk to try to find the bounds of productivity of that reservoir. I think what we've discovered over the last few quarters is that at 40-acre spacing, when we've had groups, really, our first groups of Austin Chalk wells together that are constrained, that the reservoir quality is very high. It's got a lot of natural fracturing, which we suspected but weren't certain of. And those wells are communicating laterally a bit. And that overall, we're going to get the best capital efficiency in the Austin Chalk at wider spacing. In that same time frame, we've also been testing the Upper Eagle Ford, really doubled the amount of our delineated acreage over that time in the Upper Eagle Ford. And recognize that it can -- we could backfill some of those Austin Chalk locations with Upper Eagle Ford, but both at wider spacing. They just interact better. But ultimately, we're looking for the highest recovery of hydrocarbon out of that unit at the lowest capital input. So we're trying to optimize the returns at the drilling unit level."

So there was probably a bit more bias to the conventional portfolio in the first half of the year. As we look forward to the second half of the year, that's going to largely be paced by the resource plays themselves. And that will really set the, I'll say, kind of that exit velocity that we achieved from a capital program standpoint as we move out of the year. We do anticipate, based on the activity we've described, including the additional rig in Oklahoma as well as some additional completion work in the Eagle Ford, that we will exit the fourth quarter with some pretty strong momentum going into 2017. To your point, I guess, on the rest of the portfolio, looking forward to 2017, you should expect us to continue to minimize the capital allocation to the conventional program, very similar to what we endeavored to do this cycle in 2016."

It's delivering very strong economics and performance in the portfolio. And it's simply going to add to the ability of Equatorial Guinea to add to our cash flows. I think a separate question, though, is more of the noncore asset question. We continue to scrutinize our portfolio and ensure that it is fully optimized. As I said in my opening remarks, we've achieved $1 billion year-to-date of noncore asset divestitures, but we believe there is more work to be done there. We don't think that will be to the scale of, say, a Wyoming, but we still believe there's some good solid portfolio work, particularly here in North America that we continue to drive.

I think conversely, if we see more constructive pricing moving into '17, at that $60 as we've talked about, a $10 move in pricing for us is a big impact on our operating cash flows. And we'd be looking to redeploy those pretty strongly back here into the U.S. resource plays to not only get back on sequential growth, but get back on that growth quite strongly if we saw that level of price support.

So speaking from a Marathon Oil perspective, we do expect to build some momentum going into the fourth quarter, which we think would position us quite favorably in the event we do see more constructive pricing, and I would say that there's probably many others within our space that are looking to do the same. There, of course, will always be an element that may have to be more in a balance sheet repair mode as opposed to kind of being on their front foot and looking to drive toward incremental activity.

And I think, too, you have to bear in mind that the rigs today are doing a lot more than the rigs did a year ago. And so we absolutely are taking advantage of that efficiency. In fact, in the Eagle Ford, we've actually gone down a rig in second quarter from 5 to 4 rigs, recognizing just the sheer efficiency of our drilling operations and the ability of our teams to continue to set a very strong pace on the drilling side of the business."

Our second quarter headlines. Strong well results, continued cost reductions, successful portfolio management. Our Oklahoma asset team delivered 2 outstanding STACK Meramec wells, with oil cuts above 70%, while continuing to balance leasehold demands with acreage delineation. 
This same team also closed our PayRock acquisition on Monday, just 6 weeks after announcing the deal, and are rapidly integrating that asset into our Oklahoma business. The team actually had a countdown calendar in the office as they marched towards the accelerated close date. Needless to say, they are excited and their focused efforts will ensure no loss of momentum.
We had an exceptional quarter in the Bakken, delivering a record well on our West Myrmidon acreage through a combination of great reservoir quality and enhanced completion design. The Bakken asset team has truly embraced this time of lower activity to prepare for what's next. They dropped their production costs materially and upped their game on well returns to place West Myrmidon in the mix for 2017 capital allocation.
The Eagle Ford continued seeing uplift from tighter stage spacing, while feeling the effects of a planned step-down in activity and challenging base production declines. And despite their move to higher intensity completions, their completed well costs are down significantly year-over-year.
Winning the production cost battle is hard work and typically measured in numerous but smaller victories. Rest assured that cost management remains front and center with all of our asset teams.
North America E&P production costs are down almost 30% from a year ago, and we've dropped their full year guidance by $1 per oil equivalent barrel. We've also reduced 2016 unit production expense guidance for international by $0.50 per oil equivalent barrel.
Through a combination of capital discipline and efficiency gains across all of our businesses, we'll deliver a 2016 capital program that's $100 million below our original budget, all while funding the incremental 2016 activity associated with our STACK acquisition, including the additional rig we'll add there this quarter.
Oklahoma is getting busy; with the acquisition, we will be doubling our activity in the STACK to 4 rigs in total.
Not to be outdone by North America's success, in our international business we achieved first gas from the B3 compression project in EG in July, on schedule and within budget. The project is fulfilling its mission to extend the Alba Field's production plateau by 2 years and the asset's life out beyond 2030. 
As our capital investment in the compression project falls away, EG will contribute significant free cash flow that we can reinvest in our deep inventory of high-return opportunities here in the U.S. resource plays.
On the portfolio management side. Our noncore asset sales program has now achieved over $1 billion year-to-date. And though we exceeded our initial target, we aren't done. Expect noncore asset sales to be ongoing as we continue optimizing our capital allocation to the lowest cost, highest margin opportunities.
On the other side of portfolio management, the 61,000 net acres we acquired in the STACK Meramec oil window ticks all the boxes: quality, scale, value and with further upside not assumed in the purchase price. Through this volatile and uncertain commodity price environment, we've been resolute in executing against our playbook, strengthening our balance sheet, resetting our cost structure, simplifying our portfolio, all with the goal of profitable growth within cash flows when sustainably higher prices give us the confidence to ramp activity. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Zach to begin the Q&A."

Hey, Ed, this is J.R. As we've talked, I think, on previous calls, even though we're focused here on ultimately being able to get that capital program up to a level to where we can resume the growth path, the balance sheet is still going to be important. I think we've got some maturities coming up here in October of '17 and again in March of '18.

And that's one reason why I think we're maintaining the cash balance that we are today to give us that option. But we'll continue to look at other opportunities to be able to reduce overall gross debt. But right now, I think we're leaning toward just repaying those maturities when they're due."

And as you've mentioned, we're going to be putting a second rig to work there. The 2 rigs are going to be initially focused on protecting that valuable leasehold, but also looking toward continuing strategic, I'll say, delineation around the play as well. But in terms of economics and where those wells fall in our set of opportunities, there's no doubt that the STACK oil opportunities compete at the very top of our Tier 1 inventory.

We do have a bit of excess capacity there. I think one of the things that you would recognize in our activities to date. So for example, in the results we have reported this quarter, we've been transitioning to XL wells in our overpressured area to look at the value there. Those well results have been very compelling and we're very excited about those. We also purchased this acquisition on the oil-bias side based on the fact that they had among the very best productivity on a lateral-adjusted foot basis with very low capital costs, which together, create a great value opportunity for us.

But overall, it's clearly early in the STACK still. I mean, we're delineating the whole acreage, us and peers. Those well results we reported this quarter, the Irven John and Olive June, are excellent well results. Other XL wells are performing above that type curve. They're also only about 40 or 50 days into their total production, so I think we're going need to let those run a while. I think we're excited that they're above that curve and so there's certainly an opportunity for resource upgrade. We'll also have, as you might recall, a number of other XL wells in the third quarter and fourth quarter in that same Blaine County area from our heritage acreage we get to talk about. So when we get the breadth of those and they've matured a bit, it would be a more appropriate time for that. Turning to the Bakken, I think the well results we reported there are really remarkable this quarter. All off of the same pad, the 3 best -- among the 3 best wells put in the basin in the last 3 years, that really demonstrates what technology application, the right landings on the right combination is and we have inventory like that. Similarly, we like to see those mature, but there are other wells in that area that also perform well, which is why we were aggressive in that area. So I think we need to let those mature, but there -- I'd just echo source [ph] upgrade there driven by that. Lastly, Eagle Ford, we continue to be really pleased with the results of tighter stage basin, particularly in the oil areas in the upper and lower Eagle Ford, responding very well. We've got a breadth of wells there now, almost 75 wells in that group. So it's maturing, which gives us more confidence. And I think we recognize there will be a need to do a resource update in the not-too-distant future."

So I think we went last year from sort of unconstrained Austin Chalk, very quickly to 40-acre spacing in the Austin Chalk to try to find the bounds of productivity of that reservoir. I think what we've discovered over the last few quarters is that at 40-acre spacing, when we've had groups, really, our first groups of Austin Chalk wells together that are constrained, that the reservoir quality is very high. It's got a lot of natural fracturing, which we suspected but weren't certain of. And those wells are communicating laterally a bit. And that overall, we're going to get the best capital efficiency in the Austin Chalk at wider spacing. In that same time frame, we've also been testing the Upper Eagle Ford, really doubled the amount of our delineated acreage over that time in the Upper Eagle Ford. And recognize that it can -- we could backfill some of those Austin Chalk locations with Upper Eagle Ford, but both at wider spacing. They just interact better. But ultimately, we're looking for the highest recovery of hydrocarbon out of that unit at the lowest capital input. So we're trying to optimize the returns at the drilling unit level."

So there was probably a bit more bias to the conventional portfolio in the first half of the year. As we look forward to the second half of the year, that's going to largely be paced by the resource plays themselves. And that will really set the, I'll say, kind of that exit velocity that we achieved from a capital program standpoint as we move out of the year. We do anticipate, based on the activity we've described, including the additional rig in Oklahoma as well as some additional completion work in the Eagle Ford, that we will exit the fourth quarter with some pretty strong momentum going into 2017.

I think a separate question, though, is more of the noncore asset question. We continue to scrutinize our portfolio and ensure that it is fully optimized. As I said in my opening remarks, we've achieved $1 billion year-to-date of noncore asset divestitures, but we believe there is more work to be done there.

So speaking from a Marathon Oil perspective, we do expect to build some momentum going into the fourth quarter, which we think would position us quite favorably in the event we do see more constructive pricing, and I would say that there's probably many others within our space that are looking to do the same. There, of course, will always be an element that may have to be more in a balance sheet repair mode as opposed to kind of being on their front foot and looking to drive toward incremental activity.

I'll make a few brief comments, then open the call for questions. Our key takeaways today are: excellent well results and strong execution in the third quarter while achieving cash flow neutrality;",516,"Thanks, Zach, and let me add my good morning to everyone. I'll make a few brief comments, then open the call for questions. Our key takeaways today are: excellent well results and strong execution in the third quarter while achieving cash flow neutrality; increasing rig activity in the fourth quarter within our original budget to prepare for sequential growth in the second half of 2017; and line of sight on 15% to 20% resource play CAGR at flat $55 WTI. Our total company third quarter production was above the top end of guidance and up sequentially. I'd like to recognize each of our asset teams for their contribution to this outcome. It's their hard work each and every day that delivers these outstanding results for our shareholders.
In the STACK and SCOOP, production was up over 50% from the prior quarter as we've benefited from new wells sales and a couple of months of contribution from our recent STACK acquisition. We continue to balance leasehold demands and acreage delineation in the STACK and brought some outstanding Meramec oil and the volatile oil wells to sales that are, on average, exceeding type curves on both our legacy and acquired acreage.
Our Bakken team delivered the best industry Three Forks well in the past 3 years on our East Myrmidon acreage, and extends the trend of basin leading [ph] performance set last quarter in West Myrmidon. The Eagle Ford asset team continued to drive down completed well costs. This quarter's wells averaged just under $4 million, further enhancing their outstanding returns. And our focus on the oil window at reduced stage spacing is improving the already strong economics in the play. 
Internationally, we had an excellent quarter, with Equatorial Guinea achieving their highest quarterly production since 2013, following the successful startup of the Alba B3 compression platform in July. That contributed to a 10% sequential increase in international E&P's quarterly production volumes. And OSM delivered record quarterly production in its lowest unit cost in the history of the mine.
On the portfolio side, we just sold some of our nonoperated waterflood and CO2 assets in West Texas and New Mexico for proceeds of $235 million before closing adjustments, which brings our total for noncore asset sales to over $1.5 billion since August of last year. You should expect portfolio management to continue as we drive to maximize capital allocation to our lowest-cost, highest-margin opportunities. 
With our ongoing noncore asset sales and recent STACK acquisition, our commitment to concentrating and simplifying our portfolio to the U.S. resource plays is clear. Couple that with the $5.3 billion of liquidity, including $2 billion of cash we have on our balance sheet, along with outstanding operational execution and a very competitive cost structure, we're poised to continue our execution momentum in 2017 and achieve profitable growth within cash flow at moderately higher prices. 
While our planning process is still underway, our preliminary 5-year view for resource play production supports a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 20% within cash flows at flat $55 WTI. 
With that, we can begin the Q&A."

As we meet those objectives over the next year or 2, from that point on, to the extent that we have free cash flow or cash flow to deploy, it's going to be done on the basis of the best risk adjusted return. And what we see today, of course, is that Eagle Ford is still very strongly competing. It  has some of the best economic returns in our portfolio. But with the recent results in the Bakken that we highlighted, including the East Myrmidon results this quarter, Bakken is now competing very strongly for capital allocation as well. So it's going to be a balance, it's going to be modulated based on our ability to deliver that within our means. But that's the way you should think about it.

I'll make a few brief comments, then open the call for questions. Our key takeaways today are: excellent well results and strong execution in the third quarter while achieving cash flow neutrality; increasing rig activity in the fourth quarter within our original budget to prepare for sequential growth in the second half of 2017; and line of sight on 15% to 20% resource play CAGR at flat $55 WTI. Our total company third quarter production was above the top end of guidance and up sequentially. I'd like to recognize each of our asset teams for their contribution to this outcome. It's their hard work each and every day that delivers these outstanding results for our shareholders.
In the STACK and SCOOP, production was up over 50% from the prior quarter as we've benefited from new wells sales and a couple of months of contribution from our recent STACK acquisition. We continue to balance leasehold demands and acreage delineation in the STACK and brought some outstanding Meramec oil and the volatile oil wells to sales that are, on average, exceeding type curves on both our legacy and acquired acreage.
Our Bakken team delivered the best industry Three Forks well in the past 3 years on our East Myrmidon acreage, and extends the trend of basin-leading performance set last quarter in West Myrmidon. The Eagle Ford asset team continued to drive down completed well costs. This quarter's wells averaged just under $4 million, further enhancing their outstanding returns. And our focus on the oil window at reduced stage spacing is improving the already strong economics in the play. 
Internationally, we had an excellent quarter, with Equatorial Guinea achieving their highest quarterly production since 2013, following the successful startup of the Alba B3 compression platform in July. That contributed to a 10% sequential increase in international E&P's quarterly production volumes. And OSM delivered record quarterly production in its lowest unit cost in the history of the mine.
On the portfolio side, we just sold some of our nonoperated waterflood and CO2 assets in West Texas and New Mexico for proceeds of $235 million before closing adjustments, which brings our total for noncore asset sales to over $1.5 billion since August of last year. You should expect portfolio management to continue as we drive to maximize capital allocation to our lowest-cost, highest-margin opportunities. 
With our ongoing noncore asset sales and recent STACK acquisition, our commitment to concentrating and simplifying our portfolio to the U.S. resource plays is clear. Couple that with the $5.3 billion of liquidity, including $2 billion of cash we have on our balance sheet, along with outstanding operational execution and a very competitive cost structure, we're poised to continue our execution momentum in 2017 and achieve profitable growth within cash flow at moderately higher prices. 
While our planning process is still underway, our preliminary 5-year view for resource play production supports a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 20% within cash flows at flat $55 WTI. 
With that, we can begin the Q&A."

But with the recent results in the Bakken that we highlighted, including the East Myrmidon results this quarter, Bakken is now competing very strongly for capital allocation as well.

But to your point on flexibility, the beauty of the short-cycle investments remains our ability to move and respond very quickly to the predominant price signals and price view that we have at that point in time.

I think the operator has done a great job of continuing to put pressure on operating costs. And the combination of all that delivered, again, a very exceptional unit operating cost there. And because our realizations off the back the upgrader are largely linked to WTI, with the small component to WCS, the asset does have a lot of cash flow potential. So I have to give a lot of credit to the operator in generating quite a strong quarter. Now as we look forward, even in the fourth quarter, we have planned turnaround that will ultimately, of course, volumes, which will have a feedback impact into the unit as well. So I wouldn't extrapolate the third quarter as the base business model. But what I would extrapolate is that our ability to generate higher reliability and lower costs in the mine. That trend is now becoming pretty well established. And I think that's just going to make the asset more valuable, not only to our shareholders, but certainly, in the event that, strategically, we elect to monetize at some point in the future."

Probably not fair to think about it at the same rate of change going into the next year, but we're going to continue to do that. And I think we've traditionally talked on the order of 50% commercial, 50% structural and efficiency gains across the total spend.

And we're going to continue to drive to lower the breakeven of our enterprise, which will serve us well regardless of the poor commodity price environment. 
And with that, I'll just end by saying thank you very much for joining us today."

I'll make a few brief comments, then open the call for questions. Our key takeaways today are: excellent well results and strong execution in the third quarter while achieving cash flow neutrality;",514,"Thanks, Zach, and let me add my good morning to everyone. I'll make a few brief comments, then open the call for questions. Our key takeaways today are: excellent well results and strong execution in the third quarter while achieving cash flow neutrality; increasing rig activity in the fourth quarter within our original budget to prepare for sequential growth in the second half of 2017; and line of sight on 15% to 20% resource play CAGR at flat $55 WTI. Our total company third quarter production was above the top end of guidance and up sequentially. I'd like to recognize each of our asset teams for their contribution to this outcome. It's their hard work each and every day that delivers these outstanding results for our shareholders.
In the STACK and SCOOP, production was up over 50% from the prior quarter as we've benefited from new wells sales and a couple of months of contribution from our recent STACK acquisition. We continue to balance leasehold demands and acreage delineation in the STACK and brought some outstanding Meramec oil and the volatile oil wells to sales that are, on average, exceeding type curves on both our legacy and acquired acreage.
Our Bakken team delivered the best industry Three Forks well in the past 3 years on our East Myrmidon acreage, and extends the trend of basin-leading performance set last quarter in West Myrmidon. The Eagle Ford asset team continued to drive down completed well costs. This quarter's wells averaged just under $4 million, further enhancing their outstanding returns. And our focus on the oil window at reduced stage spacing is improving the already strong economics in the play. 
Internationally, we had an excellent quarter, with Equatorial Guinea achieving their highest quarterly production since 2013, following the successful startup of the Alba B3 compression platform in July. That contributed to a 10% sequential increase in international E&P's quarterly production volumes. And OSM delivered record quarterly production in its lowest unit cost in the history of the mine.
On the portfolio side, we just sold some of our nonoperated waterflood and CO2 assets in West Texas and New Mexico for proceeds of $235 million before closing adjustments, which brings our total for noncore asset sales to over $1.5 billion since August of last year. You should expect portfolio management to continue as we drive to maximize capital allocation to our lowest-cost, highest-margin opportunities. 
With our ongoing noncore asset sales and recent STACK acquisition, our commitment to concentrating and simplifying our portfolio to the U.S. resource plays is clear. Couple that with the $5.3 billion of liquidity, including $2 billion of cash we have on our balance sheet, along with outstanding operational execution and a very competitive cost structure, we're poised to continue our execution momentum in 2017 and achieve profitable growth within cash flow at moderately higher prices. 
While our planning process is still underway, our preliminary 5-year view for resource play production supports a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 20% within cash flows at flat $55 WTI. 
With that, we can begin the Q&A."

As we meet those objectives over the next year or 2, from that point on, to the extent that we have free cash flow or cash flow to deploy, it's going to be done on the basis of the best risk adjusted return. And what we see today, of course, is that Eagle Ford is still very strongly competing. It has some of the best economic returns in our portfolio. But with the recent results in the Bakken that we highlighted, including the East Myrmidon results this quarter, Bakken is now competing very strongly for capital allocation as well. So it's going to be a balance, it's going to be modulated based on our ability to deliver that within our means. But that's the way you should think about it. First and foremost, our strategic objectives in Oklahoma, and then, we're going to allocate based on the best risk-adjusted return."

And quite frankly, our internal price forecasts are shaped to reflect that, a bit lower in the front half and a bit higher in the back half of the year. But to your point on flexibility, the beauty of the short-cycle investments remains our ability to move and respond very quickly to the predominant price signals and price view that we have at that point in time. So our view was that this was a step toward delivering on our sequential growth in the second half of '17, but as we see the macro environment turn a different way, we've got significant flexibility to adjust our capital program as well as look at our cost structure, in general. So we're not concerned necessarily with this latest softening of pricing, but we do need to be mindful of where the macro and our overarching objective of staying cash flow positive or neutral in 2017."

We've talked about before, the increases that we see -- have seen from tighter stage spacing that's 200 feet versus 250, showing initial uplift in the 15% to 20% range.

I think the operator has done a great job of continuing to put pressure on operating costs. And the combination of all that delivered, again, a very exceptional unit operating cost there. And because our realizations off the back the upgrader are largely linked to WTI, with the small component to WCS, the asset does have a lot of cash flow potential. So I have to give a lot of credit to the operator in generating quite a strong quarter. Now as we look forward, even in the fourth quarter, we have planned turnaround that will ultimately, of course, volumes, which will have a feedback impact into the unit as well. So I wouldn't extrapolate the third quarter as the base business model. But what I would extrapolate is that our ability to generate higher reliability and lower costs in the mine. That trend is now becoming pretty well established. And I think that's just going to make the asset more valuable, not only to our shareholders, but certainly, in the event that, strategically, we elect to monetize at some point in the future."

Probably not fair to think about it at the same rate of change going into the next year, but we're going to continue to do that. And I think we've traditionally talked on the order of 50% commercial, 50% structural and efficiency gains across the total spend. It's probably a little bit higher weighted to the structural and the operating side, with things like the water handling system that we've put in the Bakken, moving our water on pipe there.

be aware that we're participating in a number of outside-operated infill programs, one in that kind of general areas, the Clover infill, which is going to be testing a tighter spacing, a higher density. And so the overall concept, I guess, I would say for the Yoast is, let's go out and prove out our base case assumptions, with leverage learnings from that along with our outside-operated infills, take those learnings throughout 2017. We'll, no doubt, have a number of other infill tests and we'll test different concepts, both in terms of staggering vertically and well density within the section. And we'll take those learnings throughout '17 and then move into more of a full field development mode after that."

I'll make a few brief comments, then open the call for questions. Our key takeaways today are: excellent well results and strong execution in the third quarter while achieving cash flow neutrality;",514,"Thanks, Zach, and let me add my good morning to everyone. I'll make a few brief comments, then open the call for questions. Our key takeaways today are: excellent well results and strong execution in the third quarter while achieving cash flow neutrality; increasing rig activity in the fourth quarter within our original budget to prepare for sequential growth in the second half of 2017; and line of sight on 15% to 20% resource play CAGR at flat $55 WTI. Our total company third quarter production was above the top end of guidance and up sequentially. I'd like to recognize each of our asset teams for their contribution to this outcome. It's their hard work each and every day that delivers these outstanding results for our shareholders.
In the STACK and SCOOP, production was up over 50% from the prior quarter as we've benefited from new wells sales and a couple of months of contribution from our recent STACK acquisition. We continue to balance leasehold demands and acreage delineation in the STACK and brought some outstanding Meramec oil and the volatile oil wells to sales that are, on average, exceeding type curves on both our legacy and acquired acreage.
Our Bakken team delivered the best industry Three Forks well in the past 3 years on our East Myrmidon acreage, and extends the trend of basin-leading performance set last quarter in West Myrmidon. The Eagle Ford asset team continued to drive down completed well costs. This quarter's wells averaged just under $4 million, further enhancing their outstanding returns. And our focus on the oil window at reduced stage spacing is improving the already strong economics in the play. 
Internationally, we had an excellent quarter, with Equatorial Guinea achieving their highest quarterly production since 2013, following the successful startup of the Alba B3 compression platform in July. That contributed to a 10% sequential increase in international E&P's quarterly production volumes. And OSM delivered record quarterly production in its lowest unit cost in the history of the mine.
On the portfolio side, we just sold some of our nonoperated waterflood and CO2 assets in West Texas and New Mexico for proceeds of $235 million before closing adjustments, which brings our total for noncore asset sales to over $1.5 billion since August of last year. You should expect portfolio management to continue as we drive to maximize capital allocation to our lowest-cost, highest-margin opportunities. 
With our ongoing noncore asset sales and recent STACK acquisition, our commitment to concentrating and simplifying our portfolio to the U.S. resource plays is clear. Couple that with the $5.3 billion of liquidity, including $2 billion of cash we have on our balance sheet, along with outstanding operational execution and a very competitive cost structure, we're poised to continue our execution momentum in 2017 and achieve profitable growth within cash flow at moderately higher prices. 
While our planning process is still underway, our preliminary 5-year view for resource play production supports a compound annual growth rate of 15% to 20% within cash flows at flat $55 WTI. 
With that, we can begin the Q&A."

As we meet those objectives over the next year or 2, from that point on, to the extent that we have free cash flow or cash flow to deploy, it's going to be done on the basis of the best risk-adjusted return. And what we see today, of course, is that Eagle Ford is still very strongly competing. It has some of the best economic returns in our portfolio. But with the recent results in the Bakken that we highlighted, including the East Myrmidon results this quarter, Bakken is now competing very strongly for capital allocation as well. So it's going to be a balance, it's going to be modulated based on our ability to deliver that within our means. But that's the way you should think about it.

I think the STACK acquisition that we did in the summer is indicative of a type of opportunity we will continue to test and evaluate. But in that case, in the case of the STACK acquisition, it really ticked all boxes for us. It was quality, scale. It offered value that could deliver full-cycle returns, and it also offered a very attractive upside. And really, any opportunity, any resource capture opportunity would have to compete on that same basis and come into the portfolio immediately to compete for capital allocation. So it's a relatively high bar to make that occur. And again, we're very happy with the organic inventory.

I think, fundamentally, Guy, we think that supply and demand are starting to come more in the balance. I think it's taking much longer than many anticipated. We've always viewed 2016 as a very transitional year. I think as we look out to 2017, I would kind of characterize it as a recovery year, where we think that likely, we'll see supply demand come more into balance as we get later in the year. And quite frankly, our internal price forecasts are shaped to reflect that, a bit lower in the front half and a bit higher in the back half of the year. But to your point on flexibility, the beauty of the short-cycle investments remains our ability to move and respond very quickly to the predominant price signals and price view that we have at that point in time. So our view was that this was a step toward delivering on our sequential growth in the second half of '17, but as we see the macro environment turn a different way, we've got significant flexibility to adjust our capital program as well as look at our cost structure, in general. So we're not concerned necessarily with this latest softening of pricing, but we do need to be mindful of where the macro and our overarching objective of staying cash flow positive or neutral in 2017."

And because our realizations off the back the upgrader are largely linked to WTI, with the small component to WCS, the asset does have a lot of cash flow potential. So I have to give a lot of credit to the operator in generating quite a strong quarter. Now as we look forward, even in the fourth quarter, we have planned turnaround that will ultimately, of course, volumes, which will have a feedback impact into the unit as well. So I wouldn't extrapolate the third quarter as the base business model. But what I would extrapolate is that our ability to generate higher reliability and lower costs in the mine.

I think what we would say for starters is certainly encouraged with the aggregate performance being about 30% over the type curve. We're strongly in delineation mode and protecting our valuable leaseholds. So not surprisingly, we're going to see a little bit of variability in results, but the wells are delivering expected oil rates. They're delivering oil cuts within the range that we expected based on the wells drilled prior to the acquisition. We've seen a little bit of variability in the GOR, but certainly, too early to draw any conclusions from the limited data set that we have there and encouraged by the early results relative to the type curve."

As you rightly point out, the 6 wells infilling Yoast is consistent with kind of our base case assumption as the acquisition. Also 
be aware that we're participating in a number of outside-operated infill programs, one in that kind of general areas, the Clover infill, which is going to be testing a tighter spacing, a higher density. And so the overall concept, I guess, I would say for the Yoast is, let's go out and prove out our base case assumptions, with leverage learnings from that along with our outside-operated infills, take those learnings throughout 2017. We'll, no doubt, have a number of other infill tests and we'll test different concepts, both in terms of staggering vertically and well density within the section. And we'll take those learnings throughout '17 and then move into more of a full field development mode after that."

Thank, everyone, for your questions today, and certainly, your interest in Marathon Oil. Our investment case continues to strengthen, with visibility on competitive long-term growth within cash flows, at moderate pricing. The depth and quality of inventory in 3 of the best oil basins, a very competitive cost structure, balance sheet strength, certainly continued concentration, simplification of the portfolio and a peer leading leverage to oil. We are squarely focused on those aspects of our business that we control, our execution and our costs. And we're going to continue to drive to lower the breakeven of our enterprise, which will serve us well regardless of the poor commodity price environment.
