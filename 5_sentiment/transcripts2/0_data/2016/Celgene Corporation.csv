As we reported, 2015 was an outstanding year for Celgene. We appreciate the opportunity to review with you these exceptional results and important strategic developments and our near- and longer-term outlooks. 
Our operating momentum and advancement of the high-potential programs have us well positioned to produce market-leading growth in 2016 and beyond. Very importantly, during 2015, we advanced a number of key strategic initiatives that will drive significant growth over the next decade. We enhanced and provided greater clarity on the potential of REVLIMID. We firmly established the value proposition of OTEZLA while significantly expanding our I&I franchise. We strengthened the long-term growth potential of our Hematology and Oncology franchise through strategic immuno-oncology collaborations and by advancing important late-stage clinical programs. And we broadened and deepened our research and development pipeline as the investments we made in internal and integrated collaborative research programs advanced. These significant accomplishments, combined with our strong finish to the year, generates excellent momentum in our businesses as we head into 2016. Later in the call, Peter, Jackie and Scott will more fully review the outstanding results of the year and the strong commercial momentum across geographies and products that has us well positioned to achieve 4 products with sales over $1 billion, each expected to grow by double-digit percentages in 2016. Mark will conclude with his perspective on strategic initiatives and upcoming milestones. These milestones position us to sustain high growth for the long term. And as I hoped you can tell, this is an incredibly exciting time at Celgene, and our people are critical to maximizing our enormous potential. 
Earlier this month, we announced management changes that leverage the talent and experience of our exceptional leaders while expanding and strengthening our team. These changes provide Mark, Jackie, Scott, Peter and Rupert, all outstanding leaders, the opportunity to have an even greater impact on our organization. Since announcing these changes, our teams across the globe are energized and even more focused and committed to producing exceptional results. 
I could not be more excited about the future of Celgene. Together with Mark, our entire leadership team and all of our employees around the globe, we look forward to continuing to deliver exceptional results and turning the great promise of Celgene into reality. 
Thank you. Let me now turn the call over to Peter."

Our teams around the globe delivered robust financial results while also advancing and acquiring further next-generation growth drivers. In fact, 2015 was an exceptional",1301,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. 2015 was another great year for Celgene. Our teams around the globe delivered robust financial results while also advancing and acquiring further next-generation growth drivers. In fact, 2015 was an exceptional year of significant strategic investments. We strengthened our portfolio in several key focus areas, including immuno-oncology and epigenetics, in addition to laying the foundation to be a future leader in inflammatory bowel disease. 
While delivering strong commercial results, we made critical investments now so that we are set up to deliver sustainable, high-growth performance well into the next decade. 
Now let's discuss the financial results for the quarter and the year. The fourth quarter total net product sales grew 24%. Our 4 key products, REVLIMID, POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA, grew 28%, driven by continued momentum in core indications, label expansions and global launches. 
Now while Jackie and Scott will provide more color on the underlying market dynamics for these products later in the call, I would like to highlight just 2 items. First, full-year product sales grew 21% and were supported by greater diversification. Now as you have seen, revenue continues growing 14% to 16% per year, and it now represents 63% of product sales versus 67% in 2013. We expect this performance, as well as diversification trend, will continue right through 2020 and beyond. 
Secondly, U.S. Abraxane sales and international REVLIMID sales were positively impacted during the quarter by buying patterns. For ABRAXANE, contract optimization led to a customary buy-in during Q4, as we've seen before, and that is often followed by sell-through during Q1. As we mentioned on our Q3 conference call, 2015 was the first year of REVLIMID sales in Russia via a tender. These occurred in Q2 and in Q4, and we now expect the similar buying pattern going forward. 
Product sales growth for the quarter and the year remained volume-driven. The foreign exchange markets remained volatile throughout the year, resulting in an unfavorable net ForEx impact of $16 million to revenue during Q4 and $109 million for the year. Now our Treasury team really did an excellent job mitigating this headwind. And as reference and just for perspective, if we did not have the benefit of our hedging program, the ForEx impact would have been approximately $100 million during Q4 alone and approximately $450 million for the year. As you can see, the ForEx is a large factor that has been well-managed in 2015. 
Adjusted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.18, which includes a $0.07 per share impact for milestone to our partner, OncoMed, that we announced earlier. As a reminder, after entering into a collaboration, we include milestone payments and other collaborating expenses within our adjusted financial measures. Now of course, we are pleased with how our partner programs are progressing and the potential conservation they can have on our longer-term outlook. That's good news. 
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was up $4.71, a strong 27% increase over the prior year and even more impressive considering that it includes a $0.17 per share dilutive impact related to business development activities. And of course, that includes the $0.14 per share dilutive impact related to the Receptos acquisition this past summer. 
As we discussed on the Q3 call, we excepted a significant ramp in R&D spend during the fourth quarter, and in fact, this happened and resulted in 25% of Q4 sales being reinvested in R&D. This is due to increased clinical trial activity for our important, high-potential, late-stage programs and the collaboration-related milestone expense that we just discussed. And please note, Q4 was the first full quarter with Receptos operations as part of our organization. All these investments are critical to creating our long-term growth profile that extends well into the next decade. 
On the other hand, as we also discussed last quarter, after investing in our global commercial capabilities over the past few years to support the global launches for ABRAXANE, POMALYST and OTEZLA, we are now achieving meaningful leverage on the SG&A line. 
Our earnings quality remains exceptional, with growth for the quarter and year driven primarily by adjusted operating income, further underscoring the momentum in our commercial business. During the quarter, we experienced the full impact of last year's $8 billion debt offering, which adds an incremental $310 million of interest expense per year. Accordingly, on an annual basis, we continue to expect total net interest expense will be between $480 million and $500 million per year going forward. 
We ended the year with approximately $6.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. And throughout the year, we had certainly utilized our balance sheet and cash flow to invest in next-generation growth drivers while simultaneously repurchasing approximately $3.3 billion of Celgene shares. This is the largest annual level of repurchase in the history of Celgene, an impressive fact given the numerous other key strategic investments made during 2015. And it reflects our continued confidence in the company's future and our continued support of shareholders' interest. 
Now earlier this month, we provided 2016 guidance that calls for continued strong top line performance and a leveraged bottom line outlook. This positions us to continue as the leader in growth among large biotechs. We expect total net product sales between $10.5 billion and $11 billion, a 17% increase from 2015. This range incorporates an approximately $120 million net ForEx impact that predominantly affects international REVLIMID sales. While we do not provide total revenue guidance, I would just like to highlight the royalty-bearing sales of [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] by Novartis have decreased significantly over the past few years due to generic competition in certain markets, and we expect that trend to accelerate further in 2016. 
Turning to the adjusted operating margin. We expect a 150 basis point improvement, driven by meaningful leverage in SG&A and a slight improvement in the product gross margin due to mix. Of course, we'll continue to invest in the commercial launches of our key products just to maximize their global potential, and in particular, as we build out our I&I commercial capabilities in Europe, to further capitalize on the growing momentum of OTEZLA. We also expect to increase our level of R&D investment as we initiate 50 new clinical trials across the pipeline and expand the number of Phase III programs. Included in adjusted research and above and expense are milestone payments to partners. These are projected to range between $130 million and $140 million for the year. 
Moving to the bottom line and for the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $5.50 and $5.70, a 19% increase from 2015. Now we are off to a very strong start this year, and we anticipate Q1 adjusted earnings per share between $1.27 and $1.30. This is a 20% year-over-year growth, and this represents earning 23% of our full year EPS guidance, a better start versus historical Q1 performance as a percentage of the full year than we've seen. Now this guidance does include 2 items in the quarter. First, as you know, during Q1, we typically have higher gross to net adjustments with REVLIMID and POMALYST due to early Medicare donors hold and other ACA payments, in addition to the potential sell-through of inventory for vaccine in the U.S. We expect these same patterns in 2016. And second, we now expect several potential partner milestones to be achieved in the first quarter, resulting in between $50 million and $75 million of milestones to partners. 
Building on this great 2015, we look forward to another strong year in 2016 as our operating momentum continues and we advance the next generation of growth drivers that have the potential to maintain our growth profile into the next decade. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie."

Our Hematology and Oncology teams around the world and across all of our activities delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2015 with strong momentum. 
The franchise grew 18% year-over-year in Q4 and 16% for the full year to reach just under $8.7 billion of product revenues, a record year. And our strong growth trajectory will continue in 2016 and beyond. In 2016, we will see the first full year of revenues following launches for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma in U.S, Germany, Spain and other countries. And we expect reimbursement approvals and launches in France, Italy, Japan and others. We will see the first full year revenues for POMALYST in Japan following the June 2015 launch there. 
In addition, demand is being fueled by increasing durations of treatment across all lines of therapy in myeloma. ABRAXANE growth outside the U.S. is very solid, with nice momentum postlaunch in pancreatic cancer. 
2016 will also be a year that kicks off a steady multiyear flow of clinical data across a number of our late-stage programs, with the first to readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program coming in the middle of the year for the remarks diffuse large B-cell trial. We continue to build our hematology pipeline with programs currently enrolling for the novel compounds, luspatercept, AG-221 and [indiscernible], and the program for AG-120 is advancing. 
Finally, a number of trials are ongoing for new indications for Abraxane as well as for Abraxane in immuno-oncology combinations therapies. 
REVLIMID's year-over-year growth accelerated in Q4 with 18% growth for the quarter, including negative foreign exchange of about 1 percentage point. REVLIMID's full year growth reached 16.5%, including 2 percentage points of negative foreign exchange. This growth is primarily volume-driven. 
The ongoing launches of the newly diagnosed myeloma indication in the U.S. and across several markets in Europe are in the early stages and are fueling volume growth. REVLIMID is the market leader in first-line myeloma in the U.S., and in Q4, we hit another new all-time high for a number of unique patients treated. REVLIMID's share in second line myeloma in the U.S. was stable throughout 2015. 
European overall nonstemcell transplant newly diagnosed myeloma share reached around 15% at the end of 2015 with Germany at over 20%. Across Europe, REVLIMID held or gained second line share. Duration of treatment trends are positive across all geographies, supported by an ever-growing body of clinical data in favor of continuous treatment with REVLIMID. 
With the momentum of the newly diagnosed myeloma launch in Europe and reimbursement in Russia, our REVLIMID European region year-over-year volume growth accelerated and reached 26% in Q4 and 19% for the full year. That excellent volume growth was somewhat offset by negative price and foreign exchange impacts. 
The future growth outlook is strong, as 2016 will include the first full year of revenues post the newly diagnosed myeloma launch for REVLIMID in a number of markets, including the U.S., across Europe and Japan. And we expect to continue to obtain reimbursement approvals in more countries in 2016. And REVLIMID's future looks bright for a long time to come. In the U.S., the NCCN guidelines were recently updated and now include the RVD triplet regimen as a Category 1 preferred treatment for first-line myeloma patients in both the stem cell transplant and nonstem cell transplant settings. 
In 2016, we will see the readout of the REMARC trial  in diffuse B-cell large lymphoma, and our overall program for REVLIMID in lymphoma will continue to advance. 
Finally, within the FUSION program under our collaboration with AstraZeneca/MedImmune, the REVLIMID combination for newly diagnosed myeloma will begin enrollment in a Phase I proof-of-concept trial that will inform next steps for advancing [indiscernible] in newly diagnosed myeloma accommodation therapies. 
POMALYST/IMNOVID achieved strong sequential year-over-year growth to finish 2015, up 45% for both Q4 and the full year, and 95% of POMALYST/IMNOVID's 2015 growth came from volume. 
POMALYST third line and greater share in the U.S. showed an upward trend in the second half of 2015, and duration of treatment increased. IMNOVID overall EU market share in both the third- and fourth-line myeloma has now reached about 1/3, and durations of treatment are increasing in Europe as well. 
We look forward to the first full year of POMALYST revenues in Japan during 2016 after a strong launch in June of 2015 and strong demand uptake. 
Emerging data for POMALYST/IMNOVID triplet combinations support longer durations of treatment, and a number of combination trials where the POMALYST/IMNOVID and novel agents are ongoing, including immuno-oncology combinations for Phase I data presented at ASH were highly encouraging were relapsed/refractory myeloma patients with higher overall response rates versus today's standard of care therapy. Our POMALYST combination trial for relapsed/refractory myeloma has initiated and recently enrolled its first patient. 
ABRAXANE had a very good quarter in Q4 and finished 2015 strong with 16% [ph] year-over-year growth for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Importantly, volume growth was 18% and 16%, respectively, and was achieved despite the highly competitive landscape in some indications and geographies. 
The ABRAXANE [indiscernible] combination continues to hold the standard of care position for pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and is moving to that position in Europe with strong uptake and ongoing launches in various markets. 
During the second half of 2015, ABRAXANE U.S. shares in lung and breast were stable, and the launch of the lung indication in Europe is in its early stages. 
Emerging data's providing signs that ABRAXANE's feature in immuno-oncology combination therapies will be exciting. We have now seen promising early data for both lung and breast, and we expect significant dataflow beginning in 2017 with 2 Phase III readouts in lung and then triple negative breast readouts to follow in 2018. Other programs for ABRAXANE also continue to advance across adjuvant and locally advanced pancreas, both triple negative and early-stage breast and a number of patients segments in non-small cell lung cancer. We are optimistic about ABRAXANE's future growth prospects and the potential of the product in immuno-oncology combinations. 
Building on the strong momentum created by our teams during 2015, we look forward to another year of both excellent sales growth and advanced clinical programs in 2016. We expect REVLIMID sales to grow to $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, up 15% at the midpoint of the range and driven by volume again this year. 
POMALYST, IMNOVID and ABRAXANE are both expected to officially reach blockbuster drug status by each surpassing the $1 billion revenue mark this year, and volumes will also contribute the majority of their growth. Our regulatory and clinical teams have very full agendas this year. On the submissions  side, we expect to submit REVLIMID for poststem cell transplant maintenance in both the U.S. and EU. POMALYST/IMNOVID updated label with impairment data in both the U.S. and EU and ABRAXANE for early-stage breast cancer in the EU. 
On the clinical side, we expect data from the REMARC, CONTINUUM, ETNA and tnAcity trials. 
In addition, we expect proof-of-concept data for CC-122 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for the been TRx TLR 8 agonists in solid tumors. Furthermore, we are advancing a number of clinical programs, including the Phase III trials for luspatercept, AG-221 and AG-120, our broad program across multiple hematological indications for [indiscernible] and our novel BCMA program for myeloma. 
We are excited about our short-term growth outlook and near-term clinical and regulatory catalysts as well as the significant promise of the mid- to long term based on a number of key milestones to come. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In 2015, we saw revenues accelerating throughout the year in the U.S. We had approvals in the EU for both psoriasis and PsA and launched in early EU reimbursement countries. 
We also significantly advanced pipelines for Celgene I&I with the acquisition of Receptos in lead molecule, Ozanimod, as well as taking major steps forward in the GED-301 development program. 
We now look a global sales, we concede 2015 Q4 net sales were $183 million, leading to full year sales of $472 million. The majority of revenues in 2015 were from the U.S., where we are seeing very encouraging metrics. In early launch of countries in the U as well as Canada. Overall, we are pleased with how the global launch of executed in 2015, the first full year of commercialization for OTEZLA, and we believe it provides a tremendous base as we move into 2016 and beyond. 
Now looking specifically at the U.S. Position consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness, patient request and trial lists. The launch of the DTC campaign in late Q2 corresponded with an inflection of the OTEZLA TRx trajectory. It is important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies new to brand share with approximately 40% in both psoriasis and PsA. 
Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the largest psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 21% of the total branded market. 
Now turning to Europe. We received regulatory approval for OTEZLA early in 2015 and already launched in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Scotland. We look to launch in the remainder of the significant European markets in 2016. As I stated earlier, we are seeing very encouraging trends in all the early launch markets and are particularly pleased with our progress in Germany. 
In 2016, we should see a continuing flow of data for OTEZLA. As mentioned earlier in the year at the JP Morgan conference, we recently received the 2-year radiographic data from the Phase III and closing spotlighting study. Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, we are encouraged by the date our, which showed a lack of progression of disease for a majority of patients. In addition to seeing these data in the major medical meeting in 2016, we also hope to get data from the Phase II proof-of-concept studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis as well as data to support our QB formulation. 
We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-301 and Ozanimod. Specifically looking to GED 0301, in 2015, we initiated the endoscopic study, CB-001, in Crohn's disease as well as the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's Disease trial CB-002 and the Phase II proof-of-concept study in UC. 
During 2015, we also acquired Receptos with its lead molecule, Ozanimod, a potential best-in-class, next-generation S1P move receptor modulator. Postacquisition, we were able to work closely with the talented people of Receptos to accelerate both the MS and UC programs. The radius and SUNBEAM Phase III rigorous clinical trials are now fully enrolled and ahead of schedule. We expect to file for MS in the second half of 2017. 
We also initiated the pivotal Phase III UC trial to North and a Phase II proof-of-concept study of Ozanimod in the treatment of Crohn's disease. 
2015 was a year of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA lodges put it in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio in 2016 and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through significant milestones in 2015. These programs should help drive strong growth through 2020 and beyond. 
We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into 2016. 
Thank you for your attention, and I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark."

As we transition to 2016, the clarity of our mission, the continuity of our leadership team and our focus on advancing key strategic imperatives continues to energize and unify us. 
Our robust 2016 guidance and 2020 outlook are built on a strong foundation of global commercial, clinical, regulatory and research operating excellence. The competitive advantages our products and teams have achieved provide us with considerable optionality and multiple strategic drivers to meet and exceed our near-term financial targets. 
Longer term, we expect significant additional revenue from new data and new indication for existing commercial portfolio, plus the introduction of several products currently in late-stage development to sustain our sales base through the loss of exclusivity for key products. Our long focus on internal research and external collaborations has generated a pipeline of approximately 50 unique molecules, many with transformative first-in-class clinical profiles and with the potential to be developed for more than 100 indications. These products are expected to fuel innovation and to create significant growth opportunities over the next 10 to 15 years. 
Moreover, we expect our consistently strong cash flow to provide additional opportunities to fortify our pipeline and enhance our outlook. 
Near-term catalysts for growth include the availability of data from at least 18 different Phase III trials beginning in the middle of this year and continuing through mid-2018. Strategically, these studies also represent the opportunity to expand our hematology franchise to include lymphomas, to advance our immuno-oncology programs in multiple solid tumors and blood cancers, and with GED-301, [indiscernible] and OTEZLA, to establish clear global leadership in the treatment of serious inflammatory bowel diseases. Other ongoing programs for AG-221, CC-46 and luspatercept may provide additional opportunities for near-term growth. 
And over the next 12 to 24 months, we expect a steady stream of mid-stage and proof-of-concept data to begin to establish the clinical profiles of molecules generated from distributed and integrated research and drug development model. Importantly, these products and programs leverage or build on our established therapeutic franchises and may also support the creation of new franchises. 
We know that our future begins with delivery on the results and the promise of 2016. We look forward to providing with more detail throughout the year on our progress achieving our top financial and operational priorities and on our efforts to bring new disruptive therapies to patients in need.

So on a constant currency basis, we are on track, maybe McFee different than we originally thought but feel really good. That said, ForEx has been volatile and since the time of that guidance was issued in January 2013. And actually, if you went from that time today, you're probably seeing, net of hedges, about an $800 million impact on the top line. So we are kind of calibrating on that. And we do intend to provide an update as we get closer to 2017 based on where these ForEx rates will land in 2017. So thanks for the question. I would also add, just for what it's worth, we also added, obviously, in the beginning of 2015 our guidance out to 2020.

And it remains entirely on track despite the implied ForEx impact. I mean, clearly ForEx, has been affecting that outlook, too, but our operating performance in that timeframe we think will overcome that. So just for perspective, from the time of the guidance into 2020, there's about a $700 million, $800 million headwind as well, but we're good to cover that. We feel very good about that. And then obviously, on the bottom line, we are making significant investments in R&D. We have to see how this develops and so forth as well as some of the muscles the company. So our feeling is, in total, we really kind of gone over organization hitting these '16 numbers driving towards 2020, and we'll be updating that 2017 as we get closer to the year with sort of like the next year ahead of us."

So I think what we're seeing with the POM performance in Q4 is the ongoing impact of penetration in Europe. You probably heard what I said in my prepared remarks where the product now in the third and fourth lines in Europe has reached about 1/3, and that's happened over a period of time. Also we had the launch of POM that started in Japan in June, and we've seen very, very nice uptake in Japan in the first 6 or 7 months of being on the market there. I also think the treatment landscape is starting to maybe settle out a little bit, although you've got [indiscernible] coming in just now and just now starting to ramp up. Within this landscape, the POM regimen is very competitively positioned as it's the only regimen that has proven survival after REVLIMID relapse and exposure to the protozoal inhibitor. So we are seeing early uptick for [indiscernible] right in that fourth line in greater setting coming we're seeing the rest of the landscape start to play out as we got the other combinations that have been approved. I think it's a bit early to call trends on triplet adoption broadly in relapsed/refractory myeloma, but with the sequencing patterns, we're going to see more of that. And we think POM is very well positioned to compete there. You're also probably getting a little bit of an impact of [indiscernible] moving into second line there relative share gains, with greater in second line than any other line of therapy, as you would expect. And I think that creates even more potentially more room in the third line greater setting for these other therapies to take their places."

Obviously, if you had a statistically significant OS the trend right out of the gate, that would be extremely positive. And that's not our base case assumptions. But we think with a positive PFS readout in some trend on OS that, that would put us in a very good position with the regulators. As you know, it's a high unmet medical need.

So what we're seeing in the market, both in the U.S. and Europe, are increasing duration of trends for both REVLIMID and POMALYST. Those are continuing to go very nicely. Europe is still somewhat behind the U.S. I think we've talked about first exposure durations in the U.S. now being somewhere over 17 months, total exposure now over 22 months, continues to trend in a positive direction. The range across Europe is somewhere now in the 12 to 14 months. So you can see a ways to go for Europe to catch up. And now with the newly diagnosed approval, we should see that trajectory maybe steepen a little bit and continue. We're also seeing nice duration gains for POMALYST as well, and I think we'll see those across Europe over time and we'll see them in Japan. So the body of clinical data that continues to evolve is supportive for early and continuous treatment of myeloma with REVLIMID and then a strong backbone therapy across any of the triplets that we've seen so far, including in combination with monoclonal antibodies."

And I think that we'll see that happen over a period of time. These numbers that we give you are always averages across a big portfolio of patients. So you can't expect that an average data point is just going to jump up from one data to the next, and it will be a cumulative thing. So every time we get a newly diagnosed patients on drug, and then newly diagnosed patient is staying on drug for a longer period of time, there's a cumulative effect of that in the portfolio, and that average starts going up, and that average data point, of course, is applied to all the patients in the whole portfolio, and it becomes pretty big number. What we saw in the U.S. If we go back to the ASH data that came out, I think it was in 2009, and we started to see more move towards continuous treatment of paradigm is over time, after a few years, duration became the larger driver of growth in the U.S. And at some point, that will happen in Europe but will play out over a few years. So I think the great news is that multiple drivers, particularly in Europe and then in Japan, you've got a more relatively higher impact from market share gains in new diagnosed early on. The duration then starts to kick in, and then that plays out over time. And so you've got multiple factors driving growth, and it'll do so for a long, long period of time."

We feel highly confident in our long-term growth prospects and what we think duration trends are going to be. We also have been pleased with the reimbursement discussions for newly diagnosed label expansion for REVLIMID in Europe. And now that we've got those countries on board, and we'll have the remaining large ones in 2016, we go forward from that in a very good position with respect to having already negotiated REVLIMID price. So as other therapies come to market and all the clinical data supports longer duration of treatment. So we feel really good about that. Have we fully updated our financial forecast to reflect what the full opportunity of that could be? We have not because we want to give this a little bit of time to just settle in, see what physicians are saying now with all the new treatments that have come to market, a bit more of that slug [ph] data and other things. And we've got -- we also are in a situation that Peter mentioned with the FX headwind. We have puts and takes in the financial model that makes us such that we already gave 2020 in the middle of the December, and we increased despite the big FX numbers that Peter put out there.

So in terms of number of cycles, I mean, I think we're roughly in line with what we would have expected. That's not a big driver. As you know, the -- we've had headwinds, particularly in the U.S., with the launches of the checkpoint inhibitors. In the second half of 2015, it actually felt like that, that stabilized a little bit. You get very rapid uptake when something new comes to market. So we saw a little bit more stable shares in the second half of 2015, which I'd takes as a good sign. Outside the U.S. growth is quite solid mostly driven by the pancreatic ongoing launches where it's still pretty early days in some countries. They still don't have reimbursement in all of the top 5 countries in Europe. So that's going extremely well, and there's still room from a shared gains standpoint for us to establish ABRAXANE standard of care in Europe and taken in the U.S. So lung launch in Europe is in very early days. So in the near-term, that stronger growth outside the U.S. is going to contribute to giving -- putting us in a solid position with respect to the overall global growth while the rest of these things play out. So just with respect to the couple of things that you highlighted, I think, pretty obviously, assuming that the combination data is positive, you've got the potential for ABRAXANE to be the backbone of chemotherapy in multiple indications in I/O combination regimens. So that would, longer term, be the more significant upside. At the same time, the adjuvant pancreas trial is our trial so fully within our management. And as you probably know, that indication could double or potentially more than double the size of the pancreas opportunity for ABRAXANE versus the one that we have today. So those are a couple of things that we are pretty optimistic about. And then for the next year or so until we see some of that Phase III I/O data in 2017, we're holding our own and doing really pretty well."

We got a lot accomplished when you think about the deal with AstraZeneca to get into the checkpoint inhibitors base, with Juno, then obviously was up to us and then other deals are equally important. It was a very full agenda for the year. And quite frankly, we are, in anyway, slowing down or backing down at all on that. It's with a cushion of what options UC there. It's really a question of as they come along and do the right opportunities within ourselves. But we remain very focused on building the next generation of great assets. We are scanning causally what the next generation technology will be. And we find that we happen to be very fortunately working between our hematology and ecology space in the I&I area, and therapeutic areas or scientific areas where scientists opening up, a lot of great technology coming through so we want to make sure we're positioned against that. But we don't really work with the pace necessarily or any one budget. We just make sure that we're availing ourselves of what's out there. Clearly, from a financial perspective, we have the financial strength to work with everybody.

I mean, what we see in our environment within the U.S. where we are, for the moment, able to continue to take reasonable price increases on notably REVLIMID and POMALYST. We are quite conscious of linking those to the value proposition of the drugs. And we think we have a very good case to make in that regard. For the long-term forecast, we have somewhat more moderate assumptions about the level of price increases that we would take in the U.S. over a period of time. What we've seen this year is that outside of the U.S., and notably, as we made our way through newly diagnosed label expansion negotiations in Europe, we had price decreases across the portfolio that were pretty much in line with where we expected them to be. But versus a year ago, they were a little bit more this year as we made our way through those negotiations. So globally, when you add all those things together, and Peter showed some numbers on one of his slides for the overall portfolio, that went a little bit of a positive impact on the overall portfolio this year. But that includes mix as well and the ongoing growth in the IMiD OTEZLA coming into the portfolio. When you -- if you strip that out, the global impact of price altogether is relatively modest."

So we were able to, I think, very successfully penetrate the market. Access is a barrier in this marketplace. It's a highly managed category. There's no question. But we continue to chip away on that access environment and I think the important to note is there is a limited exceptions to the 2 Biologics step rule, those that have it, because they want to be able to encourage patient to be able to get on ultimate therapy, biologic therapy is not appropriate. And so the interesting thing sort of approved is really in the data. But I think about the beta, more than 80% of patients in the psoriasis markets that are coming on OTEZLA are not coming from a biologic. So the access things are there, but there are exceptions to be able to get around that. And we have not found access to be a significant burden on to drive demand. We would like that axis and the a preferred position as we go forward. The critical thing for navigating the axis environment as driving demand, driving volume, as I said earlier, the most successful first year revenue launch in the I&I space ever.

As we reported, 2015 was an outstanding year for Celgene. We appreciate the opportunity to review with you these exceptional results and important strategic developments and our near- and longer-term outlook.
Our operating momentum and advancement of the high-potential programs have us well positioned to produce market-leading growth in 2016 and beyond. Very importantly, during 2015, we advanced a number of key strategic initiatives that will drive significant growth over the next decade. We enhanced and provided greater clarity on the potential of REVLIMID. We firmly established the value proposition of OTEZLA, while significantly expanding our I&I franchise.
We strengthened the long-term growth potential of our Hematology and Oncology franchise through strategic immuno-oncology collaborations and by advancing important late-stage clinical programs. And we broadened and deepened our research and development pipeline as the investments we made in internal and integrated collaborative research programs advanced. These significant accomplishments, combined with our strong finish to the year, generates excellent momentum in our businesses as we head into 2016.
Later in the call, Peter, Jackie and Scott will more fully review the outstanding results of the year and the strong commercial momentum across geographies and products that has us well positioned to achieve 4 products with sales over $1 billion, each expected to grow by double-digit percentages in 2016. Mark will conclude with his perspective on strategic initiatives and upcoming milestones. These milestones position us to sustain high growth for the long term. And as I hoped you can tell, this is an incredibly exciting time at Celgene, and our people are critical to maximizing our enormous potential.
Earlier this month, we announced management changes that leverage the talent and experience of our exceptional leaders, while expanding and strengthening our team. These changes provide Mark, Jackie, Scott, Peter and Rupert, all outstanding leaders, the opportunity to have an even greater impact on our organization. Since announcing these changes, our teams across the globe are energized and even more focused and committed to producing exceptional results.
I could not be more excited about the future of Celgene. Together with Mark, our entire leadership team and all of our employees around the globe, we look forward to continuing to deliver exceptional results and turning the great promise of Celgene into reality. 
Thank you. Let me now turn the call over to Peter."

Our teams around the globe delivered robust financial results, while also advancing and acquiring further next-generation growth drivers. In fact, 2015 was an exceptional year of significant strategic investments. We strengthened our portfolio in several key focus areas, including immuno-oncology and epigenetics, in addition to laying the foundation to be a future leader in inflammatory bowel disease.
While delivering strong commercial results, we made critical investments now so that we are set up to deliver sustainable, high-growth performance well into the next decade. 
Now let's discuss the financial results for the quarter and the year. The fourth quarter total net product sales grew 24%. Our 4 key products, REVLIMID, POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA, grew 28%, driven by continued momentum in core indications, label expansions and global launches. 
Now while Jackie and Scott will provide more color on the underlying market dynamics for these products later in the call. I would like to highlight just 2 items.
First, full-year product sales grew 21% and were supported by greater diversification. Now as you have seen, revenue continues growing 14% to 16% per year, and it now represents 63% of product sales versus 67% in 2013. We expect this performance, as well as diversification trend, will continue right through 2020 and beyond.
Secondly, U.S. ABRAXANE sales and international REVLIMID sales were positively impacted during the quarter by buying patterns. For ABRAXANE, contract optimization led to a customary buy-in during Q4, as we've seen before, and that is often followed by sell-through during Q1. As we mentioned on our Q3 conference call, 2015 was the first year of REVLIMID sales in Russia via a tender. These occurred in Q2 and in Q4, and we now expect a similar buying pattern going forward.
Product sales growth for the quarter and the year remained volume-driven. The foreign exchange markets remained volatile throughout the year, resulting in an unfavorable net ForEx impact of $16 million to revenue during Q4 and $109 million for the year. Now our Treasury team really did an excellent job mitigating this headwind. And just as reference and just for perspective, if we did not have the benefit of our hedging program, the ForEx impact would have been approximately $100 million during Q4 alone and approximately $450 million for the year. As you can see, the ForEx is a large factor that has been well-managed in 2015.
Adjusted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.18, which includes a $0.07 per share impact for milestone to our partner, OncoMed, that we announced earlier. As a reminder, after entering into a collaboration, we include milestone payments and other collaborating expenses within our adjusted financial measures. Now of course, we are pleased with how our partner programs are progressing and the potential contributions they can have on our longer-term outlook. That's good news.
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $4.71, a strong 27% increase over the prior year and even more impressive considering that it includes a $0.17 per share dilutive impact related to business development activities. And of course, that includes the $0.14 per share dilutive impact related to the Receptos acquisition this past summer.
As we discussed on the Q3 call, we excepted a significant ramp in R&D spend during the fourth quarter, and in fact, this happened. And resulted in 25% of Q4 sales being reinvested in R&D. This is due to increased clinical trial activity for our important, high-potential, late-stage programs and the collaboration-related milestone expense that we just discussed. And please note, Q4 was the first full quarter with Receptos operations as part of our organization. All these investments are critical to creating our long-term growth profile that extends well into the next decade.
On the other hand, as we also discussed last quarter, after investing in our global commercial capabilities over the past few years to support the global launches for ABRAXANE, POMALYST and OTEZLA, we are now achieving meaningful leverage on the SG&A line.
Our earnings quality remains exceptional, with growth for the quarter and year driven primarily by adjusted operating income, further underscoring the momentum in our commercial business. During the quarter, we experienced the full impact of last year's $8 billion debt offering, which adds an incremental $310 million of interest expense per year. Accordingly, on an annual basis, we continue to expect total net interest expense will be between $480 million and $500 million per year going forward.
We ended the year with approximately $6.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. And throughout the year, we had certainly utilized our balance sheet and cash flow to invest in next-generation growth drivers, while simultaneously repurchasing approximately $3.3 billion of Celgene shares. This is the largest annual level of repurchase in the history of Celgene, an impressive fact given the numerous other key strategic investments made during 2015. And it reflects our continued confidence in the company's future and our continued support of shareholders' interest.
Now earlier this month, we provided 2016 guidance that calls for continued strong top line performance and a leveraged bottom line outlook. This positions us to continue as the leader in growth among large biotechs. We expect total net product sales between $10.5 billion and $11 billion, a 17% increase from 2015. This range incorporates an approximately $120 million net ForEx impact that predominantly affects international REVLIMID sales. While we do not provide total revenue guidance, I would just like to highlight the royalty-bearing sales of Ritalin and Focalin by Novartis have decreased significantly over the past few years due to generic competition in certain markets. And we expect that trend to accelerate further in 2016.
Turning to the adjusted operating margin. We expect a 150 basis point improvement, driven by meaningful leverage in SG&A and a slight improvement in the product gross margin due to mix. Of course, we'll continue to invest in the commercial launches of our key products just to maximize their global potential, and in particular, as we build out our I&I commercial capabilities in Europe, to further capitalize on the growing momentum of OTEZLA. We also expect to increase our level of R&D investment as we initiate 50 new clinical trials across the pipeline and expand the number of Phase III programs. Included in adjusted research and development expense are milestone payments to partners. These are projected to range between $130 million and $140 million for the year.
Moving to the bottom line and for the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $5.50 and $5.70, a 19% increase from 2015. Now we are off to a very strong start this year. And we anticipate Q1 adjusted earnings per share between $1.27 and $1.30. This is a 20% year-over-year growth, and this represents earning 23% of our full year EPS guidance, a better start versus historical Q1 performance as a percentage of the full year than we've seen. Now this guidance does include 2 items in the quarter. First, as you know, during Q1, we typically have higher gross to net adjustments with REVLIMID and POMALYST due to early Medicare donors hold and other ACA payments, in addition to the potential sell-through of inventory for vaccine in the U.S.  We expect these same patterns in 2016. And second, we now expect several potential partner milestones to be achieved in the first quarter, resulting in between $50 million and $75 million in milestones to partners.
Building on this great 2015, we look forward to another strong year in 2016 as our operating momentum continues and we advance the next generation of growth drivers that have the potential to maintain our growth profile into the next decade. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie."

Our Hematology and Oncology teams around the world and across all of our activities delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2015 with strong momentum.The franchise grew 18% year-over-year in Q4 and 16% for",1273,"Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. Our Hematology and Oncology teams around the world and across all of our activities delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2015 with strong momentum.
The franchise grew 18% year-over-year in Q4 and 16% for the full year to reach just under $8.7 billion of product revenues, a record year. And our strong growth trajectory will continue in 2016 and beyond. In 2016, we will see the first full year of revenues following launches for REVLIMID and newly diagnosed myeloma in the U.S, Germany, Spain and other countries. And we expect reimbursement approvals and launches in France, Italy, Japan and others. We will see the first full year revenues for POMALYST in Japan following the June 2015 launch there.
In addition, demand is being fueled by increasing durations of treatment across all lines of therapy in myeloma. ABRAXANE growth outside the U.S. is very solid, with nice momentum post-launch in pancreatic cancer.
2016 will also be a year that kicks off a steady multiyear flow of clinical data across a number of our late-stage programs, with the first readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program coming in the middle of the year for the REMARC diffuse large B-cell lymphoma trial. We continue to build our hematology pipeline with programs currently enrolling for the novel compounds, luspatercept, AG-221 and durvalumab, and the program for AG-120 is advancing. 
Finally, a number of trials are ongoing for new indications for ABRAXANE as well as for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapies.
REVLIMID's year-over-year growth accelerated in Q4 with 18% growth for the quarter, including negative foreign exchange of about 1 percentage point. REVLIMID's full year growth reached 16.5%, including 2 percentage points of negative foreign exchange. This growth is primarily volume-driven.
The ongoing launches of the newly diagnosed myeloma indication in the U.S. and across several markets in Europe are in the early stages and are fueling volume growth. REVLIMID is the market leader in first-line myeloma in the U.S., and in Q4, we hit another new all-time high for a number of unique patients treated. REVLIMID's share in second line myeloma in the U.S. was stable throughout 2015.
European overall non stem-cell transplant newly diagnosed myeloma share reached around 15% at the end of 2015 with Germany at over 20%. Across Europe, REVLIMID held or gained second line share. Duration of treatment trends are positive across all geographies, supported by an ever-growing body of clinical data in favor of continuous treatment with REVLIMID.
With the momentum of the newly diagnosed myeloma launch in Europe and reimbursement in Russia, our REVLIMID European region year-over-year volume growth accelerated and reached 26% in Q4 and 19% for the full year. That excellent volume growth was somewhat offset by negative price and foreign exchange impacts.
The future growth outlook is strong, as 2016 will include the first full year of revenues post the newly diagnosed myeloma launch for REVLIMID in a number of markets, including the U.S., across Europe and Japan. And we expect to continue to obtain reimbursement approvals in more countries in 2016. And REVLIMID's future looks bright for a long time to come. In the U.S., the NCCN guidelines were recently updated and now include the RVD triplet regimen as a Category 1 preferred treatment for first-line myeloma patients in both the stem-cell transplant and non stem-cell transplant settings. 
In 2016, we will see the readout of the REMARC trial  in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our overall program for REVLIMID in lymphoma will continue to advance.
Finally, within the FUSION program under our collaboration with AstraZeneca/MedImmune, the REVLIMID durvalumab combination for newly diagnosed myeloma will begin enrollment in a Phase I proof-of-concept trial that will inform next steps for advancing durvalumab in newly diagnosed myeloma in combination therapy.
POMALYST/IMNOVID achieved strong sequential year-over-year growth to finish 2015, up 45% for both Q4 and the full year, and 95% of POMALYST/IMNOVID's 2015 growth came from volume.
POMALYST third line and greater share in the U.S. showed an upward trend in the second half of 2015, and duration of treatment increased. IMNOVID overall EU market share in both the third- and fourth-line myeloma has now reached about 1/3, and durations of treatment are increasing in Europe as well.
We look forward to the first full year of POMALYST revenues in Japan during 2016 after a strong launch in June of 2015 and strong demand uptake. 
Emerging data for POMALYST/IMNOVID triplet combinations support longer durations of treatment, and a number of combination trials with POMALYST/IMNOVID and novel agents are ongoing, including immuno-oncology combinations for Phase I data presented at ASH were highly encouraging were relapsed/refractory myeloma patients with higher overall response rates versus today's standard of care therapy. Our POMALYST durvalumab combination trial for relapsed/refractory myeloma has initiated and recently enrolled its first patient.
ABRAXANE had a very good quarter in Q4 and finished 2015 strong with 15% year-over-year growth for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Importantly, volume growth was 18% and 16%, respectively, and was achieved despite a highly competitive landscape in some indications and geographies.
The ABRAXANE/Gemcitabine combination continues to hold the standard of care position for pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and is moving to that position in Europe with strong uptake and ongoing launches in various markets.
During the second half of 2015, ABRAXANE U.S. shares in lung and breast were stable, and the launch of the lung indication in Europe is in its early stages.
Emerging data is providing signs that ABRAXANE's feature in immuno-oncology combination therapies will be exciting. We have now seen promising early data for both lung and breast, and we expect significant dataflow beginning in 2017 with 2 Phase III readouts in lung and then triple negative breast readouts to follow in 2018. Other programs for ABRAXANE also continued to advance across adjuvant and locally advanced pancreas, both triple negative and early-stage breast and a number of patients segments in non-small cell lung cancer. We are optimistic about ABRAXANE's future growth prospects and the potential of the product in immuno-oncology combinations.
Building on the strong momentum created by our teams during 2015, we look forward to another year of both excellent sales growth and advancing of our clinical programs in 2016. We expect REVLIMID sales to grow to $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, up 15% at the midpoint of the range and driven by volume again this year.
POMALYST, IMNOVID and ABRAXANE are both expected to officially reach blockbuster drug status by each surpassing the $1 billion revenue mark this year, and volumes will also contribute the majority of their growth. Our regulatory and clinical teams have very full agendas this year. On the submissions  side, we expect to submit REVLIMID for post stem-cell transplant maintenance in both the U.S. and EU. POMALYST/IMNOVID updated label with renal impairment data in both the U.S. and EU and ABRAXANE for early-stage breast cancer in the EU.
On the clinical side, we expect data from the REMARC, CONTINUUM, ETNA and tnAcity trials.
In addition, we expect proof-of-concept data for CC-122 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for the VentiRx TLR8 agonist in solid tumors. Furthermore, we are advancing a number of clinical programs, including the Phase III trials for luspatercept, AG-221 and AG-120, our broad program across multiple hematological indications for durvalumab and our novel BCMA program for myeloma.
We are excited about both our short-term growth outlook and near-term clinical and regulatory catalysts, as well as the significant promise of the mid- to long-term based on a number of key milestones to come.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In 2015, we saw revenues accelerating throughout the year in the U.S. We had approvals in the EU for both psoriasis and PsA and launched in early EU reimbursement countries.
We also significantly advanced a development pipeline for Celgene I&I with the acquisition of Receptos in lead molecule, Ozanimod, as well as taking major steps forward in the GED-301 development program.
We now look at global sales, we concede 2015 Q4 net sales were $183 million, leading to full year sales of $472 million. The majority of revenues in 2015 were from the U.S., where we are seeing very encouraging metrics. In the early launch countries in the EU as well as Canada. Overall, we are pleased with how the global launch was executed in 2015, the first full year of commercialization for OTEZLA. And we believe it provides a tremendous base as we move into 2016 and beyond.
Now looking specifically at the U.S. Positioning consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness, patient request and trial lists. The launch of the DTC campaign in late Q2 corresponded with an inflection of the OTEZLA TRx trajectory. It is important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies in new to brand share, with approximately 40% in both psoriasis and PsA. 
Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 21% of the total branded market.
Now turning to Europe. We received regulatory approval for OTEZLA early in 2015 and already launched in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Scotland. We look to launch in the remainder of the significant European markets in 2016. As I stated earlier, we are seeing very encouraging trends in all the early launch markets and are particularly pleased with our progress in Germany.
In 2016, we should see continuing flow of data for OTEZLA. As mentioned earlier in the year at the JP Morgan conference, we recently received the 2-year radiographic data from the Phase III ankylosing spondylitis study. Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, we are encouraged by this data, which showed a lack of progression of disease for a majority of patients. In addition to seeing these data in the major medical meeting in 2016, we also hope to get data from the Phase II proof-of-concept studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis as well as data to support our QB formulation.
We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-0301 and Ozanimod. Specifically looking to GED-0301, in 2015, we initiated the endoscopic study, CB-001, in Crohn's disease as well as the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's Disease trial CB-002 and the Phase II proof-of-concept study in UC.
During 2015, we also acquired Receptos with its lead molecule, Ozanimod, a potential best-in-class, next-generation S1P move receptor modulator. Postacquisition, we were able to work closely with the talented people of Receptos to accelerate both the MS and UC programs. The RADIANCE and SUNBEAM Phase III MS clinical trials are now fully enrolled and ahead of schedule. We expect to file for MS in the second half of 2017.
We've also initiated a pivotal Phase III UC trial to North and a Phase II proof-of-concept study of Ozanimod in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
2015 was a year of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio in 2016 and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through significant milestones in 2015. These programs should help drive strong growth through 2020 and beyond.
We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into 2016. 
Thank you for your attention, and I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark."

As we transition to 2016, the clarity of our mission, the continuity of our leadership team and our focus on advancing key strategic imperatives continues to energize and unify us.
Our robust 2016 guidance and 2020 outlook are built on a strong foundation of global commercial, clinical, regulatory and research operating excellence. The competitive advantages our products and teams have achieved provide us with considerable optionality and multiple strategic drivers to meet and exceed our near-term financial targets.
Longer term, we expect significant additional revenue from new data and new indication for existing commercial portfolio, plus the introduction of several products currently in late-stage development to sustain our sales base through the loss of exclusivity for key products. Our long focus on internal research and external collaborations has generated a pipeline of approximately 50 unique molecules, many with transformative first-in-class clinical profiles and with the potential to be developed for more than 100 indications. These products are expected to fuel innovation and to create significant growth opportunities over the next 10 to 15 years.
Moreover, we expect our consistently strong cash flow to provide additional opportunities to fortify our pipeline and enhance our outlook. 
Near-term catalysts for growth include the availability of data from at least 18 different Phase III trials beginning in the middle of this year and continuing through mid-2018. Strategically, these studies also represent the opportunity to expand our hematology franchise to include lymphomas, to advance our immuno-oncology programs in multiple solid tumors and blood cancers, and with GED-0301, Ozanimod  and OTEZLA, to establish clear global leadership in the treatment of serious inflammatory bowel diseases. Other ongoing [indiscernible] programs for AG-221, CC-46 and luspatercept may provide additional opportunities for near-term growth.
And over the next 12 to 24 months, we expect a steady stream of mid-stage and proof-of-concept data to begin to establish the clinical profiles of enough molecules generated from distributed and integrated research and drug development model. Importantly, these products and programs leverage or build on our established therapeutic franchises and may also support the creation of new franchises.
We know that our future begins with delivery on the results and the promise of 2016. We look forward to providing with more details throughout the year on our progress achieving our top financial and operational priorities and on our efforts to bring new disruptive therapies to patients in need.

So on a constant currency basis, we are on track, maybe that makes a little different than we originally thought but feel really good. That said, ForEx has been volatile and since the time of that guidance was issued in January 2013. And actually, if you went from that time to today, we're probably seeing, net of hedges, about an $800 million impact on the top line. So we are kind of calibrating on that. And we do intend to provide an update as we get closer to 2017 based on where these ForEx rates will reflect in [indiscernible] in 2017. So thanks for the question. I would also add, just for what it's worth, we also added, obviously, in the beginning of 2015 our guidance out to 2020. And clearly, we are making a lot of investments to drive towards that, and we feel very good. Now we updated it last summer, after the Receptos and the AstraZeneca deal. And we reaffirmed it earlier this month. And it remains entirely on track despite the implied ForEx impact. I mean, clearly ForEx, has been affecting that outlook, too. But our operating performance in that timeframe we think will overcome that. So and just for perspective, from the time that we gave that guidance into 2020, there's about a $700 million, $800 million headwind as well, but we're good to cover that. We feel very good about that. And then obviously, on the bottom line, we are making significant investments in R&D. We have to see how those develop and so forth and as well as some of the milestones that come through.

So I think mostly what we're seeing with the POM performance in Q4 is the ongoing impact of penetration in Europe. You probably heard what I said in my prepared remarks, where the product now in the third and fourth lines in Europe has reached about 1/3, and that's happened over a period of time. Also, we had the launch of POM that started in Japan in June, and we've seen very, very nice uptake in Japan in the first 6 or 7 months of being on the market there. I also think the treatment landscape is starting to maybe settle out a little bit, although you've got dara [ph] coming in just now and just now starting to ramp up. Within this landscape, the Pom/dex regimen is very competitively positioned as it's the only regimen that has proven survival after REVLIMID relapse and exposure to a proteasome inhibitor. So we are seeing early uptick for dara [ph] right in that fourth line in greater setting and we're seeing the rest of the landscape start to play out as we've got the other combinations that have been approved. I think it's a bit early to call trends on triplet adoption broadly in relapsed/refractory myeloma, but with the sequencing patterns, we're going to see more of that. And we think POM is very well positioned to compete there. You're also probably getting a little bit of an impact of carfilzomib moving into second line there relative share gains, we're greater in second line than any other line of therapy, as you would expect. And I think that creates even potentially more room in the third line greater setting for these other therapies to take their places."

With the trial, what we would expect to see with the readout would be obviously the PFS result and then a trend in OS. I think I -- we believe that if there's a positive trend in OS then it will depend on the strength of the trend that, that will be something that the regulators could view favorably with respect to the submission. Obviously, if you had a statistically significant OS, the trend right out of the gate, that would be extremely positive. And that's not our base case assumption. But we think with a positive PFS readout in some trend on OS that, that would put us in a very good position with the regulators. As you know, it's a high unmet medical need. You've got a significant relapse rate in diffuse large B-cell, and most of it occurs within 2 years. The patient prognosis is quite bad upon relapse. There is no currently accepted maintenance therapies. There's no data to support maintenance therapies right now.

So what we're seeing in the market, both in the U.S. and Europe, are increasing duration trends for both REVLIMID and POMALYST. Those are continuing to go very nicely. Europe is still somewhat behind the U.S. I think we've talked about first exposure durations in the U.S. now being somewhere over 17 months, total exposure now over 22 months continues to trend in a positive direction. The range across Europe is somewhere now in the 12 to 14 months. So you can see ways to go for Europe to catch up. And now with the newly diagnosed approval, we should see that trajectory maybe steepen a little bit and continue. We're also seeing nice duration gains for POMALYST as well, and I think we'll see those across Europe over time and we'll see them in Japan. So the body of clinical data that continues to evolve is supportive for early and continuous treatment of myeloma with REVLIMID and then a strong [indiscernible] image in backbone therapy across any of the triplets that we've seen so far, including in combination with the monoclonal antibodies."

And I think that we'll see that happen over a period of time. These numbers that we give you are always averages across a big portfolio of patients. So you can't expect that an average data point is just going to jump up from one day to the next, then it will be a cumulative thing. So every time we get a newly diagnosed patient on drug, and the net newly diagnosed patient is staying on drug for a longer period of time, there's a cumulative effect of that in the portfolio, and that average starts going up, and that average data point, of course, is applied to all the patients in the whole portfolio, and it becomes pretty big numbers. What we saw in the U.S., if we go back to the ASH data that came out, I think it was in 2009, and we started to see more move towards this continuous treatment paradigm is over time, after a few years, duration became the larger driver of growth in the U.S. And at some point, that will happen in Europe, but that will play out over a few years. So I think the great news is that multiple drivers, particularly in Europe and then in Japan, you've got a more relatively higher impact from market share gains in newly diagnosed early on. The duration then starts to kick in, and then that plays out over time. And so you've got multiple factors driving growth, and it'll do so for a long, long period of time."

We've now got the triplet regimens approved in the relapsed setting, and this is going to play out over a period of time. We feel highly confident in our long-term growth prospects and what we think duration trends are going to be. We also have been pleased with the reimbursement discussions for newly diagnosed label expansion for REVLIMID in Europe. And now that we've got those countries on board, and we'll have the remaining large ones in 2016, we go forward from that in a very good position with respect to having already negotiated REVLIMID's price. So as other therapies come to market and all the clinical data supports longer duration of treatment. So we feel really good about that. Have we fully updated our financial forecast to reflect what the full opportunity of that could be? We have not. Because we want to give this a little bit of time to just settle in, see what physicians are saying now with all the new treatments that have come to market, socialized a bit more of that SWOG data and other things. And we've got -- we also are in a situation that Peter mentioned with the FX headwind, we got puts and takes in the financial model that makes us such that we already gave an update on 2020 in the middle of December, and we increased it despite the big FX numbers that Peter put out there. So I think that all of these trends and where we are in the market also set us up very well in terms of how we think about the development of our next-generation of novel agents and molecules. And a bit of this also would -- could relate to the evolving non-Hodgkin's landscape as well. But when you look at CC-122, CC-220, the BCMA, durvalumab and the things that we are moving along, I think we're in an excellent position to not only continue to evolve the treatment paradigms for patients, but to see those results in a very robust portfolio of products.

So in terms of number of cycles, I mean, I think we're roughly in line with what we would have expected. That's not a big driver. As you know, the -- we've had headwinds, particularly in the U.S., with the launches of the checkpoint inhibitors. In the second half of 2015, it actually felt like that, that stabilized a little bit. You get very rapid uptake when something new comes to market. So we saw a little bit more stable shares in the second half of 2015, which I take as a good sign. Outside the U.S. growth is quite solid, mostly driven by the pancreatic ongoing launches where it's still pretty early days than in some countries. They still don't have reimbursement in all of the top 5 countries in Europe. So that's going extremely well, and there's still room for -- from a shared gains standpoint for us to establish ABRAXANE [indiscernible] as standard of care in Europe and it take -- essentially in some places taken in the U.S. The Lung launch in Europe is in very early days. So in the near-term, that stronger growth outside the U.S. is going to contribute to giving -- putting us in a solid position with respect to overall global growth, while the rest of these things play out. So just with respect to the couple of things that you highlighted, I think, pretty obviously, assuming that the [indiscernible] combination data is positive, you've got the potential for ABRAXANE to be the backbone chemotherapy in multiple indications in I/O combination regimen. So that would, longer term, be the more significant upside. At the same time, the adjuvant pancreas trial is our trial, so that's fully within our management. And as you probably know, that indication could double or potentially more than double the size of the pancreas opportunity for ABRAXANE versus the one that we have today. So those are a couple of things that we are pretty optimistic about. And then for the next year or so until we see some of that Phase III I/O data in 2017, we're holding our own and doing really pretty well."

And then we'll the opportunity to evaluate that for some period of time before we make the opt-in decision.

As a matter of fact, it's the highest revenue first full year launch in I&I ever. So really, really tremendous first year and momentum that we generated in the U.S. That was, as I stated in the prepared remarks was $472 million, the vast majority of that was U.S. We're really launching in Europe this year, and Japan the year after. So we were able to, I think, very successfully penetrate the market. Access is a barrier in this marketplace. It's a highly managed category. There's no question, but we've continued to chip away that access environment. And I think the important thing to note is that payers have implemented exceptions to the 2 biologic step rule, those that have it, because they want to be able to encourage patients to be able to get on ultimate therapy if the biologic therapy is not appropriate. And so the interesting thing, sort of the proof is really in the data. When I think about the data, more than 80% of patients in the psoriasis markets that are coming on OTEZLA are not coming from a biologic. So the access things are there, but there are exceptions to be able to get around that. And we have not found access to be a significant burden on [indiscernible] to drive demand. We would like to evolve that axis and maybe be in a preferred position as we go forward. But critical thing for navigating the axis environment is driving demand, driving volume. And as I said earlier, the most successful first year revenue launch in the I&I space ever. So we're very pleased with where we're at."

And we think that even in the current environment, the PFS data supports that greater adoption. You've also potentially seen in smart guidelines just as one example, get updated where RVD has replaced some RD for newly diagnosed under those guidelines. So you can already see a positive reception to that data just based on the strength of the data. On a go-forward basis, I think that Velcade going generic, given just on the strength of the efficacy data for the RVD regimen is going to put the regimen in a very good position in a number of geographies with respect to adoption. And I think it's going to be highly competitive regimen. And when you think about the other triplets coming along, they are all going to have to find a way to show their value proposition in that landscape."

As we reported, 2015 was an outstanding year for Celgene. We appreciate the opportunity to review with you these exceptional results and important strategic developments and our near- and longer-term outlook.
Our operating momentum and advancement of the high-potential programs have us well positioned to produce market-leading growth in 2016 and beyond. Very importantly, during 2015, we advanced a number of key strategic initiatives that will drive significant growth over the next decade. We enhanced and provided greater clarity on the potential of REVLIMID. We firmly established the value proposition of OTEZLA, while significantly expanding our I&I franchise.
We strengthened the long-term growth potential of our Hematology and Oncology franchise through strategic immuno-oncology collaborations and by advancing important late-stage clinical programs. And we broadened and deepened our research and development pipeline as the investments we made in internal and integrated collaborative research programs advanced. These significant accomplishments, combined with our strong finish to the year, generates excellent momentum in our businesses as we head into 2016.
Later in the call, Peter, Jackie and Scott will more fully review the outstanding results of the year and the strong commercial momentum across geographies and products that has us well positioned to achieve 4 products with sales over $1 billion, each expected to grow by double-digit percentages in 2016. Mark will conclude with his perspective on strategic initiatives and upcoming milestones. These milestones position us to sustain high growth for the long term. And as I hope you can tell, this is an incredibly exciting time at Celgene, and our people are critical to maximizing our enormous potential.
Earlier this month, we announced management changes that leverage the talent and experience of our exceptional leaders, while expanding and strengthening our team. These changes provide Mark, Jackie, Scott, Peter and Rupert, all outstanding leaders, the opportunity to have an even greater impact on our organization. Since announcing these changes, our teams across the globe are energized and even more focused and committed to producing exceptional results.
I could not be more excited about the future of Celgene. Together with Mark, our entire leadership team and all of our employees around the globe, we look forward to continuing to deliver exceptional results and turning the great promise of Celgene into reality. 
Thank you. Let me now turn the call over to Peter."

Our teams around the globe delivered robust financial results, while also advancing and acquiring further next-generation growth drivers.

Our teams around the globe delivered robust financial results, while also advancing and acquiring further next-generation growth drivers. In fact, 2015 was an exceptional year of significant strategic investments. We strengthened our portfolio in several key focus areas, including immuno-oncology and epigenetics, in addition to laying the foundation to be a future leader in inflammatory bowel disease.
While delivering strong commercial results, we made critical investments now so that we are set up to deliver sustainable, high-growth performance well into the next decade. 
Now let's discuss the financial results for the quarter and the year. The fourth quarter total net product sales grew 24%. Our 4 key products, REVLIMID, POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA, grew 28%, driven by continued momentum in core indications, label expansions and global launches. 
Now while Jackie and Scott will provide more color on the underlying market dynamics for these products later in the call. I would like to highlight just 2 items.
First, full-year product sales grew 21% and were supported by greater diversification. Now as you have seen, REVLIMID continues growing 14% to 16% per year, and it now represents 63% of product sales versus 67% in 2013. We expect this performance, as well as diversification trend, will continue right through 2020 and beyond.
Secondly, U.S. ABRAXANE sales and international REVLIMID sales were positively impacted during the quarter by buying patterns. For ABRAXANE, contract optimization led to a customary buy-in during Q4, as we've seen before, and that is often followed by sell-through during Q1. As we mentioned on our Q3 conference call, 2015 was the first year of REVLIMID sales in Russia via a tender. These occurred in Q2 and in Q4, and we now expect a similar buying pattern going forward.
Product sales growth for the quarter and the year remained volume-driven. The foreign exchange markets remained volatile throughout the year, resulting in an unfavorable net ForEx impact of $16 million to revenue during Q4 and $109 million for the year. Now our Treasury team really did an excellent job mitigating this headwind. And just as reference and just for perspective, if we did not have the benefit of our hedging program, the ForEx impact would have been approximately $100 million during Q4 alone and approximately $450 million for the year. As you can see, the ForEx is a large factor that has been well-managed in 2015.
Adjusted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.18, which includes a $0.07 per share impact for milestone to our partner, OncoMed, that we announced earlier. As a reminder, after entering into a collaboration, we include milestone payments and other collaborating expenses within our adjusted financial measures. Now of course, we are pleased with how our partner programs are progressing and the potential contributions they can have on our longer-term outlook. That's good news.
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $4.71, a strong 27% increase over the prior year and even more impressive considering that it includes a $0.17 per share dilutive impact related to business development activities. And of course, that includes the $0.14 per share dilutive impact related to the Receptos acquisition this past summer.
As we discussed on the Q3 call, we expected a significant ramp in R&D spend during the fourth quarter, and in fact, this happened. And resulted in 25% of Q4 sales being reinvested in R&D. This is due to increased clinical trial activity for our important, high-potential, late-stage programs and the collaboration-related milestone expense that we just discussed. And please note, Q4 was the first full quarter with Receptos operations as part of our organization. All these investments are critical to creating our long-term growth profile that extends well into the next decade.
On the other hand, as we also discussed last quarter, after investing in our global commercial capabilities over the past few years to support the global launches for ABRAXANE, POMALYST and OTEZLA, we are now achieving meaningful leverage on the SG&A line.
Our earnings quality remains exceptional, with growth for the quarter and year driven primarily by adjusted operating income, further underscoring the momentum in our commercial business. During the quarter, we experienced the full impact of last year's $8 billion debt offering, which adds an incremental $310 million of interest expense per year. Accordingly, on an annual basis, we continue to expect total net interest expense will be between $480 million and $500 million per year going forward.
We ended the year with approximately $6.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. And throughout the year, we assertively utilized our balance sheet and cash flow to invest in next-generation growth drivers, while simultaneously repurchasing approximately $3.3 billion of Celgene shares. This is the largest annual level of repurchase in the history of Celgene, an impressive fact given the numerous other key strategic investments made during 2015. And it reflects our continued confidence in the company's future and our continued support of shareholders' interest.
Now earlier this month, we provided 2016 guidance that calls for continued strong top line performance and a leveraged bottom line outlook. This positions us to continue as the leader in growth among large biotechs. We expect total net product sales between $10.5 billion and $11 billion, a 17% increase from 2015. This range incorporates an approximately $120 million net ForEx impact that predominantly affects international REVLIMID sales. While we do not provide total revenue guidance, I would just like to highlight the royalty-bearing sales of Ritalin and Focalin by Novartis have decreased significantly over the past few years due to generic competition in certain markets. And we expect that trend to accelerate further in 2016.
Turning to the adjusted operating margin. We expect a 150 basis point improvement, driven by meaningful leverage in SG&A and a slight improvement in the product gross margin due to mix. Of course, we'll continue to invest in the commercial launches of our key products just to maximize their global potential, and in particular, as we build out our I&I commercial capabilities in Europe, to further capitalize on the growing momentum of OTEZLA. We also expect to increase our level of R&D investment as we initiate 50 new clinical trials across the pipeline and expand the number of Phase III programs. Included in adjusted research and development expense are milestone payments to partners. These are projected to range between $130 million and $140 million for the year.
Moving to the bottom line and for the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $5.50 and $5.70, a 19% increase from 2015. Now we are off to a very strong start this year. And we anticipate Q1 adjusted earnings per share between $1.27 and $1.30. This is a 20% year-over-year growth, and this represents earning 23% of our full year EPS guidance, a better start versus historical Q1 performance as a percentage of the full year than we've seen. Now this guidance does include 2 items in the quarter. First, as you know, during Q1, we typically have higher gross to net adjustments with REVLIMID and POMALYST due to early Medicare donut hole and other ACA payments, in addition to the potential sell-through of inventory for ABRAXANE in the U.S we expect these same patterns in 2016. And second, we now expect several potential partner milestones to be achieved in the first quarter, resulting in between $50 million and $75 million in milestones to partners.
Building on this great 2015, we look forward to another strong year in 2016 as our operating momentum continues and we advance the next generation of growth drivers that have the potential to maintain our growth profile into the next decade.

In 2016, we will see the first full year of revenues following launches for REVLIMID and newly diagnosed myeloma in the U.S, Germany, Spain and other countries. And we expect reimbursement approvals and launches in France, Italy, Japan and others. We will see the first full year revenues for POMALYST in Japan following the June 2015 launch there.
In addition, demand is being fueled by increasing durations of treatment across all lines of therapy in myeloma. ABRAXANE growth outside the U.S. is very solid, with nice momentum post-launch in pancreatic cancer.
2016 will also be a year that kicks off a steady multiyear flow of clinical data across a number of our late-stage programs, with the first readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program coming in the middle of the year for the REMARC diffuse large B-cell lymphoma trial. We continue to build our hematology pipeline with programs currently enrolling for the novel compounds, luspatercept, AG-221 and durvalumab, and the program for AG-120 is advancing. 
Finally, a number of trials are ongoing for new indications for ABRAXANE as well as for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapies.
REVLIMID's year-over-year growth accelerated in Q4 with 18% growth for the quarter, including negative foreign exchange of about 1 percentage point. REVLIMID's full year growth reached 16.5%, including 2 percentage points of negative foreign exchange. This growth is primarily volume-driven.
The ongoing launches of the newly diagnosed myeloma indication in the U.S. and across several markets in Europe are in the early stages and are fueling volume growth. REVLIMID is the market leader in first-line myeloma in the U.S., and in Q4, we hit another new all-time high for a number of unique patients treated. REVLIMID's share in second line myeloma in the U.S. was stable throughout 2015.
European overall non stem-cell transplant newly diagnosed myeloma share reached around 15% at the end of 2015 with Germany at over 20%. Across Europe, REVLIMID held or gained second line share. Duration of treatment trends are positive across all geographies, supported by an ever-growing body of clinical data in favor of continuous treatment with REVLIMID.
With the momentum of the newly diagnosed myeloma launch in Europe and reimbursement in Russia, our REVLIMID European region year-over-year volume growth accelerated and reached 26% in Q4 and 19% for the full year. That excellent volume growth was somewhat offset by negative price and foreign exchange impacts.
The future growth outlook is strong, as 2016 will include the first full year of revenues post the newly diagnosed myeloma launch for REVLIMID in a number of markets, including the U.S., across Europe and Japan. And we expect to continue to obtain reimbursement approvals in more countries in 2016. And REVLIMID's future looks bright for a long time to come. In the U.S., the NCCN guidelines were recently updated and now include the RVD triplet regimen as a Category 1 preferred treatment for first-line myeloma patients in both the stem-cell transplant and non stem-cell transplant settings. 
In 2016, we will see the readout of the REMARC trial  in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our overall program for REVLIMID in lymphoma will continue to advance.
Finally, within the FUSION program under our collaboration with AstraZeneca/MedImmune, the REVLIMID durvalumab combination for newly diagnosed myeloma will begin enrollment in a Phase I proof-of-concept trial that will inform next steps for advancing durvalumab in newly diagnosed myeloma in combination therapy.
POMALYST/IMNOVID achieved strong sequential year-over-year growth to finish 2015, up 45% for both Q4 and the full year, and 95% of POMALYST/IMNOVID's 2015 growth came from volume.
POMALYST's third line and greater share in the U.S. showed an upward trend in the second half of 2015, and duration of treatment increased. IMNOVID overall EU market share in both third- and fourth-line myeloma has now reached about 1/3, and durations of treatment are increasing in Europe as well.
We look forward to the first full year of POMALYST revenues in Japan during 2016 after a strong launch in June of 2015 and strong demand uptake. 
Emerging data for POMALYST/IMNOVID triplet combinations support longer durations of treatment, and a number of combination trials with POMALYST/IMNOVID and novel agents are ongoing, including immuno-oncology combinations where Phase I data presented at ASH were highly encouraging were relapsed/refractory myeloma patients with higher overall response rates versus today's standard of care therapy. Our POMALYST durvalumab combination trial for relapsed/refractory myeloma has initiated and recently enrolled its first patient.
ABRAXANE had a very good quarter in Q4 and finished 2015 strong with 15% year-over-year growth for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Importantly, volume growth was 18% and 16%, respectively, and was achieved despite a highly competitive landscape in some indications and geographies.
The ABRAXANE/Gemcitabine combination continues to hold the standard of care position for pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and is moving to that position in Europe with strong uptake and ongoing launches in various markets.
During the second half of 2015, ABRAXANE U.S. shares in lung and breast were stable, and the launch of the lung indication in Europe is in its early stages.
Emerging data is providing signs that ABRAXANE's future in immuno-oncology combination therapies will be exciting. We have now seen promising early data for both lung and breast, and we expect significant dataflow beginning in 2017 with 2 Phase III readouts in lung and then triple negative breast readouts to follow in 2018. Other programs for ABRAXANE also continued to advance across adjuvant and locally advanced pancreas, both triple negative and early-stage breast and a number of patients segments in non-small cell lung cancer. We are optimistic about ABRAXANE's future growth prospects and the potential of the product in immuno-oncology combinations.
Building on the strong momentum created by our teams during 2015, we look forward to another year of both excellent sales growth and advancement of our clinical programs in 2016. We expect REVLIMID sales to grow to $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, up 15% at the midpoint of the range and driven by volume again this year.
POMALYST, IMNOVID and ABRAXANE are both expected to officially reach blockbuster drug status by each surpassing the $1 billion revenue mark this year, and volumes will also contribute the majority of their growth. Our regulatory and clinical teams have very full agendas this year. On the submissions side, we expect to submit REVLIMID for post stem-cell transplant maintenance in both the U.S. and EU. POMALYST/IMNOVID updated label with renal impairment data in both the U.S. and EU and ABRAXANE for early-stage breast cancer in the EU.
On the clinical side, we expect data from the REMARC, CONTINUUM, ETNA and tnAcity trials.
In addition, we expect proof-of-concept data for CC-122 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for the VentiRx TLR8 agonist in solid tumors. Furthermore, we are advancing a number of clinical programs, including the Phase III trials for luspatercept, AG-221 and AG-120, our broad program across multiple hematological indications for durvalumab and our novel BCMA program for myeloma.
We are excited about both our short-term growth outlook and near-term clinical and regulatory catalysts, as well as the significant promise of the mid- to long-term based on a number of key milestones to come.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In 2015, we saw revenues accelerating throughout the year in the U.S. We had approvals in the EU for both psoriasis and PsA and launched in early EU reimbursement countries.
We also significantly advanced a development pipeline for Celgene I&I with the acquisition of Receptos in lead molecule, Ozanimod, as well as taking major steps forward in the GED-0301 development program.
We now look at global sales, we concede 2015 Q4 net sales were $183 million, leading to full year sales of $472 million. The majority of revenues in 2015 were from the U.S., where we are seeing very encouraging metrics in the early launch countries in the EU as well as Canada. Overall, we are pleased with how the global launch was executed in 2015, the first full year of commercialization for OTEZLA. And we believe it provides a tremendous base as we move into 2016 and beyond.
Now looking specifically at the U.S. Positioning consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness, patient request and trial lists. The launch of the DTC campaign in late Q2 corresponded with an inflection of the OTEZLA TRx trajectory. It is important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies in new to brand share, with approximately 40% in both psoriasis and PsA. 
Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 21% of the total branded market.
Now turning to Europe. We received regulatory approval for OTEZLA early in 2015 and already launched in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Scotland. We look to launch in the remainder of the significant European markets in 2016. As I stated earlier, we are seeing very encouraging trends in all the early launch markets and are particularly pleased with our progress in Germany.
In 2016, we should see continuing flow of data for OTEZLA. As mentioned earlier in the year at the JP Morgan conference, we recently received the 2-year radiographic data from the Phase III ankylosing spondylitis study. Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, we are very encouraged by this data, which showed a lack of progression of disease for a majority of patients. In addition to seeing these data in the major medical meeting in 2016, we also hope to get data from the Phase II proof-of-concept studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis as well as data to support our QB formulation.
We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-0301 and Ozanimod. Specifically looking to GED-0301, in 2015, we initiated the endoscopic study, CD-001, in Crohn's disease as well as the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's Disease trial CD-002 and the Phase II proof-of-concept study in UC.
During 2015, we also acquired Receptos with its lead molecule, Ozanimod, a potential best-in-class, next-generation S1P receptor modulator. Postacquisition, we were able to work closely with the talented people of Receptos to accelerate both the MS and UC programs. The RADIANCE and SUNBEAM Phase III MS clinical trials are now fully enrolled and ahead of schedule. We expect to file for MS in the second half of 2017.
We've also initiated a pivotal Phase III UC trial TRUE NORTH and a Phase II proof-of-concept study of Ozanimod in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
2015 was a year of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio in 2016 and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through significant milestones in 2015. These programs should help drive strong growth through 2020 and beyond.
We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into 2016. 
Thank you for your attention, and I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark."

As we transition to 2016, the clarity of our mission, the continuity of our leadership team and our focus on advancing key strategic imperatives continues to energize and unify us.
Our robust 2016 guidance and 2020 outlook are built on a strong foundation of global commercial, clinical, regulatory and research operating excellence. The competitive advantages our products and teams have achieved provide us with considerable optionality and multiple strategic drivers to meet and exceed our near-term financial targets.
Longer term, we expect significant additional revenue from new data and new indication for our existing commercial portfolio, plus the introduction of several products currently in late-stage development to sustain our sales base through the loss of exclusivity for key products. Our long focus on internal research and external collaborations has generated a pipeline of approximately 50 unique molecules, many with transformative first-in-class clinical profiles and with the potential to be developed for more than 100 indications. These products are expected to fuel innovation and to create significant growth opportunities over the next 10 to 15 years.
Moreover, we expect our consistently strong cash flow to provide additional opportunities to fortify our pipeline and enhance our outlook. 
Near-term catalysts for growth include the availability of data from at least 18 different Phase III trials beginning in the middle of this year and continuing through mid-2018. Strategically, these studies also represent the opportunity to expand our hematology franchise to include lymphomas, to advance our immuno-oncology programs in multiple solid tumors and blood cancers, and with GED-0301, Ozanimod and OTEZLA, to establish clear global leadership in the treatment of serious inflammatory bowel diseases. Other ongoing pivotal programs for AG-221, CC-486 and luspatercept may provide additional opportunities for near-term growth.
And over the next 12 to 24 months, we expect a steady stream of mid-stage and proof-of-concept data to begin to establish the clinical profiles of enough molecules generated from distributed and integrated research and drug development model. Importantly, these products and programs leverage or build on our established therapeutic franchises and may also support the creation of new franchises.
We know that our future begins with delivery on the results and the promise of 2016. We look forward to providing with more details throughout the year on our progress achieving our top financial and operational priorities and on our efforts to bring new disruptive therapies to patients in need.

And in fact, on a constant currency basis, we are on track, driven by our multiple myeloma portfolio, REV, POM and all the data that's been generated and all the great things you're hearing about OTEZLA and the launch and the outlook. So on a constant currency basis, we are on track, maybe the mix is a little different than we originally thought but feeling really good. That said, ForEx has been volatile and since the time of that guidance was issued in January 2013. And actually, if you went from that time to today, we're probably seeing, net of hedges, about an $800 million impact on the top line. So we are kind of calibrating on that. And we do intend to provide an update as we get closer to 2017 based on where these ForEx rates really look like they're going to land in 2017. So thanks for the question. I would also add, just for what it's worth, we also added, obviously, in the beginning of 2015 our guidance out to 2020. And clearly, we are making a lot of investments to drive towards that, and we feel very good. Now we updated it last summer, after the Receptos and the AstraZeneca deal. And we reaffirmed it earlier this month. And it remains entirely on track despite the implied ForEx impact. I mean, clearly, ForEx has been affecting that outlook, too. But our operating performance in that timeframe we think will overcome that. So and just for perspective, from the time that we gave that guidance to 2020, there's about a $700 million, $800 million headwind as well, but we're good to cover that. We feel very good about that. And then obviously, on the bottom line, we are making significant investments in R&D. We have to see how those develop and so forth and as well as some of the milestones that come through. So our feeling is, in total, we really kind of got our organization headed towards hitting these '16 numbers driving towards 2020. And we'll be updating that 2017 as we get closer to the year when it -- it's sort of like the next year ahead of us."

There is one market in Germany that does have a substantial oral market already with the fumaric acid ester products. And so there is a substantial market, the outlook's a little bit different than the U.S., but we think we have a really nice opportunity in Europe because of the relative lack of use of biologics relative to the U.S. and Europe.

So I think mostly what we're seeing with the POM performance in Q4 is the ongoing impact of penetration in Europe. You probably heard what I said in my prepared remarks, where the product now in the third and fourth lines in Europe has reached about 1/3, and that's happened over a period of time. Also, we had the launch of POM that started in Japan in June, and we've seen very, very nice uptake in Japan in the first 6 or 7 months of being on the market there. I also think the treatment landscape is starting to maybe settle out a little bit, although you've got dara coming in just now and just now starting to ramp up. Within this landscape, the Pom/dex regimen is very competitively positioned as it's the only regimen that has proven survival after REVLIMID relapse and exposure to a proteasome inhibitor. So we are seeing early uptick for dara right in that fourth line in greater setting and we're seeing the rest of the landscape start to play out as we've got the other combinations that have been approved. I think it's a bit early to call trends on triplet adoption broadly in relapsed/refractory myeloma, but with the sequencing patterns, we're going to see more of that. And we think POM is very well positioned to compete there. You're also probably getting a little bit of an impact of carfilzomib moving into second line there relative share gains, we're greater in second line than any other line of therapy, as you would expect. And I think that creates even potentially more room in the third line greater setting for these other therapies to take their places."

Obviously, if you had a statistically significant OS, the trend right out of the gate, that would be extremely positive. And that's not our base case assumption. But we think with a positive PFS readout in some trend on OS that, that would put us in a very good position with the regulators. As you know, it's a high unmet medical need.

Again, you've got high unmet medical need and probably room for multiple therapy should others come long and give positive result."

Well, I think everything that we've seen or you've seen is supportive for continued positive trends in duration of treatment across all lines of therapy, and that includes the data that we've seen readout so far with the triplet regimen then, in particular, the RVD data, which, as we know, is the first triplet regimen to read out for newly diagnosed, and really quite impressive PFS results. So what we're seeing in the market, both in the U.S. and Europe, are increasing duration trends for both REVLIMID and POMALYST. Those are continuing to go very nicely. Europe is still somewhat behind the U.S. I think we've talked about first exposure durations in the U.S. now being somewhere over 17 months, total exposure now over 22 months continues to trend in a positive direction. The range across Europe is somewhere now in the 12 to 14 months. So you can see a ways to go for Europe to catch up. And now with the newly diagnosed approval, we should see that trajectory maybe steepen a little bit and continue. We're also seeing nice duration gains for POMALYST as well, and I think we'll see those across Europe over time and we'll see them in Japan. So the body of clinical data that continues to evolve is supportive for early and continuous treatment of myeloma with REVLIMID and then a strong role for the image in backbone therapy across any of the triplets that we've seen so far, including in combination with the monoclonal antibodies."

And I think that we'll see that happen over a period of time. These numbers that we give you are always averages across a big portfolio of patients. So you can't expect that an average data point is just going to jump up from one day to the next, then it will be a cumulative thing. So every time we get a newly diagnosed patient on drug, and the net newly diagnosed patient is staying on drug for a longer period of time, there's a cumulative effect of that in the portfolio, and that average starts going up, and that average data point, of course, is applied to all the patients in the whole portfolio, and it becomes pretty big numbers. What we saw in the U.S., if we go back to the ASH data that came out, I think it was in 2009, and we started to see more move towards this continuous treatment paradigm is over time, after a few years, duration became the larger driver of growth in the U.S. And at some point, that will happen in Europe, but that will play out over a few years. So I think the great news is that multiple drivers, particularly in Europe and then in Japan, you've got a more relatively higher impact from market share gains in newly diagnosed early on. The duration then starts to kick in, and then that plays out over time. And so you've got multiple factors driving growth, and it'll do so for a long, long period of time."

We've now got the triplet regimens approved in the relapsed setting, and this is going to play out over a period of time. We feel highly confident in our long-term growth prospects and what we think duration trends are going to be. We also have been pleased with the reimbursement discussions for newly diagnosed label expansion for REVLIMID in Europe. And now that we've got those countries on board, and we'll have the remaining large ones in 2016, we go forward from that in a very good position with respect to having already negotiated REVLIMID's price. So as other therapies come to market and all the clinical data supports longer duration of treatment. So we feel really good about that. Have we fully updated our financial forecast to reflect what the full opportunity of that could be? We have not. Because we want to give this a little bit of time to just settle in, see what physicians are saying now with all of the new treatments that have come to market, socialized a bit more of that SWOG data and other things. And we've got -- we also are in a situation that Peter mentioned with the FX headwind, we got puts and takes in the financial model that makes it such that we already gave an update on 2020 in the middle of the summer, and we increased it despite the big FX numbers that Peter put out there. So I think that all of these trends and where we are in the market also set us up very well in terms of how we think about the development of our next-generation of novel agents and molecules. And a bit of this also would -- could relate to the evolving non-Hodgkin's landscape as well. But when you look at CC-122, CC-220, the BCMA, durvalumab and the things that we are moving along, I think we're in an excellent position to not only continue to evolve the treatment paradigms for patients, but to see those results in a very robust portfolio of products.

As you know, the -- we've had headwinds, particularly in the U.S., with the launches of the checkpoint inhibitors. In the second half of 2015, it actually felt like that, that stabilized a little bit. You get very rapid uptake when something new comes to market. So we saw a little bit more stable shares in the second half of 2015, which I take as a good sign. Outside the U.S. growth is quite solid, mostly driven by the pancreatic ongoing launches where it's still pretty early days in some countries. We still don't have reimbursement in all of the top 5 countries in Europe. So that's going extremely well, and there's still room for -- from a shared gains standpoint for us to establish ABRAXANE [indiscernible] as standard of care in Europe and it take -- essentially the same places taken in the U.S. The lung launch in Europe is in very early days. So in the near-term, that stronger growth outside the U.S. is going to contribute to giving -- putting us in a solid position with respect to overall global growth, while the rest of these things play out. So just with respect to the couple of things that you highlighted, I think, pretty obviously, assuming that the [indiscernible] combination data is positive, you've got the potential for ABRAXANE to be the backbone chemotherapy in multiple indications in I/O combination regimen. So that would, longer term, be the more significant upside. At the same time, the adjuvant pancreas trial is our trial, so that's fully within our management. And as you probably know, that indication could double or potentially more than double the size of the pancreas opportunity for ABRAXANE versus the one that we have today. So those are a couple of things that we are pretty optimistic about. And then for the next year or so until we see some of that Phase III I/O data in 2017, we're holding our own and doing really pretty well."

What we've seen this year is that outside of the U.S., and notably, as we made our way to the newly diagnosed label expansion negotiations in Europe, we had price decreases across the portfolio that were pretty much in line with where we expected them to be. But versus a year ago, they were a little bit more this year as we made our way through those negotiations.

So we were able to, I think, very successfully penetrate the market. Access is a barrier in this marketplace. It's a highly managed category. There's no question, but we've continued to chip away that access environment. And I think the important thing to note is that payers have implemented exceptions to the 2 biologic step rule, those that have it, because they want to be able to encourage patients to be able to get on ultimate therapy if the biologic therapy is not appropriate. And so the interesting thing, sort of the proof is really in the data. When I think about the data, more than 80% of patients in the psoriasis markets that are coming on OTEZLA are not coming from a biologic. So the access things are there, but there are exceptions to be able to get around that. And we have not found access to be a significant burden on the ability to drive demand. We would like to evolve that axis and maybe be in a preferred position as we go forward. But critical thing for navigating the axis environment is driving demand, driving volume.

So we will continue to see ourselves being particularly forcible in the share repurchase area, because we are in great shape on cash. And we see the stock in the sector right now, great value."

So our discussions with the health care authorities so far have been based on the GeparSepto trial and getting feedback from them with respect to what they would want to see for a regulatory submission in the neoadjuvant setting. So the GeparSepto trial data would be the data to focus on for that. It could be that the ETNA study, should it be supportive, because there are different trial designs, would be something that we potentially could consider again as supportive, but not necessary. And we've had enough of feedback and  particularly we feel like the path is clear in Europe, and we have said that our plan is to submit based on the GeparSepto data in Europe by the fourth quarter of this year. We need a little bit more clarification from FDA about some of the data that we -- they would want to see before we make a decision about timing in the U.S. So do we want to go through the trial design for ETNA?

When you look at shares, the point is that given the strength of that RVD data and the current share position, there is room for more adoption of the RVD triplet. And we think that even in the current environment, the PFS data supports that greater adoption. You've also potentially seen in smart guidelines just as one example, get updated where RVD has replaced some RD[ph] for newly diagnosed under those guidelines. So you can already see a positive reception to that data just based on the strength of the data. On a go-forward basis, I think that Velcade going generic, given just on the strength of the efficacy data for the RVD regimen is going to put the regimen in a very good position in a number of geographies with respect to adoption. And I think it's going to be a highly competitive regimen. And when you think about the other triplets coming along, they are all going to have to find a way to show their value proposition in that landscape."

As we reported, 2015 was an outstanding year for Celgene. We appreciate the opportunity to review with you these exceptional results and important strategic developments and our near- and longer-term outlook.
Our operating momentum and advancement of the high-potential programs have us well positioned to produce market-leading growth in 2016 and beyond. Very importantly, during 2015, we advanced a number of key strategic initiatives that will drive significant growth over the next decade. We enhanced and provided greater clarity on the potential of REVLIMID. We firmly established the value proposition of OTEZLA, while significantly expanding our I&I franchise.
We strengthened the long-term growth potential of our Hematology and Oncology franchise through strategic immuno-oncology collaborations and by advancing important late-stage clinical programs. And we broadened and deepened our research and development pipeline as the investments we made in internal and integrated collaborative research programs advanced. These significant accomplishments, combined with our strong finish to the year, generates excellent momentum in our businesses as we head into 2016.
Later in the call, Peter, Jackie and Scott will more fully review the outstanding results of the year and the strong commercial momentum across geographies and products that has us well positioned to achieve 4 products with sales over $1 billion, each expected to grow by double-digit percentages in 2016. Mark will conclude with his perspective on strategic initiatives and upcoming milestones. These milestones position us to sustain high growth for the long term. And as I hope you can tell, this is an incredibly exciting time at Celgene, and our people are critical to maximizing our enormous potential.
Earlier this month, we announced management changes that leverage the talent and experience of our exceptional leaders, while expanding and strengthening our team. These changes provide Mark, Jackie, Scott, Peter and Rupert, all outstanding leaders, the opportunity to have an even greater impact on our organization. Since announcing these changes, our teams across the globe are energized and even more focused and committed to producing exceptional results.
I could not be more excited about the future of Celgene. Together with Mark, our entire leadership team and all of our employees around the globe, we look forward to continuing to deliver exceptional results and turning the great promise of Celgene into reality. 
Thank you. Let me now turn the call over to Peter."

Our teams around the globe delivered robust financial results, while also advancing and acquiring further next-generation growth drivers.

Our teams around the globe delivered robust financial results, while also advancing and acquiring further next-generation growth drivers. In fact, 2015 was an exceptional year of significant strategic investments. We strengthened our portfolio in several key focus areas, including immuno-oncology and epigenetics, in addition to laying the foundation to be a future leader in inflammatory bowel disease.
While delivering strong commercial results, we made critical investments now so that we are set up to deliver sustainable, high-growth performance well into the next decade. 
Now let's discuss the financial results for the quarter and the year. The fourth quarter total net product sales grew 24%. Our 4 key products, REVLIMID, POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA, grew 28%, driven by continued momentum in core indications, label expansions and global launches. 
Now while Jackie and Scott will provide more color on the underlying market dynamics for these products later in the call. I would like to highlight just 2 items.
First, full-year product sales grew 21% and were supported by greater diversification. Now as you have seen, REVLIMID continues growing 14% to 16% per year, and it now represents 63% of product sales versus 67% in 2013. We expect this performance, as well as diversification trend, will continue right through 2020 and beyond.
Secondly, U.S. ABRAXANE sales and international REVLIMID sales were positively impacted during the quarter by buying patterns. For ABRAXANE, contract optimization led to a customary buy-in during Q4, as we've seen before, and that is often followed by sell-through during Q1. As we mentioned on our Q3 conference call, 2015 was the first year of REVLIMID sales in Russia via a tender. These occurred in Q2 and in Q4, and we now expect a similar buying pattern going forward.
Product sales growth for the quarter and the year remained volume-driven. The foreign exchange markets remained volatile throughout the year, resulting in an unfavorable net ForEx impact of $16 million to revenue during Q4 and $109 million for the year. Now our Treasury team really did an excellent job mitigating this headwind. And just as reference and just for perspective, if we did not have the benefit of our hedging program, the ForEx impact would have been approximately $100 million during Q4 alone and approximately $450 million for the year. As you can see, the ForEx is a large factor that has been well-managed in 2015.
Adjusted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.18, which includes a $0.07 per share impact for milestone to our partner, OncoMed, that we announced earlier. As a reminder, after entering into a collaboration, we include milestone payments and other collaborating expenses within our adjusted financial measures. Now of course, we are pleased with how our partner programs are progressing and the potential contributions they can have on our longer-term outlook. That's good news.
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $4.71, a strong 27% increase over the prior year and even more impressive considering that it includes a $0.17 per share dilutive impact related to business development activities. And of course, that includes the $0.14 per share dilutive impact related to the Receptos acquisition this past summer.
As we discussed on the Q3 call, we expected a significant ramp in R&D spend during the fourth quarter, and in fact, this happened. And resulted in 25% of Q4 sales being reinvested in R&D. This is due to increased clinical trial activity for our important, high-potential, late-stage programs and the collaboration-related milestone expense that we just discussed. And please note, Q4 was the first full quarter with Receptos operations as part of our organization. All these investments are critical to creating our long-term growth profile that extends well into the next decade.
On the other hand, as we also discussed last quarter, after investing in our global commercial capabilities over the past few years to support the global launches for ABRAXANE, POMALYST and OTEZLA, we are now achieving meaningful leverage on the SG&A line.
Our earnings quality remains exceptional, with growth for the quarter and year driven primarily by adjusted operating income, further underscoring the momentum in our commercial business. During the quarter, we experienced the full impact of last year's $8 billion debt offering, which adds an incremental $310 million of interest expense per year. Accordingly, on an annual basis, we continue to expect total net interest expense will be between $480 million and $500 million per year going forward.
We ended the year with approximately $6.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. And throughout the year, we assertively utilized our balance sheet and cash flow to invest in next-generation growth drivers, while simultaneously repurchasing approximately $3.3 billion of Celgene shares. This is the largest annual level of repurchase in the history of Celgene, an impressive fact given the numerous other key strategic investments made during 2015. And it reflects our continued confidence in the company's future and our continued support of shareholders' interest.
Now earlier this month, we provided 2016 guidance that calls for continued strong top line performance and a leveraged bottom line outlook. This positions us to continue as the leader in growth among large biotechs. We expect total net product sales between $10.5 billion and $11 billion, a 17% increase from 2015. This range incorporates an approximately $120 million net ForEx impact that predominantly affects international REVLIMID sales. While we do not provide total revenue guidance, I would just like to highlight the royalty-bearing sales of Ritalin and Focalin by Novartis have decreased significantly over the past few years due to generic competition in certain markets. And we expect that trend to accelerate further in 2016.
Turning to the adjusted operating margin. We expect a 150 basis point improvement, driven by meaningful leverage in SG&A and a slight improvement in the product gross margin due to mix. Of course, we'll continue to invest in the commercial launches of our key products just to maximize their global potential, and in particular, as we build out our I&I commercial capabilities in Europe, to further capitalize on the growing momentum of OTEZLA. We also expect to increase our level of R&D investment as we initiate 50 new clinical trials across the pipeline and expand the number of Phase III programs. Included in adjusted research and development expense are milestone payments to partners. These are projected to range between $130 million and $140 million for the year.
Moving to the bottom line and for the full year. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $5.50 and $5.70, a 19% increase from 2015. Now we are off to a very strong start this year. And we anticipate Q1 adjusted earnings per share between $1.27 and $1.30. This is a 20% year-over-year growth, and this represents earning 23% of our full year EPS guidance, a better start versus historical Q1 performance as a percentage of the full year than we've seen. Now this guidance does include 2 items in the quarter. First, as you know, during Q1, we typically have higher gross to net adjustments with REVLIMID and POMALYST due to early Medicare donut hole and other ACA payments, in addition to the potential sell-through of inventory for ABRAXANE in the U.S we expect these same patterns in 2016. And second, we now expect several potential partner milestones to be achieved in the first quarter, resulting in between $50 million and $75 million in milestones to partners.
Building on this great 2015, we look forward to another strong year in 2016 as our operating momentum continues and we advance the next generation of growth drivers that have the potential to maintain our growth profile into the next decade. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie."

Our Hematology and Oncology teams around the world and across all of our activities delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2015 with strong momentum.The franchise grew 18% year-over-year in Q4 and 16% for",1272,"Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. Our Hematology and Oncology teams around the world and across all of our activities delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2015 with strong momentum.
The franchise grew 18% year-over-year in Q4 and 16% for the full year to reach just under $8.7 billion of product revenues, a record year. And our strong growth trajectory will continue in 2016 and beyond. In 2016, we will see the first full year of revenues following launches for REVLIMID and newly diagnosed myeloma in the U.S, Germany, Spain and other countries. And we expect reimbursement approvals and launches in France, Italy, Japan and others. We will see the first full year revenues for POMALYST in Japan following the June 2015 launch there.
In addition, demand is being fueled by increasing durations of treatment across all lines of therapy in myeloma. ABRAXANE growth outside the U.S. is very solid, with nice momentum post-launch in pancreatic cancer.
2016 will also be a year that kicks off a steady multiyear flow of clinical data across a number of our late-stage programs, with the first readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program coming in the middle of the year for the REMARC diffuse large B-cell lymphoma trial. We continue to build our hematology pipeline with programs currently enrolling for the novel compounds, luspatercept, AG-221 and durvalumab, and the program for AG-120 is advancing. 
Finally, a number of trials are ongoing for new indications for ABRAXANE as well as for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapies.
REVLIMID's year-over-year growth accelerated in Q4 with 18% growth for the quarter, including negative foreign exchange of about 1 percentage point. REVLIMID's full year growth reached 16.5%, including 2 percentage points of negative foreign exchange. This growth is primarily volume-driven.
The ongoing launches of the newly diagnosed myeloma indication in the U.S. and across several markets in Europe are in the early stages and are fueling volume growth. REVLIMID is the market leader in first-line myeloma in the U.S., and in Q4, we hit another new all-time high for a number of unique patients treated. REVLIMID's share in second line myeloma in the U.S. was stable throughout 2015.
European overall non stem-cell transplant newly diagnosed myeloma share reached around 15% at the end of 2015 with Germany at over 20%. Across Europe, REVLIMID held or gained second line share. Duration of treatment trends are positive across all geographies, supported by an ever-growing body of clinical data in favor of continuous treatment with REVLIMID.
With the momentum of the newly diagnosed myeloma launch in Europe and reimbursement in Russia, our REVLIMID European region year-over-year volume growth accelerated and reached 26% in Q4 and 19% for the full year. That excellent volume growth was somewhat offset by negative price and foreign exchange impacts.
The future growth outlook is strong, as 2016 will include the first full year of revenues post the newly diagnosed myeloma launch for REVLIMID in a number of markets, including the U.S., across Europe and Japan. And we expect to continue to obtain reimbursement approvals in more countries in 2016. And REVLIMID's future looks bright for a long time to come. In the U.S., the NCCN guidelines were recently updated and now include the RVD triplet regimen as a Category 1 preferred treatment for first-line myeloma patients in both the stem-cell transplant and non stem-cell transplant settings. 
In 2016, we will see the readout of the REMARC trial in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our overall program for REVLIMID in lymphoma will continue to advance.
Finally, within the FUSION program under our collaboration with AstraZeneca/MedImmune, the REVLIMID durvalumab combination for newly diagnosed myeloma will begin enrollment in a Phase I proof-of-concept trial that will inform next steps for advancing durvalumab in newly diagnosed myeloma in combination therapy.
POMALYST/IMNOVID achieved strong sequential year-over-year growth to finish 2015, up 45% for both Q4 and the full year, and 95% of POMALYST/IMNOVID's 2015 growth came from volume.
POMALYST's third line and greater share in the U.S. showed an upward trend in the second half of 2015, and duration of treatment increased. IMNOVID overall EU market share in both third- and fourth-line myeloma has now reached about 1/3, and durations of treatment are increasing in Europe as well.
We look forward to the first full year of POMALYST revenues in Japan during 2016 after a strong launch in June of 2015 and strong demand uptake. 
Emerging data for POMALYST/IMNOVID triplet combinations support longer durations of treatment, and a number of combination trials with POMALYST/IMNOVID and novel agents are ongoing, including immuno-oncology combinations where Phase I data presented at ASH were highly encouraging were relapsed/refractory myeloma patients with higher overall response rates versus today's standard of care therapy. Our POMALYST durvalumab combination trial for relapsed/refractory myeloma has initiated and recently enrolled its first patient.
ABRAXANE had a very good quarter in Q4 and finished 2015 strong with 15% year-over-year growth for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Importantly, volume growth was 18% and 16%, respectively, and was achieved despite a highly competitive landscape in some indications and geographies.
The ABRAXANE/Gemcitabine combination continues to hold the standard of care position for pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and is moving to that position in Europe with strong uptake and ongoing launches in various markets.
During the second half of 2015, ABRAXANE U.S. shares in lung and breast were stable, and the launch of the lung indication in Europe is in its early stages.
Emerging data is providing signs that ABRAXANE's future in immuno-oncology combination therapies will be exciting. We have now seen promising early data for both lung and breast, and we expect significant dataflow beginning in 2017 with 2 Phase III readouts in lung and then triple negative breast readouts to follow in 2018. Other programs for ABRAXANE also continued to advance across adjuvant and locally advanced pancreas, both triple negative and early-stage breast and a number of patients segments in non-small cell lung cancer. We are optimistic about ABRAXANE's future growth prospects and the potential of the product in immuno-oncology combinations.
Building on the strong momentum created by our teams during 2015, we look forward to another year of both excellent sales growth and advancement of our clinical programs in 2016. We expect REVLIMID sales to grow to $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, up 15% at the midpoint of the range and driven by volume again this year.
POMALYST, IMNOVID and ABRAXANE are both expected to officially reach blockbuster drug status by each surpassing the $1 billion revenue mark this year, and volumes will also contribute the majority of their growth. Our regulatory and clinical teams have very full agendas this year. On the submissions side, we expect to submit REVLIMID for post stem-cell transplant maintenance in both the U.S. and EU. POMALYST/IMNOVID updated label with renal impairment data in both the U.S. and EU and ABRAXANE for early-stage breast cancer in the EU.
On the clinical side, we expect data from the REMARC, CONTINUUM, ETNA and tnAcity trials.
In addition, we expect proof-of-concept data for CC-122 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for the VentiRx TLR8 agonist in solid tumors. Furthermore, we are advancing a number of clinical programs, including the Phase III trials for luspatercept, AG-221 and AG-120, our broad program across multiple hematological indications for durvalumab and our novel BCMA program for myeloma.
We are excited about both our short-term growth outlook and near-term clinical and regulatory catalysts, as well as the significant promise of the mid- to long-term based on a number of key milestones to come.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In 2015, we saw revenues accelerating throughout the year in the U.S. We had approvals in the EU for both psoriasis and PsA and launched in early EU reimbursement countries.
We also significantly advanced a development pipeline for Celgene I&I with the acquisition of Receptos in lead molecule, Ozanimod, as well as taking major steps forward in the GED-0301 development program.
We now look at global sales, we concede 2015 Q4 net sales were $183 million, leading to full year sales of $472 million. The majority of revenues in 2015 were from the U.S., where we are seeing very encouraging metrics in the early launch countries in the EU as well as Canada. Overall, we are pleased with how the global launch was executed in 2015, the first full year of commercialization for OTEZLA. And we believe it provides a tremendous base as we move into 2016 and beyond.
Now looking specifically at the U.S. Positioning consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness, patient request and trial lists. The launch of the DTC campaign in late Q2 corresponded with an inflection of the OTEZLA TRx trajectory. It is important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies in new to brand share, with approximately 40% in both psoriasis and PsA. 
Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 21% of the total branded market.
Now turning to Europe. We received regulatory approval for OTEZLA early in 2015 and already launched in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Scotland. We look to launch in the remainder of the significant European markets in 2016. As I stated earlier, we are seeing very encouraging trends in all the early launch markets and are particularly pleased with our progress in Germany.
In 2016, we should see continuing flow of data for OTEZLA. As mentioned earlier in the year at the JP Morgan conference, we recently received the 2-year radiographic data from the Phase III ankylosing spondylitis study. Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, we are very encouraged by this data, which showed a lack of progression of disease for a majority of patients. In addition to seeing these data in the major medical meeting in 2016, we also hope to get data from the Phase II proof-of-concept studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis as well as data to support our QB formulation.
We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-0301 and Ozanimod. Specifically looking to GED-0301, in 2015, we initiated the endoscopic study, CD-001, in Crohn's disease as well as the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's Disease trial CD-002 and the Phase II proof-of-concept study in UC.
During 2015, we also acquired Receptos with its lead molecule, Ozanimod, a potential best-in-class, next-generation S1P receptor modulator. Postacquisition, we were able to work closely with the talented people of Receptos to accelerate both the MS and UC programs. The RADIANCE and SUNBEAM Phase III MS clinical trials are now fully enrolled and ahead of schedule. We expect to file for MS in the second half of 2017.
We've also initiated a pivotal Phase III UC trial TRUE NORTH and a Phase II proof-of-concept study of Ozanimod in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
2015 was a year of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio in 2016 and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through significant milestones in 2015. These programs should help drive strong growth through 2020 and beyond.
We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into 2016. 
Thank you for your attention, and I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark."

As we transition to 2016, the clarity of our mission, the continuity of our leadership team and our focus on advancing key strategic imperatives continues to energize and unify us.
Our robust 2016 guidance and 2020 outlook are built on a strong foundation of global commercial, clinical, regulatory and research operating excellence. The competitive advantages our products and teams have achieved provide us with considerable optionality and multiple strategic drivers to meet and exceed our near-term financial targets.
Longer term, we expect significant additional revenue from new data and new indication for our existing commercial portfolio, plus the introduction of several products currently in late-stage development to sustain our sales base through the loss of exclusivity for key products. Our long focus on internal research and external collaborations has generated a pipeline of approximately 50 unique molecules, many with transformative first-in-class clinical profiles and with the potential to be developed for more than 100 indications. These products are expected to fuel innovation and to create significant growth opportunities over the next 10 to 15 years.
Moreover, we expect our consistently strong cash flow to provide additional opportunities to fortify our pipeline and enhance our outlook. 
Near-term catalysts for growth include the availability of data from at least 18 different Phase III trials beginning in the middle of this year and continuing through mid-2018. Strategically, these studies also represent the opportunity to expand our hematology franchise to include lymphomas, to advance our immuno-oncology programs in multiple solid tumors and blood cancers, and with GED-0301, Ozanimod and OTEZLA, to establish clear global leadership in the treatment of serious inflammatory bowel diseases. Other ongoing pivotal programs for AG-221, CC-486 and luspatercept may provide additional opportunities for near-term growth.
And over the next 12 to 24 months, we expect a steady stream of mid-stage and proof-of-concept data to begin to establish the clinical profiles of enough molecules generated from distributed and integrated research and drug development model. Importantly, these products and programs leverage or build on our established therapeutic franchises and may also support the creation of new franchises.
We know that our future begins with delivery on the results and the promise of 2016. We look forward to providing with more details throughout the year on our progress achieving our top financial and operational priorities and on our efforts to bring new disruptive therapies to patients in need.

And in fact, on a constant currency basis, we are on track, driven by our multiple myeloma portfolio, REV, POM and all the data that's been generated and all the great things you're hearing about OTEZLA and the launch and the outlook. So on a constant currency basis, we are on track, maybe the mix is a little different than we originally thought but feeling really good. That said, ForEx has been volatile and since the time of that guidance was issued in January 2013. And actually, if you went from that time to today, we're probably seeing, net of hedges, about an $800 million impact on the top line. So we are kind of calibrating on that. And we do intend to provide an update as we get closer to 2017 based on where these ForEx rates really look like they're going to land in 2017. So thanks for the question. I would also add, just for what it's worth, we also added, obviously, in the beginning of 2015 our guidance out to 2020. And clearly, we are making a lot of investments to drive towards that, and we feel very good. Now we updated it last summer, after the Receptos and the AstraZeneca deal. And we reaffirmed it earlier this month. And it remains entirely on track despite the implied ForEx impact. I mean, clearly, ForEx has been affecting that outlook, too. But our operating performance in that timeframe we think will overcome that. So and just for perspective, from the time that we gave that guidance to 2020, there's about a $700 million, $800 million headwind as well, but we're good to cover that. We feel very good about that. And then obviously, on the bottom line, we are making significant investments in R&D. We have to see how those develop and so forth and as well as some of the milestones that come through. So our feeling is, in total, we really kind of got our organization headed towards hitting these '16 numbers driving towards 2020. And we'll be updating that 2017 as we get closer to the year when it -- it's sort of like the next year ahead of us."

So I think we're -- I look at it where it's a very early start, really with one of the major countries launched. And '16 will be the real true launch year for OTEZLA in Europe.

There is one market in Germany that does have a substantial oral market already with the fumaric acid ester products. And so there is a substantial market, the outlook's a little bit different than the U.S., but we think we have a really nice opportunity in Europe because of the relative lack of use of biologics relative to the U.S. and Europe. The demographic patient numbers are very similar when you take a look at psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. So that's the market, which has been even less penetrated, so we're excited about folding out over the course of the time in Europe.

So I think mostly what we're seeing with the POM performance in Q4 is the ongoing impact of penetration in Europe. You probably heard what I said in my prepared remarks, where the product now in the third and fourth lines in Europe has reached about 1/3, and that's happened over a period of time. Also, we had the launch of POM that started in Japan in June, and we've seen very, very nice uptake in Japan in the first 6 or 7 months of being on the market there. I also think the treatment landscape is starting to maybe settle out a little bit, although you've got dara coming in just now and just now starting to ramp up. Within this landscape, the Pom/dex regimen is very competitively positioned as it's the only regimen that has proven survival after REVLIMID relapse and exposure to a proteasome inhibitor. So we are seeing early uptick for dara right in that fourth line in greater setting and we're seeing the rest of the landscape start to play out as we've got the other combinations that have been approved. I think it's a bit early to call trends on triplet adoption broadly in relapsed/refractory myeloma, but with the sequencing patterns, we're going to see more of that. And we think POM is very well positioned to compete there. You're also probably getting a little bit of an impact of carfilzomib moving into second line there relative share gains, we're greater in second line than any other line of therapy, as you would expect. And I think that creates even potentially more room in the third line greater setting for these other therapies to take their places."

I think I -- we believe that if there's a positive trend in OS then it will depend on the strength of the trend that, that will be something that the regulators could view favorably with respect to the submission. Obviously, if you had a statistically significant OS, the trend right out of the gate, that would be extremely positive. And that's not our base case assumption. But we think with a positive PFS readout in some trend on OS that, that would put us in a very good position with the regulators. As you know, it's a high unmet medical need. You've got a significant relapse rate in diffuse large B-cell, and most of it occurs within 2 years. The patient prognosis is quite bad upon relapse.

So what we're seeing in the market, both in the U.S. and Europe, are increasing duration trends for both REVLIMID and POMALYST. Those are continuing to go very nicely. Europe is still somewhat behind the U.S. I think we've talked about first exposure durations in the U.S. now being somewhere over 17 months, total exposure now over 22 months continues to trend in a positive direction. The range across Europe is somewhere now in the 12 to 14 months. So you can see a ways to go for Europe to catch up. And now with the newly diagnosed approval, we should see that trajectory maybe steepen a little bit and continue. We're also seeing nice duration gains for POMALYST as well, and I think we'll see those across Europe over time and we'll see them in Japan. So the body of clinical data that continues to evolve is supportive for early and continuous treatment of myeloma with REVLIMID and then a strong role for the image in backbone therapy across any of the triplets that we've seen so far, including in combination with the monoclonal antibodies."

So every time we get a newly diagnosed patient on drug, and the net newly diagnosed patient is staying on drug for a longer period of time, there's a cumulative effect of that in the portfolio, and that average starts going up, and that average data point, of course, is applied to all the patients in the whole portfolio, and it becomes pretty big numbers. What we saw in the U.S., if we go back to the ASH data that came out, I think it was in 2009, and we started to see more move towards this continuous treatment paradigm is over time, after a few years, duration became the larger driver of growth in the U.S. And at some point, that will happen in Europe, but that will play out over a few years. So I think the great news is that multiple drivers, particularly in Europe and then in Japan, you've got a more relatively higher impact from market share gains in newly diagnosed early on. The duration then starts to kick in, and then that plays out over time. And so you've got multiple factors driving growth, and it'll do so for a long, long period of time."

I think the -- I mean, we've just seen the SWOG data presented at ASH in December. We've now got the triplet regimens approved in the relapsed setting, and this is going to play out over a period of time. We feel highly confident in our long-term growth prospects and what we think duration trends are going to be. We also have been pleased with the reimbursement discussions for newly diagnosed label expansion for REVLIMID in Europe. And now that we've got those countries on board, and we'll have the remaining large ones in 2016, we go forward from that in a very good position with respect to having already negotiated REVLIMID's price. So as other therapies come to market and all the clinical data supports longer duration of treatment. So we feel really good about that. Have we fully updated our financial forecast to reflect what the full opportunity of that could be? We have not. Because we want to give this a little bit of time to just settle in, see what physicians are saying now with all of the new treatments that have come to market, socialized a bit more of that SWOG data and other things. And we've got -- we also are in a situation that Peter mentioned with the FX headwind, we got puts and takes in the financial model that makes it such that we already gave an update on 2020 in the middle of the summer, and we increased it despite the big FX numbers that Peter put out there. So I think that all of these trends and where we are in the market also set us up very well in terms of how we think about the development of our next-generation of novel agents and molecules. And a bit of this also would -- could relate to the evolving non-Hodgkin's landscape as well. But when you look at CC-122, CC-220, the BCMA, durvalumab and the things that we are moving along, I think we're in an excellent position to not only continue to evolve the treatment paradigms for patients, but to see those results in a very robust portfolio of products. It's going to allow us to deliver strong growth for a long time to come."

So in terms of number of cycles, I mean, I think we're roughly in line with what we would have expected. That's not a big driver. As you know, the -- we've had headwinds, particularly in the U.S., with the launches of the checkpoint inhibitors. In the second half of 2015, it actually felt like that, that stabilized a little bit. You get very rapid uptake when something new comes to market. So we saw a little bit more stable shares in the second half of 2015, which I take as a good sign. Outside the U.S. growth is quite solid, mostly driven by the pancreatic ongoing launches where it's still pretty early days in some countries. We still don't have reimbursement in all of the top 5 countries in Europe. So that's going extremely well, and there's still room for -- from a shared gains standpoint for us to establish ABRAXANE [indiscernible] as standard of care in Europe and it take -- essentially the same places taken in the U.S. The lung launch in Europe is in very early days. So in the near-term, that stronger growth outside the U.S. is going to contribute to giving -- putting us in a solid position with respect to overall global growth, while the rest of these things play out. So just with respect to the couple of things that you highlighted, I think, pretty obviously, assuming that the [indiscernible] combination data is positive, you've got the potential for ABRAXANE to be the backbone chemotherapy in multiple indications in I/O combination regimen. So that would, longer term, be the more significant upside. At the same time, the adjuvant pancreas trial is our trial, so that's fully within our management. And as you probably know, that indication could double or potentially more than double the size of the pancreas opportunity for ABRAXANE versus the one that we have today. So those are a couple of things that we are pretty optimistic about. And then for the next year or so until we see some of that Phase III I/O data in 2017, we're holding our own and doing really pretty well."

What we've seen this year is that outside of the U.S., and notably, as we made our way to the newly diagnosed label expansion negotiations in Europe, we had price decreases across the portfolio that were pretty much in line with where we expected them to be. But versus a year ago, they were a little bit more this year as we made our way through those negotiations. So globally, when you add all those things together, and Peter showed some numbers on one of his slides for the overall portfolio, that went a little bit of a positive impact on the overall portfolio this year. But that includes mix as well and the ongoing growth in the IMiDs, OTEZLA coming into the portfolio. When you -- if you strip that out, the global impact of price altogether is relatively modest."

So we were able to, I think, very successfully penetrate the market. Access is a barrier in this marketplace. It's a highly managed category. There's no question, but we've continued to chip away that access environment. And I think the important thing to note is that payers have implemented exceptions to the 2 biologic step rule, those that have it, because they want to be able to encourage patients to be able to get on ultimate therapy if the biologic therapy is not appropriate. And so the interesting thing, sort of the proof is really in the data. When I think about the data, more than 80% of patients in the psoriasis markets that are coming on OTEZLA are not coming from a biologic. So the access things are there, but there are exceptions to be able to get around that. And we have not found access to be a significant burden on the ability to drive demand. We would like to evolve that axis and maybe be in a preferred position as we go forward. But critical thing for navigating the axis environment is driving demand, driving volume.

And we've had enough of feedback and particularly we feel like the path is clear in Europe, and we have said that our plan is to submit based on the GeparSepto data in Europe by the fourth quarter of this year. We need a little bit more clarification from FDA about some of the data that we -- they would want to see before we make a decision about timing in the U.S. So do we want to go through the trial design for ETNA? I mean, you can pull it up on the clinicaltrials.gov, it's a slightly different population, it's the HER2 negative high-risk population, again, potentially complementary to the GeparSepto data, but not necessary from the submission standpoint."

When you look at shares, the point is that given the strength of that RVD data and the current share position, there is room for more adoption of the RVD triplet. And we think that even in the current environment, the PFS data supports that greater adoption. You've also potentially seen in smart guidelines just as one example, get updated where RVD has replaced some RD[ph] for newly diagnosed under those guidelines. So you can already see a positive reception to that data just based on the strength of the data. On a go-forward basis, I think that Velcade going generic, given just on the strength of the efficacy data for the RVD regimen is going to put the regimen in a very good position in a number of geographies with respect to adoption. And I think it's going to be a highly competitive regimen. And when you think about the other triplets coming along, they are all going to have to find a way to show their value proposition in that landscape."

We are pleased to be with you today to discuss the details of our exceptional start to 2016. 
During the first quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our key strategic imperatives, and the results and progress we will highlight today reflect the strong operating momentum of our global commercial franchises and significant advances made in the key areas of research and development. Importantly, we achieved these results while both investing in our high potential research portfolio and assertively managing our capital structure. Our first quarter performance and key market dynamics for our products strengthens our confidence that we will achieve at least the mid-point of our 2016 EPS and product sales guidance ranges that we provided in January. To that end, today, we are raising the lower end of our 2016 sales and EPS ranges. Our excellent business momentum also presents us with the opportunity to provide further clarity on our 2017 targets, where we now expect top line growth of approximately 18% and EPS growth of approximately 22% based on the mid-point of our adjusted 2016 and 2017 ranges. 
Peter will provide additional details on our updated 2016 guidance and 2017 target. And in addition to reviewing our excellent commercial performance, Jackie and Scott will discuss the progress our global teams are making towards maximizing the potential of our marketed products and broadening the footprint of our therapeutic franchise. 
With the positive results of the Phase III/b TSA-006 trial, evaluating OTEZLA in biologic-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis, we have entered a 2-year period when we expect to have the results from 18 Phase III clinical trials, involving our commercial portfolio and several key late-stage compounds. These significant later-stage programs and several molecules in early and mid-stage development are expected to provide the platforms for our continued growth through the next decade. 
Under the leadership of Rupert and Rob Hershberg, our somatic centers of excellence and our integrated collaborative research model continues to advance our portfolio of unique and potentially transformative early-stage molecules towards critical position points. 
Since the start of this year, we have already achieved important milestones related to the development of 3 novel therapies. We filed investigational new drug submissions for CC-9009, [indiscernible] for acute myeloid leukemia; CC-9010, a BET inhibitor in development for solid tumors; and in collaboration with our partner, [indiscernible] Bio, we have dosed the first patient with DB-2121, our BCMA CAR-T therapy for patients with multiple myeloma. 
Additionally, based on the tremendous progress our partner Juno has made with its CD19 CAR-T therapies, we exercised our option on the program, providing yet another opportunity for us to build on and leverage our existing expertise in infrastructure to accelerate the development of the unique therapeutic approach in the promising field of immuno-oncology. Combining our expertise in immunology and inflammation, protein homeostasis, epigenetics and immuno-oncology with insights gained from our world-class partners is rapidly increasing our understanding of the biology and drivers of cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. This research engine is enhancing our discovery capabilities and driving the identification of therapies that have a potential to disrupt and improve treatment paradigms for significantly underserved patient population. 
Our first quarter performance and important research, clinical and regulatory achievements have as well positioned to deliver high growth in the near, medium and long term. 
Thank you, and I'm pleased to welcome Peter to our call."

As Mark mentioned, this has been an exceptional start to the year, with strong volume-driven product sales growth of 21%, driving bottom line growth of 23%. We are delivering this industry-leading performance",1501,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. 
As Mark mentioned, this has been an exceptional start to the year, with strong volume-driven product sales growth of 21%, driving bottom line growth of 23%. We are delivering this industry-leading performance while significantly increasing our R&D investments, as we lay the foundation for long-term growth. 
Our business momentum has us on track to achieve the upper half of our previously issued 2016 adjusted earnings guidance. Accordingly, we are now raising the bottom end of that range, updating guidance to $5.60 to $5.70 per share. 
Later on the call, I will discuss how we see this momentum continuing into 2017 and right through to 2020.
First, I would like to provide our thoughts on the outstanding Q1 results. Q1 net product sales grew 21% to approximately $2.5 billion, really strong growth. And key contributions were made by REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA. Both Jackie and Scott will [indiscernible] the underlying demand dynamic and outlook for these products later on the call. 
Secondly, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, the sequential performance from Q4 to Q1 is always impacted by several items. REVLIMID and POMALYST are impacted in Q1 by higher gross net adjustments related to early Medicare donor [indiscernible] and other ACA payments. In addition, international REVLIMID sales were favorably impacted by the [indiscernible] in Q4. And ABRAXANE sales are impacted by customer contract optimization that results in a buy-in during Q4, followed by a sell-through in Q1. Not surprisingly, these dynamics result in the 2% sequential decline in net product sales in Q4.
Looking at our top line drivers of growth. Volume accounted for 19 of the 21 total percentage points of growth, outstanding operational performance. A modest contribution from price was partially offset by foreign exchange. The strengthening U.S. dollar drove a negative ForEx impact of approximately $31 million or a 1.5% negative impact to net product sales.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $1.32 per share, which includes a $0.065 impact for milestone payments made to collaboration partners for the advancement of our joint [ph] program. Now you may recall that we did not have any milestone payments in Q1 last year. This performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30 per share due to the strong operational performance. U.S. REVLIMID sales are ahead of expectation, and OTEZLA and POMALYST posted very solid year-on-year growth. 
Turning to the P&L line item. As you can see, Celgene's outstanding P&L performance continued. The adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 54%. We saw meaningful leverage from G&A and also from the fact that we are now lapping strong sales and marketing investments that were in place a year ago. And these investments last year supported the launches of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, the U.S. OTEZLA launch and global rollouts for ABRAXANE and POMALYST/IMNOVID. This year, the increase in SG&A was primarily to support the rollout of OTEZLA in the European Community. 
As we highlighted over the last 2 [ph] quarters, we are making significant investments in advancing our next generation of growth drivers through the mid- to late-stage clinical trials. Year-over-year, our R&D grew 37% due to increased clinical trial activity; the Receptos operations, which were not part of our Q1 financials last year; and the $65 million of collaboration-related milestone patients I just mentioned earlier. 
Finally, the tax rate increased from the prior period, largely due to product and geographic mix. The exceptional operational performance in Q1 drove adjusted earnings per share. Operating income growth drove $0.27 per share of the $0.25 per share bottom line growth. In total, financial levers had a negative $0.02 impact, primarily due to higher interest expense in the $8 billion bond offering last summer. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. As we mentioned on the last call, given current market conditions and our long-term view on the value of the company, we accelerated our full year plans and were forceful during Q1 with the repurchase program acquiring $1.4 billion of shares. We achieved this level of activity while preserving financial flexibility to continue making strategic investments that further build long-term shareholder value. 
Based on the strong start to the year, we are updating our 2016 guidance. We now expect REVLIMID to achieve sales of $6.7 billion, a high-end of the previous range. ABRAXANE sales are expected to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range due to a highly competitive U.S. market for lung and breast cancer therapy. OTEZLA and POMALYST are on track, with solid trajectories for the year. All of this gives us confidence to raise the lower end of the previous total net product sales range to $10.75 billion. 
We expect R&D to increase throughout the year based on clinical trial activity and new programs coming to the portfolio, such as the recent opt-in on Juno's CD19 CAR T program. Based on these adjustments, we are also raising the lower end of the adjusted earnings guidance to the new range of $5.60 to $5.70 per share, as I mentioned earlier. 
A great first quarter and an improved outlook for 2016. And very importantly, we anticipate that this strong operational momentum will carry forward. 
Our guidance for 2016 equates to 19% top line growth and 20% bottom line growth. We have spent some time assessing how this great 2016 momentum will carry forward beyond our current guidance here into our target time frame. We are very pleased to say that despite the previously discussed ForEx impact of a strengthened the U.S. dollar and our ongoing substantial late-stage R&D investment, we expect to sustain our top and bottom line performance into 2017 and through to our 2020 target goal. This has been achieved as we significantly increased our R&D in late-stage pipeline investment funding 18 Phase III trials and is based on current ForEx exchange rates. 
Our outlook for 2017 now establishes a target of 18% growth top line, completely in line with our 2020 target CAGR previously announced. It is again worth noting that viewed on a constant currency basis, this 2017 top line outlook represents a performance in the high end of our previous target range. 
Additionally, we anticipate that the 2016 bottom line growth rate will be improved in 2017 to 22%, which is approaching our 22 -- the 2020 CAGR previously announced in our prior target. And it represents an improvement over the increased 2016 bottom line guidance range. Of course, all these growth rates are based on the mid-point of our target ranges. 
With these outstanding growth prospects, the operational performance of Celgene is expected to remain outstanding relative to the industry for the duration of our target time frame. 
Now let's focus on the 2 target years specifically. Turning to 2017. The primary driver in our expected the commercial performance is REVLIMID, which we now expect to achieve sales of approximately $8 billion, a $1 billion increase from our prior target. Both POMALYST and OTEZLA are on track and expected to achieve our previous targets. These 3 drivers are partially offset by ABRAXANE due to the previously mentioned competitive dynamic. 
Importantly, our R&D agenda remains very full within 2017. Programs such as GED-0301, Ozanimod, [indiscernible], and Juno's CD19 program are  sliding [ph] high-potential assets that represent next-generation growth drivers for the company, and they will all receive important R&D late-stage investments in 2017. 
At the bottom line, we now target 2017 adjusted earnings per share between $6.75 and $7 a share and expect 22% increase from 2016 based on the guidance midpoints in each year. 
Finally, for modeling purposes, we advise you to use a diluted share count of 825 million shares. Now this figure is in line with our prior target but higher than our 2016 guidance. Beginning next year, a change to the accounting standards per share-based payments eliminates the favorable adjustment that is currently provided in the Treasury stock method for calculating the diluted share count. This will increase our share count based solely on the new calculation methodology. Additionally, increases in the Celgene share price will also create an increase in the calculated share count. 
To round out our longer-term targets, we are on track to achieve our 2020 target of over $21 billion in product sales and over $13 in adjusted earnings per share. As I mentioned, these figures now reflect the current ForEx environment. We are on track despite the weakened U.S. dollar due to our operational strength. We expect that our mix of products will be different, as we now anticipate that the momentum and upside expected in REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA will be offset by our reduced ABRAXANE outlook. 
As you can see, Q1 financial performance was outstanding. It supports strong full year outlook and aligns with our target for 2017 and 2020. A very strong position for Celgene. 
Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie."

Our hematology franchise performance is particularly robust, especially in multiple myeloma. We have leading positions in many geographies across all lines of myeloma therapy, and we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us. 
Our global launch of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma continues and is a key driver of our growth trajectory. POMALYST/IMNOVID remains a critical component of our portfolio and has a strong global position in relapsed/refractory myeloma. ABRAXANE's growth outside the U.S. remains solid, as the product rises to a standard of care position in multiple markets in pancreatic cancer. 
In the U.S., we continue to face significant competitive challenges as we compete with novel agents in terms in both breast and lung. 
Our clinical, medical and regulatory teams delivered another solid quarter of execution on our development programs. We made progress across all therapeutic categories on our portfolio of trials, including opting into Juno CD19 program. We look forward to the ongoing investment of our program, including the first readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program with top line results from REMARC for diffuse large B diffuse lymphoma coming 
soon. 
Significant growth opportunities are ahead of us in multiple myeloma. REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID are now backbone therapies within combination regimens across all lines of myeloma treatment. Strictly combinations and continuous treatment are driving and will continue to drive increases in duration. We are gaining shares in newly diagnosed myeloma across many geographies and will continue to build on our competitive position, with label expansions for REVLIMID in the post stem cell transplant segment and for POMALYST/IMNOVID in renal-impaired patients and, over time, for both products in combination regimen. 
Generally, for multiple myeloma, the pool of patients is growing around the world with the aging population and with new therapies expanding survival and thus, prevalent. 
And large areas of unmet medical need in myeloma remain. We believe we have a strong portfolio of novel agents in development that position us very well to deliver new therapies to patients who are not yet cured of their disease. And we will report our progress results program as they advance. 
Even as those development plans evolve for new novel agents, starting already now with recently approved and soon-to-come triplet regimens, we see nice growth opportunities for [indiscernible] in combination regimens, including [indiscernible], to continue to gain market share in the U.S., EU 5 and other geographies as well.
REVLIMID had a great quarter in Q1, and we are extremely pleased with our 19% year-over-year growth, excluding negative foreign exchange. In the U.S. in multiple myeloma, we continue to see strong growth in new RXs and total RXs, positive momentum in duration and the ongoing adoption of the continuous treatment approach with REVLIMID. 
Our growth is mainly volume-driven, and we expect this to continue for a long time to come. This strong momentum stems from a series of positive event that but REVLIMID in an outstanding position as a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma. We now see solid trends in the U.S. with 12 to 18 months of experience demonstrating the impact of these events in the marketplace. The same trends are taking hold outside the U.S. as well, as we achieve reimbursement for newly diagnosed myeloma across Europe and now in Japan, with approximately 1 year of data post the launch of new diagnosed myeloma in Europe. Now in several countries across Europe, we feel highly confident in REVLIMID's future growth trajectory as we continue its broad global expansion.
POMALYST/IMNOVID global growth remains stellar at 38% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis and is robust across most major geographies. One exception was France, where net revenues for the quarter were negatively impacted in the amount of about $15 million due to a onetime adjustment to rebate. Globally, growth is volume-driven from share gains and increasing duration of treatment. POMALYST/IMNOVID now holds a leading position in third line and greater myeloma and all major markets where it is approved and reimbursed. Growth will continue to be strong in 2016 and beyond, as we will have our first full year of product sales in Japan, as duration trends continue to increase around the world, and as we work to update our label for renal impairment data, which will allow us to better address that patient segment. 
In addition, POMALYST/IMNOVID combination regimens are being studied with a variety of novel agents, and additional future growth will come as those data and subsequent approvals become available. 
ABRAXANE continues to hold a solid position in the treatment of breast, lung and pancreatic cancers within a highly competitive marketplace. In the U.S., overall demand for the product has been relatively stable. In pancreatic cancer, ABRAXANE, in combination with gemcitabine, remains the standard of care with around 50% sale of first-line patients. In both breast and squamous lung, U.S. shares have been generally flat, while shares are somewhat down in on squamous lung. We are also seeing some downward impact on the number of breast cancer patients being treated with chemotherapy post the launch of [indiscernible] early last year. 
Outside the U.S., ABRAXANE growth is good, as the product is moving to a standard of care position for pancreatic cancer in the markets where it is reimbursed. Future catalysts for ABRAXANE include data from the now fully enrolled APACT adjuvant pancreas trial expected in 2017 and data from immuno-oncology combination trials in lung expected in 2017 and triple-negative breast expected in 2018.
Our Hematology/Oncology franchise is off to a great start to the year, with particularly strong trends in hematology. As Peter highlighted, this momentum is causing us to now see REVLIMID coming in at the upper end of our revenue guidance range for 2016 at around $6.7 billion. With the strength we see across our hematology portfolio this year, when we look ahead to next year, we now expect the target range for 2017 total hematology revenues of $10.2 billion to $10.5 billion and a range of $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion for the combined Hematology/Oncology franchise, including the net negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Our clinical programs are advancing with lymphoma in the lead, and we look forward to sharing top line data with you soon from the REMARC diffuse large B-cell trial. 
As we move into 2017, we will have even more data coming from our lymphoma program, as we will see the readout of the RELEVANCE trial in follicular lymphoma in the first half of the year and the AUGMENT trial in the second half. 
Looking to the longer term, we have expanded the number of new compounds and indications in our mid- to late-stage hematology pipeline. This progress gives us significant confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2020 target of over $17 billion of Hematology/Oncology sales despite negative currency impact. We look forward to providing you with more updates on our clinical programs during upcoming medical meetings at ASCO and EHA are upon us, and we have excellent sets of abstract submissions for both congresses. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Scott."

Q1 was a strong quarter for Celgene I&I for OTEZLA. In Q1, we saw revenues continue to grow throughout the quarter in the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remained strong in all geographies [indiscernible]",630,"Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. Q1 was a strong quarter for Celgene I&I for OTEZLA. In Q1, we saw revenues continue to grow throughout the quarter in the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remained strong in all geographies [indiscernible]. And in March, we filed JNDA in Japan. We also significantly advanced the development pipeline for Celgene I&I by taking part of steps forward in the GED-0301 and ozanimod program, as well as with many other early- to mid-stage clinical programs. 
Global OTEZLA net sales for Q1 2016 were $196 million. This represents a 224% year-on-year increase. Sales in Q1 continued to increase despite normal TRx market declines in the first quarter. The majority of revenues remained from the U.S., but are we also seeing encouraging [indiscernible] in the early launch countries in Europe. 
In 2016, our focus in Europe was not only on execution in the early launch countries but also in our optimal reimbursement decisions in the next wave of countries and more broadly expanding our footprint in the EU. This should be a significant source of growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, we are very pleased with the global execution of the OTEZLA launch, as we head into the second full year of commercialization. The strong start in 2016 will help enable us achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in 2016.
Now looking specifically at the U.S. Positioning consumer campaigns are driving increases to brand awareness, patient requests and trials. It's important to note that OTEZLA continues to meet all other therapies [indiscernible] with approximately 40% of both psoriasis and PsA markets. 
Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 20% of the total branded market. In the slower evolving PsA market, OTEZLA has already achieved 15% market share of the branded market. Also importantly, earlier this month, at the AMCP meeting, data was presented and concluded OTEZLA patient showed a similar persistence compared with a biologic cohort amongst adults with psoriasis in the United States. 
We are continuing to execute in advance on our world [indiscernible] cycle plan for OTEZLA. As previous the mentioned, we filed for both psoriasis and PsA in Japan. We also received data from PsA-006 Phase III study in biologic-naïve patients. This was our fifth positive Phase III study for OTEZLA in PsA. 
We expect the number of milestones in 2016 and '17, including data for our once-daily registration program as well as Phase II studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. Phase III data from the global recess trial should be available in 2017. 
We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-0301 and Ozanimod. Specifically looking at GED, in Q1, we completed enrollment in the endoscopic study CD-001 in Crohn's disease as well as continuing to enroll the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's Disease trial, CD-002, and the Phase II proof-of-concept study in ulcerative colitis. 
During Q1, we saw significant data readouts for ozanimod, including presentations of both the 72-week MS data, ACTRIMS, and the TOUCHSTONE UC Phase II data at ECCO. We also expect the TOUCHSTONE data to be published in a major medical journal in the very near future. 
Q1 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to have a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. 
We also moved all major development programs ahead. These programs will be major contributors driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio, as we move deeper into 2016. 
Thank you for your attention. I'd like to know turn the call back to Mark."

I'll pass to Jackie and [indiscernible] to comment on their outlook for related products. The U.S. side actually for the benefit of all the listeners, is actually in the back half first slide I believe in the backup of the site that we went through. It just simply highlights that over time, we've had targets for 2017 revenue, which actually, from when they were originally issued to more recently they were $13 billion [ph] to $14 billion [ph] of increase in the original target. And if you eliminate the ForEx impact, what that shows us that, in fact, our current operational performance is in the high end of that guidance range. Entire discussion for 2017 total product sales is entirely a question of its strong operational performance, offset by foreign exchange impacts by strengthened dollar. So thanks for pointing that out. I think the key is also, though, very importantly, is with that target that we've laid out for '17 and for 22 -- 2020, we can see now our path forward at current foreign exchange rates to having very strong sales momentum that we're achieving this year, that we anticipate maintaining that momentum in 2017. And quite frankly, that's up very well to maintain that momentum all the way through 2020.

So just on the Hem/Onc franchise. We've talked about the mix for the franchise for probably about a year or so as being different than what we had expected back in 2013 when we gave these targets, largely driven by the dynamic for ABRAXANE in the marketplace, post the era of the checkpoint inhibitor, and a couple of other novel agents as well. So if you take the REVLIMID update of $8 billion compared to 7, 4 [ph], that's the plus billion that you talked about, when you think about the operational performance, the lion share of the foreign exchange would also hit REVLIMID at $8 billion, excluding foreign exchange, would be even higher, significantly higher. The other products that would come next in the ranking of those impacted by foreign exchange would be POMALYST/IMNOVID now that we're into the year, where we have more international sales for that product. You will remember that the ABRAXANE target for 2017 that was given in 2013 was $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So now holding ABRAXANE number of around $1 billion, you can see, I think, pretty clearly where that mix shift is."

And any of my colleagues, you want to add to it, please feel free. The main thing that we see, as we continue to make progress on the top line, is we feel like we've got pretty clear visibility to how we would be able to bring more targeted novel agents to market to further address certain patient segments within multiple myeloma, be it high-risk patients, patients that are refractory to certain compounds. And we, I think, have a plan and a strategy that's as clear as it's ever been with the agents that we have in our hands today. And you saw that on one of the slides where we have quite a nice of portfolio. And what we've learned about the mechanism of action of the [indiscernible] results are allowing us to potentially accelerate the next generation of compounds coming out of that platform and the third one modifying agents to allow us to achieve that segmentation and then bringing more targeted therapies to the different patient segments. So when we think about REVLIMID as we approach that 2025, 2026 timeframe, we see it probably not being replaced by one new novel agents but by a basket of novel agents in combination therapies that are going to allow us to grow through that patent cliff. And I think that's probably as much is I need to say at this point in time. I would also maybe add that, at some point, when we do another Research Day or an Analyst/Investor Day, I think we'll be looking to give you a bit more visibility to how we're thinking about those things. Let me also maybe just summarize, I'll turn it over to Scott, sorry for the long-winded answer. But with the negotiation on the patent litigation, I think, from your perspective and modeling, now that you've got that 2026 goalpost in there, you can see how we get there over the next 10 years in terms of bringing these novel agents forward. And I think you'll see that our development programs are taking us in that direction. There are -- I'm sorry, I'm keeping -- going long with this. There are some compound that are also not in any of our forecasts yet, including [indiscernible], for example, which is one that you've got a decent amount of visibility to already in terms of the clinical development program [indiscernible].

Good morning, Geoff. Thanks for the question. So the first thing on the sequential -- what you see each quarter, each beginning of each year in the first quarter, I think this is actually not so much specific to Celgene even necessarily as an industry-wide phenomenon, which is with the ACA program, you do make payments each has a certain tax we pay, as well as we have to make higher gross-to-net payments early in the year to fill the [indiscernible]. So I think that's the dynamic where you see a lot of it coming through, and basically, it's a first quarter effect that kind of hit the gross-to-net. That's the main item. I mean, do think there's anything beyond that. I do think probably if on products that came into the same reimbursement world with a government program under ACA, you'd see that for most companies. I went through that, just highlight but as you go for Q4 to Q1 and sort of an odd thing. If you are -- if you happen to be looking at the sequential quarters, which, personally, I would like to look at year-over-year growth, obviously, but if you look at sequential quarters, this is to keep at the back of your mind among gross-to-net does have some extra volume in the first quarter. We also just remind you that in Q4, we actually did have a very favorable tender that helped our performance in the first quarter. It's not much of a gross-to-net, but it's a good volume item, and I mentioned that as well. And then Jackie and her comments, we did have one adjustment our gross-to-net in France that actually impacted the gross-to-net for POMALYST. So POMALYST really I think of a ski to understand that there is a slight adjustment in the first quarter that's a onetimer to catch-up. And that so POMALYST I think either Rita at a little bit make sure you get an accurate view of momentum of POMALYST, which is just great and doing very well around the world. On the second question, relative to our flexibility, I would just highlighting a couple of things. First of all, as we went through the transaction with Receptos last year, we did increase our debt load. And obviously, we highlighted that, that took us up to a much higher debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the short term. And with a very strong cash flow performance in the company that will we were to back down again, pretty quickly actually. We'll be cover that with the credit agencies very carefully from a full understanding and agreement on that, which is great. The other thing I'd say is as we do our best development activity, we are able to use some of our foreign cash in a lot of these transactions because very often, we have [indiscernible] worldwide actually buying IT, for example, when we did the AstraZeneca deal, that IP was already offshore. As you get other transactions like GED-0301, like was enough for asset. So we are able to use that so as a result, our U.S. cash position relative to Moody's ratings is not stressed. We're also able with receptors. We have relatively good U.S. cash position, and we highlight that in a 10-Q. You'll see that in the 10-Q each quarter. We did it for the 10-K as well. And in fact, our years cash position is actually relatively good amount and going to the transaction. So from that standpoint, we feel very good about our debt-to-EBITDA. We actually just recently met with all the agencies. I think everybody is good. Your question was more prospectively if a transaction came along, how would we look at it? Those are so situation specific, larger transaction. Obviously, we're not trying to forecast that with the case but obviously, ipilimumab end up using some equity or you might push yourself up again a little bit. But we obviously have got a very, very full arsenal right now between our internal pipeline as well as our collaboration portfolio. And so we really did use 2015 as a major step in immuno-oncology. Are we still hungry for BD deals? Absolutely. And you'll see us continue to do transactions for different companies often sitting in the profile of our collaboration portfolio. Present time is right opportunity, we would be happy to step up and I think the point about strong financial flexibility is that the oven very fortunate to have a very strong cash flow in this company. We work very closely with a credit agencies on a regular basis, and we feel very comfortable about where we are and where we're going."

It also has put in perspective that every year we have a presidential election, but it's definitely going to turn over, you see this happening when you look at 1992 or 2008 and what happened. And so it is an important time for us to address these issues. But first, we're going to be faced with these issues of cost and value for a long time regardless of the politics of it. I think the politics are important to us. I think we need to make sure we understand that the kind of changes that anybody would propose to really affect our outcomes are going to be very significant unlikely to occur. So we think the issue set of been dealt with with the normal operations of our businesses and the systems in our ecosystem, whether it's payers and providers. And we've got to work through a better job to define what value is, and I think you'll see people on one side of the system try and decide this is the way we'll defined value, and others are going to other methods. I think there are many collaborative efforts going on today between companies on our side and also versus payers working together to find solutions to these issues to ensure that we do constrain costs but not at the reduction of these kind of investments that we need to deal with incredible issues that we have to face in Alzheimer's, cancer, metabolic disease, et cetera. So we're very concerned about it. We got -- before the end of his presidential debate, we've got [indiscernible] there's a balance of the discussion. We've got important initiatives coming on for the industry about that in the coming weeks and months.

When you run some of the numbers out and do some scenarios, we could have some nice upside to 2020. I think, today, what we're prepared to say about that is we would expect the mix to be different between Heme and Onc, as we have said, for 2016 and 2017. But the fundamentals for REVLIMID and POMALYST both are really exceptionally strong."

That's a little bit of a dynamic. So we feel very good about the operational performance. The data coming through is great. So in no way [indiscernible] think that we're not very bullish on these leading brands. I think some of those uptakes will come as we get more visibility into the market. But I think the other thing that we've already talked about today is we have a ROBUST pipeline of [indiscernible] drugs behind all of this that we still need to see when and how they segment and change the market.

So I think one of the key aspects of this, well, there's probably 2 maybe, and again, one of the things that we've been able to address in a research type of a day are the molecules behave very differently. We know a lot about them now and are able to design them to fine-tune certain aspects of them to hit the target certain patient segments. We're quite optimistic about that.

We're seeing patient initiations at the highest levels possible. We're continuing to gain market share. There's a lot of momentum on-demand. And we're seeing very good persistency of patients on the drug. There was a paper just published last week showing very similar persistency OTEZLA versus biologic cohort, which is very encouraging. And we've got the number of countries that are going to be launching as we go through '16 into early '17. We are still at this point in reimbursement discussions and not launched yet in the U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy. So those are upside and then growth drivers for '16, '17 and beyond. And Japan, we believe, is going to be strong growth driver as well. And we filed in Japan. We have a very strong pivotal trial with [indiscernible] 11 we filed in Japan. We expect an approval towards the end of this year and be launching and reimbursement in early in 2017. We think there's a tremendous opportunity. For the compound in Japan, they're very oral-oriented and very safety-oriented. And we think the product fits very, very well so we've got nice opportunity in Japan. Second part of the question was [indiscernible]. We've seen, since the launch of [indiscernible], I'm looking at the slides, UC the market share grasp. Both from a new to brand patient initiation perspective and from a market share perspective and a TRx perspective, we've seen OTEZLA continue to grow at a similar rate before versus after the launch of [indiscernible]. We believe that they are products, which are competing in quite different parts of the market, [indiscernible ] mainly from [indiscernible] portion. And if you were me some of the data that we presented on OTEZLA, 80% of patients who are going to OTEZLA are coming from something other than a biologic therapy, whether that's lidar or topicals or oral DMARD.

We are pleased to be with you today to discuss the details of our exceptional start to 2016. During the first quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our key strategic imperatives, and the results and progress we will highlight today reflect the strong operating momentum of our global commercial franchises and significant advances made in the key areas of research and development. Importantly, we achieved these results while both investing in our high-potential research portfolio and assertively managing our capital structure. 
Our first quarter performance and key market dynamics for our products strengthens our confidence that we will achieve at least the mid-point of our 2016 EPS and product sales guidance ranges that we provided in January. To that end, today, we are raising the lower end of our 2016 sales and EPS ranges. Our excellent business momentum also presents us with the opportunity to provide further clarity on our 2017 targets, where we now expect top line growth of approximately 18% and EPS growth of approximately 22% based on the mid-point of our adjusted 2016 and 2017 ranges. 
Peter will provide additional details on our updated 2016 guidance and 2017 target. And in addition to reviewing our excellent commercial performance, Jackie and Scott will discuss the progress our global teams are making towards maximizing the potential of our marketed products and broadening the footprint of our therapeutic franchise. 
With the positive results of the Phase IIIb PSA-006 trial, evaluating OTEZLA in biologic-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis, we have entered a 2-year period when we expect to have the results from 18 Phase III clinical trials involving our commercial portfolio and several key late-stage compound. These significant later-stage programs and several molecules in early- and mid-stage development are expected to provide the platforms for our continued growth through the next decade. 
Under the leadership of Rupert Vessey and Robert Hershberg, our Thematic Centers of Excellence and our integrated collaborative research model continues to advance our portfolio of unique and potentially transformative early-stage molecules towards critical decision points. 
Since the start of this year, we have already achieved important milestones relating to the development of 3 novel therapies. We filed investigational new drug submissions for CC-9009, a cell [indiscernible] for acute myeloid leukemia; CC-9010, a BET inhibitor in development for solid tumors; and in collaboration with our partner, bluebird bio, we have dosed the first patient with bb2121, our BCMA CAR T therapy for patients with multiple myeloma. 
Additionally, based on the tremendous progress our partner Juno has made with its CD19 CAR T therapies, we exercised our option on the program, providing yet another opportunity for us to build on and leverage our existing expertise in infrastructure to accelerate the development of a unique therapeutic approach in the promising field of immuno-oncology. 
Combining our expertise in immunology and inflammation, protein homeostasis, epigenetics and immuno-oncology with insights gained from our world-class partners is rapidly increasing our understanding of the biology and drivers of cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. This research engine is enhancing our discovery capabilities and driving the identification of therapies that have a potential to disrupt and improve the treatment paradigms for significantly underserved patient population. 
Our first quarter performance and important research, clinical and regulatory achievements have us well positioned to deliver high growth in the near, medium and long term.

258769,329818430,966060,"Celgene Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Celgene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, this has been an exceptional start to the year, with strong volume-driven product sales growth of 21%, driving bottom line growth of 23%. We are delivering this industry-leading performance w",1499,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, this has been an exceptional start to the year, with strong volume-driven product sales growth of 21%, driving bottom line growth of 23%. We are delivering this industry-leading performance while significantly increasing our R&D investments as we lay the foundation for long-term growth. Our business momentum has us on track to achieve the upper half of our previously issued 2016 adjusted earnings guidance. Accordingly, we are now raising the bottom end of that range, updating guidance to $5.60 to $5.70 per share. Later on the call, I will discuss how we see this momentum continuing into 2017 and right through to 2020.
First, I would like to provide our thoughts on the outstanding Q1 results. Q1 net product sales grew 21% to approximately $2.5 billion, really strong growth. And key contributions were made by REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA. Both Jackie and Scott will address the underlying demand dynamic and outlook for these products later on the call. 
Secondly, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, the sequential performance from Q4 to Q1 is always impacted by several items. REVLIMID and POMALYST are impacted in Q1 by higher gross net adjustments related to early Medicare donut hole and other ACA payments. In addition, international REVLIMID sales were favorably impacted by the tendering in Q4. And ABRAXANE sales are impacted by customer contract optimization that results in a buy-in during Q4, followed by a sell-through in Q1. Not surprisingly, these dynamics resulted in the 2% sequential decline in net product sales in Q4.
Looking at our top line drivers of growth. Volume accounted for 19 of the 21 total percentage points of growth, outstanding operational performance. A modest contribution from price was partially offset by foreign exchange. The strengthening U.S. dollar drove a negative ForEx impact of approximately $31 million or a 1.5% negative impact to net product sales.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $1.32 per share, which includes a $0.065 impact for milestone payments made to collaboration partners for the advancement of our joint program. Now you may recall that we did not have any milestone payments in Q1 last year. This performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30 per share due to the strong operational performance. U.S. REVLIMID sales are ahead of expectation and OTEZLA and POMALYST posted very solid year-on-year growth. 
Turning to the P&L line item. As you can see, Celgene's outstanding P&L performance continued. The adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 54%. We saw meaningful leverage from G&A and also from the fact that we are now lapping strong sales and marketing investments that were in place a year ago. And these investments last year supported the launches of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, the U.S. OTEZLA launch and global rollouts for ABRAXANE and POMALYST/IMNOVID. This year, the increase in SG&A was primarily to support the rollout of OTEZLA in the European community. 
As we highlighted over the last few quarters, we are making significant investments in advancing our next generation of growth drivers through the mid- to late-stage clinical trials. Year-over-year, R&D grew 37% due to increased clinical trial activity; the Receptos operations, which were not part of our Q1 financials last year; and the $65 million of collaboration-related milestone payments that I just mentioned earlier. 
Finally, the tax rate increased from the prior period, largely due to product and geographic mix. The exceptional operational performance in Q1 drove adjusted earnings per share. Operating income growth drove $0.27 per share of the $0.25 per share bottom line growth. In total, financial levers had a negative $0.02 impact, primarily due to higher interest expense in the $8 billion bond offering last summer. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. As we mentioned on the last call, given current market conditions and our long-term view on the value of the company, we accelerated our full year plans and were forceful during Q1 with the repurchase program acquiring $1.4 billion of shares. We achieved this level of activity while preserving financial flexibility to continue making strategic investments that further build long-term shareholder value. 
Based on the strong start to the year, we are updating our 2016 guidance. We now expect REVLIMID to achieve sales of $6.7 billion, a high end of the previous range. ABRAXANE sales are expected to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range due to a highly competitive U.S. market for lung and breast cancer therapy. OTEZLA and POMALYST are on track with solid trajectories for the year. All of this gives us confidence to raise the lower end of the previous total net product sales range to $10.75 billion. 
We expect R&D to increase throughout the year based on clinical trial activity and new programs coming to the portfolio, such as the recent opt-in on Juno's CD19 CAR T program. Based on these adjustments, we are also raising the lower end of the adjusted earnings guidance to the new range of $5.60 to $5.70 per share, as I mentioned earlier. A great first quarter and an improved outlook for 2016. And very importantly, we anticipate that this strong operational momentum will carry forward. 
Our guidance for 2016 equates to 19% top line growth and 20% bottom line growth. We have spent some time assessing how this great 2016 momentum will carry forward beyond our current guidance here into our target time frame. We are very pleased to say that despite the previously discussed ForEx impact of a strengthened the U.S. dollar and our ongoing substantial late-stage R&D investment, we expect to sustain our top and bottom line performance into 2017 and through to our 2020 target goal. This has been achieved as we significantly increased our R&D late-stage pipeline investment funding 18 Phase III trials and is based on current ForEx exchange rates. 
Our outlook for 2017 now establishes a target of 18% growth top line, completely in line with our 2020 target CAGR we previously announced. It is again worth noting that viewed on a constant currency basis, this 2017 top line outlook represents a performance in the high end of our previous target range. 
Additionally, we anticipate that the 2016 bottom line growth rate will be improved in 2017 to 22%, which is approaching our 22 -- 2020 CAGR previously announced in our prior target. And it represents an improvement over the increased 2016 bottom line guidance range. Of course, all these growth rates are based on the mid-point of our target ranges. With these outstanding growth prospects, the operational performance of Celgene is expected to remain outstanding relative to the industry for the duration of our target time frame. 
Now let's focus on the 2 target years specifically. Turning to 2017. The primary driver in our expected commercial performance is REVLIMID, which we now expect to achieve sales of approximately $8 billion, a $1 billion increase from our prior target. Both POMALYST and OTEZLA are on track and expected to achieve our previous target. These 3 drivers are partially offset by ABRAXANE due to the previously mentioned competitive dynamic. 
Importantly, our R&D agenda remains very full within 2017. Programs such as GED-0301, Ozanimod, durvalumab and Juno's CD19 program are exciting high-potential assets that represent next-generation growth drivers for the company, and they will all receive important R&D late-stage investment in 2017.  At the bottom line, we now target 2017 adjusted earnings per share between $6.75 and $7 a share and expect 22% increase from 2016 based on the guidance midpoints in each year. 
Finally, for modeling purposes, we advise you to use a diluted share count of 825 million shares. Now this figure is in line with our prior target, but higher than our 2016 guidance. Beginning next year, a change to the FASB accounting standards per share-based payments eliminates the favorable adjustment that is currently provided in the treasury stock method for calculating the diluted share count. This will increase our share count based solely on the new calculation methodology. Additionally, increases in the Celgene share price will also create an increase in the calculated share count. 
To round out our longer-term targets, we are on track to achieve our 2020 target of over $21 billion in product sales and over $13 in adjusted earnings per share. As I mentioned, these figures now reflect the current ForEx environment. We are on track despite the weakened U.S. dollar due to our operational strength. We expect that our mix of products will be different as we now anticipate that the momentum and upside expected in REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA will be offset by our reduced ABRAXANE outlook. As you can see, Q1 financial performance was outstanding. It supports strong full year outlook and aligns with our targets for 2017 and 2020. A very strong position for Celgene. 
Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie."

Our hematology franchise performance is particularly robust, especially in multiple myeloma. We have leading positions in many geographies across all lines of myeloma therapy, and we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us. 
Our global launch of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma continues and is a key driver of our growth trajectory. POMALYST/IMNOVID remains a critical component of our portfolio and has a strong global position in relapsed/refractory myeloma. ABRAXANE's growth outside the U.S. remains solid as the product rises to a standard of care position in multiple markets in pancreatic cancer. In the U.S., we continue to face significant competitive challenges as we compete with novel agent in terms -- in both breast and lung. 
Our clinical, medical and regulatory teams delivered another strong quarter of execution on our development programs. We made progress across all therapeutic categories on our portfolio of trials, including opting into Juno's CD19 program. We look forward to the ongoing investment of our program, including the first readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program with top line results from REMARC for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma coming 
soon. 
Significant growth opportunities are ahead of us in multiple myeloma. REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID are now backbone therapies within combination regimens across all lines of myeloma treatment. Strictly combinations and continuous treatment are driving and will continue to drive increases in duration. We are gaining shares in newly diagnosed myeloma across many geographies and will continue to build on our competitive position with label expansions for REVLIMID in the post-stem cell transplant segment and for POMALYST/IMNOVID in renal-impaired patients and over time, for both products in combination regimen. 
Generally, for multiple myeloma, the pool of patients is growing around the world with the aging population and with new therapies expanding survival and thus, prevalence. And large areas of unmet medical need in myeloma remain. We believe we have a strong portfolio of novel agents in development that position us very well to deliver new therapies to patients who are not yet cured of their disease. And we will report our progress with those programs as they advance. 
Even as those development plans evolve for new novel agents, starting already now with recently approved and soon-to-come triplet regimens, we see nice growth opportunities for IMiD, in combination regimens including IMiDs, to continue to gain market share in the U.S., EU-5 and other geographies as well.
REVLIMID had a great quarter in Q1 and we are extremely pleased with our 19% year-over-year growth, excluding negative foreign exchange. In the U.S., in multiple myeloma, we continue to see strong growth in new RXs and total RXs, positive momentum in duration and the ongoing adoption of the continuous treatment approach with REVLIMID. Our growth is mainly volume-driven and we expect this to continue for a long time to come. 
This strong momentum stems from a series of positive events that put REVLIMID in an outstanding position as a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma. We now see solid trends in the U.S. with 12 to 18 months of experience demonstrating the impact of these events in the marketplace. These same trends are taking hold outside the U.S. as well, as we achieve reimbursement for newly diagnosed myeloma across Europe, and now in Japan, with approximately 1 year of data post the launch of newly diagnosed myeloma in Europe. Now in several countries across Europe, we feel highly confident in REVLIMID's future growth trajectory as we continue its broad global expansion.
POMALYST/IMNOVID global growth remains stellar at 38% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis and is robust across most major geographies. One exception was France, where net revenues for the quarter were negatively impacted in the amount of about $15 million due to a onetime adjustment to rebate. Globally, growth is volume-driven from share gains and increasing duration of treatment. POMALYST/IMNOVID now holds a leading position in third line and greater myeloma in all major markets where it is approved and reimbursed. 
Growth will continue to be strong in 2016 and beyond, as we will have our first full year of product sales in Japan, as duration trends continue to increase around the world and as we work to update our label for renal impairment data, which will allow us to better address that patient segment. In addition, POMALYST/IMNOVID combination regimens are being studied with a variety of novel agents and additional future growth will come as those data and subsequent approvals become available. 
ABRAXANE continues to hold a solid position in the treatment of breast, lung and pancreatic cancers within a highly competitive marketplace. In the U.S., overall demand for the product has been relatively stable. In pancreatic cancer, ABRAXANE, in combination with gemcitabine, remains the standard of care with around 50% share of first-line patients. In both breast and squamous lung, U.S. shares have been generally flat, while shares are somewhat down in non-squamous lung. We are also seeing some downward impact on the number of breast cancer patients being treated with chemotherapy post the launch of palbociclib early last year. 
Outside the U.S., ABRAXANE growth is good, as the product is moving to a standard of care position for pancreatic cancer in the markets where it is reimbursed. Future catalysts for ABRAXANE include data from the now fully enrolled APACT adjuvant pancreas trial expected in 2017 and data from immuno-oncology combination trials in lung expected in 2017 and triple-negative breast expected in 2018.
Our Hematology/Oncology franchise is off to a great start to the year with particularly strong trends in hematology. As Peter highlighted, this momentum is causing us to now see REVLIMID coming in at the upper end of our revenue guidance range for 2016 at around $6.7 billion. With the strength we see across our hematology portfolio this year, when we look ahead to next year, we now expect the target range for 2017 total hematology revenues of $10.2 billion to $10.5 billion and a range of $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion for the combined Hematology/Oncology franchise, including the net negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Our clinical programs are advancing with lymphoma in the lead, and we look forward to sharing top line data with you soon from the REMARC diffuse large B-cell trial. As we move into 2017, we will have even more data coming from our lymphoma program, as we will see the readout of the RELEVANCE trial in follicular lymphoma in the first half of the year and the AUGMENT trial in the second half. 
Looking to the longer term, we have expanded the number of new compounds and indications in our mid- to late-stage hematology pipeline. This progress gives us significant confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2020 target of over $17 billion of Hematology/Oncology sales, despite negative currency impact. We look forward to providing you with more updates on our clinical programs during upcoming medical meetings as ASCO and EHA are upon us, and we have excellent sets of abstract submissions for both congresses. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In Q1, we saw revenues continue to grow throughout the quarter in the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remained strong in all geographies in which we have launched. And in March, we filed JNDA in Japan. We also significantly advanced the development pipeline for Celgene I&I by taking important of steps forward in the GED-0301 and Ozanimod program, as well as with many other early- to mid-stage clinical programs. 
Global OTEZLA net sales for Q1 2016 were $196 million. This represents a 224% year-on-year increase. Sales in Q1 continued to increase despite normal TRx market declines in the first quarter. The majority of revenues remained from the U.S., but we are also seeing encouraging metrics in the early launch countries in Europe. In 2016, our focus in Europe was not only on execution in the early launch countries, but also in gaining optimal reimbursement decisions in the next wave of countries and more broadly expanding our footprint in the EU. This should be a significant source of growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, we are very pleased with the global execution of the OTEZLA launch, as we head into the second full year of commercialization. The strong start in 2016 will help enable us achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in 2016.
Now looking specifically at the U.S. Physician and consumer campaigns are driving increases to brand awareness, patient requests and trials. It's important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies of new-to-brand share with approximately 40% of both psoriasis and PsA markets. 
Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 20% of the total branded market. In the slower evolving PsA market, OTEZLA has already achieved 15% market share of the branded market. Also importantly, earlier this month, at the AMCP meeting, data was presented and concluded OTEZLA patient showed a similar persistence compared with a biologic cohort amongst adults with psoriasis in the United States. 
We are continuing to execute in advance on a robust lifecycle plan for OTEZLA. As previously mentioned, we filed for both psoriasis and PsA in Japan. We also received data from PSA-006 Phase III study in biologic-naïve patients. This was our fifth positive Phase III study for OTEZLA in PsA. 
We expect the number of milestones in 2016 and '17, including data for our once-daily registration program as well as Phase II studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. Phase III data from the global research trial should be available in 2017. 
We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-0301 and Ozanimod. Specifically looking at GED, in Q1, we completed enrollment in the endoscopic study CD-001 in Crohn's disease as well as continuing to enroll the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's disease trial, CD-002, and the Phase II proof-of-concept study in ulcerative colitis. 
During Q1, we saw significant data readouts for Ozanimod, including presentations of both the 72-week MS data in ACTRIMS, and the TOUCHSTONE UC Phase II data at ECCO. We also expect the TOUCHSTONE data to be published in a major medical journal in the very near future. 
Q1 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to have a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead. These programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move deeper into 2016.

Let me start on that and then I'm going to pass it to Jackie and Scott as well to comment on their outlook for each of their related products. So you referenced the slide, but actually for the be  fit of all the listeners, is actually in the backup. It's the first slide, I believe, in the backup of the slide that we went through. And it just simply highlights that, over time, we've had targets for 2017 revenue which actually from when they were originally issued to more recently they were $13 billion to $14 billion which was an increase in the original target. And if you eliminate the ForEx impact, what that would show is that, in fact, our current operational performance is in the high end of that guidance range. The entire discussion for 2017 total product sales is entirely a question of its strong operational performance, offset by foreign exchange impacts by a strength in dollar. So thanks for pointing that out. I think the key is also though, and very importantly, is with that target that we've laid out for '17 and for 22 -- 2020, we can see now our path forward at current foreign exchange rates to having very strong sales momentum that we're achieving this year, that we anticipate maintaining that momentum in 2017. And quite frankly, that's up very well to maintaining that momentum all the way through 2020. Now in terms of the individual products, maybe I'll let Jackie and Scott each just comment on what they see happening."

So just on the Hem/Onc franchise, we've talked about the mix for the franchise for probably about a year or so as being different than what we had expected back in 2013 when we gave these targets, largely driven by the dynamic for ABRAXANE in the marketplace, post the era of the checkpoint inhibitors and a couple of other novel agents as well. So if you take the REVLIMID update of $8 billion compared to $7 billion before, that's the plus billion that you talked about. When you think about the operational performance, so the lion's share of the foreign exchange would also hit REVLIMID at $8 billion excluding foreign exchange, would be even higher, significantly higher. The other product that would come next in the ranking of those impacted by foreign exchange would be POMALYST/IMNOVID now that we're into the year where we have more international sales for that product. You will remember that the ABRAXANE target for 2017 that was given in 2013 was $1.5 billion to $2 billion.

And any of my colleagues who want to add to it, please feel free. The main thing that we see as we continue to make progress on the top line is, we feel like we've got pretty clear visibility to how we will be able to bring more targeted novel agents to market to further address certain patient segments within multiple myeloma, be they high-risk patients, patients that are refractory to certain compounds. And we, I think, have a plan and a strategy that is as clear as it's ever been with the agents that we have in our hands today, and you saw that on one of the slides where we have quite a nice of portfolio. And what we've learned about the mechanism of action of the IMiDs of [indiscernible] is also allowing us to potentially accelerate the next generation of compounds coming out of that platform and the third one modifying agents to allow us to achieve that segmentation and then bringing more targeted therapies to the different patient segments. So when we think about REVLIMID as we approach that 2025, 2026 time frame, we see it probably not being replaced by one new novel agent, but by a basket of novel agents in combination therapies that are going to allow us to grow through that patent cliff. And I think that's probably as much is I need to say at this point in time. I would also maybe add that, at some point, when we do another Research Day or an Analyst/Investor Day, I think we'll be looking to give you a bit more visibility to how we're thinking about those things. Let me also maybe just summarize -- I'll turn it over to Scott, sorry for the long-winded answer, but with the negotiation on the patent litigation, I think, from your perspective and modeling, now that you've got that 2026 goalpost in there, you can see how we get there over the next 10 years in terms of bringing these novel agents forward. And I think you'll see that our development programs are taking us in that direction. There are -- I'm sorry, I'm keeping -- going long with this, but there are some compounds that are also not in any of our forecasts yet, including durvalumab, for example, which is one that you've got a decent amount of visibility to already in terms of the clinical development program, and you'll see data over time.

So the first thing on the sequential -- what you see each quarter, each first -- beginning of each year in the first quarter, I think this is actually not so much specific to Celgene even necessarily as",827,"Sure. Good morning, Geoff. Thanks for the question. So the first thing on the sequential -- what you see each quarter, each first -- beginning of each year in the first quarter, I think this is actually not so much specific to Celgene even necessarily as an industry-wide phenomenon, which is with the ACA program, you do make payments, each of us have a certain tax we pay as well as we have to make higher gross-to-net payments early in the year to fill the donor hole. So I think that's a dynamic where you see a lot of that coming through, and basically, it's a first quarter effect that kind of hits the gross-to-net. That's the main item. I mean, I don't think there's anything else beyond that, and I do think probably if you found products that came into the same reimbursement world with the government programs under ACA, you'd see that for most companies. I went through that, just to highlight, as you go from Q4 to Q1, it's just sort of an odd thing. If you are -- if you happen to be looking at sequential quarters, which, personally, I would like to look at year-over-year growth, obviously, but if you look at sequential quarters, these are just things to keep in the back of your mind that the gross-to-net does kind of pick up some extra volume in the first quarter. We also, just to remind you that, in Q4, we actually did have a very favorable tender that helped our performance in the first quarter. It's not so much of a gross-to-net, but it's a good volume item, and I mentioned that as well. And then Jackie, in her comments, we did have one adjustment to our gross-to-net in France, that actually impacted the gross-to-net for POMALYST. So POMALYST really I think did this, the key to understand that there is a slight adjustment in the first quarter that's a one timer to catch-up. And -- so POMALYST, I think we need to retune that a little bit to make sure you get an accurate view of the momentum of POMALYST, which is just great, and doing very well around the world. On the second question, relative to our flexibility, I would just highlight a couple of things. First of all, as we went through the transaction with Receptos last year, we did increase our debt load. And obviously, we highlighted that, that took us up to a much higher debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the short term. And with a very strong cash flow performance of the company that would be worked back down again, not pretty quickly actually. We'll obviously cover that with the credit agencies very carefully for full understanding and agreement on that, which is great. The other thing I'd say is that, as we do our business development activity, we are able to use some of our foreign cash in a lot of these transactions because very often, we have rest of the world, right? So we're actually buying IP, that for example, when we did the AstraZeneca deal, IP was already offshore. As you get other transactions like GED-0301 and likewise, an offshore asset. So we are able to use that, so as a result, our U.S. cash position relative to the Moody's ratings is not as stressed. We're also able to do that with Receptos, so we have a relatively good U.S. cash position, and we highlighted that in the 10-Q. You'll see that in the 10-Q each quarter. We did it for the 10-K as well. And in fact, our U.S. cash position is actually relatively good having gone through that transaction. So from that standpoint, we feel very good about our debt-to-EBITDA. We actually, just recently, met with all the agencies. I think everything is good. Now, your question was more prospectively, if a transaction came along, how would we look at it? Those are so situation-specific, if it was a large transaction, obviously we're not trying to forecast that would be the case, but obviously you might end up using some equity or you might push yourself up again a little bit. But we obviously have got a very, very full arsenal right now between our internal pipeline as well as our collaboration portfolio. And so we really did use 2015 as a major year to step into immuno-oncology. Are we still hungry for BD deals? Absolutely. And you'll see us continuing to do transactions with different companies often sitting in the profile of our collaboration portfolio. Present time is the right opportunity, came along we would be happy to step up, and I think the point about the strong financial flexibility is that we've been very fortunate to have a very strong cash flow in this company. We work very closely with the credit agencies on a regular basis, and we feel very comfortable about where we are, and where we're going."

It matches very nicely with unmet medical need in that phase of trial, is powered for both PFS and OS. What we would expect to see, I think we've even told you, and you can see out there in clinicaltrials.gov that the expected PFS difference will be about 15 months versus the control. And we would expect or hope to see a positive, statistically significant result on PFS, and a trend on OS. We do not necessarily expect at this time to see a statistically significant trend. But we think that with the trend in OS and a positive PFS trial that we've got a nice regulatory submission."

I think there are some important issues that we need to make sure we're all aware of. We have the overarching economics and benefits of developed societies, they're going to keep pressure on health care economics for several decades. So I think the most significant issue that we all face is, how do we afford the health care that we want to have, and make the investments in the future that we want? I think that we're very concerned by the level of noise in the environment. It's very concerning, and it's real. It also has put in perspective that every 8 years we have a presidential election, when it's definitely going to turn over, you see this happening whether you look at 1992 or 2008 and what happened. And so it is an important time for us to address these issues. But first, we're going to be faced with these issues of cost and value for a long time regardless of the politics of it. I think the politics are important to us. I think we need to make sure we understand that the kind of changes that anybody would propose to really affect our outcomes are going to be very significant, unlikely to occur. So we think the issues that are going to have to be dealt with normal operations of our businesses and the systems in our ecosystem, whether it's payers and providers. And we've got to work through a better job to define what value is, and I think you'll see people on one side of the system try and decide this is the way we'll define value, and others are going to other methods. I think there are many collaborative efforts going on today between companies on our side and also versus payers working together to find solutions to these issues to ensure that we do constrain costs, but not at the reduction of these kind of investments that we need to deal with the incredible issues that we as a society face in Alzheimer's, cancer, metabolic disease, et cetera. So we're very concerned about it. We've got a -- before the end of this presidential debate, we've got to change the tenor so that there's a balance in the discussion. We've got important initiatives coming on from the industry about that in the coming weeks and months. But I think we ought to recognize, this is a long-term issue that we're going to be dealing with, based on the longer term health care economics of the entire system. And we've got to be fair to that discussion."

So I think we'll see the tide kind of change a little bit after the election. But we're totally engaged. It's constructive.

And now we just have the SWOG data presentation at ASH last year. But with that, what we're seeing, and this is true across the world, and we also included the slides for the early launch countries for newly diagnosed in Europe, where we now have about a year's worth of data. We see very strong share uptake in the markets where the product is reimbursed. And we're seeing positive duration trends in all geographies. We're also seeing physicians who previously did not necessarily fully embrace the continuous treatment of paradigm now embracing that paradigm. We're also seeing fundamental support for not only REVLIMID but also POMALYST in combinations that is going to be a reality for a long time to come. We're seeing very nice increases in duration for POMALYST as well. So I think that we're in a great position. When you run some of the numbers out and do some scenarios, we could have some nice upside to 2020. I think, today, what we're prepared to say about that is, we would expect the mix to be different between Heme and Onc, as we have said, for 2016 and 2017.

Relative to OTEZLA, and the confidence we have in the targets and goals for '16 and '17 are the idea that the TRxs continue to grow, were the highest levels ever as of last week. We're seeing patient initiations at the highest levels possible. We're continuing to gain market share. There's a lot of momentum and demand. And we're seeing very good persistency of patients on the drug. There was a paper just published last week showing very similar persistency OTEZLA versus biologic cohort, which is very encouraging. And then we've got a number of countries that are going to be launching as we go through '16 into early '17. We are still at this point in reimbursement discussions and not launched yet in the U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy. So those are upside and growth drivers for '16, '17 and beyond. And Japan, we believe, is going to be a strong growth driver as well. And we filed in Japan. We had a very strong pivotal trial with PSOR-011, we filed in Japan. We expect an approval towards the end of this year, and be launching with reimbursement early in 2017. We think there's a tremendous opportunity. For the compound in Japan, they're very oral-oriented and very safety-oriented. And we think the product fits very, very well, and so we've got nice growth opportunity in Japan. The second part of the question was Cosentyx. What we've seen, since the launch of Cosentyx, and if you look at the slides, you can see the market share graph. Both from a new to brand patient initiation perspective and from a market share perspective and a TRx perspective, we've seen OTEZLA continue to grow at a similar rate before versus after the launch of Cosentyx. We believe that they are products, which are competing in quite different parts of the market, Cosentyx mainly from TNF failure portion. And if you remember, some of the data that we presented on OTEZLA, 80% of patients who are going -- coming to OTEZLA are coming from something other than a biologic therapy, whether that's lido or topicals or oral DMARD. So I think the products that are -- are in very different parts of the market and looking at different patients."

tax rate up a little bit. So overall, in the financial section, I'd say, really not much benefit there. And then the overall, the net positive, probably we had a couple of positive items on our hedging relative to the recognition of positive impacts from the forward points as we roll forward. You may recall last fall, we had a couple of quarters where we had some negative impact. This is just a volatile item that bounces back and forth. So net-net though I think we -- I would retain my comment that the interest expense, interest income, net-net, should be in that high $400 million range on a full year basis. In any given quarter, the other category can be positive or negative. And I wouldn't go one way or the other with that. I would remind you that sometimes when there is a positive it is offset by a higher discreet item in the tax line. 
So just to wrap things up. And if I can just finish things up for the company. We're really thrilled with the first quarter. We feel like we have come into the year with great momentum and it has allowed us to increase our guidance, top line and bottom line.

We are pleased to be with you today to discuss the details of our exceptional start to 2016. During the first quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our key strategic imperatives, and the results and progress we will highlight today reflect the strong operating momentum of our global commercial franchises and significant advances made in the key areas of research and development. Importantly, we achieved these results while both investing in our high-potential research portfolio and assertively managing our capital structure. 
Our first quarter performance and key market dynamics for our products strengthens our confidence that we will achieve at least the midpoint of our 2016 EPS and product sales guidance ranges that we provided in January. To that end, today, we are raising the lower end of our 2016 sales and EPS ranges. Our excellent business momentum also presents us with the opportunity to provide further clarity on our 2017 targets, where we now expect top line growth of approximately 18% and EPS growth of approximately 22% based on the mid-points of our adjusted 2016 and 2017 ranges. 
Peter will provide additional details on our updated 2016 guidance and 2017 target. And in addition to reviewing our excellent commercial performance, Jackie and Scott will discuss the progress our global teams are making towards maximizing the potential of our marketed products and broadening the footprint of our therapeutic franchise. 
With the positive results of the Phase IIIb PSA-006 trial, evaluating OTEZLA in biologic-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis, we have entered a 2-year period when we expect to have the results from 18 Phase III clinical trials involving our commercial portfolio and several key late-stage compound. These significant later-stage programs and several molecules in early- and mid-stage development are expected to provide the platforms for our continued growth through the next decade. 
Under the leadership of Rupert Vessey and Robert Hershberg, our Thematic Centers of Excellence and our integrated collaborative research model continues to advance our portfolio of unique and potentially transformative early-stage molecules towards critical decision points. 
Since the start of this year, we have already achieved important milestones relating to the development of 3 novel therapies. We filed investigational new drug submissions for CC-90009, a cell mod for acute myeloid leukemia; CC-90010, a BET inhibitor in development for solid tumors; and in collaboration with our partner, bluebird bio, we have dosed the first patient with bb2121, our BCMA CAR T therapy for patients with multiple myeloma. 
Additionally, based on the tremendous progress our partner Juno has made with its CD19 CAR T therapies, we exercised our option on the program, providing yet another opportunity for us to build on and leverage our existing expertise in infrastructure to accelerate the development of a unique therapeutic approach in the promising field of immuno-oncology. 
Combining our expertise in immunology and inflammation, protein homeostasis, epigenetics and immuno-oncology with insights gained from our world-class partners is rapidly increasing our understanding of the biology and drivers of cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. This research engine is enhancing our discovery capabilities and driving the identification of therapies that have a potential to disrupt and improve the treatment paradigms for significantly underserved patient populations.
Our first quarter performance and important research, clinical and regulatory achievements have us well positioned to deliver high growth in the near, medium and long term. 
Thank you, and I'm pleased to welcome Peter to our call."
258769,329818430,966456,"Celgene Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Celgene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, this has been an exceptional start to the year, with strong volume-driven product sales growth of 21%, driving bottom line growth of 23%. We are delivering this industry-leading performance w",1500,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, this has been an exceptional start to the year, with strong volume-driven product sales growth of 21%, driving bottom line growth of 23%. We are delivering this industry-leading performance while significantly increasing our R&D investments as we lay the foundation for long-term growth. Our business momentum has us on track to achieve the upper half of our previously issued 2016 adjusted earnings guidance. Accordingly, we are now raising the bottom end of that range, updating guidance to $5.60 to $5.70 per share. Later on in the call, I will discuss how we see this momentum continuing into 2017 and right through to 2020.
First, I would like to provide our thoughts on the outstanding Q1 results. Q1 net product sales grew 21% to approximately $2.5 billion, really strong growth. And key contributions were made by REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA. Both Jackie and Scott will address the underlying demand dynamic and outlook for these products later on the call. 
Secondly, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, the sequential performance from Q4 to Q1 is always impacted by several items. REVLIMID and POMALYST are impacted in Q1 by higher gross net adjustments related to early Medicare donut hole and other ACA payments. In addition, international REVLIMID sales were favorably impacted by the Russian tender in Q4. And ABRAXANE sales are impacted by customer contract optimization that results in a buy-in during Q4, followed by a sell-through in Q1. Not surprisingly, these dynamics resulted in the 2% sequential decline in net product sales in Q4.
Looking at our top line drivers of growth. Volume accounted for 19 of the 21 total percentage points of growth, outstanding operational performance. A modest contribution from price was partially offset by foreign exchange. The strengthening U.S. dollar drove a negative ForEx impact of approximately $31 million or a 1.5% negative impact to net product sales.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $1.32 per share, which includes a $0.065 impact for milestone payments made to collaboration partners for the advancement of our joint program. Now you may recall that we did not have any milestone payments in Q1 last year. This performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30 per share due to the strong operational performance. U.S. REVLIMID sales are ahead of expectation and OTEZLA and POMALYST posted very solid year-on-year growth. 
Turning to the P&L line item. As you can see, Celgene's outstanding P&L performance continued. The adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 54%. We saw meaningful leverage from G&A and also from the fact that we are now lapping strong sales and marketing investments that were in place a year ago. And these investments last year supported the launches of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, the U.S. OTEZLA launch and global rollouts for ABRAXANE and POMALYST/IMNOVID. This year, the increase in SG&A was primarily to support the rollout of OTEZLA in the European community. 
As we highlighted over the last few quarters, we are making significant investments in advancing our next generation of growth drivers through the mid- to late-stage clinical trials. Year-over-year, R&D grew 37% due to increased clinical trial activity; the Receptos operations, which were not part of our Q1 financials last year; and the $65 million of collaboration-related milestone payments that I just mentioned earlier. 
Finally, the tax rate increased from the prior period, largely due to product and geographic mix. The exceptional operational performance in Q1 drove adjusted earnings per share. Operating income growth drove $0.27 per share of the $0.25 per share bottom line growth. In total, financial levers had a negative $0.02 impact, primarily due to higher interest expense in the $8 billion bond offering last summer. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. As we mentioned on the last call, given current market conditions and our long-term view on the value of the company, we accelerated our full year plans and were forceful during Q1 with the repurchase program, acquiring $1.4 billion of shares. We achieved this level of activity while preserving financial flexibility to continue making strategic investments that further build long-term shareholder value. 
Based on the strong start to the year, we are updating our 2016 guidance. We now expect REVLIMID to achieve sales of $6.7 billion, the high end of the previous range. ABRAXANE sales are expected to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range due to a highly competitive U.S. market for lung and breast cancer therapy. OTEZLA and POMALYST are on track with solid trajectories for the year. All of this gives us confidence to raise the lower end of the previous total net product sales range to $10.75 billion. 
We expect R&D to increase throughout the year based on clinical trial activity and new programs coming to the portfolio, such as the recent opt-in on Juno's CD19 CAR T program. Based on these adjustments, we are also raising the lower end of the adjusted earnings guidance to the new range of $5.60 to $5.70 per share, as I mentioned earlier. A great first quarter and an improved outlook for 2016. And very importantly, we anticipate that this strong operational momentum will carry forward. 
Our guidance for 2016 equates to 19% top line growth and 20% bottom line growth. We have spent some time assessing how this great 2016 momentum will carry forward beyond our current guidance year into our target time frame. We are very pleased to say that despite the previously discussed ForEx impact of a strengthened U.S. dollar and our ongoing substantial late-stage R&D investment, we expect to sustain our top and bottom line performance into 2017 and through to our 2020 target goal. This is being achieved as we significantly increase our R&D late-stage pipeline investment, funding 18 Phase III trials and is based on current ForEx exchange rates. 
Our outlook for 2017 now establishes a target of 18% growth top line, completely in line with our 2020 target CAGR previously announced. It is again worth noting that viewed on a constant currency basis, this 2017 top line outlook represents a performance in the high end of our previous target range. 
Additionally, we anticipate that the 2016 bottom line growth rate will be improved in 2017 to 22%, which is approaching our 22 -- 2020 CAGR previously announced in our prior target. And it represents an improvement over the increased 2016 bottom line guidance range. Of course, all these growth rates are based on the midpoint of our target ranges. With these outstanding growth prospects, the operational performance of Celgene is expected to remain outstanding relative to the industry for the duration of our target time frame. 
Now let's focus on the 2 target years specifically. Turning to 2017. The primary driver in our expected commercial performance is REVLIMID, which we now expect to achieve sales of approximately $8 billion, a $1 billion increase from our prior target. Both POMALYST and OTEZLA are on track and expected to achieve our previous target. These 3 drivers are partially offset by ABRAXANE, due to the previously mentioned competitive dynamic. 
Importantly, our R&D agenda remains very full within 2017. Programs such as GED-0301, Ozanimod, durvalumab and Juno's CD19 program are exciting high-potential assets that represent next-generation growth drivers for the company, and they will all receive important R&D late-stage investment in 2017.  At the bottom line, we now target 2017 adjusted earnings per share between $6.75 and $7 a share, an expected 22% increase from 2016 based on the guidance midpoints in each year. 
Finally, for modeling purposes, we advise you to use a diluted share count of 825 million shares. Now this figure is in line with our prior target, but higher than our 2016 guidance. Beginning next year, a change to the FASB accounting standards for share-based payments eliminates a favorable adjustment that is currently provided in the treasury stock method for calculating the diluted share count. This will increase our share count based solely on the new calculation methodology. Additionally, increases in the Celgene share price will also create an increase in the calculated share count. 
To round out our longer-term targets, we are on track to achieve our 2020 target of over $21 billion in product sales and over $13 in adjusted earnings per share. As I mentioned, these figures now reflect the current ForEx environment. We are on track despite the weakened U.S. dollar due to our operational strength. We expect that our mix of products will be different as we now anticipate that the momentum and upside expected in REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA will be offset by our reduced ABRAXANE outlook. As you can see, Q1 financial performance was outstanding. It supports a strong full year outlook and aligns with our targets for 2017 and 2020. A very strong position for Celgene. 
Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie."

Our hematology franchise performance is particularly robust, especially in multiple myeloma. We have leading positions in many geographies across all lines of myeloma therapy, and we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us. 
Our global launch of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma continues and is a key driver of our growth trajectory. POMALYST/IMNOVID remains a critical component of our portfolio and has a strong global position in relapsed/refractory myeloma. ABRAXANE's growth outside the U.S. remains solid as the product rises to a standard of care position in multiple markets in pancreatic cancer. In the U.S., we continue to face significant competitive challenges as we compete with novel agent entrants in both breast and lung. 
Our clinical, medical and regulatory teams delivered another strong quarter of execution on our development programs. We made progress across all therapeutic categories on our portfolio of trials, including opting into Juno's CD19 program. We look forward to the ongoing advancement of our programs, including the first readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program, with top line results from REMARC for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma coming soon. 
Significant growth opportunities are ahead of us in multiple myeloma. REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID are now backbone therapies within combination regimens across all lines of myeloma treatment. Triplet combinations and continuous treatment are driving and will continue to drive increases in duration. We are gaining shares in newly diagnosed myeloma across many geographies and will continue to build on our competitive position with label expansions for REVLIMID in the post-stem cell transplant segment and for POMALYST/IMNOVID in renal-impaired patients and over time, for both products in combination regimen. 
Generally, for multiple myeloma, the pool of patients is growing around the world with the aging population and with new therapies expanding survival and thus, prevalence. And large areas of unmet medical need in myeloma remain. We believe we have a strong portfolio of novel agents in development that position us very well to deliver new therapies to patients who are not yet cured of their disease. And we will report on our progress with those programs as they advance. 
Even as those development plans evolve for new novel agents, starting already now with recently approved and soon-to-come triplet regimens, we see nice growth opportunities for IMiD, and combination regimens including IMiDs, to continue to gain market share in the U.S., EU-5 and other geographies as well.
REVLIMID had a great quarter in Q1 and we are extremely pleased with our 19% year-over-year growth, excluding negative foreign exchange. In the U.S., in multiple myeloma, we continue to see strong growth in new Rxs and total Rxs, positive momentum in duration and the ongoing adoption of the continuous treatment approach with REVLIMID. Our growth is mainly volume-driven and we expect this to continue for a long time to come. 
This strong momentum stems from a series of positive events that put REVLIMID in an outstanding position as a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma. We now see solid trends in the U.S. with 12 to 18 months of experience demonstrating the impact of these events in the marketplace. These same trends are taking hold outside the U.S. as well, as we achieve reimbursement for newly diagnosed myeloma across Europe, and now in Japan, with approximately 1 year of data post the launch of newly diagnosed myeloma in Europe. Now in several countries across Europe, we feel highly confident in REVLIMID's future growth trajectory as we continue its broad global expansion.
POMALYST/IMNOVID global growth remains stellar at 38% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis and is robust across most major geographies. One exception was France, where net revenues for the quarter were negatively impacted in the amount of about $15 million due to a onetime adjustment to rebate. Globally, growth is volume-driven from share gains and increasing duration of treatment. POMALYST/IMNOVID now holds a leading position in third line and greater myeloma in all major markets where it is approved and reimbursed. 
Growth will continue to be strong in 2016 and beyond, as we will have our first full year of product sales in Japan, as duration trends continue to increase around the world and as we work to update our label for renal impairment data, which will allow us to better address that patient segment. In addition, POMALYST/IMNOVID combination regimens are being studied with a variety of novel agents and additional future growth will come as those data and subsequent approvals become available. 
ABRAXANE continues to hold a solid position in the treatment of breast, lung and pancreatic cancers within a highly competitive marketplace. In the U.S., overall demand for the product has been relatively stable. In pancreatic cancer, ABRAXANE, in combination with gemcitabine, remains the standard of care with around 50% share of first-line patients. In both breast and squamous lung, U.S. shares have been generally flat, while shares are somewhat down in non-squamous lung. We are also seeing some downward impact on the number of breast cancer patients being treated with chemotherapy post the launch of palbociclib early last year. 
Outside the U.S., ABRAXANE growth is good, as the product is moving to a standard of care position for pancreatic cancer in the markets where it is reimbursed. Future catalysts for ABRAXANE include data from the now fully enrolled APACT adjuvant pancreas trial expected in 2017 and data from immuno-oncology combination trials in lung expected in 2017 and triple-negative breast expected in 2018.
Our Hematology/Oncology franchise is off to a great start to the year with particularly strong trends in hematology. As Peter highlighted, this momentum is causing us to now see REVLIMID coming in at the upper end of our revenue guidance range for 2016 at around $6.7 billion. With the strength we see across our hematology portfolio this year, when we look ahead to next year, we now expect the target range for 2017 total hematology revenues of $10.2 billion to $10.5 billion and a range of $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion for the combined Hematology/Oncology franchise, including the net negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Our clinical programs are advancing with lymphoma in the lead, and we look forward to sharing top line data with you soon from the REMARC diffuse large B-cell trial. As we move into 2017, we will have even more data coming from our lymphoma program, as we will see the readout of the RELEVANCE trial in follicular lymphoma in the first half of the year and the AUGMENT trial in the second half. 
Looking to the longer term, we have expanded the number of new compounds and indications in our mid- to late-stage hematology pipeline. This progress gives us significant confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2020 target of over $17 billion of Hematology/Oncology sales, despite negative currency impact. We look forward to providing you with more updates on our clinical programs during upcoming medical meetings, as ASCO and EHA are upon us, and we have excellent sets of abstract submissions for both congresses. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In Q1, we saw revenues continue to grow throughout the quarter in the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remain strong in all geographies in which we have launched. And in March, we filed JNDA in Japan. We also significantly advanced the development pipeline for Celgene I&I by taking important steps forward in the GED-0301 and Ozanimod program, as well as with many other early- to mid-stage clinical programs. 
Global OTEZLA net sales for Q1 2016 were $196 million. This represents a 224% year-on-year increase. Sales in Q1 continued to increase despite normal TRx market declines in the first quarter. The majority of revenues remain from the U.S., but we are also seeing encouraging metrics in the early launch countries in Europe. In 2016, our focus in Europe was not only on execution in the early launch countries, but also on gaining optimal reimbursement decisions in the next wave of countries and more broadly expanding our footprint in the EU. This should be a significant source of growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Overall, we are very pleased with the global execution of the OTEZLA launch, as we head into the second full year of commercialization. The strong start in 2016 will help enable us achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in 2016.
Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician and consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests and trials. It's important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies of new-to-brand share, with approximately 40% of both psoriasis and PsA markets. 
Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 20% of the total branded market. In the slower evolving PsA market, OTEZLA has already achieved 15% market share of the branded market. Also importantly, earlier this month, at the AMCP meeting, data was presented that concluded OTEZLA patients showed a similar persistence compared with a biologic cohort amongst adults with psoriasis in the United States. 
We are continuing to execute in advance on a robust life cycle plan for OTEZLA. As previously mentioned, we filed for both psoriasis and PsA in Japan. We also received data from PSA-006, a Phase III study in biologic-naïve patients. This was our fifth positive Phase III study for OTEZLA in PsA. 
We expect a number of milestones in 2016 and '17, including data for our once-daily registration program as well as Phase II studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. Phase III data from the global Behçet's trial should be available in 2017. 
We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-0301 and Ozanimod. Specifically looking at GED, in Q1, we completed enrollment in the endoscopic study CD-001 in Crohn's disease as well as continuing to enroll the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's disease trial, CD-002, and the Phase II proof-of-concept study in ulcerative colitis. 
During Q1, we saw significant data readouts for Ozanimod, including presentations of both the 72-week MS data at ACTRIMS, and the TOUCHSTONE UC Phase II data at ECCO. We also expect the TOUCHSTONE data to be published in a major medical journal in the very near future. 
Q1 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to have a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead. These programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move deeper into 2016.

So you referenced a slide, but actually for the benefit of all the listeners, is actually in the backup. It's the first slide, I believe, in the backup of the slides that we went through. And it just simply highlights that over time, we've had targets for 2017 revenue which actually from when they were originally issued to more recently, they were $13 billion to $14 billion, which was an increase in the original target. And if you eliminate the ForEx impact, what that would show is that, in fact, our current operational performance is in the high end of that guidance range. The entire discussion for 2017 total product sales is entirely a question of is strong operational performance offset by foreign exchange impacts by a strength in dollar. So thanks for pointing that out. I think the key is also, though, and very importantly, is with the targets that we've laid out for '17 and for 22 -- 2020, we can see now our path forward at current foreign exchange rates to having very strong sales momentum that we're achieving this year, that we anticipate maintaining that momentum in 2017. And quite frankly, that sets us up very well to maintaining that momentum all the way through 2020.

So just on the Hem/Onc franchise, we've talked about the mix for the franchise for probably about a year or so as being different than what we had expected back in 2013 when we gave these targets, largely driven by the dynamics for ABRAXANE in the marketplace post the era of the checkpoint inhibitors and a couple of other novel agents as well. So if you take the REVLIMID update of $8 billion compared to $7 billion before, that's the plus billion that you talked about, when you think about the operational performance, though, the lion's share of the foreign exchange would also hit REVLIMID, that $8 billion excluding foreign exchange, would be even higher, significantly higher. The other product that would come next in the ranking of those impacted by foreign exchange would be POMALYST/IMNOVID now that we're into the year where we have more international sales for that product. You will remember that the ABRAXANE target for 2017 that was given in 2013 was $1.5 billion to $2 billion.

The big picture question is, we get a lot of questions from investors trying to understand what kind of changes to the REVLIMID dynamics are going to happen as we approach the cliff, and you've got a lot of new combos and data that are coming out this year, I'm wondering if you thought about how you might articulate to investors how to think about, either qualitatively or quantitatively, what percentage of REVLIMID you might be able to offset with these new combos, because modeling that in the out years really makes a difference. And there's not a lot of color out there right now. Then the second question is the maintenance question for Scott. Any changes in prior auth requirements for OTEZLA that you've seen in the last 3 months?"

And any of my colleagues who want to add to it, please feel free. The main thing that we see as we continue to make progress on the top line is, we feel like we've got pretty clear visibility to how we will be able to bring more targeted novel agents to market to further address certain patient segments within multiple myeloma, be they high-risk patients, patients that are refractory to certain compounds. And we, I think, have a plan and a strategy that is as clear as it's ever been with the agents that we have in our hands today, and you saw that on one of the slides where we have quite a nice portfolio. And what we've learned about the mechanism of action of the IMiDs over time is also allowing us to potentially accelerate the next generation of compounds coming out of that platform in the [indiscernible] modifying agents to allow us to achieve that segmentation and then bringing more targeted therapies to the different patient segments. So when we think about REVLIMID as we approach that 2025, 2026 time frame, we see it probably not being replaced by one new novel agent, but by a basket of novel agents in combination therapies that are going to allow us to grow through that patent cliff. And I think that's probably as much as I need to say at this point in time. I would also maybe add that at some point, when we do another Research Day or Analyst/Investor Day, I think we'll be looking to give you a bit more visibility to how we're thinking about those things. Let me also maybe just summarize, before I'll turn it over to Scott, sorry for the long-winded answer, but with the negotiation on the patent litigation, I think from your perspective in modeling, now that you've got that 2026 goalpost in there, you can see how we get there over the next 10 years in terms of bringing these novel agents forward. And I think you'll see that our development programs are taking us in that direction. There are -- I'm sorry, I'm keeping -- going long with this, but there are some compounds that are also not in any of our forecasts yet, including durvalumab, for example, which is one that you've got a decent amount of visibility to already in terms of the clinical development program, and you'll see data over time. So with that, I'm going to stop."

And remember, we'll have to redo it every year. Some will be -- some will go continuously. But what you see overall is a little bit of a chilling or drop in Q1 in the overall psoriatic marketplace and you see it for a number of years in a row, that you see the increase is happening in Q2, Q3, Q4 and we see that in the market this year.

So the first thing on the sequential -- what you see each quarter, each first -- beginning of each year in the first quarter, I think this is actually not so much specific to Celgene even necessarily, it's an industry-wide phenomenon, which i",825,"Sure, Geoff. So the first thing on the sequential -- what you see each quarter, each first -- beginning of each year in the first quarter, I think this is actually not so much specific to Celgene even necessarily, it's an industry-wide phenomenon, which is with the ACA program, you do make payments, each of us have a certain tax we pay, as well as we have to make higher gross-to-net payments early in the year to fill the donut hole. So I think that's a dynamic where you see a lot of that coming through, and basically, it's a first quarter effect that kind of hits the gross-to-net. That's the main item. I mean, I don't think there's anything else beyond that, and I do think probably if you found products that came into the same reimbursement world with the government programs under ACA, you'd see that for most companies. I went through that, just to highlight, as you go from Q4 to Q1, it's just sort of an odd thing. If you are -- if you happen to be looking at sequential quarters, which, personally, I always like to look at year-over-year growth, obviously, but if you look at sequential quarters, these are just things to keep in the back of your mind, that the gross-to-net does kind of pick up some extra volume in the first quarter. We also, just to remind you, that in Q4, we actually did have a very favorable tender that helped our performance in the first quarter. It's not so much of a gross-to-net, but it's a good volume item, and I mentioned that as well. And then Jackie, in her comments, we did have one adjustment to our gross-to-net in France, that actually impacted the gross-to-net for POMALYST. So POMALYST, really, I think, is key to understand that there is a slight adjustment in the first quarter that's a one-timer, the catch-up. And -- so POMALYST, I think we need to retune that a little bit to make sure you get an accurate view of the momentum of POMALYST, which is just great, and doing very well around the world. On the second question, relative to our flexibility, I would just highlight a couple of things. First of all, as we went through the transaction with Receptos last year, we did increase our debt load. And obviously, we highlighted that, that took us up to a much higher debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the short term. And with a very strong cash flow performance of the company, that would be worked back down again, pretty quickly, actually. We've obviously covered that with the credit agencies very carefully with full understanding and agreement on that, which is great. The other thing I'd say is that, as we do our business development activity, we are able to use some of our foreign cash in a lot of these transactions because very often, we have rest of world rights. So we're actually buying IP, that for example, when we did the AstraZeneca deal, that was IP was already offshore. Or as you get other transactions, like GED-0301 and likewise, an offshore asset. So we are able to use that, and so as a result, our U.S. cash position relative to the Moody's ratings is not as stressed. We were also able to do that with Receptos, so we have a relatively good U.S. cash position, and we highlight that in the 10-Q. You'll see that in the 10-Q each quarter. We did it for the 10-K as well. And in fact, our U.S. cash position is actually relatively good, having gone through that transaction. So from that standpoint, we feel very good about our debt-to-EBITDA. We actually just recently met with all the agencies. I think everything is good. Now, your question was more prospectively, if a transaction came along, how would we look at it? Those are so situation-specific, if it was a large transaction, obviously, we're not trying to forecast that would be the case, but obviously, you might end up using some equity, or you might push yourself up again a little bit. But we obviously have got a very, very full arsenal right now between our internal pipeline as well as our collaboration portfolio. And so we really did use 2015 as a major year to step into immuno-oncology. Are we still hungry for BD deals? Absolutely. And you'll see us continuing to do transactions with different companies, often sitting in the profile of our collaboration portfolio, that from time to time, if the right opportunity came along, we would be happy to step up. And I think the point about the strong financial flexibility is that we have been very fortunate to have a very strong cash flow in this company. We work very closely with the credit agencies on a regular basis, and we feel very comfortable about where we are, and where we're going."

It matches very nicely with unmet medical need. And that phase of trial is powered for both PFS and OS. What we would expect to see, I think we've even told you, and you can see out there in clinicaltrials.gov that the expected PFS difference will be about 15 months versus the control. And we would expect or hope to see a positive, statistically significant result on PFS, and a trend on OS. We do not necessarily expect at this time to see a statistically significant trend. But we think that with the trend in OS and a positive PFS trial, that we've got a nice regulatory submission."

We have the overarching economics and benefits of developed societies that are going to keep pressure on health care economics for several decades. So I think the most significant issue that we all face is how do we afford the health care that we want to have and make the investments in the future that we want? I think that we're very concerned by the level of noise in the environment. It's very concerning, and it's real. You also have to put in perspective that every 8 years we have a presidential election, when it's definitely going to turn over, you see this happening, whether you look at 1992 or 2008 and what happens. And so it is an important time for us to address these issues. But first, we're going to be faced with these issues of cost and value for a long time regardless of the politics of it. I think the politics are important to us. I think we need to make sure we understand that the kind of changes that anybody would propose to really affect our outcomes are going to be very significant, are unlikely to occur. So we think the issues that are going to have to be dealt with through the normal operations of our businesses and the systems in our ecosystem, whether it's payers and providers. And we've got to work to do a better job to define what value is, and I think you'll see people on one side of the system try and decide this is the way we'll define value, and others are going to other methods. I think there are many collaborative efforts going on today between companies on our side and also versus payers working together to find solutions to these issues to ensure that we do constrain costs, but not at the reduction of these kind of investments that we need to deal with the incredible issues that we as a society face in Alzheimer's, cancer, metabolic disease, et cetera. So we're very concerned about it. We've got a -- before the end of this presidential debate, we've got to change the tenor so that there's a balance in the discussion. We've got important initiatives coming on from the industry about that in the coming weeks and months. But I think we ought to recognize this is a long-term issue that we're going to be dealing with, based on the longer term health care economics of the entire system. And we've got to be prepared for that discussion."

Relative to OTEZLA and the confidence we have in the targets and goals for '16 and '17 are the idea that the TRxs continue to grow, we're at the highest levels ever as of last week. We're seeing patient initiations at the highest levels possible. We're continuing to gain market share. There's a lot of momentum on demand. And we're seeing very good persistency of patients on the drug. There was a paper just published last week showing very similar persistency OTEZLA versus biologic cohort, which is very encouraging. And then we've got a number of countries that are going to be launching as we go through '16 into early '17. We are still at this point in reimbursement discussions and not launched yet in the U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy. So those are upside and growth drivers for '16, '17 and beyond. And Japan, we believe, is going to be a strong growth driver as well. And we filed in Japan. We had a very strong pivotal trial with PSOR-011, we filed in Japan. We expect an approval towards the end of this year, and be launching and with reimbursement early in 2017. We think there's a tremendous opportunity. For the compound in Japan, they're very oral-oriented and very safety-oriented. And we think the product fits very, very well, and so we've got nice growth opportunity in Japan. The second part of the question was Cosentyx. What we've seen since the launch of Cosentyx, and if you look at the slides, you can see the market share graph. Both from a new to brand patient initiation perspective and from a market share perspective and a TRx perspective, we've seen OTEZLA continue to grow at a similar rate before versus after the launch of Cosentyx. We believe that they are products which are competing in quite different parts of the market, Cosentyx mainly from the TNF failure portion. And if you remember, some of the data that we presented on OTEZLA, 80% of patients who are going -- coming to OTEZLA are coming from something other than a biologic therapy, whether that's [indiscernible] or topicals or oral DMARD. So I think they're products that are -- are in very different parts of the market and looking at different patients."

I would say, the dynamic is actually quite good in terms of the overall relapsed/refractory market. And we think as the combination data continues to emerge, it is going to be quite positive for POMALYST on a go-forward basis. The other thing, as I mentioned in my comments, is we're seeing nice increases in duration of treatment for POMALYST, and we're seeing them quarter-after-quarter. When we think on -- we're still seeing double-digit growth in both new Rxs and almost double the new Rx level of growth in total Rxs for POM in the U.S., so it's quite positive. When you think about the environment outside the U.S., the one thing I would say is, keep your eyes on reimbursement discussions as novel agents come to market, and keep in mind that POMALYST has an overall survival benefit in its label and that's quite important when you think about reimbursement positioning."

So the market has been aggressive on price. We've been a little bit less aggressive than the market over the past couple of years. We want to maintain that position at a discount to biologic price, because we think not only in the U.S. but around the world, it gives us the best opportunity to penetrate and to be used early and the encouragement for patients to be used in the pre-biologic space. So we're going to continue with that pricing strategy."

But then always, there's this other category, where there's a lot of other things that come in. It tends to be a little bit noisy, you have some impairments, some gains on our equity holdings and so forth and that nets out to be, this quarter, to be a little bit positive, but quite frankly, some of the gains were discrete items that pushed our tax rate up a little bit. So overall, in the financial section, I'd say, really not much benefit there. And then the overall, the net positives, probably we had a couple of positive items on our hedging relative to the recognition of positive impacts from the forward points as we roll forward. You may recall last fall, we had a couple of quarters where we had some negative impact. This is just a volatile item that bounces back and forth. So net-net, though, I think we -- I would retain my comment that the interest expense, interest income, net-net, should be in that high $400 million range on a full year basis. In any given quarter, the other category can be positive or negative. And I wouldn't go one way or the other with that. I would remind you that sometimes when there is a positive, it is offset by a higher discrete item in the tax line. 
So just to wrap things up, and if I can, just finish things up for the company, we're really thrilled with the first quarter. We feel like we have come into the year with great momentum and it has allowed us to increase our guidance, top line and bottom line. We have allowed that momentum to help us think through exactly where we're going with our financial targets out in the outer years through '17 and 2020. We feel really good about that. I think as Jackie and Scott and Mark all talked about, we have got a lot of exciting activity going on in the pipeline, and a lot of late-stage report-outs coming in the near term. So I think as we go through the balance of 2016 and into 2017, we have a lot of very positive stimulus items reporting out.

We appreciate the opportunity to review our second quarter operating performance and the progress we have made advancing major corporate objectives with you. Guided by our strategy to imperatives, our global teams are driving outstanding results and achieving key financial regulatory, clinical and commercial milestones that Peter, Michael Scott and Jackie will discuss with you today. 
Against virtually every metric, our second quarter was outstanding. This momentum combined with the leverage of our business model continues to generate, improves our full year outlook such that today we're raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.70 to $5.75 from our earlier target of $5.60 to $5.70 and our guiding to the high end of our current net product sales range of $10.75 billion to $11 billion. Peter will provide much more detail about our second quarter financial performance and improving outlook in a few minutes. 
Our management team is committed to delivering exceptional results each quarter, while we continue to invest in and advance opportunities expected to maximize the potential of our commercial franchises and build strong and diverse platforms for long-term value creation. We believe this balance was well represented in the quarter. For example, EHA, new clinical data were presented that cemented REVLIMID's position as a standard of care for myeloma patients. 
In just the past year, 5 novel agents have generated significantly better clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma when combined with REVLIMID. These new data and real-world patient outcomes are adding to the momentum of our global myeloma franchise. 
As you'll hear from Scott, our investments in the commercialization of OTEZLA continue to drive the leadership positions in the U.S. psoriasis and arthritis markets. And its global expansion is accelerating as we complete launch preparations in major European markets and Japan. 
Recognizing the inherent challenges associated with clinical development, we continue to advance high potential pipeline programs to diversify our opportunities. Earlier this week, we announced that based on the interim overall survival analysis of the REMARC study testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We currently do not plan to seek approval for this indication. However, given the optionality and diversity of our late stage programs, we remain confident in our mid-and long-term growth potential and profile. One of these programs is a GED-0301 were later this  quarter, we expect to have CD-001 12-week endoscopic data. Scott will discuss our progress developing GED-0301 and our I&I pipeline later during the call. 
Through our internal research capabilities and with our  exceptional partners, we have created a continued to add new file our platforms expected to improve our opportunities for longer-term growth. Since the beginning of year, we have filed four Investigational new drug applications for Celgene developed products, entered into a number of important collaborations and advanced key clinical programs with our partners. Last week, we announced the new collaboration with John's Therapeutics, adding to our differentiated opportunities to identify and develop novel immuno-oncology therapies. 
Our work with John's is expect to meaningfully add to progress we're making with our immuno-oncology partners Juno and AstraZeneca and our expanded relationship with will investigate potential therapies, based on immune cell metabolic pathways that are expected to have applications for the treatment of cancers as well as inflammatory disorders. These examples highlight just some of the progress we're making with our efforts to discover and advance tomorrows transformational therapies and create better future for patients in need. 
We look forward to updating you on the progress of our research and key late stage programs throughout the second half of the year. Despite continued global economic and political uncertainties, our business momentum has never been stronger. We continue to invest in late stage clinical trials to optimize the value proposition of our existing portfolio and made an late stage pipeline and promising alliances to our internal research efforts. These are very exciting times at Celgene. Thank you very much and please help me welcome Peter to our call."

In Q2, we continue to build on momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio. Our strong top line growth is driven by volume with careful -- with exceptional performance from our core products. Our bottom line is driven by careful immuno management, while we continue to invest in our innovative R&D portfolio. Our performance this year has led us to raise our adjusted diluted EPS range, as Mark said, $5.70 to $5.75. To guide net product sales to approximate $11 million and REVLIMID sales to approximately $6.8 billion for 2016. 
Turning to our second quarter top line results. We continue to see impressive industry-leading growth. Our year-over-year growth of our net product sales was 22%. Now Michael and Scott will discuss the underlying demand for this performance later in the call. The driver of our topline growth continues to be volume. Volume accounted for 16 of the total 21.8 percentage points. Our bottom line growth continues to be strong and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.44 per share. 
Our year-over-year 17% growth was achieved despite higher R&D expenses, related to numerous late stage programs, our acquisitions of Receptos that closed in the second half of 2015 and the decision to opt in on several collaboration programs over the past several year. 
Turning to our P&L. We continue to have exceptional performance. The adjusted operating margin improved 330 basis points year-over-year to 54.6% for the quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, we was a 16 basis points improvement. We continue to see excellent leverage in SG&A, which from margin perspective, offsets our R&D investment. Operating income drove $0.35 per share of the $0.21 per share bottom line growth. Financial levers have a total negative $0.14 impact, which includes the additional interest expense from last year's bond offering. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and marketable Securities. 
For the first half of 2016, we purchased nearly $1.8 billion of our outstanding shares. And in June, an additional $3 billion for share repurchases was authorized, leaving us with a total authorization level of approximately $5.1 billion. 
Based on our exceptional first-half performance and strong momentum, we are updating our 2016 guidance for REVLIMID net product sales, total net product sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Now our prior guidance for POMALYST ABRAXANE and OTEZLA net product sales will remain unchanged. 
As mentioned earlier, we are guiding to full year REVLIMID net product sales of $6.8 billion from the prior guidance of $6.7 billion. And this is due to the strong uptick seen year-to-date. Our continued management of the SG&A line allows us to raise our adjusted operating margin guidance for the year by 50 basis points to approximately 54%. We now expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.75. We're also updating our diluted share count from $811 million to $806 million, due to our first half share repurchases. 
Our first half performance has been superb. And we anticipate continued great commercial momentum. Looking ahead, we are also excited for the next phase of drivers to extend our future growth.

Before we start, let me take the opportunity to thank our Hematology and Oncology team across the globe for the great work in delivering truly outstanding second quarter. We have made significant progress in further maximizing the opportunity of our existing assets and then advancing our development programs in pipeline across assets and diseases. Our Q2 financial results are extremely strong with 16% year-over-year revenue growth and 9% sequential growth. The REVLIMID launch was highly successful across all geographies. We expanded reimbursements across key markets and so positive uptick duration trends in the markets where we have reimbursement. POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow globally with strong market share and duration rhythm. 
ABRAXANE had a positive quarter around the globe despite the uptake of novel agents in breast and lung cancer. We are maintaining our U.S. leadership position in pancreatic cancer and our pancreatic market share is growing in reimburse markets outside of the U.S. There was a very positive data our key in-line brand. Impressive clinical results of REVLIMID in NDMM maintenance in combination with refractory myeloma as well as ABRAXANE combination data with checkpoint inhibitors have been presented that the ASCO and EHA meeting in June. 
Our pipline is advancing substantially including our 82:1 pivotal studies We're very pleased with the progress of our programs. We have opened additional trials of diffusion program for the myeloma malignancies and made progress with our partnerships with Juno and 
Finally, our next generation moving forward in the clinic. REVLIMID delivered outstanding results in Q2 with 18% year-over-year and 8% sequential revenue growth. All key performance metrics are strong globally and the majority of the growth is coming from volume. The U.S. in demand launch continues to produce significant change. U.S. year-over-year growth quarter was 16% and growth was 17%. We have made steady progress with reimbursement in Europe and expect to have reimbursements in additional markets such as Italy by the end of 2016. And the share continues to grow in the reimbursement markets in Europe well as in Japan and is in line with our expectation. 
As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, the momentum for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma is extremely strong. Supported by multiple drivers, such as the ongoing NDMM launch with growing evidence for continued treatment and multiple results and approvals in the U.S. and in Europe. Additional momentum in myeloma beyond 2016 will be generated through our ongoing and planned maintenance submissions in Europe and U.S. as well as the recent publication of relapse refractory myeloma with an estimated progression-free survival of well over 40 months. 
As we look forward for REVLIMID beyond myeloma, lymphoma will be of major growth driver by 2020 and beyond. As Mark mentioned, earlier this week we provided an update on the REMARC trial evaluating REVLIMID with maintenance in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma responding to first line therapy. We're working closely with our partner LIFO to analyze the data and look forward to presenting the results of the major Hematology Conference later this year. 
The REMARC study is part of broad REVLIMID program focused on multiple NHL histology and patient segments. While REMARC evaluated a unique clinical strategy of using REVLIMID as maintenance monotherapy large B cell lymphoma, the other four Phase III studies are testing the combination of REVLIMID with Rituximab or Rituximab based combination therapies in follicular lymphoma and patient's with We feel that the evidence created through multiple Phase II studies in those settings is very robust, supporting strong value proposition unique mechanism of action and good likelihood of success for the RELEVANCE, ROBUST and AUGMENT run. Results from the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trails are expected next year. 
Our 2020 REVLIMID's financial targets includes between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in sales for lymphoma. We designed this range to be independent of the success of any 1 of the 5 Phase III trials. 
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered a strong 35% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter net sales growth. We have leading market shares in U.S., launch markets in Europe and Japan continues to see share gains while duration is increasing globally. Despite a growing number of relapse refractory myeloma treatment options, we see a stable third line share and an increasing second line share for POMALYST, which is driven by earlier usage directly off the REVLIMID and in combination with traditional and new agents, further enhancing value proposition and clinical benefit. 
We recently received FDA approval for POMALYST label update with patients with renal impairment, which will allow us to better educate on the use of POMALYST in this patient population. We have received a positive CHMP opinion for a similar label update for IMNOVID in Europe.
Our development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID in multiple combinations continue to advance. This includes our Phase III MMO-7 trial in combination with second or later treatment line as well as ongoing Phase I/II combination studies with and 
ABRAXANE had a solid performance in the second quarter with 2% year-over-year net sales growth and 11% sequential growth. In the U.S., ABRAXANE maintained its leadership share position in metastatic pancreatic cancer and continued to stabilize in breast and lung cancer, despite competition from other regions. ABRAXANE net sales outside U.S. grew 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, despite some slight headwinds from price and distributor buying patterns. It's important to note, that many recently reimbursed markets have not yet reached peak shares in pancreatic cancer. 
I'd also like to remind you of the long-term opportunity for ABRAXANE. Data for ABRAXANE in combination with in triple-negative breast cancer were represented at ASCO adding to the highly encouraging clinical evidence for I/O ABRAXANE combination reported a couple of months ago for non-small cell lung cancer. I/O ABRAXANE Phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer are set to read out 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
In addition to the development programs that I have described for in-line brands, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making and advancing our broader and deep earlier and later stage pipeline. Let me focus on couple of key programs and assets. The enrollment of the Phase II expansion study in replaced refractory AML is completed and the Phase III study in relapsed refractory AML is on track. Our collaboration with are is rapidly moving forward and our respective Phase III trials in patients with lower risk MDS and beta-thalassemia continue to enroll well. I'm particularly excited about the progress we've made with our I/O pipeline to program is now enrolling 6 trials in multiple hematological logical malignancies in combination with many Celgene acids including POMALYST in relpased refractory myeloma, REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma in relapsed refractory myeloma, multiple assets in NHL or CLL with in AML and with in high-risk MDA. 
In April, we opted into the program with Juno and made good progress with our for Europe. In the first quarter of this year program. This program continues to advance and in conjunction with and our next generation will be an important corner store in our way to secure multiple myeloma. 
Finally, I'd like to highlight the progress we've made substantial advancing to our understanding of protein homeostasis over the past few years, which is put us in a position to investigate multiple new and potentially more effective next generation in targeted higher risk patient segments. We have our CC-122 program enrolling into multiple proof of concept studies in several indications, both of monotherapy and in combination with new agents. And we have other candidates coming that we will tell you more about as we make progress. 
To summarize, we had a great second quarter for the hematology and oncology franchise on all fronts. As Peter mentioned, our strong momentum has given us the confidence to raise our REVLIMID revenue guidance to approximate $6.8 billion. The strength of the entire portfolio makes us believe that we will hit the high end of our revenue range for 2016. Our clinical programs are advancing nicely. The RELEVANCE and AUGMENT follicular lymphoma trials with read up in 2017. The POMALYST/IMNOVID study will provide results in 2018 and we have ABRAXANE opportunity in pancreatic cancer and with I/O combination that will be reading out in 2017 and 2018. 
Finally, our earlier pipeline is moving forward substantially, especially in I/O and protein homeostasis. We have a lot of confidence in accelerating momentum in our near term and long term opportunity and are on track to deliver 2020 targets for our franchise. 
Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In Q2 be solid revenue growth accelerate throughout the quarter in both the U.S. and EU. Leading indicators of demand remains strong in the U.S. and throughout Q2. In Q2, we received the top line results for our atopic dermatitis Phase II proof of concept study and are evaluating Nextest. We also advanced development pipeline by taking important steps forward in the GED-0301 and Ozanimod programs as well as the other early-to-mid stage clinical stage programs. Global OTEZLA net sales for Q2 2016 were $242 million. This represents a 170% year-on-year increase and a 24% quarter-on-quarter increase. The majority of revenues continue to be derived from the U.S., but we're seeing strong metrics in the launch countries in the Europe. We're pleased with the merging access footprint for OTEZLA globally. We have now achieved favorable reimbursement decisions in 14 countries in Europe and expect to conclude discussions in most of the remaining countries in Q3. 
This progress in Europe together with an expected approval in Japan by the end of this year should represent a significant source of revenue growth for OTEZLA in 2017 and beyond. Now looking specifically at the U.S., position campaigns and fresh consumer campaign are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests is on OTEZLA equivalent to biologic therapy at 1-year. OTEZLA also continues to lead all of the branded therapies and new share. The PSA and psoriasis markets have grown significantly over the past few years, driven in part by new launches of products with novel If we look specifically at these more recent launches, we can clearly see from the ground that OTEZLA has not really been a leader and growing the market, but has also captured a strong and growing TRX leadership position. 
We are aggressively advancing Ozanimod development program. As discussed previously, the MS pivotal trials are full enrolled and the ulcerative colitis pivotal Phase III TRUE NORTH is enrolling patients worldwide. During Q2, we saw significant data readouts for Ozanimod, including presentation of Phase II TOUCHSTONE histologic data at the DVW meeting in May, and importantly, the publication of the full TOUCHSTONE II Phase II data in New England Journal of Medicine. 
In Q2, we also completed enrollment in CD-OO1, the endoscopic trial for GED-0301. We expect to get initial topline data for the 12-week portion of this study in Q3. We intend to make this data available in these data available in the second half of 2016 at a major medical meeting. As a reminder, the objective of the 12-week portion of the study is to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic improvement at an early time point. This trial targeted to enroll the patient population with advanced or serious disease, confirmed by both and endoscopy This is a multinational study with approximately 80% of patients in the world coming from North America. 
The large Phase III pivotal trials CD-002 continues to enroll and we have over 150 sites around the world now active. Additionally, the Phase II proof of concept trial of GED-0301, if you see, is now fully enrolled.
Q2 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene and I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch is put us in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through important milestones. These programs we major contributors and driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic with the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolios we move into the second of 2016.

We're well-positioned to finish the year strong and move into 2017 with great momentum. This is the case for our commercial, operational and financial performance as well as our clinical, regulatory and research performance. Looking at third 2016 milestones we laid out at the beginning of this year, we see that we are outperforming on our financial targets, as reflected in our updated guidance today. Our commercial and operational positions have never been better and set us up extremely well to delivered on our ambitious growth objectives from now to 2020. Our franchise teams are driving strong positive commercial trends across our key products and major geographies and our global operational teams are delivering exceptional performance in helping to drive our operating profit growth. 
REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID and ABRAXANE have already obtained blockbuster drug status under OTEZLA is on its way to hitting the $1 billion annual revenue milestone this year, thus becoming the fourth blockbuster in our portfolio. All 4 of these drugs have bright future growth prospects and unique profiles in their therapeutic areas. The growth potential across our existing product portfolio from ongoing geographic expansion remains ahead of us and is only one of the factors driving our growth, as it continues to block alongside enhanced value proposition an ongoing label expansion for marketed product, as well as new product approvals to fuel our expected 18% revenue constant annual growth rate from 2016 to 2020. 
Our regulatory teams are delivering on key submissions globally and some new approvals of already been achieved. Our clinical teams are advancing our pipeline projects with milestones hit across a succession of trial in decisions, enrollment achievements and data readouts. Our research and early development teams and producing new drug candidates for IND submissions and making progress on the early stage trials that allow us to advance compounds into later stage development. 
Building on the success achieved today, we enter an exciting multiyear period when we will see numerous Phase III trial readouts. By year end, we expect new date in major medical meetings for some of our 2016 trial readouts. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate readouts for him hematology oncology for REVLIMID in follicular lymphoma and for ABRAXANE in both non-small cell clung cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer, as Michael mentioned. Turning to I&I, we expect to see the OTEZLA and two trials for Ozanimod in multiple sclerosis break. And there is more in 2018 win for hematology/oncology we will have data for ABRAXANE in triple-negative breast cancer and POMALYST in second line multiple myeloma. 
For I&I, 2018 will bring read outs in the IBD space, 2 in and 1 for Ozanimod and ulcerative colitis. These are all major trials and potential major catalysts. This portfolio of trials gives us several high qualities shot on goal for products and indications that can significantly, contribute to our future revenue growth and diversification. To conclude, I would also point out that in addition to port is shown on the slide, we have even more information flowed during the remainder of this year. As Scott mentioned, we expect to share 12-week data from the GED-0301 endoscopy trial in the second half of the year. As we deliver on our milestones, we will see a number of Phase II trial readouts from now to the end of the year. We also look forward to important data presentations at made major medical meetings including UEGW in October, ASH in December, and San Antonio Breast in December, and we will kick off new R&D Deep Dive series with an investor analyst event in September. Our first topic will be protein homeostasis and where we think the science can take our new product development programs in that area. Our teams have put us in a fabulous place so far this year and we have even more to come before year end and great things ahead in 2017, 2018, and beyond.

It's likely that we have a very good momentum for across the globe and it is coming from a couple of sectors starting with the fact that there is a need for product that is oral and effective and well tolerated in the patient population that is the first point.  Which I think leads to kind of some prescriber preference for using such an oral very effective in the patient population as compared to an IV drug. But I think that's only part of the story. What we are seeing with that it's moving up. It's moving in third line and it is moving up even in second line directly off the REVLIMID and we start to see a lot of use which is a very positive effect on the clinical benefit that we see on the outcomes of patients, but most importantly, also on the treatment duration. So we actually don't see the situation that is building with CB-38 and competitive we actually see it as complementary.

I think you're referring to the studies that we're doing lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in combination with Rituximab. The studies are actually set up in a way that they are comparing with the current standard of care. So in case of induction of B-cell and lymphoma that are standard of care for induction for quite a while and the study has been really set up in order provide a huge improvement of outcome. What's also probably important to note that in study B-cell lymphoma there's a limited treatment duration. So we're expecting a very market outcomes improvement, while at the same time, there is a limited duration of treatment. The situation in follicular lymphoma is building from observation and the fact that standard of care at this moment of time is mostly chemotherapy with or without Rituximab or Rituximab alone. We have elderly frail patient population follicular lymphoma that is absolutely not tolerating chemotherapy well, whether it is based So there's a truly need for improvement of treatment of this patient population. Again, we feel the studies which are have been set up in a way that they represent a true improvement of standard of care and outcomes of the patient.

So that we can confirm that there are actually mucosal involvement at baseline. The prior studies didn't do that in some of the patients, didn't have went into the study maybe didn't have Crohn's disease and that was one of the development challenges in Crohn's disease, way to get confirmed active disease is baseline, so this is a little bit different it is more rigorous from that perspective making sure. that there's mucosal involvement and mucosal damage.

There's a couple of recent review articles looking at all the data that are out there sort of provide picture out to. The only correlation that has sort of a rhythm that I'm aware reason I'm aware off you can see is, if you get control from assigned some of those perspective early and you start to see some improvements in the mucosal. It generally leads to positive effect when you get out to week 52. So that's basically we're looking for new Crohn's treatment.

I'd like to begin by welcoming Michael Pehl to our call in his role as President of our Global Hematology & Oncology franchise. Michael brings over 25 years of industry experience to his leadership position and joined Celgene in 2006 as the first General Manager of our German affiliate. Michael has made significant contributions to our company in roles of increasing responsibility, including Head of our Hematology business in Europe and Head of our Global Hematology and Oncology Marketing Group. Welcome, Michael. 
We appreciate the opportunity to review our second quarter operating performance and the progress we have made advancing major corporate objectives with you. Guided by our strategic imperatives, our global teams are driving outstanding results and achieving key financial regulatory, clinical and commercial milestones that Peter, Michael, Scott and Jackie will discuss with you today. 
Against virtually every metric, our second quarter was outstanding. This momentum combined with the leverage of our business model continues to generate, improves our full year outlook such that today we're raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.70 to $5.75 from our earlier target of $5.60 to $5.70, and our guiding to the high end of our current net product sales range of $10.75 billion to $11 billion. Peter will provide much more detail about our second quarter financial performance and improving outlook in a few minutes. 
Our management team is committed to delivering exceptional results each quarter, while we continue to invest in and advanced opportunities expected to maximize the potential of our commercial franchises and build strong and diverse platforms for long-term value creation. We believe this balance was well represented in the quarter. For example, EHA, new clinical data were presented that cemented REVLIMID's position as a standard of care for myeloma patients. 
In just the past year, 5 novel agents have generated significantly better clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma when combined with REVLIMID. These new data and real-world patient outcomes are adding to the momentum of our global myeloma franchise. 
As you'll hear from Scott, our investments in the commercialization of OTEZLA continue to drive to leadership position in the U.S. psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets. And its global expansion is accelerating as we complete launch preparations in major European markets and Japan. 
Recognizing the inherent challenges associated with clinical development, we continue to advance high potential pipeline programs to diversify our opportunities. Earlier this week, we announced that based on the interim overall survival analysis of the REMARC study testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we currently do not plan to seek approval for this indication. However, given the optionality and diversity of our late-stage programs, we remain confident in our mid- and long-term growth potential and profile. One of these programs is GED-0301. Later this quarter, we expect to have the CD-001 12-week endoscopic data. Scott will discuss our progress developing GED-0301 and our I&I pipeline later during our call. 
Through our internal research capabilities and with our exceptional partners, we have created and continued to add new platforms expected to improve our opportunities for longer-term growth. Since the beginning of the year, we have filed 4 Investigational new drug applications for Celgene developed products, entered into a number of important collaborations and advanced key clinical programs with our partners. Last week, we announced a new collaboration with Johns Therapeutics, adding to our differentiated opportunities to identify and develop novel immuno-oncology therapies. 
Our work with Johns is expected to meaningfully add to the progress we're making with our immuno-oncology partners: Juno, bluebird bio, Lycera and AstraZeneca. And our expanded relationship with Agios will investigate potential new therapies based on immune cell metabolic pathways that are expected to have applications for the treatment of cancers as well as inflammatory disorders. These examples highlight just some of the progress we're making with our efforts to discover and advance tomorrows transformational therapies and create a better future for patients in need. 
We look forward to updating you on the progress of our research and key late-stage programs throughout the second half of the year. Despite continued global economic and political uncertainties, our business momentum has never been stronger. We continue to invest in late-stage clinical trials to optimize the value proposition of our existing portfolio, advance our mid- and late-stage pipeline and add promising alliances to our internal research efforts. These are very exciting times at Celgene. Thank you very much, and please help me welcome Peter to our call."
258769,370552247,1015924,"Celgene Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Celgene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, we continue to build on the momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio. Our strong top line growth is driven by volume with careful -- with exceptional performance from our core pro",545,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, we continue to build on the momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio. Our strong top line growth is driven by volume with careful -- with exceptional performance from our core products. Our bottom line is driven by careful P&L management, while we continue to invest in our innovative R&D portfolio. Our performance this year has led us to raise our adjusted diluted EPS range, as Mark said, $5.70 to $5.75. To guide net product sales to approximate $11 billion and REVLIMID sales to approximately $6.8 billion for 2016. 
Turning to our second quarter top line results. We continue to see impressive industry-leading growth. Our year-over-year growth for net product sales was 22%. Now Michael and Scott will discuss the underlying demand for this performance later in the call. The driver of our top line growth continues to be volume. Volume accounted for 16 of the total 21.8 percentage points. Our bottom line growth continues to be strong and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.44 per share. 
Our year-over-year 17% growth was achieved despite higher R&D expenses, related to our numerous late-stage programs, our acquisitions of Receptos and Quanticel that closed in the second half of 2015 and the decision to opt in on several collaboration programs over the past year. 
Turning to our P&L. We continue to have exceptional performance. The adjusted operating margin improved 330 basis points year-over-year to 54.6% for the quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw a 60 basis point improvement. We continue to see excellent leverage in SG&A, which from a margin perspective, offsets our R&D investment. Operating income drove $0.35 per share of the $0.21 per share bottom line growth. Financial levers have a total negative $0.14 impact, which includes the additional interest expense from last year's bond offering. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
For the first half of 2016, we purchased nearly $1.8 billion of our outstanding shares. And in June, an additional $3 billion for share repurchases was authorized, leaving us with a total authorization level of approximately $5.1 billion. 
Based on our exceptional first half performance and strong momentum, we are updating our 2016 guidance for REVLIMID net product sales, total net product sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Now our prior guidance for POMALYST ABRAXANE and OTEZLA net product sales will remain unchanged. 
As mentioned earlier, we are guiding to full year REVLIMID net product sales of $6.8 billion from the prior guidance of $6.7 billion. And this is due to the strong uptick seen year-to-date. Our continued management of the SG&A line allows us to raise our adjusted operating margin guidance for the year by 50 basis points to approximately 54%. We now expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.75. We're also updating our diluted share count from $811 million to $806 million due to our first half share repurchases. 
Our first half performance has been superb. And we anticipate continued great commercial momentum. Looking ahead, we are also excited for the next phase of drivers to extend our future growth. 
Thank you. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael."

Before we start, let me take the opportunity to thank our Hematology & Oncology teams across the globe for the great work in delivering a truly outstanding second quarter. We have made significant progress in further maximizing the opportunity of our existing assets and then advancing our development programs in pipeline across assets and diseases. Our Q2 financial results are extremely strong with 16% year-over-year revenue growth and 9% sequential growth. The REVLIMID NDMM launch is highly successful across all geographies. We expanded reimbursements across key markets and so positive uptick in duration trends in the markets where we have reimbursement. POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow globally with strong market share and duration rhythm. 
ABRAXANE had a positive quarter around the globe despite the uptake of novel agents in breast and lung cancer. We are maintaining our U.S. leadership position in pancreatic cancer and our pancreatic market share is growing in reimburse markets outside of the U.S. There was a very positive flow of data supporting our key in-line brands. Impressive clinical results of REVLIMID NDMM maintenance in combination with daratumumab in refractory myeloma as well as ABRAXANE combination data with checkpoint inhibitors have been presented at the ASCO and EHA meeting in June. 
Our pipeline is advancing substantially including our AG-221 and luspatercept pivotal studies We're very pleased with the progress of our I/O programs. We have opened additional trials of the FUSION program for durvalumab in hematologic malignancies and made progress with our CAR-T partnerships with Juno and bluebird bio. 
Finally, our next-generation CELMoDs are moving forward in the clinic. REVLIMID delivered outstanding results in Q2 with 18% year-over-year and 8% sequential revenue growth. All key performance metrics are strong globally and the majority of the growth is coming from volume. U.S. NDMM launch continues to produce significant share and duration gains. U.S. year-over-year growth in TRx for the quarter was 16% and NRx growth was 17%. We have made steady progress with reimbursement in Europe and expect to have reimbursement in additional markets, such as Italy, by the end of 2016. NDMM share continues to grow in reimburse markets in Europe well as in Japan and is in line with our expectation. 
As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, the momentum for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma is extremely strong. Supported by multiple drivers, such as the ongoing NDMM launch, the growing evidence for continuous treatment and multiple triplet readouts and approvals in U.S. and in Europe. Additional momentum in myeloma beyond 2016 will be generated through our ongoing and planned ASCT maintenance submissions in Europe and U.S. as well as the recent publication of Rd+ daratumumab data in relapsed/refractory myeloma with an estimated progression-free survival of well over 40 months. 
As we look forward for REVLIMID beyond myeloma, lymphoma will be a major growth driver by 2020 and beyond. As Mark mentioned, earlier this week, we provided an update on the REMARC trial evaluating REVLIMID as maintenance therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma responding to first-line arch of therapy. We're working closely with our partner Lycera to analyze the data and look forward to presenting the results at a major hematology conference later this year. 
The REMARC study is part of a broad REVLIMID program focused on multiple NHL histology, hence patient segments. While REMARC evaluated a unique clinical strategy of using REVLIMID as maintenance monotherapy in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the other 4 Phase III studies are testing the combination of REVLIMID with Rituximab or Rituximab-based combination therapies in follicular lymphoma and first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with the ABC subtyes. We feel that the evidence created through multiple Phase II studies in those settings is very robust, supporting strong value proposition, unique mechanisms of action and a good likelihood of success for the RELEVANCE, ROBUST and AUGMENT run. Results from the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trails are expected next year. 
Our 2020 REVLIMID's financial target includes between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in sales for lymphoma. We designed this range to be independent of the success of any 1 of the 5 Phase III trial. 
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered a strong 35% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter net sales growth. We have leading market shares in U.S. Launch markets in Europe and Japan continues to see share gains, while duration is increasing globally. Despite a growing number of relapsed/refractory myeloma treatment options, we see a stable third-line share and an increasing second-line share for POMALYST, which is driven by earlier usage directly of the REVLIMID and in combination with traditional and new agents, further enhancing value proposition and clinical benefit. 
We recently received FDA approval for POMALYST label update in patients with renal impairment, which will allow us to better educate on the usage of POMALYST in this patient population. We have received a positive CHMP opinion for a similar label update for IMNOVID in Europe.
Our development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID in multiple combinations continue to advance. This includes our Phase III MM-007 trial in combination with [indiscernible] in second or later treatment line as well as ongoing Phase I/II combination studies with daratumumab and durvalumab. 
ABRAXANE had a solid performance in the second quarter with 2% year-over-year net sales growth and 11% sequential growth. In the U.S., ABRAXANE maintained its leadership share position in metastatic pancreatic cancer and continued to stabilize in breast and lung cancer, despite competition from other agents. ABRAXANE net sales outside of U.S. grew 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and despite some slight headwinds from price and distributor buying patterns. It's important to note that many recently reimburse markets have not yet reached peak shares in pancreatic cancer. 
I'd also like to remind you of the long-term opportunities for ABRAXANE. Data for ABRAXANE in combination with eccentric and triple-negative breast cancer were represented at ASCO adding to the highly encouraging clinical evidence for I/O ABRAXANE combination reported a couple of months ago for non-small cell lung cancer. I/O ABRAXANE Phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer are set to read out in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
In addition to the development programs that I have described for our in-line brands, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in advancing our broader deep earlier and late-stage pipeline. Let me focus on a couple of key programs and assets. The enrollment of the Phase II expansion study of AG-221 in relapsed/refractory AML is completed and the Phase III study in relapsed/refractory AML is on track. Our luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron is rapidly moving forward and our respective Phase III trials in patients with lower risk MDS and beta-thalassemia continue to enroll well. I'm particularly excited about the progress we've made with our I/O pipeline. The durvalumab fusion program is now enrolling 6 trials in multiple hematological malignancies in combination with many Celgene assets, including POMALYST in relpased refractory myeloma, REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, daratumumab in relapsed refractory myeloma, multiple assets in NHL or CLL with VIDAZA [ph] and high-risk MDS and AML and with [indiscernible] high-risk MDS. 
In April, we opted into the CD19 CAR-T program with Juno and made good progress with our respective development programs for Europe. In the first quarter of this year, we opted in for bluebird bio's BCMA program. This program continues to advance and in conjunction with durvalumab and our next-generation CELMoDs will be an important corner store on our way to secure for multiple myeloma. 
Finally, I'd like to highlight the progress we've made at substantially advancing our understanding of protein homeostasis over the past few years, which has put us in a position to investigate multiple new and potentially more effective next-generation CELMoDs in targeted, higher-risk patient segments. We have our CC-122 program enrolling into multiple proof of concept studies in several indications, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. And we have other candidates coming that we will tell you more about as we make progress. 
To summarize, we had a great second quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise on all fronts. As Peter mentioned, our strong momentum has given us the confidence to raise our REVLIMID revenue guidance to approximate $6.8 billion. The strength of the entire portfolio makes us believe that we will hit the high end of our revenue range for 2016. Our clinical programs are advancing nicely. The RELEVANCE and AUGMENT follicular lymphoma trials will read out in 2017. The POMALYST/IMNOVID MM-007 pivotal study will provide results in 2018, and we have ABRAXANE opportunities in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and with I/O combination, that will be reading out in 2017 and 2018. 
Finally, our earlier pipeline is moving forward substantially, especially in I/O and protein homeostasis. We have a lot of confidence in accelerating momentum in our near-term and long-term opportunities and now on track to deliver on the 2020 targets for our franchise. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In Q2, we saw revenue growth accelerate throughout the quarter in both the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remains strong in the U.S. and throughout Europe. In Q2, we received the top line results for our atopic dermatitis Phase II proof of concept study and are evaluating next steps. We also advanced a development pipeline by taking important steps forward in the GED-0301 and Ozanimod programs, as well as with other early-to-mid stage clinical programs. Global OTEZLA net sales for Q2 2016 were $242 million. This represents a 170% year-on-year increase and a 24% quarter-on-quarter increase. The majority of revenues continue to be derived from the U.S., but we're seeing strong metrics in the launch countries in the Europe. We're pleased with the emerging access footprint for OTEZLA globally. We have now achieved favorable reimbursement decisions in 14 countries in Europe and expect to conclude discussions in most of the remaining countries in Q3. 
This progress in Europe together with an expected approval in Japan by the end of this year should represent a significant source of revenue growth for OTEZLA in 2017 and beyond. Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician campaigns and a refreshed consumer campaign are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests and trials [ph]. Persistence on OTEZLA continues to lengthen as equivalent to biologic therapy at 1-year. OTEZLA also continues to lead all other branded therapies and new to brand share. The PSA and psoriasis markets have grown significantly over the past few years, driven in part by new launches of products with novel non-TNF MOA. If we look specifically at these more recent launches, we can clearly see from the ground that OTEZLA has not only been a leader in growing the market, but has also captured a strong and growing TRx leadership position. 
We are aggressively advancing the Ozanimod development program. As discussed previously, the MS pivotal trials are fully enrolled and the ulcerative colitis pivotal Phase III trial, TRUE NORTH, is enrolling patients worldwide. During Q2, we saw significant data readouts for Ozanimod, including presentation of the Phase II TOUCHSTONE histologic data at the DDW meeting in May, and importantly, the publication of the full TOUCHSTONE II Phase II data in The New England Journal of Medicine. 
In Q2, we also completed enrollment in CD-001, the endoscopic trial for GED-0301. We expect to get initial top line data for the 12-week portion of the study in Q3. We intend to make this data available in the second half of 2016 at a major medical meeting. As a reminder, the objective of the 12-week portion of the study is to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic improvements at an early time point. This trial targeted to enroll a patient population with advanced or serious disease, confirmed by both CDAI and endoscopy at baseline. This is a multinational study with approximately 80% of patients enrolled coming from North America. 
The large Phase III pivotal trial CD-002 continues to enroll, and we have over 150 sites around the world now active. Additionally, the Phase II proof of concept trial of GED-0301, if you see, is now fully enrolled.
Q2 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through important milestones. These programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into the second half of 2016. 
Thank you very much for your attention, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Jackie."

We're well-positioned to finish the year strong and move into 2017 with great momentum. This is the case for our commercial, operational and financial performance, as well as our clinical, regulatory and research performance. Looking at the 2016 milestones we laid out at the beginning of this year, we see that we are outperforming on our financial targets, as reflected in our updated guidance today. Our commercial and operational positions have never been better and set us up extremely well to deliver on our ambitious growth objectives from now to 2020. Our franchise teams are driving strong positive commercial trends across our key products and major geographies, and our global operational teams are delivering exceptional performance and helping to drive our operating profit growth. 
REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID and ABRAXANE have already obtained blockbuster drug status, and OTEZLA is on its way to hitting the $1 billion annual revenue milestone this year, thus becoming the fourth blockbuster in our portfolio. All 4 of these drugs have bright future growth prospects and unique profiles in their therapeutic areas. The growth potential across our existing product portfolio from ongoing geographic expansion remains ahead of us and is only one of the factors driving our growth, as it contributes alongside enhanced value propositions and ongoing label expansions for our marketed products, as well as new product approvals to fuel our expected 18% revenue constant annual growth rate from 2016 to 2020. 
Our regulatory teams are delivering on key submissions globally and some new approvals have already been achieved. Our clinical teams are advancing our pipeline projects with milestones hit across a succession of trial initiations, enrollment achievements and data readouts. Our research and early development teams are producing new drug candidates for IND submissions and making progress on the early-stage trials that allow us to advance compounds into later [ph] stage development. 
Building on the success achieved today, we enter an exciting multiyear period when we will see numerous Phase III trial readouts. By year-end, we expect new date in major medical meetings for some of our 2016 trial readouts. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate readouts for Hematology/Oncology for REVLIMID in follicular lymphoma and for ABRAXANE in both non-small cell lung cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer, as Michael mentioned. Turning to I&I. We expect to see Behcet's data for OTEZLA and 2 trials for Ozanimod in multiple sclerosis. And there is more, in 2018, win for Hematology/Oncology. We will have data for ABRAXANE in triple-negative breast cancer and POMALYST in second-line multiple myeloma. 
For I&I, 2018 will bring 3 trial readouts in the IBD space, 2 in Crohn's for GED-0301 and 1 for Ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. These are all major trials and potential major catalysts. This portfolio of trials gives us several high-quality shots on goal for products and indications that can significantly contribute to our future revenue growth and diversification. To conclude, I would also point out that in addition to what is shown on the slide, we have even more information flow during the remainder of this year. As Scott mentioned, we expect to share 12-week data from the GED-0301 endoscopy trial in the second half of the year. As we deliver on our milestones, we will see a number of Phase II trial readouts from now to the end of the year. We also look forward to important data presentations at major medical meetings, including UEGW in October, ASH in December, and San Antonio Breast in December. And we will kick off a new R&D Deep Dive series with an investor analyst event in September. Our first topic will be protein homeostasis and where we think the science can take our new product development programs in that area. Our teams have put us in a fabulous place so far this year, and we have even more to come before year-end, and great things ahead in 2017, 2018 and beyond.

So [indiscernible] It's very clear that we have a very good momentum for pomalidomide across the globe and it's coming from a couple of factors, starting with the fact that there is a need for a product that is oral and effective and well tolerated in a later line patient population, that is the first point. Which I think leads to a kind of some prescriber preference for using such an oral, very effective drug in the patient population as compared to an IV drug. But I think that's only part of the story. What we are seeing with pomalidomide is that it's moving up. It's moving up in third line and it's moving up even in second line directly off the REVLIMID, and we start to see a lot of [combinatorial use, which has a very positive effect on the clinical benefit that we see on the outcomes of patients, but most importantly, also on treatment duration. So we actually don't see the situation that is building with CD38 and pomalidomide as competitive. We actually see it as complementary.

I think you're referring to the studies -- the combinatorial studies that we're doing in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in combination with Rituximab. The studies are actually set up in a way that they are comparing with the current standard of care. So in case of induction of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that are CHOP, which has been standard of care for induction for quite a while and the study has been really set up in order to provide a huge improvement of outcome. What's also probably important to note that in this study of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, there's a limited treatment duration. So we're expecting varied market outcomes improvement, while at the same time, there is a limited duration of treatment. The situation in follicular lymphoma is building from the observation and the fact that the standard of care at this moment of time is mostly chemotherapy with or without Rituximab or Rituximab alone. We have elderly frail patient population follicular lymphoma that is absolutely not tolerating chemotherapy well, whether it is [indiscernible] based or whether it's CHOP-based or R-CHOP-based. So there's a true need for improvement of treatment of this patient population.

So clearly, the entire Bio-Pharma sector, particularly biotech, was down in the first quarter, which we all talked about at that time.

So answering the question as to why, it's definitely following the analysis and hopefully, we will provide very robust update by the end of the year on those data. The other part of your question was about the correlation of this data with the rest of our lymphoma program and I was trying to highlight in my transcripts, it's the fact that there is very different patient segments, very different combinatorial strategies in our program. So the REMARC study was really done in an elderly first-line diffuse large B-cell high-risk population off the R-CHOP and that was a maintenance therapy, that's very different from the rest of our programs. You may recall that the robust studies and induction study in an ABC subtype and then, we have 2 other important pivotal studies in follicular lymphoma, again, totally different biology and rare combination. So I think, it's definitely -- it's definitely wrong to draw any conclusions from REMARC when we're looking at our other studies."

There's been a lot of discussion in the environment over the last 24, 18 months relative to what should you expect in Crohn's disease relative to endoscopy and sort of the way that this has evolved that's the early time points whether that's be 10, be 12, people are basically looking for 25% change in baseline [indiscernible] scores. By the time you get out to be 24, people are looking at 50% improvement in that [indiscernible] scores. And then when you get out to around a year or 52 weeks and beyond, the people will really look at what we call endoscopic remission or mucosal healing, that's when you expect to see that being significant. It's following sort of a time sequence. You expect to see in an effective drug, strong signs of response early on and then you expect to see, from an endoscopic perspective, the mucosal of the GI tract getting better and better over time, but basically 25, 50 and then mucosal at 52 is the way that the environment is evolving right now."

It is not unusual for large studies to have protocol amendments and minor changes to fiscal plans and things during the course of the execution of the study. I've never personally been involved in a study that had no amendments at all from start to finish. So some minor amendments can happen for a lot of different reasons. Specific to this case, I haven't seen -- the study is not complete, I haven't seen the data. So I can't thoughtfully comment on whether there is anything there which would lead us to change, but at this point, we don't believe that there are any of this -- anything that we see that would lead to major changes in the program. Relative to what to expect, this is where it's a little bit different to take a look at comparables. In the external world, very few other companies use [indiscernible] as the main endpoint to look at endoscopic healing. There's been an evolution in time at what endpoint you should use. Some of the oldest studies had different endpoints and other thing I think is very, very important when you look at the data from GED or any new entity in Crohn's disease from this point forward is we're starting to do baseline endoscopies, so that we can confirm that there actually is mucosal involvement at baseline. The prior studies didn't do that, and some of the patients, didn't have any [ph] lesions when they went into the study, maybe didn't have Crohn's disease, and that was one of the development challenges in Crohn's disease. And way to get around that is confirm active disease at the baseline. So this is a little bit different study. It's more rigorous from that perspective making sure that there's mucosal involvement and mucosal damage. And then taking a look with the [indiscernible] endpoint, which is different than endpoints that have been used in the past. So it's a pretty stringent study that's going to give us a really good idea of what's going on in terms of not only signs and symptoms in this population, but really importantly, what's going on in from an endoscopic perspective."

The relative correlation between what you see in the mucosal and signs and symptoms and real healing has been an area of major debate, particularly in Crohn's disease, much clear when you see. And Crohn's disease has been an area of major debate. There's a couple of recent review articles looking at all the data that are out there that's sort of provide a good picture. The only correlation that has the sort of a reason that I'm aware of, if you can see it, if you get control from a sings and symptoms perspective early, and you start to see some improvements in the mucosa, it generally leads to a positive effect when you get out to week 52. And so that's basically what we're looking for our new Crohn's treatment. Signs and symptoms, significant remissions and signs that it's actually starting to work at the early time points, seeing endoscopic response, endoscopic improvements, and those things together yield a high or probability of a patient being in long-term remission and getting through endoscopic healing at those longer time points."

So, I think, we believe that our treatment of strategic collaboration transactions where the portion of an upfront is related to the acquisition of rights is excluded from non-GAAP is appropriate. The acquisition of rights is unique to the formation of the collaboration, it's very strategic and it's not part of our ongoing operations. Of course, subsequently after that transaction -- collaboration is formed, all other ongoing operating costs of the collaboration, whether they'd be development cost, they'd be milestones, they'd be royalties, cocommercialization, all the ongoing operational activities that we do together with our collaborator are included in our non-GAAP presentation. So I think that's the way we've always through about it. It's very hard to forecast strategic transactions. It's something where I don't think many companies talk about what M&A deals they are going to do next year or what collaboration activity they're going to do. And there are many, many reasons that we can talk about in terms of how to think about this and how it makes sense, but in the interest of time now since we're almost on the hour, I won't drag it through all that at this point, but in the interest of time, our approach has been consistent for many years. It's not uncommon across the industry. Many companies have the same approach and importantly, we're fully transparent on all the factors we have in our GAAP to non-GAAP presentation, and we've always been. And so anybody who wants to particularly look at it slightly differently, certainly, they're able to do that and that's fine.

I think what you're seeing is a simply outstanding execution across the franchises that is the culmination of a lot of years of strategic thinking behind everything that we're doing as well. So lots of exciting days to come for I&I. We've got multiple new products that we're going to read out soon, multiple new indications. For [indiscernible] just one thing that I wanted to close with respect to the myeloma franchise is we're in quite a unique position, both with respect to our existing asset as well as those that are coming through the pipeline that you'll hear more about over the course of the remainder of the year as we have our deep dive event and some other things over time, but we're the only company with multiple products and multiple myeloma that are positioned very uniquely across the spectrum between relapsed refractory and newly diagnosed with backbone therapies for REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID that are combining with everything. And I think that's something to keep in mind. We see a lot of potential, very positive momentum based on the data that we've seen so far both in the relapsed refractory setting for combos as well as the newly diagnosed setting for combos irrespective of which novel agent is coming along. So everything is looking great. Thank you very much. Thanks again to our teams for a great second quarter. And we'll talk to you soon."

Michael brings over 25 years of industry experience",766,"Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'd like to begin by welcoming Michael Pehl to our call in his role as President of our Global Hematology & Oncology franchise. Michael brings over 25 years of industry experience to his leadership position and joined Celgene in 2006 as the first General Manager of our German affiliate. Michael has made significant contributions to our company in roles of increasing responsibility, including Head of our Hematology business in Europe and Head of our Global Hematology and Oncology Marketing Group. Welcome, Michael. 
We appreciate the opportunity to review our second quarter operating performance and the progress we have made advancing major corporate objectives with you. Guided by our strategic imperatives, our global teams are driving outstanding results and achieving key financial, regulatory, clinical and commercial milestones that Peter, Michael, Scott and Jackie will discuss with you today. 
Against virtually every metric, our second quarter was outstanding. This momentum combined with the leverage of our business model continues to generate, improves our full year outlook such that today we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.70 to $5.75 from our earlier target of $5.60 to $5.70, and are guiding to the high end of our current net product sales range of $10.75 billion to $11 billion. Peter will provide much more detail about our second quarter financial performance and improving outlook in a few minutes. 
Our management team is committed to delivering exceptional results each quarter, while we continue to invest in and advanced opportunities expected to maximize the potential of our commercial franchises and build strong and diverse platforms for long-term value creation. We believe this balance was well represented in the quarter. For example, at EHA, new clinical data were presented that cemented REVLIMID's position as a standard of care for myeloma patients. 
In just the past year, 5 novel agents have generated significantly better clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma when combined with REVLIMID. These new data and real-world patient outcomes are adding to the momentum of our global myeloma franchise. 
As you'll hear from Scott, our investments in the commercialization of OTEZLA continue to drive to leadership positions in the U.S. psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets. And its global expansion is accelerating as we complete launch preparations in major European markets and Japan. 
Recognizing the inherent challenges associated with clinical development, we continue to advance high potential pipeline programs to diversify our opportunities. Earlier this week, we announced that based on the interim overall survival analysis of the REMARC study testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we currently do not plan to seek approval for this indication. However, given the optionality and diversity of our late-stage programs, we remain confident in our mid- and long-term growth potential and profile. One of these programs is GED-0301. Where later this quarter, we expect to have the CD-001 12-week endoscopic data. Scott will discuss our progress developing GED-0301 and our I&I pipeline later during our call. 
Through our internal research capabilities and with our exceptional partners, we have created and continue to add new platforms expected to improve our opportunities for longer-term growth. Since the beginning of the year, we have filed 4 investigational new drug applications for Celgene developed products, entered into a number of important collaborations and advanced key clinical programs with our partners. Last week, we announced a new collaboration with Johns Therapeutics, adding to our differentiated opportunities to identify and develop novel immuno-oncology therapies. 
Our work with Johns is expected to meaningfully add to the progress we are making with our immuno-oncology partners: Juno, bluebird bio, Lycera and AstraZeneca. And our expanded relationship with Agios will investigate potential new therapies based on immune cell metabolic pathways that are expected to have applications for the treatment of cancers as well as inflammatory disorders. These examples highlight just some of the progress we're making with our efforts to discover and advance tomorrow's transformational therapies and create a better future for patients in need. 
We look forward to updating you on the progress of our research and key late-stage programs throughout the second half of the year. Despite continued global economic and political uncertainties, our business momentum has never been stronger. We continue to invest in late-stage clinical trials to optimize the value proposition of our existing portfolio, advance our mid- and late-stage pipeline and add promising alliances to our internal research efforts. These are very exciting times at Celgene. Thank you very much, and please help me welcome Peter to our call."

In Q2, we continue to build on the momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio. Our strong top line growth is driven by volume with careful -- with exceptional performance from our core pro",546,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, we continue to build on the momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio. Our strong top line growth is driven by volume with careful -- with exceptional performance from our core products. Our bottom line is driven by careful P&L management, while we continue to invest in our innovative R&D portfolio. Our performance this year has led us to raise our adjusted diluted EPS range, as Mark said, $5.70 to $5.75. To guide net product sales to approximate $11 billion and REVLIMID sales to approximately $6.8 billion for 2016. 
Turning to our second quarter top line results. We continue to see impressive industry-leading growth. Our year-over-year growth for net product sales was 22%. Now Michael and Scott will discuss the underlying demand for this performance later in the call. The driver of our top line growth continues to be volume. Volume accounted for 16 of the total 21.8 percentage points. Our bottom line growth continues to be strong, and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.44 per share. 
Our year-over-year 17% growth was achieved despite higher R&D expenses, related to our numerous late-stage programs, our acquisitions of Receptos and Quanticel that closed in the second half of 2015 and the decision to opt in on several collaboration programs over the past year. 
Turning to our P&L. We continue to have exceptional performance. The adjusted operating margin improved 330 basis points year-over-year to 54.6% for the quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw a 60 basis point improvement. We continue to see excellent leverage in SG&A, which from a margin perspective, offsets our R&D investment. Operating income drove $0.35 per share of the $0.21 per share bottom line growth. Financial levers had a total negative $0.14 impact, which includes the additional interest expense from last year's bond offering. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
For the first half of 2016, we purchased nearly $1.8 billion of our outstanding shares. And in June, an additional $3 billion for share repurchases was authorized, leaving us with a total authorization level of approximately $5.1 billion. 
Based on our exceptional first half performance and strong momentum, we are updating our 2016 guidance for REVLIMID net product sales, total net product sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Now our prior guidance for POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA net product sales will remain unchanged. 
As mentioned earlier, we are guiding to full year REVLIMID net product sales of $6.8 billion from the prior guidance of $6.7 billion. And this is due to the strong uptick seen year-to-date. Our continued management of the SG&A line allows us to raise our adjusted operating margin guidance for the year by 50 basis points to approximately 54%. We now expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.75. We are also updating our diluted share count from 811 million to 806 million due to our first half share repurchases. 
Our first half performance has been superb. And we anticipate continued great commercial momentum. Looking ahead, we are also excited for the next phase of drivers to extend our future growth. 
Thank you. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael."
258769,370552247,1016414,"Celgene Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Celgene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, let me take the opportunity to thank our Hematology & Oncology teams across the globe for their great work in delivering a truly outstanding second quarter. We have made significant progress i",1498,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, let me take the opportunity to thank our Hematology & Oncology teams across the globe for their great work in delivering a truly outstanding second quarter. We have made significant progress in further maximizing the opportunity of our existing assets and then advancing our development programs in pipeline across assets and diseases. Our Q2 financial results are extremely strong with 16% year-over-year revenue growth and 9% sequential growth. The REVLIMID NDMM launch is highly successful across all geographies. We expanded reimbursements across key markets and so positive uptick in duration trends in the markets where we have reimbursement. POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow globally with strong market share and duration rhythm. 
ABRAXANE had a positive quarter around the globe despite the uptake of novel agents in breast and lung cancer. We are maintaining our U.S. leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and our pancreatic market share is growing in reimbursed markets outside of the U.S. There was a very positive flow of data supporting our key in-line brands. Impressive clinical results of REVLIMID NDMM maintenance in combination with daratumumab in refractory myeloma as well as ABRAXANE combination data with checkpoint inhibitors have been presented at the ASCO and EHA meeting in June. 
Our pipeline is advancing substantially including our AG-221 and luspatercept pivotal studies. We're very pleased with the progress of our I/O programs. We have opened additional trials of the FUSION program for durvalumab in hematologic malignancies and made progress with our CAR-T partnerships with Juno and bluebird bio. 
Finally, our next-generation CELMoDs are moving forward in the clinic. REVLIMID delivered outstanding results in Q2 with 18% year-over-year and 8% sequential revenue growth. All key performance metrics are strong globally, and the majority of the growth is coming from volume. U.S. NDMM launch continues to produce significant share and duration gains. U.S. year-over-year growth in TRx for the quarter was 16% and NRx growth was 17%. We have made steady progress with reimbursement in Europe and expect to have reimbursement in additional markets, such as Italy, by the end of 2016. NDMM share continues to grow in reimburse markets in Europe well as in Japan and is in line with our expectation. 
As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, the momentum for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma is extremely strong. Supported by multiple drivers, such as the ongoing NDMM launch, the growing evidence for continuous treatment and multiple triplet readouts and approvals in U.S. and in Europe. Additional momentum in myeloma beyond 2016 will be generated through our ongoing and planned ASCT maintenance submissions in Europe and U.S. as well as the recent publication of Rd+ daratumumab data in relapsed/refractory myeloma with an estimated progression-free survival of well over 40 months. 
As we look forward for REVLIMID beyond myeloma, lymphoma will be a major growth driver by 2020 and beyond. As Mark mentioned, earlier this week, we provided an update on the REMARC trial evaluating REVLIMID as maintenance therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma responding to first-line arch of therapy. We are working closely with our partner Lycera to analyze the data and look forward to presenting the results at a major hematology conference later this year. 
The REMARC study is part of a broad REVLIMID program focused on multiple NHL histology and patient segments. While REMARC evaluated a unique clinical strategy of using REVLIMID as maintenance monotherapy in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the other 4 Phase III studies are testing the combination of REVLIMID with Rituximab or Rituximab-based combination therapies in follicular lymphoma and first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with the ABC subtype. We feel that the evidence created through multiple Phase II studies in those settings is very robust, supporting strong value proposition, unique mechanisms of action and a good likelihood of success for the RELEVANCE, ROBUST and AUGMENT trials. Results from the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trails are expected next year. 
Our 2020 REVLIMID's financial target includes between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in sales for lymphoma. We designed this range to be independent of the success of any 1 of the 5 Phase III trials.
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered a strong 35% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter net sales growth. We have leading market shares in U.S. Launch markets in Europe and Japan continues to see share gains, while duration is increasing globally. Despite a growing number of relapsed/refractory myeloma treatment options, we see a stable third-line share and an increasing second-line share for POMALYST, which is driven by earlier usage directly of the REVLIMID and in combination with traditional and new agents, further enhancing value proposition and clinical benefit. 
We recently received FDA approval for a POMALYST label update in patients with renal impairment, which will allow us to better educate on the usage of POMALYST in this patient population. We have received a positive CHMP opinion for a similar label update for IMNOVID in Europe.
Our development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID in multiple combinations continue to advance. This includes our Phase III MM-007 trial in combination with [indiscernible] in second or later treatment line as well as ongoing Phase I/II combination studies with daratumumab and durvalumab. 
ABRAXANE had a solid performance in the second quarter with 2% year-over-year net sales growth and 11% sequential growth. In the U.S., ABRAXANE maintained its leadership share position in metastatic pancreatic cancer and continued to stabilize in breast and lung cancer, despite competition from other agents. ABRAXANE net sales outside of U.S. grew 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and despite some slight headwinds from price and distributor buying patterns. It's important to note that many recently reimbursed markets have not yet reached peak shares in pancreatic cancer. 
I'd also like to remind you of the long-term opportunities for ABRAXANE. Data for ABRAXANE in combination with eccentric and triple-negative breast cancer were represented at ASCO, adding to the highly encouraging clinical evidence for I/O ABRAXANE combination reported a couple of months ago for non-small cell lung cancer. I/O ABRAXANE Phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer are set to read out in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
In addition to the development programs that I have described for our in-line brands, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in advancing our broad and deep earlier and late-stage pipeline. Let me focus on a couple of key programs and assets. The enrollment of the Phase II expansion study of AG-221 in relapsed/refractory AML is completed and the Phase III study in relapsed/refractory AML is on track. Our luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron is rapidly moving forward and our respective Phase III trials in patients with lower risk MDS and beta-thalassemia continue to enroll well. I'm particularly excited about the progress we've made with our I/O pipeline. The durvalumab fusion program is now enrolling 6 trials in multiple hematological malignancies in combination with many Celgene assets, including POMALYST in relapsed refractory myeloma, REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, daratumumab in relapsed refractory myeloma, multiple assets in NHL or CLL with VIDAZA [ph] and high-risk MDS and AML and with [indiscernible] high-risk MDS. 
In April, we opted into the CD19 CAR-T program with Juno and made good progress with our respective development programs for Europe. In the first quarter of this year, we opted in for bluebird bio's BCMA program. This program continues to advance and in conjunction with durvalumab and our next-generation CELMoDs will be an important cornerstone on our way to secure for multiple myeloma. 
Finally, I'd like to highlight the progress we've made at substantially advancing our understanding of protein homeostasis over the past few years, which has put us in a position to investigate multiple new and potentially more effective next-generation CELMoDs in targeted, higher-risk patient segments. We have our CC-122 program enrolling into multiple proof of concept studies in several indications, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. And we have other candidates coming that we will tell you more about as we make progress. 
To summarize, we had a great second quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise on all fronts. As Peter mentioned, our strong momentum has given us the confidence to raise our REVLIMID revenue guidance to approximate $6.8 billion. The strength of the entire portfolio makes us believe that we will hit the high end of our revenue range for 2016. Our clinical programs are advancing nicely. The RELEVANCE and AUGMENT follicular lymphoma trials will read out in 2017. The POMALYST/IMNOVID MM-007 pivotal study will provide results in 2018, and we have ABRAXANE opportunities in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and with I/O combination, that will be reading out in 2017 and 2018. 
Finally, our earlier pipeline is moving forward substantially, especially in I/O and protein homeostasis. We have a lot of confidence in accelerating momentum in our near-term and long-term opportunities and now on track to deliver on the 2020 targets for our franchise. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In Q2, we saw revenue growth accelerate throughout the quarter in both the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remains strong in the U.S. and throughout Europe. In Q2, we received the top line results for our atopic dermatitis Phase II proof of concept study and are evaluating next steps. We also advanced a development pipeline by taking important steps forward in the GED-0301 and Ozanimod programs, as well as with other early-to-mid stage clinical programs. Global OTEZLA net sales for Q2 2016 were $242 million. This represents a 170% year-on-year increase and a 24% quarter-on-quarter increase. The majority of revenues continue to be derived from the U.S., but we're seeing strong metrics in the launch countries in Europe. We are pleased with the emerging access footprint for OTEZLA globally. We have now achieved favorable reimbursement decisions in 14 countries in Europe and expect to conclude discussions in most of the remaining countries in Q3. 
This progress in Europe together with an expected approval in Japan by the end of this year should represent a significant source of revenue growth for OTEZLA in 2017 and beyond. Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician campaigns and a refreshed consumer campaign are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests and trials [ph]. Persistence on OTEZLA continues to lengthen as equivalent to biologic therapy at 1-year. OTEZLA also continues to lead all other branded therapies and new to brand share. The PSA and psoriasis markets have grown significantly over the past few years, driven in part by new launches of products with novel non-TNF MOA. If we look specifically at these more recent launches, we can clearly see from the ground that OTEZLA has not only been a leader in growing the market, but has also captured a strong and growing TRx leadership position. 
We are aggressively advancing the Ozanimod development program. As discussed previously, the MS pivotal trials are fully enrolled and the ulcerative colitis pivotal Phase III trial, TRUE NORTH, is enrolling patients worldwide. During Q2, we saw significant data readouts for Ozanimod, including presentation of the Phase II TOUCHSTONE histologic data at the DDW meeting in May, and importantly, the publication of the full TOUCHSTONE II Phase II data in The New England Journal of Medicine. 
In Q2, we also completed enrollment in CD-001, the endoscopic trial for GED-0301. We expect to get initial top line data for the 12-week portion of the study in Q3. We intend to make these data available in the second half of 2016 at a major medical meeting. As a reminder, the objective of the 12-week portion of the study is to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic improvements at an early time point. This trial targeted to enroll a patient population with advanced or serious disease, confirmed by both CDAI and endoscopy at baseline. This is a multinational study with approximately 80% of patients enrolled coming from North America. 
The large Phase III pivotal trial CD-002 continues to enroll, and we have over 150 sites around the world now active. Additionally, the Phase II proof of concept trial of GED-0301, if you see, is now fully enrolled.
Q2 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through important milestones. These programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into the second half of 2016. 
Thank you very much for your attention, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Jackie."

We're well-positioned to finish the year strong and move into 2017 with great momentum. This is the case for our commercial, operational and financial performance, as well as our clinical, regulatory and research performance. Looking at the 2016 milestones we laid out at the beginning of this year, we see that we are outperforming on our financial targets, as reflected in our updated guidance today. Our commercial and operational positions have never been better and set us up extremely well to deliver on our ambitious growth objectives from now to 2020. Our franchise teams are driving strong positive commercial trends across our key products and major geographies, and our global operational teams are delivering exceptional performance and helping to drive our operating profit growth. 
REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID and ABRAXANE have already obtained blockbuster drug status, and OTEZLA is on its way to hitting the $1 billion annual revenue milestone this year, thus becoming the fourth blockbuster in our portfolio. All 4 of these drugs have bright future growth prospects and unique profiles in their therapeutic areas. The growth potential across our existing product portfolio from ongoing geographic expansion remains ahead of us and is only one of the factors driving our growth, as it contributes alongside enhanced value propositions and ongoing label expansions for our marketed products, as well as new product approvals to fuel our expected 18% revenue constant annual growth rate from 2016 to 2020. 
Our regulatory teams are delivering on key submissions globally, and some new approvals have already been achieved. Our clinical teams are advancing our pipeline projects with milestones hit across a succession of trial initiations, enrollment achievements and data readouts. Our research and early development teams are producing new drug candidates for IND submissions and making progress on the early-stage trials that allow us to advance compounds into later stage development. 
Building on the success achieved to-date, we enter an exciting multiyear period when we will see numerous Phase III trial readouts. By year-end, we expect new date in major medical meetings for some of our 2016 trial readouts. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate readouts for Hematology/Oncology for REVLIMID in follicular lymphoma and for ABRAXANE in both non-small cell lung cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer, as Michael mentioned. Turning to I&I. We expect to see Behcet's data for OTEZLA and 2 trials for Ozanimod in multiple sclerosis. And there is more, in 2018, win for Hematology/Oncology. We will have data for ABRAXANE in triple-negative breast cancer and POMALYST in second-line multiple myeloma. 
For I&I, 2018 will bring 3 trial readouts in the IBD space, 2 in Crohn's for GED-0301 and 1 for Ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. These are all major trials and potential major catalysts. This portfolio of trials gives us several high-quality shots on goal for products and indications that can significantly contribute to our future revenue growth and diversification. To conclude, I would also point out that in addition to what is shown on the slide, we have even more information flow during the remainder of this year. As Scott mentioned, we expect to share 12-week data from the GED-0301 endoscopy trial in the second half of the year. As we deliver on our milestones, we will see a number of Phase II trial readouts from now to the end of the year. We also look forward to important data presentations at major medical meetings, including UEGW in October, ASH in December, and San Antonio Breast in December. And we will kick off a new R&D Deep Dive series with an investor analyst event in September. Our first topic will be protein homeostasis and where we think the science can take our new product development programs in that area. Our teams have put us in a fabulous place so far this year, and we have even more to come before year-end, and great things ahead in 2017, 2018 and beyond.

So [indiscernible] It's very clear that we have a very good momentum for pomalidomide across the globe and it's coming from a couple of factors, starting with the fact that there is a need for a product that is oral and effective and well tolerated in a later line patient population, that is the first point. Which I think leads to a kind of some prescriber preference for using such an oral, very effective drug in the patient population as compared to an IV drug. But I think that's only part of the story. What we are seeing with pomalidomide is that it's moving up. It's moving up in third line and it's moving up even in second line directly off the REVLIMID, and we start to see a lot of combinatorial use, which has a very positive effect on the clinical benefit that we see on the outcomes of patients, but most importantly, also on treatment duration. So we actually don't see the situation that is building with CD38 and pomalidomide as competitive. We actually see it as complementary. The 2 drugs go extremely well together and what we're seeing at this moment of time is a lot of combinatorial use."

I think you're referring to the studies -- the combinatorial studies that we're doing in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in combination with Rituximab. The studies are actually set up in a way that they are comparing with the current standard of care. So in case of induction of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that are CHOP, which has been standard of care for induction for quite a while and the study has been really set up in order to provide a huge improvement of outcome. What's also probably important to note that in this study of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, there's a limited treatment duration. So we're expecting a varied marked outcomes improvement, while at the same time, there is a limited duration of treatment. The situation for follicular lymphoma is building from the observation and the fact that the standard of care at this moment of time is mostly chemotherapy with or without Rituximab or Rituximab alone. We have elderly frail patient population follicular lymphoma that is absolutely not tolerating chemotherapy well, whether it is antimoxian [ph] based or whether it's CHOP-based or R-CHOP-based. So there's a true need for improvement of treatment of this patient population. Again, we feel the studies, which are [indiscernible] studies, have been set up in a way that they are representing a true improvement of standard of care and the outcomes of this patient. That should translate in a very positive reimbursement situation for us."

So clearly, the entire Bio-Pharma sector, particularly biotech, was down in the first quarter, which we all talked about at that time.

When we go out to 2020, which is I think which you're referring to, we've also provided obviously a basis for that guidance that we gave and that was a share count of 830.

So obviously, it's a long time between now and 2020. So I think there's also things coming.

The other part of your question was about the correlation of this data with the rest of our lymphoma program and I was trying to highlight in my transcripts, it's the fact that there is very different patient segments, very different combinatorial strategies in our program. So the REMARC study was really done in an elderly first-line diffuse large B-cell high-risk population off the R-CHOP and that was a maintenance therapy, that's very different from the rest of our programs. You may recall that the robust studies and induction study in an ABC subtype and then, we have 2 other important pivotal studies in follicular lymphoma, again, totally different biology and a rare combination.

And that's the early time points whether that's week 10, week 12, people are basically looking for 25% change in baseline SES-CD [ph] scores. By the time you get out to week 24, people are looking at 50% improvement in SES-CD [ph] scores. And then when you get out to around a year or 52 weeks and beyond, the people will really look at what we call endoscopic remission or mucosal healing, that's when you expect to see that being significant.

It is not unusual for large studies to have protocol amendments and minor changes to fiscal plans and things during the course of the execution of the study. I've never personally been involved in a study that had no amendments at all from start to finish. So some minor amendments can happen for a lot of different reasons. Specific to this case, I haven't seen -- the study is not complete, I haven't seen the data. So I can't thoughtfully comment on whether there is anything there which would lead us to change, but at this point, we don't believe that there are any of this -- there's anything that we see that would lead to major changes in the program. Relative to what to expect, this is where it's a little bit different to take a look at comparables. In the external world, very few other companies use SES-CD as the main endpoint to look at endoscopic healing. There's been an evolution in time at what endpoint you should use. Some of the older studies had different endpoints and the other thing I think is very, very important when you look at the data from GED or any new entity in Crohn's disease from this point forward is we're starting to do baseline endoscopies, so that we can confirm that there actually is mucosal involvement at baseline. The prior studies didn't do that, and some of the patients, didn't have any lesions when they went into the study, maybe didn't have Crohn's disease, and that was one of the development challenges in Crohn's disease. And way to get around that is confirm active disease at the baseline. So this is a little bit different study. It's more rigorous from that perspective, making sure that there's mucosal involvement and mucosal damage. And then taking a look with the SES-CD endpoint, which is different than endpoints that have been used in the past. So it's a pretty stringent study that's going to give us a really good idea of what's going on in terms of not only signs and symptoms in this population, but really importantly, what's going on in from an endoscopic perspective."

And Crohn's disease has been an area of major debate. There's a couple of recent review articles looking at all the data that are out there that's sort of provide a good picture. The only correlation that has the sort of a rhythm that I'm aware of, that you can see it, if you get control from a signs and symptoms perspective early, and you start to see some improvements in the mucosa, it generally leads to a positive effect when you get out to week 52. And so that's basically what we're looking for our new Crohn's treatment. Signs and symptoms, significant remissions and signs that it's actually starting to work at the early time points, seeing endoscopic response or endoscopic improvements, and those things together yield a high or probability of a patient being in long-term remission and getting through endoscopic healing at those longer time points."

So, I think, we believe that our treatment of strategic collaboration transactions where the portion of an upfront is related to the acquisition of rights is excluded from non-GAAP is appropriate. The acquisition of rights is unique to the formation of the collaboration, it's very strategic and it's not part of our ongoing operations. Of course, subsequently after that transaction -- collaboration is formed, all other ongoing operating costs of the collaboration, whether they'd be development cost, they'd be milestones, they'd be royalties, cocommercialization, all the ongoing operational activities that we do together with our collaborator are included in our non-GAAP presentation. So I think that's the way we've always through about it. It's very hard to forecast strategic transactions. It's something where I don't think many companies talk about what M&A deals they are going to do next year or what collaboration activity they're going to do. And there are many, many reasons that we can talk about in terms of how to think about this and how it makes sense, but in the interest of time now since we're almost on the hour, I won't drag it through all that at this point, but in the interest of time, our approach has been consistent for many years. It's not uncommon across the industry.

So what's extremely exciting is you are going have this endoscopy data relatively soon and then there is, as we mentioned, a lot of information flow from now and till the end of year, and we'll start in the second half of the year to see momentum going into 2017, and you're going to see these follicular trials readout beginning in the first half of 2017, and Michael did an extremely thorough job of outlining why we think that we will see success with those treatment regimens and what the differences are versus the REMARC trial.

So we're going to get that data, and we should have a good view on that in first half of next year, but we feel confident if we make the decision to go ahead and go alone, we feel very confident that we can do that very successfully. We're doing that right now currently with OTEZLA. It's a very relatively tight specialty group of physicians, it fits with what we do at Celgene.

And I think that's something to keep in mind. We see a lot of potential, very positive momentum based on the data that we've seen so far, both in the relapsed refractory setting for combos as well as the newly diagnosed setting for combos, irrespective of which novel agent is coming along.

Michael brings over 25 years of industry experience",766,"Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'd like to begin by welcoming Michael Pehl to our call in his role as President of our Global Hematology & Oncology franchise. Michael brings over 25 years of industry experience to his leadership position and joined Celgene in 2006 as the first General Manager of our German affiliate. Michael has made significant contributions to our company in roles of increasing responsibility, including Head of our Hematology business in Europe and Head of our Global Hematology and Oncology Marketing Group. Welcome, Michael. 
We appreciate the opportunity to review our second quarter operating performance and the progress we have made advancing major corporate objectives with you. Guided by our strategic imperatives, our global teams are driving outstanding results and achieving key financial, regulatory, clinical and commercial milestones that Peter, Michael, Scott and Jackie will discuss with you today. 
Against virtually every metric, our second quarter was outstanding. This momentum combined with the leverage of our business model continues to generate, improves our full year outlook such that today we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.70 to $5.75 from our earlier target of $5.60 to $5.70, and are guiding to the high end of our current net product sales range of $10.75 billion to $11 billion. Peter will provide much more detail about our second quarter financial performance and improving outlook in a few minutes. 
Our management team is committed to delivering exceptional results each quarter, while we continue to invest in and advanced opportunities expected to maximize the potential of our commercial franchises and build strong and diverse platforms for long-term value creation. We believe this balance was well represented in the quarter. For example, at EHA, new clinical data were presented that cemented REVLIMID's position as a standard of care for myeloma patients. 
In just the past year, 5 novel agents have generated significantly better clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma when combined with REVLIMID. These new data and real-world patient outcomes are adding to the momentum of our global myeloma franchise. 
As you'll hear from Scott, our investments in the commercialization of OTEZLA continue to drive to leadership positions in the U.S. psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets. And its global expansion is accelerating as we complete launch preparations in major European markets and Japan. 
Recognizing the inherent challenges associated with clinical development, we continue to advance high potential pipeline programs to diversify our opportunities. Earlier this week, we announced that based on the interim overall survival analysis of the REMARC study testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we currently do not plan to seek approval for this indication. However, given the optionality and diversity of our late-stage programs, we remain confident in our mid- and long-term growth potential and profile. One of these programs is GED-0301. Where later this quarter, we expect to have the CD-001 12-week endoscopic data. Scott will discuss our progress developing GED-0301 and our I&I pipeline later during our call. 
Through our internal research capabilities and with our exceptional partners, we have created and continue to add new platforms expected to improve our opportunities for longer-term growth. Since the beginning of the year, we have filed 4 investigational new drug applications for Celgene developed products, entered into a number of important collaborations and advanced key clinical programs with our partners. Last week, we announced a new collaboration with Johns Therapeutics, adding to our differentiated opportunities to identify and develop novel immuno-oncology therapies. 
Our work with Johns is expected to meaningfully add to the progress we are making with our immuno-oncology partners: Juno, bluebird bio, Lycera and AstraZeneca. And our expanded relationship with Agios will investigate potential new therapies based on immune cell metabolic pathways that are expected to have applications for the treatment of cancers as well as inflammatory disorders. These examples highlight just some of the progress we're making with our efforts to discover and advance tomorrow's transformational therapies and create a better future for patients in need. 
We look forward to updating you on the progress of our research and key late-stage programs throughout the second half of the year. Despite continued global economic and political uncertainties, our business momentum has never been stronger. We continue to invest in late-stage clinical trials to optimize the value proposition of our existing portfolio, advance our mid- and late-stage pipeline and add promising alliances to our internal research efforts. These are very exciting times at Celgene. Thank you very much, and please help me welcome Peter to our call."

In Q2, we continue to build on the momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio.

In Q2, we continue to build on the momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio. Our strong top line growth is driven by volume with careful -- with exceptional performance from our core products. Our bottom line is driven by careful P&L management, while we continue to invest in our innovative R&D portfolio. Our performance this year has led us to raise our adjusted diluted EPS range, as Mark said, $5.70 to $5.75. To guide net product sales to approximate $11 billion and REVLIMID sales to approximately $6.8 billion for 2016. 
Turning to our second quarter top line results. We continue to see impressive industry-leading growth. Our year-over-year growth for net product sales was 22%. Now Michael and Scott will discuss the underlying demand for this performance later in the call. The driver of our top line growth continues to be volume. Volume accounted for 16 of the total 21.8 percentage points. Our bottom line growth continues to be strong, and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.44 per share. 
Our year-over-year 17% growth was achieved despite higher R&D expenses, related to our numerous late-stage programs, our acquisitions of Receptos and Quanticel that closed in the second half of 2015 and the decision to opt in on several collaboration programs over the past year. 
Turning to our P&L. We continue to have exceptional performance. The adjusted operating margin improved 330 basis points year-over-year to 54.6% for the quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw a 60 basis point improvement. We continue to see excellent leverage in SG&A, which from a margin perspective, offsets our R&D investment. Operating income drove $0.35 per share of the $0.21 per share bottom line growth. Financial levers had a total negative $0.14 impact, which includes the additional interest expense from last year's bond offering. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
For the first half of 2016, we purchased nearly $1.8 billion of our outstanding shares. And in June, an additional $3 billion for share repurchases was authorized, leaving us with a total authorization level of approximately $5.1 billion. 
Based on our exceptional first half performance and strong momentum, we are updating our 2016 guidance for REVLIMID net product sales, total net product sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS. Now our prior guidance for POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA net product sales will remain unchanged. 
As mentioned earlier, we are guiding to full year REVLIMID net product sales of $6.8 billion from the prior guidance of $6.7 billion. And this is due to the strong uptick seen year-to-date. Our continued management of the SG&A line allows us to raise our adjusted operating margin guidance for the year by 50 basis points to approximately 54%. We now expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.75. We are also updating our diluted share count from 811 million to 806 million due to our first half share repurchases. 
Our first half performance has been superb. And we anticipate continued great commercial momentum. Looking ahead, we are also excited for the next phase of drivers to extend our future growth. 
Thank you. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael."

Before we start, let me take the opportunity to thank our Hematology & Oncology teams across the globe for their great work in delivering a truly outstanding second quarter. We have made significant progress i",1498,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, let me take the opportunity to thank our Hematology & Oncology teams across the globe for their great work in delivering a truly outstanding second quarter. We have made significant progress in further maximizing the opportunity of our existing assets and then advancing our development programs in pipeline across assets and diseases. Our Q2 financial results are extremely strong with 16% year-over-year revenue growth and 9% sequential growth. The REVLIMID NDMM launch is highly successful across all geographies. We expanded reimbursements across key markets and so positive uptick in duration trends in the markets where we have reimbursement. POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow globally with strong market share and duration rhythm. 
ABRAXANE had a positive quarter around the globe despite the uptake of novel agents in breast and lung cancer. We are maintaining our U.S. leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and our pancreatic market share is growing in reimbursed markets outside of the U.S. There was a very positive flow of data supporting our key in-line brands. Impressive clinical results of REVLIMID NDMM maintenance in combination with daratumumab in refractory myeloma as well as ABRAXANE combination data with checkpoint inhibitors have been presented at the ASCO and EHA meeting in June. 
Our pipeline is advancing substantially including our AG-221 and luspatercept pivotal studies. We're very pleased with the progress of our I/O programs. We have opened additional trials of the FUSION program for durvalumab in hematologic malignancies and made progress with our CAR-T partnerships with Juno and bluebird bio. 
Finally, our next-generation CELMoDs are moving forward in the clinic. REVLIMID delivered outstanding results in Q2 with 18% year-over-year and 8% sequential revenue growth. All key performance metrics are strong globally, and the majority of the growth is coming from volume. U.S. NDMM launch continues to produce significant share and duration gains. U.S. year-over-year growth in TRx for the quarter was 16% and NRx growth was 17%. We have made steady progress with reimbursement in Europe and expect to have reimbursement in additional markets, such as Italy, by the end of 2016. NDMM share continues to grow in reimburse markets in Europe well as in Japan and is in line with our expectation. 
As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, the momentum for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma is extremely strong. Supported by multiple drivers, such as the ongoing NDMM launch, the growing evidence for continuous treatment and multiple triplet readouts and approvals in U.S. and in Europe. Additional momentum in myeloma beyond 2016 will be generated through our ongoing and planned ASCT maintenance submissions in Europe and U.S. as well as the recent publication of Rd+ daratumumab data in relapsed/refractory myeloma with an estimated progression-free survival of well over 40 months. 
As we look forward for REVLIMID beyond myeloma, lymphoma will be a major growth driver by 2020 and beyond. As Mark mentioned, earlier this week, we provided an update on the REMARC trial evaluating REVLIMID as maintenance therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma responding to first-line arch of therapy. We are working closely with our partner Lycera to analyze the data and look forward to presenting the results at a major hematology conference later this year. 
The REMARC study is part of a broad REVLIMID program focused on multiple NHL histology and patient segments. While REMARC evaluated a unique clinical strategy of using REVLIMID as maintenance monotherapy in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the other 4 Phase III studies are testing the combination of REVLIMID with Rituximab or Rituximab-based combination therapies in follicular lymphoma and first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with the ABC subtype. We feel that the evidence created through multiple Phase II studies in those settings is very robust, supporting strong value proposition, unique mechanisms of action and a good likelihood of success for the RELEVANCE, ROBUST and AUGMENT trials. Results from the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trails are expected next year. 
Our 2020 REVLIMID's financial target includes between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in sales for lymphoma. We designed this range to be independent of the success of any 1 of the 5 Phase III trials.
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered a strong 35% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter net sales growth. We have leading market shares in U.S. Launch markets in Europe and Japan continues to see share gains, while duration is increasing globally. Despite a growing number of relapsed/refractory myeloma treatment options, we see a stable third-line share and an increasing second-line share for POMALYST, which is driven by earlier usage directly of the REVLIMID and in combination with traditional and new agents, further enhancing value proposition and clinical benefit. 
We recently received FDA approval for a POMALYST label update in patients with renal impairment, which will allow us to better educate on the usage of POMALYST in this patient population. We have received a positive CHMP opinion for a similar label update for IMNOVID in Europe.
Our development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID in multiple combinations continue to advance. This includes our Phase III MM-007 trial in combination with [indiscernible] in second or later treatment line as well as ongoing Phase I/II combination studies with daratumumab and durvalumab. 
ABRAXANE had a solid performance in the second quarter with 2% year-over-year net sales growth and 11% sequential growth. In the U.S., ABRAXANE maintained its leadership share position in metastatic pancreatic cancer and continued to stabilize in breast and lung cancer, despite competition from other agents. ABRAXANE net sales outside of U.S. grew 2% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and despite some slight headwinds from price and distributor buying patterns. It's important to note that many recently reimbursed markets have not yet reached peak shares in pancreatic cancer. 
I'd also like to remind you of the long-term opportunities for ABRAXANE. Data for ABRAXANE in combination with eccentric and triple-negative breast cancer were represented at ASCO, adding to the highly encouraging clinical evidence for I/O ABRAXANE combination reported a couple of months ago for non-small cell lung cancer. I/O ABRAXANE Phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer are set to read out in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
In addition to the development programs that I have described for our in-line brands, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in advancing our broad and deep earlier and late-stage pipeline. Let me focus on a couple of key programs and assets. The enrollment of the Phase II expansion study of AG-221 in relapsed/refractory AML is completed and the Phase III study in relapsed/refractory AML is on track. Our luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron is rapidly moving forward and our respective Phase III trials in patients with lower risk MDS and beta-thalassemia continue to enroll well. I'm particularly excited about the progress we've made with our I/O pipeline. The durvalumab fusion program is now enrolling 6 trials in multiple hematological malignancies in combination with many Celgene assets, including POMALYST in relapsed refractory myeloma, REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, daratumumab in relapsed refractory myeloma, multiple assets in NHL or CLL with VIDAZA [ph] and high-risk MDS and AML and with [indiscernible] high-risk MDS. 
In April, we opted into the CD19 CAR-T program with Juno and made good progress with our respective development programs for Europe. In the first quarter of this year, we opted in for bluebird bio's BCMA program. This program continues to advance and in conjunction with durvalumab and our next-generation CELMoDs will be an important cornerstone on our way to secure for multiple myeloma. 
Finally, I'd like to highlight the progress we've made at substantially advancing our understanding of protein homeostasis over the past few years, which has put us in a position to investigate multiple new and potentially more effective next-generation CELMoDs in targeted, higher-risk patient segments. We have our CC-122 program enrolling into multiple proof of concept studies in several indications, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. And we have other candidates coming that we will tell you more about as we make progress. 
To summarize, we had a great second quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise on all fronts. As Peter mentioned, our strong momentum has given us the confidence to raise our REVLIMID revenue guidance to approximate $6.8 billion. The strength of the entire portfolio makes us believe that we will hit the high end of our revenue range for 2016. Our clinical programs are advancing nicely. The RELEVANCE and AUGMENT follicular lymphoma trials will read out in 2017. The POMALYST/IMNOVID MM-007 pivotal study will provide results in 2018, and we have ABRAXANE opportunities in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and with I/O combination, that will be reading out in 2017 and 2018. 
Finally, our earlier pipeline is moving forward substantially, especially in I/O and protein homeostasis. We have a lot of confidence in accelerating momentum in our near-term and long-term opportunities and now on track to deliver on the 2020 targets for our franchise. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

In Q2, we saw revenue growth accelerate throughout the quarter in both the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remains strong in the U.S. and throughout Europe. In Q2, we received the top line results for our atopic dermatitis Phase II proof of concept study and are evaluating next steps. We also advanced a development pipeline by taking important steps forward in the GED-0301 and Ozanimod programs, as well as with other early-to-mid stage clinical programs. Global OTEZLA net sales for Q2 2016 were $242 million. This represents a 170% year-on-year increase and a 24% quarter-on-quarter increase. The majority of revenues continue to be derived from the U.S., but we're seeing strong metrics in the launch countries in Europe. We are pleased with the emerging access footprint for OTEZLA globally. We have now achieved favorable reimbursement decisions in 14 countries in Europe and expect to conclude discussions in most of the remaining countries in Q3. 
This progress in Europe together with an expected approval in Japan by the end of this year should represent a significant source of revenue growth for OTEZLA in 2017 and beyond. Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician campaigns and a refreshed consumer campaign are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests and trials [ph]. Persistence on OTEZLA continues to lengthen as equivalent to biologic therapy at 1-year. OTEZLA also continues to lead all other branded therapies and new to brand share. The PSA and psoriasis markets have grown significantly over the past few years, driven in part by new launches of products with novel non-TNF MOA. If we look specifically at these more recent launches, we can clearly see from the ground that OTEZLA has not only been a leader in growing the market, but has also captured a strong and growing TRx leadership position. 
We are aggressively advancing the Ozanimod development program. As discussed previously, the MS pivotal trials are fully enrolled and the ulcerative colitis pivotal Phase III trial, TRUE NORTH, is enrolling patients worldwide. During Q2, we saw significant data readouts for Ozanimod, including presentation of the Phase II TOUCHSTONE histologic data at the DDW meeting in May, and importantly, the publication of the full TOUCHSTONE II Phase II data in The New England Journal of Medicine. 
In Q2, we also completed enrollment in CD-001, the endoscopic trial for GED-0301. We expect to get initial top line data for the 12-week portion of the study in Q3. We intend to make these data available in the second half of 2016 at a major medical meeting. As a reminder, the objective of the 12-week portion of the study is to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic improvements at an early time point. This trial targeted to enroll a patient population with advanced or serious disease, confirmed by both CDAI and endoscopy at baseline. This is a multinational study with approximately 80% of patients enrolled coming from North America. 
The large Phase III pivotal trial CD-002 continues to enroll, and we have over 150 sites around the world now active. Additionally, the Phase II proof of concept trial of GED-0301, if you see, is now fully enrolled.
Q2 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through important milestones. These programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into the second half of 2016. 
Thank you very much for your attention, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Jackie."

We're well-positioned to finish the year strong and move into 2017 with great momentum. This is the case for our commercial, operational and financial performance, as well as our clinical, regulatory and research performance. Looking at the 2016 milestones we laid out at the beginning of this year, we see that we are outperforming on our financial targets, as reflected in our updated guidance today. Our commercial and operational positions have never been better and set us up extremely well to deliver on our ambitious growth objectives from now to 2020. Our franchise teams are driving strong positive commercial trends across our key products and major geographies, and our global operational teams are delivering exceptional performance and helping to drive our operating profit growth. 
REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID and ABRAXANE have already obtained blockbuster drug status, and OTEZLA is on its way to hitting the $1 billion annual revenue milestone this year, thus becoming the fourth blockbuster in our portfolio. All 4 of these drugs have bright future growth prospects and unique profiles in their therapeutic areas. The growth potential across our existing product portfolio from ongoing geographic expansion remains ahead of us and is only one of the factors driving our growth, as it contributes alongside enhanced value propositions and ongoing label expansions for our marketed products, as well as new product approvals to fuel our expected 18% revenue constant annual growth rate from 2016 to 2020. 
Our regulatory teams are delivering on key submissions globally, and some new approvals have already been achieved. Our clinical teams are advancing our pipeline projects with milestones hit across a succession of trial initiations, enrollment achievements and data readouts. Our research and early development teams are producing new drug candidates for IND submissions and making progress on the early-stage trials that allow us to advance compounds into later stage development. 
Building on the success achieved to-date, we enter an exciting multiyear period when we will see numerous Phase III trial readouts. By year-end, we expect new date in major medical meetings for some of our 2016 trial readouts. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate readouts for Hematology/Oncology for REVLIMID in follicular lymphoma and for ABRAXANE in both non-small cell lung cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer, as Michael mentioned. Turning to I&I. We expect to see Behcet's data for OTEZLA and 2 trials for Ozanimod in multiple sclerosis. And there is more, in 2018, win for Hematology/Oncology. We will have data for ABRAXANE in triple-negative breast cancer and POMALYST in second-line multiple myeloma. 
For I&I, 2018 will bring 3 trial readouts in the IBD space, 2 in Crohn's for GED-0301 and 1 for Ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. These are all major trials and potential major catalysts. This portfolio of trials gives us several high-quality shots on goal for products and indications that can significantly contribute to our future revenue growth and diversification. To conclude, I would also point out that in addition to what is shown on the slide, we have even more information flow during the remainder of this year. As Scott mentioned, we expect to share 12-week data from the GED-0301 endoscopy trial in the second half of the year. As we deliver on our milestones, we will see a number of Phase II trial readouts from now to the end of the year. We also look forward to important data presentations at major medical meetings, including UEGW in October, ASH in December, and San Antonio Breast in December. And we will kick off a new R&D Deep Dive series with an investor analyst event in September. Our first topic will be protein homeostasis and where we think the science can take our new product development programs in that area. Our teams have put us in a fabulous place so far this year, and we have even more to come before year-end, and great things ahead in 2017, 2018 and beyond. 
With that, I thank you for listening, and I now open the call to questions."

So [indiscernible] It's very clear that we have a very good momentum for pomalidomide across the globe and it's coming from a couple of factors, starting with the fact that there is a need for a product that is oral and effective and well tolerated in a later line patient population, that is the first point. Which I think leads to a kind of some prescriber preference for using such an oral, very effective drug in the patient population as compared to an IV drug. But I think that's only part of the story. What we are seeing with pomalidomide is that it's moving up. It's moving up in third line and it's moving up even in second line directly off the REVLIMID, and we start to see a lot of combinatorial use, which has a very positive effect on the clinical benefit that we see on the outcomes of patients, but most importantly, also on treatment duration. So we actually don't see the situation that is building with CD38 and pomalidomide as competitive. We actually see it as complementary. The 2 drugs go extremely well together and what we're seeing at this moment of time is a lot of combinatorial use."

I think you're referring to the studies -- the combinatorial studies that we're doing in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in combination with Rituximab. The studies are actually set up in a way that they are comparing with the current standard of care. So in case of induction of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that are CHOP, which has been standard of care for induction for quite a while and the study has been really set up in order to provide a huge improvement of outcome. What's also probably important to note that in this study of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, there's a limited treatment duration. So we're expecting a varied marked outcomes improvement, while at the same time, there is a limited duration of treatment. The situation for follicular lymphoma is building from the observation and the fact that the standard of care at this moment of time is mostly chemotherapy with or without Rituximab or Rituximab alone. We have elderly frail patient population follicular lymphoma that is absolutely not tolerating chemotherapy well, whether it is antimoxian [ph] based or whether it's CHOP-based or R-CHOP-based. So there's a true need for improvement of treatment of this patient population. Again, we feel the studies, which are [indiscernible] studies, have been set up in a way that they are representing a true improvement of standard of care and the outcomes of this patient. That should translate in a very positive reimbursement situation for us."

So clearly, the entire Bio-Pharma sector, particularly biotech, was down in the first quarter, which we all talked about at that time. And we saw our stock price down in the 90s and so we took advantage of that and use our capacity to get some shares and that has, for the short-term, reduced our share count. When we go out to 2020, which is I think which you're referring to, we've also provided obviously a basis for that guidance that we gave and that was a share count of 830.

The other part of your question was about the correlation of this data with the rest of our lymphoma program and I was trying to highlight in my transcripts, it's the fact that there is very different patient segments, very different combinatorial strategies in our program. So the REMARC study was really done in an elderly first-line diffuse large B-cell high-risk population off the R-CHOP and that was a maintenance therapy, that's very different from the rest of our programs. You may recall that the robust studies and induction study in an ABC subtype and then, we have 2 other important pivotal studies in follicular lymphoma, again, totally different biology and a rare combination.

By the time you get out to week 24, people are looking at 50% improvement in SES-CD [ph] scores. And then when you get out to around a year or 52 weeks and beyond, the people will really look at what we call endoscopic remission or mucosal healing, that's when you expect to see that being significant. It's following sort of a time sequence. You expect to see in an effective drug, strong signs of response early on and then you expect to see, from an endoscopic perspective, the mucosal of the GI tract getting better and better over time, but basically 25, 50 and then mucosal at 52 is the way that the environment is evolving right now."

It is not unusual for large studies to have protocol amendments and minor changes to fiscal plans and things during the course of the execution of the study. I've never personally been involved in a study that had no amendments at all from start to finish. So some minor amendments can happen for a lot of different reasons. Specific to this case, I haven't seen -- the study is not complete, I haven't seen the data. So I can't thoughtfully comment on whether there is anything there which would lead us to change, but at this point, we don't believe that there are any of this -- there's anything that we see that would lead to major changes in the program. Relative to what to expect, this is where it's a little bit different to take a look at comparables. In the external world, very few other companies use SES-CD as the main endpoint to look at endoscopic healing. There's been an evolution in time at what endpoint you should use. Some of the older studies had different endpoints and the other thing I think is very, very important when you look at the data from GED or any new entity in Crohn's disease from this point forward is we're starting to do baseline endoscopies, so that we can confirm that there actually is mucosal involvement at baseline. The prior studies didn't do that, and some of the patients, didn't have any lesions when they went into the study, maybe didn't have Crohn's disease, and that was one of the development challenges in Crohn's disease. And way to get around that is confirm active disease at the baseline. So this is a little bit different study. It's more rigorous from that perspective, making sure that there's mucosal involvement and mucosal damage. And then taking a look with the SES-CD endpoint, which is different than endpoints that have been used in the past. So it's a pretty stringent study that's going to give us a really good idea of what's going on in terms of not only signs and symptoms in this population, but really importantly, what's going on in from an endoscopic perspective."

The relative correlation between what you see in the mucosal and signs and symptoms and real healing has been an area of major debate, particularly in Crohn's disease, much clear when you see. And Crohn's disease has been an area of major debate. There's a couple of recent review articles looking at all the data that are out there that's sort of provide a good picture. The only correlation that has the sort of a rhythm that I'm aware of, that you can see it, if you get control from a signs and symptoms perspective early, and you start to see some improvements in the mucosa, it generally leads to a positive effect when you get out to week 52. And so that's basically what we're looking for our new Crohn's treatment. Signs and symptoms, significant remissions and signs that it's actually starting to work at the early time points, seeing endoscopic response or endoscopic improvements, and those things together yield a high or probability of a patient being in long-term remission and getting through endoscopic healing at those longer time points."

So, I think, we believe that our treatment of strategic collaboration transactions where the portion of an upfront is related to the acquisition of rights is excluded from non-GAAP is appropriate. The acquisition of rights is unique to the formation of the collaboration, it's very strategic and it's not part of our ongoing operations. Of course, subsequently after that transaction -- collaboration is formed, all other ongoing operating costs of the collaboration, whether they'd be development cost, they'd be milestones, they'd be royalties, cocommercialization, all the ongoing operational activities that we do together with our collaborator are included in our non-GAAP presentation. So I think that's the way we've always through about it. It's very hard to forecast strategic transactions. It's something where I don't think many companies talk about what M&A deals they are going to do next year or what collaboration activity they're going to do. And there are many, many reasons that we can talk about in terms of how to think about this and how it makes sense, but in the interest of time now since we're almost on the hour, I won't drag it through all that at this point, but in the interest of time, our approach has been consistent for many years. It's not uncommon across the industry. Many companies have the same approach and importantly, we're fully transparent on all the factors we have in our GAAP to non-GAAP presentation, and we've always been. And so anybody who wants to particularly look at it slightly differently, certainly, is able to do that and that's fine. So at this point really, we feel we're right on track with where we've been."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an outstanding third quarter and are excited to review and discuss the results with you, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our confidence and optimism in our future. During the quarter, our global therapeutic franchises continued to build strong demand momentum for our major cancer and immunology products. The value proposition these therapies bring to patients, physicians and providers, combined with exceptional execution, led to a meaningful acceleration in sales, allowing us to again raise our full year 2016 guidance and provide an update to our 2017 outlook. Following my comments, Peter will review these numbers and the drivers of our financial performance. 
In addition to providing their insights about our commercial results, Michael and Scott will review the progress we are making at advancing several major late-stage programs in their franchises. Important new and updated clinical information supporting these programs was recently presented, especially study results that continue to demonstrate the transformative potential of both GED-0301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. They will also preview the range of data we expect to be published or presented at major medical meetings during the fourth quarter. 
I'd like to again thank many of you and your colleagues for joining us at the September investor deep dive into one of Celgene's core areas of research expertise, protein homeostasis. We are at the forefront of research aimed at understanding and manipulating the biological pathways within cells that control the function and degradation of proteins implicated in cancer and inflammatory diseases. The early programs that are emerging from this important scientific platform, combined with our internal discovery efforts in immuno-oncology, inflammation, epigenetics and with external collaboration partners, are increasing our opportunities to discover and develop more best-in-class or first-in-class molecules. 
Our novel approach to drug discovery, complementing organic expertise with a network of collaboration partners, is delivering. Working together, we have filed 8 investigational new drug applications this year while continuing to invest in discovery platforms with a potential to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients with serious diseases. 
At this time every year, our executive leadership team comes together for an in-depth review of our long-range strategic plan. We conducted our 2016 review just last week. In addition to reaffirming Celgene's mission and purpose, we reinforced our understanding of and confidence in the robust opportunities we have for sustained high growth. The momentum of our existing products, the potential of our pipeline and broad collaboration network and the innovation and execution of our high-performing teams are key drivers of our optimism. 
We also focused on our financial strategies to ensure we are investing in research, commercial, business development and capital structure programs that have the greatest potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients and to generate long-term shareholder value. Our business model creates the most value for all stakeholders when we invent medicines that improve and extend the lives of patients today while we invest in therapies that may cure patients in the future. 
Our principled approach to pricing innovative therapies is driven by the value they deliver to patients and the health care systems. At Celgene, we continuously seek to work collaboratively with providers, payers, patient advocacy organizations and governments to maximize patient access and ensure that incentives exist to encourage research that improves outcomes and ultimately, that lowers the total cost of health care around the world. Discovering and developing medicines that have clearly differentiated benefits for patients has and always will determine the level of our success. 
Before opening the call for your questions, Jackie will provide her perspective on our operating performance, business drivers, strategic positioning and the exceptional potential we have for long-term growth. We are incredibly energized by our year-to-date progress, and I'd like to thank my colleagues across all functions and around the world for their committed efforts on behalf of patients we serve today and the patients we seek to serve in the future. 
Thank you, and please help me welcome Peter to the call."
258769,403588380,1062993,"Celgene Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Celgene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. While Q3 was another exceptional quarter driven by strong operating performance across the organization, the continued commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the th",627,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. While Q3 was another exceptional quarter driven by strong operating performance across the organization, the continued commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the third consecutive quarter. Due to the strong positioning of our products within the marketplace, we expect this increased momentum to continue into next year, and we now expect to achieve the high end of the previously revised 2017 range for total product sales and adjusted earnings per share. We are delivering this level of financial performance while we advance our pipeline and make strategic investments to access external innovation, all of which positions the company to grow through 2020 and well beyond. 
Turning to the quarter. Total net product sales in Q3 were over $2.9 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, a significant acceleration versus Q3 growth rates in the prior 2 years. Consistent with prior periods, our growth was predominantly volume-driven as product volume grew 25%. The contribution to growth from price remains relatively small and can fluctuate in any given period due to the timing of pricing actions throughout the year. 
Now the third quarter benefited from approximately $70 million in tender offer sales of REVLIMID to Russia. Excluding these Russian purchases, total net product sales still grew 25% year-over-year. Please recall that last year, the Russian orders occurred in the second and fourth quarters. And for your modeling, we do not anticipate any Russian tender business in the fourth quarter. What is clear is that REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA are having outstanding years and are greatly expanding usage. Now Michael and Scott will share their perspectives on this strong underlying volume growth and the demand drivers for these products later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.58, a year-on-year growth of 28%. Operating income accounted for the entire increase in earnings. Below operating income, the benefit from a lower diluted share count was offset by a full quarter of interest expense related to the debt issued to acquire Receptos in August last year and a higher tax rate due to geographic mix. 
Our operating model remains flexible and aligned with our strategic direction. During 2016, we have continued to increase our R&D investment as we support our growing pipeline and research efforts. At the same time, we have leveraged our global commercial infrastructure despite increasing coverage of our international I&I sales organization. The net result is a continued improvement in the adjusted operating margin of 80 basis points in Q3 and a 200 basis point improvement year-to-date when compared to prior period. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now we continue to balance deploying capital between our share repurchase program and strategic transactions to access external innovation such as the EngMab deal.  Striking the right balance is critical as we prioritize our strategic initiatives to position the company to growth for the next decade. For the first 9 months, we repurchased $2 billion in common stock and entered into 6 strategic transactions. 
In summary, the business is performing very well. The year-to-date operating momentum places us on track this year to achieve sales of approximately $11.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $5.58 and $5.92 per share. This implies a fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS growth rate in the range of 31% to 35%. So as you can see, we expect the earnings momentum to continue right through the year-end. For 2017, we are now on track to achieve the high end of our previously revised ranges for total net product sales and adjusted earnings per share. So really, a great quarter. 
I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael."

In addition, w",1502,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Q3 2016 was another great quarter for Hematology & Oncology. My sincere thanks to our teams worldwide for an outstanding performance, with impressive growth in key brands and across geographies. In addition, we made robust progress with key development programs for multiple pipeline assets. 
We had a record performance in Q3, with 24% year-over-year and 8% sequential revenue growth. REVLIMID and demand growth continues in launched countries, and we have secured reimbursement in most key markets, though we have not yet had a full year of revenues in many European markets. 
POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow, and IMNOVID-based triplet combination is increasing utilization, driving share and duration. ABRAXANE is maintaining its positioning in the U.S., with stable market shares in breast, lung and pancreatic cancer and is growing outside the U.S. in pancreatic cancer. 
We made significant progress on our pipeline during the quarter. We expect to submit a new drug application to FDA for AG-221 in relapsed/refractory AML by year-end. We have further advanced our CC-122 program in a variety of diseases, and our FUSION program for durvalumab continues to enroll 6 trials in hematologic diseases. 
Our luspatercept and CC-486 programs enrolled well into [ph] pivotal programs in myeloid malignancies. Through our recent acquisition of EngMab and the lead molecule EM901, Celgene is now uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development opportunities using 2 key platforms: CAR T and CD-3-redirected killing. Our teams are diligently preparing for the upcoming ASH Congress in San Diego. We expect to have a robust set of starter [ph] presentations across both our in-line brands and pipeline assets. 
REVLIMID had an outstanding third quarter, with 30% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue growth, reflecting strong underlying demand across the globe. The ongoing NDMM launch provides significant market share gains in key markets where we have reimbursements. In addition, we secured NDMM reimbursement for Italy in September. We expect to have reimbursement in Switzerland by the end of the year and in France, by Q1 2017. Duration continues to increase in all geographies. 
REVLIMID benefits from a stream of positive starter, [ph] including another New England Journal of Medicine publication, the POLLUX trial. As a reminder, the starter for our [ph] daratumumab  in relapsed/refractory myeloma demonstrates an estimated progression-free survival for the combination of well over 40 months. Coupled with the FDA breakthrough starters for our [ph] daratumumab for treatment in relapsed/refractory myeloma, we are optimistic about a major growth opportunity ahead for REVLIMID. 
In addition, we have submitted applications to the FDA and EMA for REVLIMID as maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after receiving autologous stem-cell transplantation. The FDA has provided the application with a Priority Review designation and a PDUFA date of February 24, 2017. The decision of the European authority is expected in the first half of 2017. 
Furthermore, we are excited about the REVLIMID myeloma data to be presented at ASH this year, including final overall survival data for MM-020 and key analysis for Myeloma XI. This trial, conducted by the MRC study group in the U.K., randomized more than 3,800 transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed myeloma patients and is the largest myeloma study to date. REVLIMID has been investigated both in the induction and maintenance setting, and respective results will be presented at the Congress. 
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered strong growth, with 33% year-over-year and 7% sequential growth. Most launched markets have achieved leadership positions in the third-line-plus patient segment, and duration continues to grow. POMALYST/IMNOVID demand continues to grow in spite of some competitive pressure in the fourth-line-plus patient segment with the launch of daratumumab. We have seen overall demand increase due to the use of POMALYST in triplet combination, including in combination with daratumumab. NCCN guidelines were recently updated to include 3 POMALYST-based triplets for relapsed/refractory myeloma. In addition, FDA has recently granted standard review to daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma with a PDUFA date in June 2017. 
During the third quarter, we received EMA approval for an IMNOVID label update for patients with renal impairment, facilitating the use of pomalidomide in this difficult-to-treat patient population. We expect all of these growth drivers to lead to share and duration gains in the future. 
We are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID to further support the use of multiple combination. Our Phase III OPTIMISMM trial in combination with bortezomib and second or later treatment line is on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017. 
ABRAXANE continues to have stable performance. ABRAXANE grew 1% year-over-year, with growth coming from outside of the United States. U.S. ABRAXANE maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and demand is stable in breast and lung cancer in spite of the underlying competitive dynamics. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 5% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter, driven by pancreatic cancer in markets with reimbursement, including Germany, Spain and Italy. 
ABRAXANE has generated additional impact for data in difficult-to-treat solid tumors. Data from multiple studies evaluating the use of ABRAXANE alone, in standard combination or in combination with mobile agents in pancreatic cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer were presented during the ESMO meeting in October. We plan to present the results of the ABRAXANE randomized Phase II tnAcity trial in first-line triple-negative breast cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. Data from the ABRAXANE ABOUND lung cancer study will be presented at the World Congress on Lung Cancer in December. And we are awaiting the results of the ongoing pivotal ABRAXANE dicentric  [ph] combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. 
Additional surge in [ph] data will be presented at several key congresses by year-end. In addition to the Myeloma XI and MM-020 studies that are already mentioned, data presentations at the forthcoming ASH Congress in San Diego include our REMARC study of REVLIMID maintenance in elderly first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. Data for REVLIMID maintenance in CLL from the CONTINUUM trial and interim analysis of our R2 [ph] MAGNIFY study in indolent lymphoma as well as CC-122, CD20 combination data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and indolent lymphoma. In addition, a number of our collaboration partners will be presenting data on early and mid-stage assets. 
As I noted earlier, we'll have key ABRAXANE presentations at the World Congress on Lung Cancer and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium before year-end. We are also very excited about the very encouraging Phase I Marizomib data in combination with avastin in glioblastoma to be presented by our partner, Triphase, at the Society for Neuro-Oncology in November. 
In addition to the excellent performance of our in-line brands, we are making very good progress in advancing our early- and later-stage pipeline. The luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron continues to advance. Our 2 Phase III trials in low-risk MDS and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia are enrolling extremely well. And we are actively engaged in planning to further maximize the opportunity of the asset in additional patient segments and indications. We are making progress with our I/O pipeline and [ph] CD19 and BCMA and CAR-T programs with our partners Juno and bluebird bio. We received an EMA PRIME designation for the development of JAK 15 [ph] in adult relapsed/refractory ALL in Europe, which may enable accelerated development and approval. 
The FUSION program is advancing, evaluating durvalumab in combination with key in-line brands and mobile agents. We expect data readouts to begin in early 2017. 
Our recent acquisition of EngMab and the lead molecule EM901 further complements our industry-leading portfolio and pipeline of myeloma assets. We see B-cell maturation antigen, BCMA, as an ideal target for immune-based therapies such as CAR-T and CD-3-redirected killing. Celgene is uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development opportunities using both platforms, which we view as highly complementary. 
In addition to monotherapy, both platforms provide the opportunity for rational combination therapies with our CELMoDs and checkpoint inhibitors in order to further improve treatment efficacy as well as for clinical development in other BCMA expressing B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma. 
Finally, we are aggressively pursuing our protein homeostasis pipeline. The CC-122 program is enrolling multiple proof-of-concept studies in myeloma, lymphoma, CLL and hepatocellular carcinoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. The data obtained will allow us to start making pivotal decisions in the first half of 2017. 
In addition, and as highlighted at our research meeting in New York earlier this month, our new AML CELMoD, CC-90009, has progressed into Phase I. And we have identified additional CELMoD successor compounds with high potential in various hematological malignancies. 
In summary, our Hematology & Oncology franchise has had another outstanding quarter. Our key brands have delivered strong financial performance, and the momentum gives us the confidence to raise our outlook for 2016 and 2017. Our early- and late-stage clinical programs have advanced nicely during the quarter, and the acquisition of EngMab is a perfect fit for our myeloma and lymphoma pipeline. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Q3 was an important quarter for I&I, full of advancement for both our marketed and pipeline assets. With OTEZLA, we've seen revenue continue to accelerate throughout the quarter, with growth in both psoriasis and PSA indications, as demand, market share and persistency continue to increase. At the same time, we have expanded the global access footprint for OTEZLA. As of this month, reimbursement for OTEZLA has now been achieved in 20 countries worldwide. 
In Q3, we advanced development of our pipeline programs, progressing multiple asset assets through important milestones. 
Turning now to OTEZLA. Global net sales in Q3 were $275 million. This represents a 98% year-on-year increase. Sales in Q3 continued to grow despite the regular market declines in prescribing typically seen in the summer months. While we remain focused on the launch execution in Germany and other early launch markets, we were able to achieve critical reimbursement decisions from several key European markets. NICE granted a positive opinion for OTEZLA in psoriasis, which reverses previous guidance and enables access for patients in England and Wales. With multiple positive reimbursement decisions in hand, we are now preparing to execute the next wave of launches in the EU. 
Focusing now on the U.S. market dynamics. The physician consumer campaigns continue to drive increases in demand for OTEZLA. With the sustained leadership position in new [ph] to brand share, we are seeing a continued rise in market share for OTEZLA, which now represents more than 1/5 of the systemic-treated psoriasis market. Consistent with the OTEZLA value proposition on pricing strategy today, much of this growth is coming from the pre-biologic market segment. 
Last week, the interim results from the GED-0301 CD-001 trial were represented as a late breaker at UEGW meeting in Vienna. These results represented early exploratory look at the data and are part of a broader development program that is well underway. As a reminder, the objective of the study was to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic improvements in a broader, more difficult-to-treat Crohn's population than studied previously. It enrolled 63 patients across 3 active treatment groups. All patients had a confirmed endoscopic damage at [ph] baseline and clinically advanced disease. The CD-001 results are generally consistent with the clinical outcomes seen in the placebo-controlled IGON program and support GED utilization across a broad Crohn's patient population. With the IGON studies, there was compelling evidence to view GED-0301 as a potentially transformational therapy. As an oral treatment with unprecedented rates and clinical response and remission and negligible systemic exposure, it could allow patients to be treated in a fundamentally different way than other therapies in development or on the market. 
In CD-001, with a more heterogeneous population, GED-0301 demonstrated meaningful clinical and endoscopic outcomes across different patient types, including CNS naïve in failures, those with prior surgeries as well as patients with proximal and distal disease. Once confirmed in pivotal programs, we are confident that this product will be transformational for patient care. Data rollout is expected to continue through the rest of the year. The focus of these data will be the 3- and 4-year results from the PALACE and ESTEEM programs, which show a highly differentiated benefit risk profile for OTEZLA relative to other competitive products. Data from positive Phase II studies for RPC4046 in EoE and CC-220 in lupus will also be disseminated. 
Q3 was a quarter full of advancement for Celgene I&I. OTEZLA's share and duration continue to improve, while access gains expand the geographic breadth of the product. OTEZLA is well on track to achieve blockbusters [ph] data from 2016 and in the years to come. 
We moved all major development programs ahead and look forward to multiple upcoming proof-of-concept study readouts, including GED and OTEZLA in the UC, ozanimod in Crohn's disease and CC-220 in cutaneous  lupus. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio. 
Thank you for your attention this morning, and I'd like to turn the call over to Jackie."

Q3 was a fabulous quarter for Celgene. Quarters like this are only made possible by the cumulative hard work of our teams around the world, work that builds over time to produce the top of momentum [ph][ph]  we are currently generating. Our Q3 performance demonstrates we're stronger than ever, and we advanced into 2017 in the coming years in a great position. Our 2016 milestone chart shows us well on track to achieve what we set out to achieve this year, and we feel very good about where we are at this point in the fourth quarter. 
Even though there are only 2 months remaining in the year, there are still exciting data to be presented at ACR, ASH, San Antonio Breast and other medical meetings, so stay tuned for those presentations. 
This year, we started to see data readouts from the Phase III trials in our pipeline. This is just the beginning of a multiyear period, during which we will have readouts on a number of potentially transformative programs. Michael and Scott spoke about some of these. The Phase III trials still to read out over the coming 12 to 24 months give us the potential to see upside for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapies, to expand ABRAXANE's presence in pancreatic cancer, to take REVLIMID into lymphoma, to further expand and diversify our myeloid business, to see the expansion and diversification of our I&I franchise with 2 new compounds, ozanamod and GED-0301 in 2 new therapeutic categories: Multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease, and much more. We will also have Phase II and proof-of-concept data for a number of indications across several compounds, including CC-122, CC-220, lumab, CAR-T, CCE 4046 and daratumumab, and the flow of data will be strong and steady for sometime to come. 
On the commercial side, building on the strong momentum of 2016 and 2017, we look forward to launches across multiple geographies for REVLIMID in the stem cell transplant setting of newly diagnosed myeloma, the U.S. launch of AG-221 in IDH2-mutated AML, the ongoing global uptake of triplet regiments on backbone and the geographic expansion of OTEZLA, including the important market of Japan. These commercial catalysts and the clinical catalyst that highlights give us high confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2017 and 2020 targets and produce strong growth for many years beyond.

So NDMM, there is a very distinct post-transplant opportunity in Europe. So transplantation maintenance has been developed our loss by European investigators, but there is no usage because there is no approved reimbursement at this moment of time so there's a very distinct opportunity. When it comes to the U.S., there is usage-driven by the data, but I can remind you as to what happened with our NDMM launch in elderly patient. So once we have the launch and the opportunity to really talk about it and educate, the market shares and duration went up, and we're going to see the same thing happening in U.S. So in this situation. So it's an opportunity for both sides of the Atlantic, although I would say the opportunity for Europe is probably slightly bigger. So that's the first part of the question. For the second part, you're right, and talking about treatment duration, you just have to think about kind of where we are with progression-free survival with the triplet combination. At this moment of time, those which are approved already provide anything between 20 to 28 months. Our current treatment duration in U.S. is 18 months. And then you have the trial that was recently published in the New England Journal of medicine, where we are talking about progression-free survival of 40 to 50 months. Treatment duration needs a little bit of time to build up, and that's the point that I wanted to make. Once a drug is available and the clinical data is there and the approval is there, it needs a little bit of time to build up. So we need to go beyond the 18 months. I think when you look at our results, we already see kind of the impact of the treatment duration really impacting very positively with our new label in transplant-eligible NDMM and with the data, we think this is going to accelerate even further."

So we -- and by the way, the overall survival data and the data is really driving that, and we're happy to be in and able to provide an update of this data at ASH so you can all look at this. As a consequence, the price reductions that you have to have in some European markets, not in all, but in some, with a new label were absolutely moderate and 100% in line with our expectation. Of course, there is this trend in the U.S. where you can maintain a price or increase a price upon value proposition. And in Europe, payers are driving you down, so the trends, of course, prices in U.S. and Europe are actually not the same. What I can tell you is that we are extremely happy with the speed, but then also with the appreciation support that we got payers in the NDMM situation in here."

And I think the right way if answering it is just reminding ourselves that there is when we're thinking about multiple myeloma, there still segments with a very distinct medical need. So there is absolutely the need to bring better therapies although we see now all these triplet data reading out. When we're thinking about patients relapsing very, very quickly and it's actually expanded [ph] from 5% to 30% after post-REVLIMID and daratumumab, when we're thinking about patients with higher epigenetic features. When we're thinking patients collapsing after daratumumab pomalidomide. There's many patient segments that even with the available current therapies, are really not doing well. That's the first point that I wanted to make. The second point, BCMA's really a great target. It's selectively expressed. It's almost expressed in 100% of the multiple myeloma patients. It start really a deal target for immune therapies. And having both platforms available, which is CART redirected killing gives us really the opportunity to start thinking about treatment sequence. So you could think about using one earlier and the other one later, using it as a patient thinking about induction therapy or if a patient relapses after one, you can use the other one. And then there is a third element that I think is very important. CAR-T is not for everyone. CAR-T is for younger patients, and there will be some reimbursement questions around CAR-T, so you're really happy then if you have an antibody with your portfolio going against the same target. And then finally, I just wanted to make this remark apart from having both, we really have very distinct combination opportunities. We will be able to combine with. We will be able to combine with checkpoint inhibitors. Everything we have in our portfolio is extremely complementary, so we feel extremely good about that."

So I think there was a lot of really important learnings for those at ESMO and coming back. I think the way to look at the space at this moment of time is that there is a rather small and well-defined population if high express in PDL-1 that is going to be treated with monotherapy. Everybody else is meeting a combination, and there's an option of treating those patients either with I/O I/O combinations or with I/O chemo combination. When I'm looking at the data and I'm talking to key opinion leaders there's a little bit of sentiment to say very low or no PDL-1 that could be a preference for chemotherapy. And of course, the data from the larger study has to play out at the end of the day, and there will be some overlap between those segments and the usage of both. But I think what's definitely worth to be said is that at ESMO, the combination of chemo and I/O was absolutely strengthened. We think we are extremely well positioned with that. The data that we've been showing with ABRAXANE and are extremely positive, and we're looking forward to having our data being read out."

Approximately 90% of patients are coming to OTEZLA therapy from something other than a biologic. So they're either switching off an oral, switching off or coming on to OTEZLA from nothing and and only 10% are coming on from a biologic therapy. In terms of duration, what we're seeing is duration of 1 year, which looks at the high biologic range. And so we feel very good about that duration. Certainly, well above what you see for other oral compounds in the space. So the duration therapy actually looks quite good. One thing from the clinical studies that is very heartening to me and there's some 4-year data, which will come out in a little while, and that says that 65% of the patients who finished 1 year in the clinical trial were still on drug for [ph] years, which is really impressive and these are in PSA studies, which is really unprecedented relative to data from any other competitor or any other clinical trial. So the compliance is good for through 1 year. I can't -- I don't have the commercial experience to say what it looks like for 2 years or 3 years because we don't have the data yet.

And I just wanted to once again say the usage and the approval is driven up on overall survival data that we've been generating from multiple studies and the bar here is 2.5 years in overall survival benefit.

There's multiple opportunities. But I would make the argument that also in the foreseeable future, if you're an elderly frail patient or if you're a patient, doublets remain a very attractive option. So that's the first point I wanted to make. Coming to the second part down my point of your question, we really think that REVLIMID and thalidomide are really great drugs. We really are compelled by the New England publication that we've been seeing in the New England Journal of medicine. Even when you look at the best available data, and I was trying to say this, 25% to 30% of patients even daratumumab are relapsing after 6 to 12 months. There is extremely limited options if a patient is relapsing after daratumumab or after pomalidomide. And the overall survival of patients with high risk such as genetic features despite all these new available therapies is still only 3 or 4 years. That's very bad. That's absolutely not good enough. We can be patient population very clearly. We can find them clinically. We can to find them molecularly, and this is exactly where we want to test our new and we feel extremely good about that."

So when we're looking at the pomalidomide duration both in U.S. and Europe steadily increasing. what I can share with you is that the treatment duration in U.S. is now over 10 months. A lot of that is driven by 2 factors: a, the use combinatory therapy. There's a lot of data available. guidance have recently been updated, and there's going to be by the way, increasing use, as you heard, pomalidomide daratumumab submitted to the FDA and PDUFA date available. So that's one element driving pomalidomide duration, the usage in combination. The other element is the increasing usage earlier in therapy. So if you use REVLIMID either in combination, as I was trying to say earlier, in patients are relapsing afterwards, you won't have another triplet right after again with and another combination partner. And that's exactly what we are seeing. And I think the great performance of pomalidomide that we had in the third quarter is really a reflection of exactly that."

And I think CD 47 plays extremely nicely into this old building toolbox that we have having an ability to really activate macrophages. So we see this in the context of building our I/O pipeline. That's number one. And of course, we were trying to test it very broadly. We're starting in acute AML.

The triplet usage in U.S. is, of course, already broader in Europe, you always have to take this the reimbursement hurdle. But triplets are increasingly also reimbursed in Europe. So where we see a really steep increase at this moment in time isn't over that in combination of REVLIMID and dexamethasone with Velcade based upon the data of 777, the first-line study that has been presented roundabout a year ago. And just to remind everybody, compared with alone 12 months overall survival benefit. So that's quite a lot. There's a lot of usage of this combination, not just in an elderly population. That's what we see, but and also certainly in the induction setting. What makes this very compelling and when we're thinking about Europe is certainly the fact that at a certain time point, Velcade is going to become generics so we have a very well-tolerated, very effective triplet, which may come along with a very reasonable cost. We're putting a lot of effort behind this combination. And then of course, there is the combination of and I just wanted to point it out once again because the New England Journal of Medicine was so nice. Daratumumab combination 40 to 50 months progression-free survival. That's going to drive our treatment duration big time, and we see that catalyst, again starting in the U.S., but I have no doubt that it also going to come to Europe."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an outstanding third quarter and are excited to review and discuss the results with you, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our confidence and optimism in our future. During the quarter, our global therapeutic franchises continued to build strong demand momentum for our major cancer and immunology products. The value proposition these therapies bring to patients, physicians and providers, combined with exceptional execution, led to a meaningful acceleration in sales, allowing us to again raise our full year 2016 guidance and provide an update to our 2017 outlook. Following my comments, Peter will review these numbers and the drivers of our financial performance. 
In addition to providing their insights about our commercial results, Michael and Scott will review the progress we are making at advancing several major late-stage programs in their franchises. Important new and updated clinical information supporting these programs was recently presented, especially study results that continue to demonstrate the transformative potential of both GED-0301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. They will also preview the range of data we expect to be published or presented at major medical meetings during the fourth quarter. 
I'd like to again thank many of you and your colleagues for joining us at the September investor deep dive into one of Celgene's core areas of research expertise, protein homeostasis. We are at the forefront of research aimed at understanding and manipulating the biological pathways within cells that control the function and degradation of proteins implicated in cancer and inflammatory diseases. The early programs that are emerging from this important scientific platform, combined with our internal discovery efforts in immuno-oncology, inflammation, epigenetics and with external collaboration partners, are increasing our opportunities to discover and develop more best-in-class or first-in-class molecules. 
Our novel approach to drug discovery, complementing organic expertise with a network of collaboration partners, is delivering. Working together, we have filed 8 investigational new drug applications this year while continuing to invest in discovery platforms with a potential to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients with serious diseases. 
At this time every year, our executive leadership team comes together for an in-depth review of our long-range strategic plan. We conducted our 2016 review just last week. In addition to reaffirming Celgene's mission and purpose, we reinforced our understanding of and confidence in the robust opportunities we have for sustained high growth. The momentum of our existing products, the potential of our pipeline and broad collaboration network and the innovation and execution of our high-performing teams are key drivers of our optimism. 
We also focused on our financial strategies to ensure we are investing in research, commercial, business development and capital structure programs that have the greatest potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients and to generate long-term shareholder value. Our business model creates the most value for all stakeholders when we invent medicines that improve and extend the lives of patients today while we invest in therapies that may cure patients in the future. 
Our principled approach to pricing innovative therapies is driven by the value they deliver to patients and the health care systems. At Celgene, we continuously seek to work collaboratively with providers, payers, patient advocacy organizations and governments to maximize patient access and ensure that incentives exist to encourage research that improves outcomes and ultimately, that lowers the total cost of health care around the world. Discovering and developing medicines that have clearly differentiated benefits for patients has and always will determine the level of our success. 
Before opening the call for your questions, Jackie will provide her perspective on our operating performance, business drivers, strategic positioning and the exceptional potential we have for long-term growth. We are incredibly energized by our year-to-date progress, and I'd like to thank my colleagues across all functions and around the world for their committed efforts on behalf of patients we serve today and the patients we seek to serve in the future. 
Thank you, and please help me welcome Peter to the call."

While Q3 was another exceptional quarter driven by strong operating performance across the organization, the continued commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the th",627,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. While Q3 was another exceptional quarter driven by strong operating performance across the organization, the continued commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the third consecutive quarter. Due to the strong positioning of our products within the marketplace, we expect this increased momentum to continue into next year, and we now expect to achieve the high end of the previously revised 2017 range for total product sales and adjusted earnings per share. We are delivering this level of financial performance while we advance our pipeline and make strategic investments to access external innovation, all of which positions the company to grow through 2020 and well beyond. 
Turning to the quarter. Total net product sales in Q3 were over $2.9 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, a significant acceleration versus Q3 growth rates in the prior 2 years. Consistent with prior periods, our growth was predominantly volume-driven as product volume grew 25%. The contribution to growth from price remains relatively small and can fluctuate in any given period due to the timing of pricing actions throughout the year. 
Now the third quarter benefited from approximately $70 million in tender offer sales of REVLIMID to Russia. Excluding these Russian purchases, total net product sales still grew 25% year-over-year. Please recall that last year, the Russian orders occurred in the second and fourth quarters. And for your modeling, we do not anticipate any Russian tender business in the fourth quarter. What is clear is that REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA are having outstanding years and are greatly expanding usage. Now Michael and Scott will share their perspectives on this strong underlying volume growth and the demand drivers for these products later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.58, a year-on-year growth of 28%. Operating income accounted for the entire increase in earnings. Below operating income, the benefit from a lower diluted share count was offset by a full quarter of interest expense related to the debt issued to acquire Receptos in August last year and a higher tax rate due to geographic mix. 
Our operating model remains flexible and aligned with our strategic direction. During 2016, we have continued to increase our R&D investment as we support our growing pipeline and research efforts. At the same time, we have leveraged our global commercial infrastructure despite increasing coverage of our international I&I sales organization. The net result is a continued improvement in the adjusted operating margin of 80 basis points in Q3 and a 200 basis point improvement year-to-date when compared to prior period. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now we continue to balance deploying capital between our share repurchase program and strategic transactions to access external innovation such as the EngMab deal. Striking the right balance is critical as we prioritize our strategic initiatives to position the company to growth for the next decade. For the first 9 months, we repurchased $2 billion in common stock and entered into 6 strategic transactions. 
In summary, the business is performing very well. The year-to-date operating momentum places us on track this year to achieve sales of approximately $11.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $5.58 and $5.92 per share. This implies a fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS growth rate in the range of 31% to 35%. So as you can see, we expect the earnings momentum to continue right through the year-end. For 2017, we are now on track to achieve the high end of our previously revised ranges for total net product sales and adjusted earnings per share. So really, a great quarter. 
I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael."

My sincere thanks to our teams worldwide for an outstanding performance, with impressive growth in key brands and across geographies. In addition, we made robust progress with key development programs for multiple pipeline assets. 
We had a record performance in Q3, with 24% year-over-year and 8% sequential revenue growth. REVLIMID and demand growth continues in launched countries, and we have secured reimbursement in most key markets, though we have not yet had a full year of revenues in many European markets. 
POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow, and IMNOVID-based triplet combination is increasing utilization, driving share and duration. ABRAXANE is maintaining its positioning in the U.S., with stable market shares in breast, lung and pancreatic cancer and is growing outside the U.S. in pancreatic cancer. 
We made significant progress on our pipeline during the quarter. We expect to submit a new drug application to FDA for AG-221 in relapsed/refractory AML by year-end. We have further advanced our CC-122 program in a variety of diseases, and our FUSION program for durvalumab continues to enroll 6 trials in hematologic diseases. 
Our luspatercept and CC-486 programs enrolled well into pivotal programs in myeloid malignancies. Through our recent acquisition of EngMab and the lead molecule EM901, Celgene is now uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development opportunities using 2 key platforms: CAR T and CD-3-redirected killing. Our teams are diligently preparing for the upcoming ASH Congress in San Diego. We expect to have a robust set of starter presentations across both our in-line brands and pipeline assets. 
REVLIMID had an outstanding third quarter, with 30% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue growth, reflecting strong underlying demand across the globe. The ongoing NDMM launch provides significant market share gains in key markets where we have reimbursements. In addition, we secured NDMM reimbursement for Italy in September. We expect to have reimbursement in Switzerland by the end of the year and in France, by Q1 2017. Duration continues to increase in all geographies. 
REVLIMID benefits from a stream of positive starter, including another New England Journal of Medicine publication, the POLLUX trial. As a reminder, the starter for Rd plus daratumumab in relapsed/refractory myeloma demonstrates an estimated progression-free survival for the combination of well over 40 months. Coupled with the FDA breakthrough starters for Rd plus daratumumab for treatment in relapsed/refractory myeloma, we are optimistic about a major growth opportunity ahead for REVLIMID. 
In addition, we have submitted applications to the FDA and EMA for REVLIMID as maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after receiving autologous stem-cell transplantation. The FDA has provided the application with a Priority Review designation and a PDUFA date of February 24, 2017. The decision of the European authority is expected in the first half of 2017. 
Furthermore, we are excited about the REVLIMID myeloma data to be presented at ASH this year, including final overall survival data for MM-020 and key analysis for Myeloma XI. This trial, conducted by the MRC study group in the U.K., randomized more than 3,800 transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed myeloma patients and is the largest myeloma study to date. REVLIMID has been investigated both in the induction and maintenance setting, and respective results will be presented at the Congress. 
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered strong growth, with 33% year-over-year and 7% sequential growth. Most launched markets have achieved leadership positions in the third-line-plus patient segment, and duration continues to grow. POMALYST/IMNOVID demand continues to grow in spite of some competitive pressure in the fourth-line-plus patient segment with the launch of daratumumab. We have seen overall demand increase due to the use of POMALYST in triplet combination, including in combination with daratumumab. NCCN guidelines were recently updated to include 3 POMALYST-based triplets for relapsed/refractory myeloma. In addition, FDA has recently granted standard review to daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma with a PDUFA date in June 2017. 
During the third quarter, we received EMA approval for an IMNOVID label update for patients with renal impairment, facilitating the use of pomalidomide in this difficult-to-treat patient population. We expect all of these growth drivers to lead to share and duration gains in the future. 
We are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID to further support the use of multiple combination. Our Phase III OPTIMISMM trial in combination with bortezomib and second or later treatment line is on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017. 
ABRAXANE continues to have stable performance. ABRAXANE grew 1% year-over-year, with growth coming from outside of the United States. U.S. ABRAXANE maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and demand is stable in breast and lung cancer in spite of the underlying competitive dynamics. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 5% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter, driven by pancreatic cancer in markets with reimbursement, including Germany, Spain and Italy. 
ABRAXANE has generated additional impact for data in difficult-to-treat solid tumors. Data from multiple studies evaluating the use of ABRAXANE alone, in standard combination or in combination with mobile agents in pancreatic cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer were presented during the ESMO meeting in October. We plan to present the results of the ABRAXANE randomized Phase II tnAcity trial in first-line triple-negative breast cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. Data from the ABRAXANE ABOUND lung cancer study will be presented at the World Congress on Lung Cancer in December. And we are awaiting the results of the ongoing pivotal ABRAXANE dicentric combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. 
Additional Celgene data will be presented at several key congresses by year-end. In addition to the Myeloma XI and MM-020 studies that are already mentioned, data presentations at the forthcoming ASH Congress in San Diego include our REMARC study of REVLIMID maintenance in elderly first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. Data for REVLIMID maintenance in CLL from the CONTINUUM trial and interim analysis of our R2 MAGNIFY study in indolent lymphoma as well as CC-122, CD20 combination data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and indolent lymphoma. In addition, a number of our collaboration partners will be presenting data on early and mid-stage assets. 
As I noted earlier, we'll have key ABRAXANE presentations at the World Congress on Lung Cancer and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium before year-end. We are also very excited about the very encouraging Phase I Marizomib data in combination with Avastin in glioblastoma to be presented by our partner, Triphase, at the Society for Neuro-Oncology in November. 
In addition to the excellent performance of our in-line brands, we are making very good progress in advancing our early- and later-stage pipeline. The luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron continues to advance. Our 2 Phase III trials in low-risk MDS and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia are enrolling extremely well. And we are actively engaged in planning to further maximize the opportunity of the asset in additional patient segments and indications. We are making progress with our I/O pipeline and CD19 and BCMA and CAR-T programs with our partners Juno and bluebird bio. We received an EMA PRIME designation for the development of JAK 15 [ph] in adult relapsed/refractory ALL in Europe, which may enable accelerated development and approval. 
The FUSION program is advancing, evaluating durvalumab in combination with key in-line brands and mobile agents. We expect data readouts to begin in early 2017. 
Our recent acquisition of EngMab and the lead molecule EM901 further complements our industry-leading portfolio and pipeline of myeloma assets. We see B-cell maturation antigen, BCMA, as an ideal target for immune-based therapies such as CAR-T and CD-3-redirected killing. Celgene is uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development opportunities using both platforms, which we view as highly complementary. 
In addition to monotherapy, both platforms provide the opportunity for rational combination therapies with our CELMoDs and checkpoint inhibitors in order to further improve treatment efficacy as well as for clinical development in other BCMA expressing B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma. 
Finally, we are aggressively pursuing our protein homeostasis pipeline. The CC-122 program is enrolling multiple proof-of-concept studies in myeloma, lymphoma, CLL and hepatocellular carcinoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. The data obtained will allow us to start making pivotal decisions in the first half of 2017. 
In addition, and as highlighted at our research meeting in New York earlier this month, our new AML CELMoD, CC-90009, has progressed into Phase I. And we have identified additional CELMoD successor compounds with high potential in various hematological malignancies. 
In summary, our Hematology & Oncology franchise has had another outstanding quarter. Our key brands have delivered strong financial performance, and the momentum gives us the confidence to raise our outlook for 2016 and 2017. Our early- and late-stage clinical programs have advanced nicely during the quarter, and the acquisition of EngMab is a perfect fit for our myeloma and lymphoma pipeline. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Q3 was an important quarter for I&I, full of advancement for both our marketed and pipeline assets. With OTEZLA, we've seen revenue continue to accelerate throughout the quarter, with growth in both psoriasis and PSA",673,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Q3 was an important quarter for I&I, full of advancement for both our marketed and pipeline assets. With OTEZLA, we've seen revenue continue to accelerate throughout the quarter, with growth in both psoriasis and PSA indications, as demand, market share and persistency continue to increase. At the same time, we have expanded the global access footprint for OTEZLA. As of this month, reimbursement for OTEZLA has now been achieved in 20 countries worldwide. 
In Q3, we advanced development of our pipeline programs, progressing multiple asset assets through important milestones. 
Turning now to OTEZLA. Global net sales in Q3 were $275 million. This represents a 98% year-on-year increase. Sales in Q3 continued to grow despite the regular market declines in prescribing typically seen in the summer months. While we remain focused on the launch execution in Germany and other early launch markets, we were able to achieve critical reimbursement decisions from several key European markets. NICE granted a positive opinion for OTEZLA in psoriasis, which reverses previous guidance and enables access for patients in England and Wales. With multiple positive reimbursement decisions in hand, we are now preparing to execute the next wave of launches in the EU. 
Focusing now on the U.S. market dynamics. The physician consumer campaigns continue to drive increases in demand for OTEZLA. With the sustained leadership position in new to brand share, we are seeing a continued rise in market share for OTEZLA, which now represents more than 1/5 of the systemic-treated psoriasis market. Consistent with the OTEZLA value proposition on pricing strategy today, much of this growth is coming from the pre-biologic market segment. 
Last week, the interim results from the GED-0301 CD-001 trial were represented as a late breaker at UEGW meeting in Vienna. These results represented early exploratory look at the data and are part of a broader development program that is well underway. As a reminder, the objective of the study was to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic improvements in a broader, more difficult-to-treat Crohn's population than studied previously. It enrolled 63 patients across 3 active treatment groups. All patients had a confirmed endoscopic damage at baseline and clinically advanced disease. The CD-001 results are generally consistent with the clinical outcomes seen in the placebo-controlled IGON program and support GED utilization across a broad Crohn's patient population. With the IGON studies, there was compelling evidence to view GED-0301 as a potentially transformational therapy. As an oral treatment with unprecedented rates and clinical response and remission and negligible systemic exposure, it could allow patients to be treated in a fundamentally different way than other therapies in development or on the market. 
In CD-001, with a more heterogeneous population, GED-0301 demonstrated meaningful clinical and endoscopic outcomes across different patient types, including CNS naïve in failures, those with prior surgeries as well as patients with proximal and distal disease. Once confirmed in pivotal programs, we are confident that this product will be transformational for patient care. Data rollout is expected to continue through the rest of the year. The focus of these data will be the 3- and 4-year results from the PALACE and ESTEEM programs, which show a highly differentiated benefit risk profile for OTEZLA relative to other competitive products. Data from positive Phase II studies for RPC4046 in EoE and CC-220 in lupus will also be disseminated. 
Q3 was a quarter full of advancement for Celgene I&I. OTEZLA's share and duration continue to improve, while access gains expand the geographic breadth of the product. OTEZLA is well on track to achieve blockbusters data from 2016 and in the years to come. 
We moved all major development programs ahead and look forward to multiple upcoming proof-of-concept study readouts, including GED and OTEZLA in the UC, ozanimod in Crohn's disease and CC-220 in cutaneous lupus. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio.

Our Q3 per",415,"Thank you, Scott. Q3 was a fabulous quarter for Celgene. Quarters like this are only made possible by the cumulative hard work of our teams around the world, work that builds over time to produce the top of momentum we are currently generating. Our Q3 performance demonstrates we are stronger than ever, and we advance into 2017 and the coming years in a great position. Our 2016 milestone chart shows us well on track to achieve what we set out to achieve this year, and we feel very good about where we are at this point in the fourth quarter. 
Even though there are only 2 months remaining in the year, there are still exciting data to be presented at AACR, ASH, San Antonio Breast and other medical meetings, so stay tuned for those presentations. 
This year, we started to see data readouts from the Phase III trials in our pipeline. This is just the beginning of a multiyear period, during which we will have readouts on a number of potentially transformative programs. Michael and Scott spoke about some of these. The Phase III trials still to read out over the coming 12 to 24 months give us the potential to see upside for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapies; to expand ABRAXANE's presence in pancreatic cancer; to take REVLIMID into lymphoma; to further expand and diversify our myeloid business; to see the expansion and diversification of our I&I franchise with 2 new compounds, ozanimod and GED-0301, and 2 new therapeutic categories, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease; and much more. We will also have Phase II and proof-of-concept data for a number of indications across several compounds, including CC-122, CC-220, durvalumab, CAR-T, CC-486 and demcizumab, and the flow of data will be strong and steady for sometime to come. 
On the commercial side, building on the strong momentum of 2016 and 2017, we look forward to launches across multiple geographies for REVLIMID in the stem-cell transplant setting of newly diagnosed myeloma; the U.S. launch of AG-221 in IDH2-mutated AML; the ongoing global uptake of triplet regimens on IMiD backbones; and the geographic expansion of OTEZLA, including the important market of Japan. These commercial catalysts and the clinical catalysts I highlighted give us high confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2017 and 2020 targets and produce strong growth for many years beyond. 
Let me close by thanking our teams around the world for their performance, and thank you for listening to our call today."

So on NDMM, there is a very distinct post-transplant opportunity in Europe. So transplantation maintenance has been developed a lot by European investigators, but there is no usage because there is no approved reimbursement at this moment of time. So there's a very distinct opportunity. When it comes to the U.S., there is usage driven by the data, but I can remind you as to what happened with our NDMM launch in elderly patient. So once we had the launch and the opportunity to really talk about it and educate, the market shares and the duration went up. And we're going to see the same thing happening in the U.S. So -- in this situation. So it's an opportunity for both sides of the Atlantic, although, I would say, the opportunity for Europe is probably slightly bigger. So that's the first part of the question. With the second part, you're right. And talking about treatment duration, you just have to think about kind of where we are with progression-free survival with the triplet combination. At this moment of time, those which are approved already provide anything between 20 to 28 months. Our current treatment duration in the U.S. is 18 months. And then you have the POLLUX trial that was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, where we are talking about progression-free survival of 40 to 50 months. Treatment duration needs a little bit of time to build up, and that's the point that I wanted to make. Once a drug is available and the clinical data is there and approval is there, it needs a little bit of time to build up. So we need to go beyond the 18 months. I think when you look in -- at our results, we already see kind of the impact of the treatment duration really impacting very positively. With our new label in transplant-eligible NDMM and with the POLLUX data, we think this is going to accelerate even further."

The REVLIMID, daratumumab data is actually really intriguing because 40 to 50 months of progression-free survival in relapsed/refractory myeloma is absolutely intriguing. Is that going to have an impact on the overall treatment segment sequence in pomalidomide? Yes, likely. But I think it's going to be in a way that -- especially in the U.S., REVLIMID, daratumumab is going to be quickly taken up the first-line usage as it is such a great regimen. And that allows pomalidomide to then really go into the second-line space and be used immediately after. So if you have a great triplet to start with, you want to have another triplet to go on with.

And I still [indiscernible] kind of also the question that you were just asking. So the treatment duration in Europe is not quite where the U.S. is, and it's understandable because a lot of the duration in the U.S., of course, is driven by this year-long availability of RD in first-line treatment. So in Europe, we are at roundabout 13 to 14 months at this moment of time, increasing foreseeingly with the NDMM launch. And as I said, in the U.S., a first usage, 18 months; and then aggregate use, 24 months. So there's still a really good way to go for Europe, and the NDMM launch is going to absolutely drive this. With your question of NDMM pricing, I think the speed upon which we've been getting the 20 reimbursements in Europe should provide you with confidence that there is a lot of appreciation of the data and the value proposition of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma with payers. So we -- and by the way, the overall survival data and the MM-020 data is really driving that, and we're happy to being able to provide an update of this data at ASH so you can all look at this. As a consequence, the price reductions that you have to have in some European markets, not in all, but in some, with a new label were absolutely moderate and 100% in line with our expectation. Of course, there is this trend in the U.S., where you can maintain the price or increase the price upon value proposition. And in Europe, payers are driving you down. So the trends, of course, of prices in the U.S. and Europe are actually not the same. What I can tell you is that we are extremely happy with the speed, but then also with the appreciation and support that we got by payers in the NDMM situation in Europe."

So what I can share with you and for everybody on the call, so CONTINUUM is a randomized study of REVLIMID maintenance in relapsed CLL post-induction therapy. So we're testing maintenance therapy here. So what I can share with you that is -- the co-primary endpoint, which is progression-free survival, was achieved in CONTINUUM and that the overall survival data is still immature. That said, these data are really going to provide us with very, very important information for the future positioning and investigation of CELMoDs in CLL. And we think that there is a very distinct need for better therapies in CLL, and we think also that CELMoD is an excellent drug class for that purpose. When you're thinking of patients who are relapsing off the ibrutinib, when you think about the really low CR rates and when you're thinking about the very high number of -- and proportion of MLB-positive patients with CLL, there is a distinct need for better therapies. We are very excited in that context about CC-122. We think it has a really differentiated immune profile, and CC-122 is going to be the drug to be moved forward. But CONTINUUM is going to help us to do this in the best possible way. The data that we're going to show with MAGNIFY, which is our R2 study in indolent lymphoma, is an interim analysis. So we'll be able to compare the data, the Phase II data, that has actually led to our programs that is ongoing, our pivotal programs, and confirm those with a much, much bigger patient population that we've been including in MAGNIFY. We feel extremely positive about that, and we'll be going to show the data at ASH."

And I think the right way of answering it is just reminding ourselves that there is -- when we're thinking about multiple myeloma, there's still segments with a very distinct medical need. So there is absolutely the need to bring better therapies, although we see now all these triplet data reading out. When we're thinking about patients who are relapsing very, very quickly and has actually expanded to 5% to 30% after post-REVLIMID and daratumumab when we're thinking about patients with high risk such as genetic features, when we're thinking of patients who are relapsing after daratumumab and pomalidomide. There's many patient segments that under -- even with the available current therapies, are really not doing well. That's the first point that I wanted to make. The second point, BCMA is really a great target. It's selectively expressed. It's almost expressed in 100% of the multiple myeloma patients. It's not a really ideal target for immune therapies. And having both platforms available, which is CAR-T and CD-3-redirected killing, gives us really the opportunity to start thinking about treatment sequence. So you could think about using one earlier and the other one later, using it with the patient think about induction therapy. Or if a patient relapses after one, you can use the other one. And then there is a third element that I think is very important. CAR-T is not for everyone. CAR-T is for younger patients, and there will be some reimbursement questions around CAR-T, so you are really happy then if you have an antibody in your portfolio with the same -- going against the same target. And then finally, I just wanted to make this remark. Apart from having both, we really have very distinct combination opportunities. We will be able to combine with IMiDs. We will be able to combine with checkpoint inhibitors. Everything we have in our portfolio is extremely complementary, so we feel extremely good about that."

So I think there was a lot of really important learnings for those who were at ESMO and coming back. I think the way to look at the space at this moment of time is that there is a rather small and well-defined population of high-expressing PDL-1 that is going to be treated with monotherapy. Everybody else is obviously needing a combination, and there's an option of treating those patients either with I/O, I/O combinations or with I/O, chemo combination. When I'm looking at the data and I'm talking to key opinion leaders, there's a little bit of a sentiment to say like -- you have a very low or no PDL-1 expression that will be a preference for chemotherapy. And of course, the data from the larger end of my studies have to play out at the end of the day, and there will be some overlaps between those segments and the usage of both. But I think what's definitely worth to be said is that at ESMO, the combination of chemo and I/O was absolutely strengthened. We think we are extremely well positioned with that. The data that we've been showing with ABRAXANE dicentric are extremely positive. And we're looking forward to having our data being read out."

What we're seeing from a commercial perspective, and I do believe I had a slide that addressed this, approximately 90% of patients are coming to OTEZLA therapy from something other than a biologic. So they're either switching off an oral, switching off topical or coming onto OTEZLA from nothing and on and only 10% are coming on from a biologic therapy. In terms of duration, what we're seeing is duration at 1 year, which looks at the high biologic range. And so the -- we feel very good about that duration. Certainly, well above what you see for other oral compounds in the space. So the duration of therapy actually looks quite good. One thing from the clinical studies that is very heartening to me and there's some 4-year data, which will come out in a little while, and that says that 65% of the patients who finished 1 year in the clinical trial were still on drug at 4 years, which is really unprecedented. And these were in PsA studies, which is really unprecedented relative to data from any other competitor or any other clinical trial. So the compliance is good for 1 -- through 1 year. I can't -- I don't have the commercial experience to say what it looks like for 2 years or 3 years because we don't have that data yet. But we believe that compliance will continue and continue to get better over time."

I think I would like to start your question with kind of what we've been saying a couple of times already. I think with the upcoming approval of REVLIMID [indiscernible] NDMM in maintenance, this is going to be the standard, and it's going to broadly applied. It's already used very broadly in the U.S. based, by the way, upon data that we've been obtaining from 3 studies and is doing a meta-analysis. It's really nice to show the 2.5 years overall survival benefit. Those are very strong data. Now the application and the usage and the uptick is going to start in Europe. That's the first thing I wanted to say. There is an ongoing study of daratumumab in that indication, but maintenance is really a long-term game. If you think back about kind of when we started to put REVLIMID into maintenance, and we are now at the point of really going to the finish line, this is something that takes multiple years. And I just wanted to, once again, say the usage and the approval is driven upon overall survival data that we've been generating from multiple studies, and the bar here is 2.5 years on overall survival benefit. Thinking about our future iMiDs, is there a place for them in maintenance? Maybe. We are particularly excited when we're looking at those iMiDs and group and have been talking about those in New York because they have a very, very deep B-cell kill effect. So whether those are going to be primarily used in maintenance or not needs to be decided, but I would not rule it out."

But the use of triplets is really picking up very, very quickly. And the reason is very, very clear. When you're looking at the progression-free survival and the response rate and the depth of the response that you can get, there's a compelling reason to do so. There is multiple opportunities. But I would make the argument that also in the foreseeable future, if you're an elderly frail patient or if you're a standard-risk patient, doublets remain a very attractive option. So that's the first point that I wanted to make. When -- coming to the second point of your question, we really think that REVLIMID and pomalidomide are great drugs. We really are compelled by the New England Journal publication that we've been seeing in the New England Journal of Medicine. Even when you look at the best available data, and I was trying to say this, 25% to 30% of patients even with Rev/Dex daratumumab are relapsing after 6 to 12 months. There is extremely limited options if a patient is relapsing after daratumumab or after pomalidomide. And the overall survival of patients with high risk, such as genetic features, despite all these new available therapies is still only 3 or 4 years. That's very bad. That's absolutely not good enough. We can define these patient populations very clearly. We can define them clinically. We can define them molecularly, and this is exactly where we want to test our new CELMoDs in. And we feel extremely good about that."

So when we're looking at the pomalidomide duration both in the U.S. and Europe, it's steadily increasing. What I can share with you is that the treatment duration in the U.S. is now over 10 months. A lot of that is driven by 2 factors: a, the use in combinatorial therapy. There's a lot of data available. NCCN guidance has recently been updated, and there's going to be, by the way, increasing use. As you heard, pomalidomide, daratumumab is submitted to the FDA, and there's a PDUFA date available. So that's one element driving pomalidomide duration, the usage in combination. The other element is the increasing usage earlier in therapy. So if you use REVLIMID either in combination, as I was trying to say earlier, and patients are relapsing afterwards, you won't have another triplet right after again with an IMiDs and another combination partner. And that's exactly what we are seeing. And I think the great performance of pomalidomide that we had in the third quarter is really a reflection of exactly that."

And then two, as we think about the evolution of Celgene post-REVLIMID genericization in mid-2020s, how do you think about Celgene's ability to grow through a REVLIMID patent cliff in a theoretical scenario, where REVLIMID outperformance makes it more difficult to grow through that cliff or even keep through that -- flat through that cliff?"

And on a go-forward basis, we would expect that to continue. So with respect to your question about the patent issue -- and I think we've at least highlighted this, if not completely qualitatively directionally, in some of the things that we have been presenting. We have a tremendous number of things going on in the pipeline not only in the multiple myeloma area, where all of the things that Michael and Mark and others have spoken about today, including BCMA and other things that we have going on. So we see great potential to continue to have a very strong multiple myeloma franchise for a long time to come. While that is happening, we've also got this great diversification coming in the I&I business, tremendous growth there. We have a lot going on in the myeloid space, where. It's a franchise that we've talked about a little bit less maybe just because today, it's nowhere near the size of the myeloma business. But we see that business growing tremendously. And then, Michael has also talked about some of the things that we've learned with respect to CLL and other diseases that are not in the model at all. So I think there's a lot of optionality in the portfolio, and we feel very confident in our ability as we get out there to continue to grow for a long time beyond 2026."

So where we see a really steep increase at this moment of time is through truly in combination of REVLIMID and dexamethasone with Velcade based upon the data of SWOG 777, the first-line study that has been presented roundabout a year ago. And just to remind everybody, compared with Rd alone has a 12 months overall survival benefit. So that's quite a lot. There's a lot of usage of this combination, not just in an elderly population. That's what we see, but in also certainly in the induction setting. What makes this very compelling, and when we're thinking about Europe, it's certainly the fact that at a certain time point, Velcade is going to become generic. So you have a very well-tolerated, very effective triplet, which may come along with a very reasonable cost. We're putting a lot of effort behind this combination. And then of course, there is the combination of -- and I just wanted to point it out once again because the New England Journal of Medicine was so nice. The Rd, daratumumab combination, 40 to 50 months progression-free survival. That's going to drive our treatment duration big time, and we see it as a catalyst, again, starting in the U.S., but I have no doubt that it's also going to come to Europe."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an outstanding third quarter and are excited to review and discuss the results with you, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our confidence and optimism in our future. During the quarter, our global therapeutic franchises continued to build strong demand momentum for our major cancer and immunology products. The value proposition these therapies bring to patients, physicians and providers, combined with exceptional execution, led to a meaningful acceleration of sales, allowing us to again raise our full year 2016 guidance and provide an update to our 2017 outlook. Following my comments, Peter will review these numbers and the drivers of our financial performance. 
In addition to providing their insights about our commercial results, Michael and Scott will review the progress we are making advancing several major late-stage programs in their franchises. Important new and updated clinical information supporting these programs was recently presented, especially study results that continue to demonstrate the transformative potential of both GED-0301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. They will also preview the range of data we expect to be published or presented at major medical meetings during the fourth quarter. 
I'd like to again thank many of you and your colleagues for joining us at the September investor deep dive into one of Celgene's core areas of research expertise, protein homeostasis. We are at the forefront of research aimed at understanding and manipulating the biological pathways within cells that control the function and degradation of proteins implicated in cancer and inflammatory diseases. The early programs that are emerging from this important scientific platform, combined with our internal discovery efforts in immuno-oncology, inflammation, epigenetics and with external collaboration partners, are increasing our opportunities to discover and develop more best-in-class or first-in-class molecules. 
Our novel approach to drug discovery, complementing organic expertise with a network of collaboration partners, is delivering. Working together, we have filed 8 investigational new drug applications this year while continuing to invest in discovery platforms with a potential to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients with serious diseases. 
At this time every year, our executive leadership team comes together for an in-depth review of our long-range strategic plan. We conducted our 2016 review just last week. In addition to reaffirming Celgene's mission and purpose, we reinforced our understanding of and confidence in the robust opportunities we have for sustained high growth. The momentum of our existing products, the potential of our pipeline and broad collaboration network and the innovation and execution of our high-performing teams are key drivers of our optimism. 
We also focused on our financial strategies to ensure we are investing in research, commercial, business development and capital structure programs that have the greatest potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients and to generate long-term shareholder value. Our business model creates the most value for all stakeholders when we invent medicines that improve and extend the lives of patients today while we invest in therapies that may cure patients in the future. 
Our principled approach to pricing innovative therapies is driven by the value they deliver to patients and the health care systems. At Celgene, we continuously seek to work collaboratively with providers, payers, patient advocacy organizations and governments to maximize patient access and ensure that incentives exist to encourage research that improves outcomes and ultimately, that lowers the total cost of health care around the world. Discovering and developing medicines that have clearly differentiated benefits for patients has and always will determine the level of our success. 
Before opening the call for your questions, Jackie will provide her perspective on our operating performance, business drivers, strategic positioning and the exceptional potential we have for long-term growth. We are incredibly energized by our year-to-date progress, and I'd like to thank my colleagues across all functions and around the world for their committed efforts on behalf of patients we serve today and the patients we seek to serve in the future.

While Q3 was another exceptional quarter driven by strong operating performance across the organization, the continued commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the th",627,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. While Q3 was another exceptional quarter driven by strong operating performance across the organization, the continued commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the third consecutive quarter. Due to the strong positioning of our products within the marketplace, we expect this increased momentum to continue into next year, and we now expect to achieve the high end of the previously revised 2017 range for total product sales and adjusted earnings per share. We are delivering this level of financial performance while we advance our pipeline and make strategic investments to access external innovation, all of which positions the company to grow through 2020 and well beyond. 
Turning to the quarter. Total net product sales in Q3 were over $2.9 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, a significant acceleration versus Q3 growth rates in the prior 2 years. Consistent with prior periods, our growth was predominantly volume-driven as product volume grew 25%. The contribution to growth from price remains relatively small and can fluctuate in any given period due to the timing of pricing actions throughout the year. 
Now the third quarter benefited from approximately $70 million in tender offer sales of REVLIMID to Russia. Excluding these Russian purchases, total net product sales still grew 25% year-over-year. Please recall that last year, the Russian orders occurred in the second and fourth quarters. And for your modeling, we do not anticipate any Russian tender business in the fourth quarter. What is clear is that REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA are having outstanding years and are greatly expanding usage. Now Michael and Scott will share their perspectives on this strong underlying volume growth and the demand drivers for these products later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.58, a year-on-year growth of 28%. Operating income accounted for the entire increase in earnings. Below operating income, the benefit from a lower diluted share count was offset by a full quarter of interest expense related to the debt issued to acquire Receptos in August last year and a higher tax rate due to geographic mix. 
Our operating model remains flexible and aligned with our strategic direction. During 2016, we have continued to increase our R&D investment as we support our growing pipeline and research efforts. At the same time, we have leveraged our global commercial infrastructure despite increasing coverage of our international I&I sales organization. The net result is a continued improvement in the adjusted operating margin of 80 basis points in Q3 and a 200 basis point improvement year-to-date when compared to prior period. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now we continue to balance deploying capital between our share repurchase program and strategic transactions to access external innovation such as the EngMab deal. Striking the right balance is critical as we prioritize our strategic initiatives to position the company to grow for the next decade. For the first 9 months, we repurchased $2 billion in common stock and entered into 6 strategic transactions. 
In summary, the business is performing very well. The year-to-date operating momentum places us on track this year to achieve sales of approximately $11.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $5.58 and $5.92 per share. This implies a fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS growth rate in the range of 31% to 35%. So as you can see, we expect the earnings momentum to continue right through the year-end. For 2017, we are now on track to achieve the high end of our previously revised ranges for total net product sales and adjusted earnings per share. So really, a great quarter. 
I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael."

ABRAXANE is maintaining its positioning in the U.S., with stable market shares in breast, lung and pancreatic cancer and is growing outside the U.S. in pancreatic cancer. 
We made significant progress on our pipeline during the quarter. We expect to submit a new drug application to FDA for AG-221 in relapsed/refractory AML by year-end. We have further advanced our CC-122 program in a variety of diseases, and our FUSION program for durvalumab continues to enroll 6 trials in hematologic diseases. Our luspatercept and CC-486 programs enrolled well into pivotal programs in myeloid malignancies. Through our recent acquisition of EngMab and the lead molecule EM901, Celgene is now uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development opportunities using 2 key platforms: CAR T and CD-3-redirected killing. Our teams are diligently preparing for the upcoming ASH Congress in San Diego. We expect to have a robust set of data presentations across both our in-line brands and pipeline assets. 
REVLIMID had an outstanding third quarter, with 30% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue growth, reflecting strong underlying demand across the globe. The ongoing NDMM launch provides significant market share gains in key markets where we have reimbursements. In addition, we secured NDMM reimbursement for Italy in September. We expect to have reimbursement in Switzerland by the end of the year and in France, by Q1 2017. Duration continues to increase in all geographies. 
REVLIMID benefits from a stream of positive data, including another New England Journal of Medicine publication, the POLLUX trial. As a reminder, the starter for Rd plus daratumumab in relapsed/refractory myeloma demonstrates an estimated progression-free survival for the combination of well over 40 months. Coupled with the FDA breakthrough starters for Rd plus daratumumab for treatment in relapsed/refractory myeloma, we are optimistic about a major growth opportunity ahead for REVLIMID. 
In addition, we have submitted applications to the FDA and EMA for REVLIMID as maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after receiving autologous stem-cell transplantation. The FDA has provided the application with a Priority Review designation and a PDUFA date of February 24, 2017. The decision of the European authority is expected in the first half of 2017.  Furthermore, we are excited about the REVLIMID myeloma data to be presented at ASH this year, including final overall survival data for MM-020 and key analysis for Myeloma XI. This trial, conducted by the MRC study group in the U.K., randomized more than 3,800 transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed myeloma patients and is the largest myeloma study to date. REVLIMID has been investigated both in the induction and maintenance setting, and respective results will be presented at the Congress. 
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered strong growth, with 33% year-over-year and 7% sequential growth. Most launched markets have achieved leadership positions in the third-line-plus patient segment, and duration continues to grow. POMALYST/IMNOVID demand continues to grow in spite of some competitive pressure in the fourth-line-plus patient segment with the launch of daratumumab. We have seen overall demand increase due to the use of POMALYST in triplet combination, including in combination with daratumumab. NCCN guidelines were recently updated to include 3 POMALYST-based triplets for relapsed/refractory myeloma. In addition, FDA has recently granted standard review to daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma with a PDUFA date in June 2017. 
During the third quarter, we received EMA approval for an IMNOVID label update for patients with renal impairment, facilitating the use of pomalidomide in this difficult-to-treat patient population. We expect all of these growth drivers to lead to share and duration gains in the future.  We are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID to further support the use of multiple combination. Our Phase III OPTIMISMM trial in combination with bortezomib and second or later treatment line is on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017. 
ABRAXANE continues to have stable performance. ABRAXANE grew 1% year-over-year, with growth coming from outside of the United States. U.S. ABRAXANE maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and demand is stable in breast and lung cancer in spite of the underlying competitive dynamics. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 5% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter, driven by pancreatic cancer in markets with reimbursement, including Germany, Spain and Italy. 
ABRAXANE has generated additional impact for data in difficult-to-treat solid tumors. Data from multiple studies evaluating the use of ABRAXANE alone, in standard combination or in combination with mobile agents in pancreatic cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer were presented during the ESMO meeting in October. We plan to present the results of the ABRAXANE randomized Phase II tnAcity trial in first-line triple-negative breast cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. Data from the ABRAXANE ABOUND lung cancer study will be presented at the World Congress on Lung Cancer in December. And we are awaiting the results of the ongoing pivotal ABRAXANE dicentric combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. 
Additional Celgene data will be presented at several key congresses by year-end. In addition to the Myeloma XI and MM-020 studies that I already mentioned, data presentations at the forthcoming ASH Congress in San Diego include our REMARC study of REVLIMID maintenance in elderly first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients; data for REVLIMID maintenance in CLL from the CONTINUUM trial and interim analysis of our R2 MAGNIFY study in indolent lymphoma; as well as CC-122, CD20 combination data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and indolent lymphoma. In addition, a number of our collaboration partners will be presenting data on early and mid-stage assets. 
As I noted earlier, we'll have key ABRAXANE presentations at the World Congress on Lung Cancer and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium before year-end. We are also very excited about the very encouraging Phase I Marizomib data in combination with Avastin in glioblastoma to be presented by our partner, Triphase, at the Society for Neuro-Oncology in November. 
In addition to the excellent performance of our in-line brands, we are making very good progress in advancing our early- and later-stage pipeline. The luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron continues to advance. Our 2 Phase III trials in low-risk MDS and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia are enrolling extremely well. And we are actively engaged in planning to further maximize the opportunity of the assets in additional patient segments and indications. We are making progress with our I/O pipeline and CD19 and BCMA and CAR-T programs with our partners Juno and bluebird bio. We received an EMA PRIME designation for the development of JAK 15 [ph] in adult relapsed/refractory ALL in Europe, which may enable accelerated development and approval.  The FUSION program is advancing, evaluating durvalumab in combination with key in-line brands and mobile agents. We expect data readouts to begin in early 2017. 
Our recent acquisition of EngMab and the lead molecule EM901 further complements our industry-leading portfolio and pipeline of myeloma assets. We see B-cell maturation antigen, BCMA, as an ideal target for immune-based therapies such as CAR-T and CD-3-redirected killing. Celgene is uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development opportunities using both platforms, which we view as highly complementary. In addition to monotherapy, both platforms provide the opportunity for rational combination therapies with our CELMoDs and checkpoint inhibitors in order to further improve treatment efficacy as well as for clinical development in other BCMA expressing B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma. 
Finally, we are aggressively pursuing our protein homeostasis pipeline. The CC-122 program is enrolling multiple proof-of-concept studies in myeloma, lymphoma, CLL and hepatocellular carcinoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. The data obtained will allow us to start making pivotal decisions in the first half of 2017.  In addition, and as highlighted at our research meeting in New York earlier this month, our new AML CELMoD, CC-90009, has progressed into Phase I. And we have identified additional CELMoD successor compounds with high potential in various hematological malignancies. 
In summary, our Hematology & Oncology franchise has had another outstanding quarter. Our key brands have delivered strong financial performance, and the momentum gives us the confidence to raise our outlook for 2016 and 2017. Our early- and late-stage clinical programs have advanced nicely during the quarter, and the acquisition of EngMab is a perfect fit for our myeloma and lymphoma pipeline. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Q3 was an important quarter for I&I, full of advancement for both our marketed and pipeline assets. With OTEZLA, we've seen revenue continue to accelerate throughout the quarter, with growth in both psoriasis and PSA indications, as demand, market share and persistency continue to increase. At the same time, we have expanded the global access footprint for OTEZLA. As of this month, reimbursement for OTEZLA has now been achieved in 20 countries worldwide.  In Q3, we advanced development of our pipeline programs, progressing multiple assets through important milestones. 
Turning now to OTEZLA. Global net sales in Q3 were $275 million. This represents a 98% year-on-year increase. Sales in Q3 continued to grow despite the regular market declines in prescribing typically seen in the summer months. While we remain focused on the launch execution in Germany and other early launch markets, we were able to achieve critical reimbursement decisions from several key European markets. NICE granted a positive opinion for OTEZLA in psoriasis, which reverses previous guidance and enables access for patients in England and Wales. With multiple positive reimbursement decisions in hand, we are now preparing to execute the next wave of launches in the EU. 
Focusing now on the U.S. market dynamics. The physician consumer campaigns continue to drive increases in demand for OTEZLA. With the sustained leadership position in new to brand share, we are seeing a continued rise in market share for OTEZLA, which now represents more than 1/5 of the systemic-treated psoriasis market. Consistent with the OTEZLA value proposition on pricing strategy today, much of this growth is coming from the pre-biologic market segment. 
Last week, the interim results from the GED-0301 CD-001 trial were represented as a late breaker at UEGW meeting in Vienna. These results represented early exploratory look at the data and are part of a broader development program that is well underway. As a reminder, the objective of the study was to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic improvements in a broader, more difficult-to-treat Crohn's population than studied previously. It enrolled 63 patients across 3 active treatment groups. All patients had a confirmed endoscopic damage at baseline and clinically advanced disease. The CD-001 results are generally consistent with the clinical outcomes seen in the placebo-controlled IGON program and support GED utilization across a broad Crohn's patient population. With the IGON studies, there was compelling evidence to view GED-0301 as a potentially transformational therapy. As an oral treatment with unprecedented rates and clinical response and remission and negligible systemic exposure, it could allow patients to be treated in a fundamentally different way than other therapies in development or on the market. 
In CD-001, with a more heterogeneous population, GED-0301 demonstrated meaningful clinical and endoscopic outcomes across different patient types, including CNS naïve in failures, those with prior surgeries as well as patients with proximal and distal disease. Once confirmed in pivotal programs, we are confident that this product will be transformational for patient care. Data rollout is expected to continue through the rest of the year. The focus of these data will be the 3- and 4-year results from the PALACE and ESTEEM programs, which show a highly differentiated benefit risk profile for OTEZLA relative to other competitive products. Data from positive Phase II studies for RPC4046 in EoE and CC-220 in lupus will also be disseminated. 
Q3 was a quarter full of advancement for Celgene I&I. OTEZLA's share and duration continue to improve, while access gains expand the geographic breadth of the product. OTEZLA is well on track to achieve blockbusters data from 2016 and in the years to come. We moved all major development programs ahead and look forward to multiple upcoming proof-of-concept study readouts, including GED and OTEZLA in the UC, ozanimod in Crohn's disease and CC-220 in cutaneous lupus. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio. 
Thank you for your attention this morning, and I'd like to turn the call over to Jackie."

Our Q3 pe",416,"Thank you, Scott. Q3 was a fabulous quarter for Celgene. Quarters like this are only made possible by the cumulative hard work of our teams around the world, work that builds over time to produce the type of momentum we are currently generating. Our Q3 performance demonstrates we are stronger than ever, and we advance into 2017 and the coming years in a great position. Our 2016 milestone chart shows us well on track to achieve what we set out to achieve this year, and we feel very good about where we are at this point in the fourth quarter.  Even though there are only 2 months remaining in the year, there is still exciting data to be presented at AACR, ASH, San Antonio Breast and other medical meetings, so stay tuned for those presentations. 
This year, we started to see data readouts from the Phase III trials in our pipeline. This is just the beginning of a multiyear period, during which we will have readouts on a number of potentially transformative programs. Michael and Scott spoke about some of these. The Phase III trials still to read out over the coming 12 to 24 months give us the potential to see upside for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapies; to expand ABRAXANE's presence in pancreatic cancer; to take REVLIMID into lymphoma; to further expand and diversify our myeloid business; to see the expansion and diversification of our I&I franchise with 2 new compounds, ozanimod and GED-0301, and 2 new therapeutic categories, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease; and much more. We will also have Phase II and proof-of-concept data for a number of indications across several compounds, including CC-122, CC-220, durvalumab, CAR-T, CC-486 and demcizumab, and the flow of data will be strong and steady for some time to come. 
On the commercial side, building on the strong momentum of 2016 and 2017, we look forward to launches across multiple geographies for REVLIMID in the stem-cell transplant setting of newly diagnosed myeloma; the U.S. launch of AG-221 in IDH2-mutated AML; the ongoing global uptake of triplet regimens on IMiD backbones; and the geographic expansion of OTEZLA, including the important market of Japan. These commercial catalysts and the clinical catalysts I highlighted give us high confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2017 and 2020 targets and produce strong growth for many years beyond. 
Let me close by thanking our teams around the world for their performance, and thank you for listening to our call today."

So on NDMM, there is a very distinct post-transplant opportunity in Europe. So transplantation maintenance has been developed a lot by European investigators, but there is no usage because there is no approved reimbursement at this moment of time. So there's a very distinct opportunity. When it comes to the U.S., there is usage driven by the data, but I can remind you as to what happened with our NDMM launch in elderly patients. So once we had the launch and the opportunity to really talk about it and educate, the market shares and the duration went up. And we're going to see the same thing happening in the U.S. So -- in this situation. So it's an opportunity for both sides of the Atlantic, although, I would say, the opportunity for Europe is probably slightly bigger. So that's the first part of the question. With the second part, you're right. And talking about treatment duration, you just have to think about kind of where we are with progression-free survival with the triplet combination. At this moment of time, those which are approved already provide anything between 20 to 28 months. Our current treatment duration in the U.S. is 18 months. And then you have the POLLUX trial that was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, where we were talking about progression-free survival of 40 to 50 months. Treatment duration needs a little bit of time to build up, and that's the point that I wanted to make. Once a drug is available and the clinical data is there and approval is there, it needs a little bit of time to build up. So we need to go beyond the 18 months. I think when you're looking at our results, we already see kind of the impact of the treatment duration really impacting very positively. With our new label in transplant-eligible NDMM and with the POLLUX data, we think this is going to accelerate even further."

So starting with the duration in the U.S. We are currently -- when we're looking at the first use of the product, we are currently at 18 months. As you probably know, REVLIMID is not just used once. The combination with other drugs allows the -- to use it once again. So the overall treatment duration is now 24 months. And it's constantly increasing. The REVLIMID, daratumumab data is actually really intriguing because 40 to 50 months of progression-free survival in relapsed/refractory myeloma is absolutely intriguing. Is that going to have an impact on the overall treatment segment sequence in pomalidomide? Yes, likely. But I think it's going to be in a way that -- especially in the U.S., REVLIMID, daratumumab is going to be quickly taken up the first-line usage as it is such a great regimen. And that allows pomalidomide to then really go into the second-line space and be used immediately after. So if you have a great triplet to start with, you want to have another triplet to go on with. And the sequence of REVLIMID and pomalidomide is actually extremely compelling, and that's what -- something we're seeing already in the market happening."

And I still owe Geoff kind of also the question that you were just asking. So the treatment duration in Europe is not quite where the U.S. is, and it's understandable because a lot of the duration in the U.S., of course, is driven by this year-long availability of RD in first-line treatment. So in Europe, we are at roundabout 13 to 14 months at this moment of time, increasing foreseeingly with the NDMM launch. And as I said, in the U.S., a first usage, 18 months; and then aggregate use, 24 months. So there's still a really good way to go for Europe, and the NDMM launch is going to absolutely drive this. With your question of NDMM pricing, I think the speed upon which we've been getting the 20 reimbursements in Europe should provide you with confidence that there is a lot of appreciation of the data and the value proposition of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma with payers. So we -- and by the way, the overall survival data and the MM-020 data is really driving that, and we're happy to being able to provide an update of this data at ASH so you can all look at this. As a consequence, the price reductions that you have to have in some European markets, not in all, but in some, with a new label were absolutely moderate and 100% in line with our expectation. Of course, there is this trend in the U.S., where you can maintain the price or increase the price upon value proposition. And in Europe, payers are driving you down. So the trends, of course, of prices in the U.S. and Europe are absolutely not the same. What I can tell you is that we are extremely happy with the speed, but then also with the appreciation and support that we got by payers in the NDMM situation in Europe."

So what I can share with you and for everybody on the call, so CONTINUUM is a randomized study of REVLIMID maintenance in relapsed CLL post-induction therapy. So we're testing maintenance therapy here. So what I can share with you that is -- the co-primary endpoint, which is progression-free survival, was achieved in CONTINUUM and that the overall survival data is still immature. That said, these data are really going to provide us with very, very important information for the future positioning and investigation of CELMoDs in CLL. And we think that there is a very distinct need for better therapies in CLL, and we think also that CELMoD is an excellent drug class for that purpose. When you're thinking of patients who are relapsing off the ibrutinib, when you think about the really low CR rates and when you're thinking about the very high number of -- and proportion of MLB-positive patients with CLL, there is a distinct need for better therapies. We are very excited in that context about CC-122. We think it has a really differentiated immune profile, and CC-122 is going to be the drug to be moved forward. But CONTINUUM is going to help us to do this in the best possible way. The data that we're going to show with MAGNIFY, which is our R2 study in indolent lymphoma, is an interim analysis.

And I think the right way of answering it is just reminding ourselves that there is -- when we're thinking about multiple myeloma, there's still segments with a very distinct medical need. So there is absolutely the need to bring better therapies, although we see now all these triplet data reading out. When we're thinking about patients who are relapsing very, very quickly, and it's actually 25% to 30% after post-REVLIMID and daratumumab, when we're thinking about patients with high risks such as genetic features, when we're thinking of patients who are relapsing after daratumumab and pomalidomide. There's many patient segments that under -- even with the available current therapies, are really not doing well. That's the first point that I wanted to make. The second point, BCMA is really a great target. It's selectively expressed. It's almost expressed in 100% of the multiple myeloma patients. It's not a really ideal target for immune therapies. And having both platforms available, which is CAR-T and CD-3-redirected killing, gives us really the opportunity to start thinking about treatment sequence. So you could think about using one earlier and the other one later, using it in the same patient, think about induction therapy, or if the patient relapses after one, you can use the other one. And then there is a third element that I think is very important. CAR-T is not for everyone. CAR-T is for younger patients, and there will be some reimbursement questions around CAR-T, so you are really happy then if you have an antibody in your portfolio with the same -- going against the same target. And then finally, I just wanted to make this remark. Apart from having both, we really have very distinct combination opportunities. We will be able to combine with IMiDs. We will be able to combine with checkpoint inhibitors. Everything we have in our portfolio is extremely complementary, so we feel extremely good about that."

So I think there was a lot of really important learnings for those who were at ESMO and coming back. I think the way to look at the space at this moment of time is that there is a rather small and well-defined population of high-expressing PDL-1 that is going to be treated with monotherapy. Everybody else is obviously needing a combination, and there's an option of treating those patients either with I/O, I/O combinations or with I/O, chemo combination. When I'm looking at the data and I'm talking to key opinion leaders, there's a little bit of a sentiment to say like -- you have a very low or no PDL-1 expression that will be a preference for chemotherapy. And of course, the data from the larger randomized studies has to play out at the end of the day, and there will be some overlaps between those segments and the usage of both. But I think what's definitely worth to be said is that at ESMO, the combination of chemo and I/O was absolutely strengthened. We think we are extremely well positioned with that.

What we're seeing from a commercial perspective, and I do believe I had a slide that addressed this, approximately 90% of patients are coming to OTEZLA therapy from something other than a biologic. So they're either switching off an oral, switching off topical or coming onto OTEZLA from nothing and on and only 10% are coming on from a biologic therapy. In terms of duration, what we're seeing is duration at 1 year, which looks at the high biologic range. And so the -- we feel very good about that duration. Certainly, well above what you see for other oral compounds in the space. So the duration of therapy actually looks quite good. One thing from the clinical studies that is very heartening to me and there's some 4-year data, which will come out in a little while, and that says that 65% of the patients who finished 1 year in the clinical trial were still on drug at 4 years, which is really unprecedented. And these were in PsA studies, which is really unprecedented relative to data from any other comparator or any other clinical trial. So the compliance is good for 1 -- through 1 year.

I think I would like to start your question with kind of what we've been saying a couple of times already. I think with the upcoming approval of REVLIMID [indiscernible] NDMM in maintenance, this is going to be the standard, and it's going to broadly applied. It's already used very broadly in the U.S. based, by the way, upon data that we've been obtaining from 3 studies and we – during the meta-analysis, really nice to show the 2.5 years overall survival benefit. Those are very strong data. Now the application and the usage and the uptake is going to start in Europe. That's the first thing I wanted to say. There is an ongoing study of daratumumab in that indication, but maintenance is really a long-term game. If you think back about kind of when we started to put REVLIMID into maintenance, and we are now at the point of really going to the finish line, this is something that takes multiple years. And I just wanted to, once again, say the usage and the approval is driven upon overall survival data that we've been generating from multiple studies, and the bar here is 2.5 years on overall survival benefit. Thinking about our future iMiDs, is there a place for them in maintenance? Maybe. We are particularly excited when we're looking at those iMiDs and Rupert has been talking about those in New York because they have a very, very deep B-cell kill effect. So whether those are going to be primarily used in maintenance or not needs to be decided, but I would not rule it out."

But the use of triplets is really picking up very, very quickly. And the reason is very, very clear. When you're looking at the progression-free survival and the response rate and the depth of the response that you can get, there's a compelling reason to do so. There's multiple opportunities. But I would make the argument that also in the foreseeable future, if you're an elderly frail patient or if you're a standard-risk patient, doublets remain a very attractive option. So that's the first point that I wanted to make. When coming to the second point of your question, we really think that REVLIMID and pomalidomide are great drugs. We really are compelled by the New England Journal publication that we've been seeing in the New England Journal of Medicine. Even when you look at the best available data, and I was trying to say this, 25% to 30% of patients even with Rev/Dex daratumumab are relapsing after 6 to 12 months. There is extremely limited options if a patient is relapsing after daratumumab or after pomalidomide. And the overall survival of patients with high risk, such as genetic features, despite all these new available therapies is still only 3 or 4 years. That's very bad. That's absolutely not good enough. We can define these patient populations very clearly. We can define them clinically. We can define them molecularly, and this is exactly where we want to test our new CELMoDs in. And we feel extremely good about that."

So when we're looking at the pomalidomide duration both in the U.S. and Europe, it's steadily increasing. What I can share with you is that the treatment duration in the U.S. is now over 10 months. A lot of that is driven by 2 factors: a, the use in combinatorial therapy. There's a lot of data available. NCCN guidance has recently been updated, and there's going to be, by the way, increasing use. As you heard, pomalidomide, daratumumab is submitted to the FDA, and there's a PDUFA date available. So that's one element driving pomalidomide duration, the usage in combination. The other element is the increasing usage earlier in therapy. So if you use REVLIMID either in combination, as I was trying to say earlier, and patients are relapsing afterwards, you want to have another triplet right after again with an IMiDs and another combination partner. And that's exactly what we are seeing. And I think the great performance of pomalidomide that we had in the third quarter is really a reflection of exactly that."

And just to remind everybody, compared with Rd alone has a 12 months overall survival benefit. So that's quite a lot. There's a lot of usage of this combination, not just in an elderly population. That's what we see, but in also certainly in the induction setting. What makes this very compelling, and when we're thinking about Europe, is certainly the fact that at a certain time point, Velcade is going to become generic. So you have a very well-tolerated, very effective triplet, which may come along with a very reasonable cost. We're putting a lot of effort behind this combination. And then of course, there is the combination of -- and I just wanted to point it out once again because the New England Journal of Medicine was so nice.

Based on all the comments that Michael and Scott had made and Jackie as well and Mark, you can tell that we've got very strong commercial momentum right now. And so obviously, the Q3 results, we're very pleased with. More good stuff to come, obviously, as we finish up the year. And we -- as we move into '17 and look ahead to 2020, we actually feel like we're very much on track to do extremely well against those targets. Obviously, we're in an exciting period. The fourth quarter is always fun for us. There's a tremendous amount of news flow at the medical meetings on our products and our pipeline. We continue to enrich our pipeline and moving forward, which you saw in the deep dive just for protein homeostasis. But obviously, from a business development standpoint, you can see we've broadened the range of things that we're looking at. There is just a tremendous set of opportunities for us to pursue. So it's an exciting time to be part of Celgene. We're really pleased with our results, and thank you for your support."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an outstanding third quarter and are excited to review and discuss the results with you, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our confidence and optimism in our future. During the quarter, our global therapeutic franchises continued to build strong demand momentum for our major cancer and immunology products. The value proposition these therapies bring to patients, physicians and providers, combined with exceptional execution, led to a meaningful acceleration of sales, allowing us to again raise our full year 2016 guidance and provide an update to our 2017 outlook. Following my comments, Peter will review these numbers and the drivers of our financial performance. 
In addition to providing their insights about our commercial results, Michael and Scott will review the progress we are making advancing several major late-stage programs in their franchises. Important new and updated clinical information supporting these programs was recently presented, especially study results that continue to demonstrate the transformative potential of both GED-0301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. They will also preview the range of data we expect to be published or presented at major medical meetings during the fourth quarter. 
I'd like to again thank many of you and your colleagues for joining us at the September investor deep dive into one of Celgene's core areas of research expertise, protein homeostasis. We are at the forefront of research aimed at understanding and manipulating the biological pathways within cells that control the function and degradation of proteins implicated in cancer and inflammatory diseases. The early programs that are emerging from this important scientific platform, combined with our internal discovery efforts in immuno-oncology, inflammation, epigenetics and with external collaboration partners, are increasing our opportunities to discover and develop more best-in-class or first-in-class molecules. 
Our novel approach to drug discovery, complementing organic expertise with a network of collaboration partners, is delivering. Working together, we have filed 8 investigational new drug applications this year while continuing to invest in discovery platforms with a potential to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients with serious diseases. 
At this time every year, our executive leadership team comes together for an in-depth review of our long-range strategic plan. We conducted our 2016 review just last week. In addition to reaffirming Celgene's mission and purpose, we reinforced our understanding of and confidence in the robust opportunities we have for sustained high growth. The momentum of our existing products, the potential of our pipeline and broad collaboration network and the innovation and execution of our high-performing teams are key drivers of our optimism. 
We also focused on our financial strategies to ensure we are investing in research, commercial, business development and capital structure programs that have the greatest potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients and to generate long-term shareholder value. Our business model creates the most value for all stakeholders when we invent medicines that improve and extend the lives of patients today while we invest in therapies that may cure patients in the future. 
Our principled approach to pricing innovative therapies is driven by the value they deliver to patients and the health care systems. At Celgene, we continuously seek to work collaboratively with providers, payers, patient advocacy organizations and governments to maximize patient access and ensure that incentives exist to encourage research that improves outcomes and ultimately, that lowers the total cost of health care around the world. Discovering and developing medicines that have clearly differentiated benefits for patients has and always will determine the level of our success. 
Before opening the call for your questions, Jackie will provide her perspective on our operating performance, business drivers, strategic positioning and the exceptional potential we have for long-term growth. We are incredibly energized by our year-to-date progress, and I'd like to thank my colleagues across all functions and around the world for their committed efforts on behalf of patients we serve today and the patients we seek to serve in the future. 
Thank you, and please help me welcome Peter to the call."

While Q3 was another exceptional quarter driven by strong operating performance across the organization, the continued commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the th",627,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. While Q3 was another exceptional quarter driven by strong operating performance across the organization, the continued commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the third consecutive quarter. Due to the strong positioning of our products within the marketplace, we expect this increased momentum to continue into next year, and we now expect to achieve the high end of the previously revised 2017 range for total product sales and adjusted earnings per share. We are delivering this level of financial performance while we advance our pipeline and make strategic investments to access external innovation, all of which positions the company to grow through 2020 and well beyond. 
Turning to the quarter. Total net product sales in Q3 were over $2.9 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, a significant acceleration versus Q3 growth rates in the prior 2 years. Consistent with prior periods, our growth was predominantly volume-driven as product volume grew 25%. The contribution to growth from price remains relatively small and can fluctuate in any given period due to the timing of pricing actions throughout the year. 
Now the third quarter benefited from approximately $70 million in tender offer sales of REVLIMID to Russia. Excluding these Russian purchases, total net product sales still grew 25% year-over-year. Please recall that last year, the Russian orders occurred in the second and fourth quarters. And for your modeling, we do not anticipate any Russian tender business in the fourth quarter. What is clear is that REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA are having outstanding years and are greatly expanding usage. Now Michael and Scott will share their perspectives on this strong underlying volume growth and the demand drivers for these products later in the call. 
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.58, a year-on-year growth of 28%. Operating income accounted for the entire increase in earnings. Below operating income, the benefit from a lower diluted share count was offset by a full quarter of interest expense related to the debt issued to acquire Receptos in August last year and a higher tax rate due to geographic mix. 
Our operating model remains flexible and aligned with our strategic direction. During 2016, we have continued to increase our R&D investment as we support our growing pipeline and research efforts. At the same time, we have leveraged our global commercial infrastructure despite increasing coverage of our international I&I sales organization. The net result is a continued improvement in the adjusted operating margin of 80 basis points in Q3 and a 200 basis point improvement year-to-date when compared to prior period. 
We ended the third quarter with approximately $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now we continue to balance deploying capital between our share repurchase program and strategic transactions to access external innovation such as the EngMab deal. Striking the right balance is critical as we prioritize our strategic initiatives to position the company to grow for the next decade. For the first 9 months, we repurchased $2 billion in common stock and entered into 6 strategic transactions. 
In summary, the business is performing very well. The year-to-date operating momentum places us on track this year to achieve sales of approximately $11.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $5.58 and $5.92 per share. This implies a fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS growth rate in the range of 31% to 35%. So as you can see, we expect the earnings momentum to continue right through the year-end. For 2017, we are now on track to achieve the high end of our previously revised ranges for total net product sales and adjusted earnings per share. So really, a great quarter. 
I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael."
258769,403588380,1064663,"Celgene Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Celgene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone.

In addition, w",1494,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Q3 2016 was another great quarter for Hematology & Oncology. My sincere thanks to our teams worldwide for an outstanding performance, with impressive growth in key brands and across geographies. In addition, we made robust progress with key development programs for multiple pipeline assets. 
We had a record performance in Q3, with 24% year-over-year and 8% sequential revenue growth. REVLIMID and demand growth continues in launched countries, and we have secured reimbursement in most key markets, though we have not yet had a full year of revenues in many European markets. POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow, and IMNOVID-based triplet combination is increasing utilization, driving share and duration. ABRAXANE is maintaining its positioning in the U.S., with stable market shares in breast, lung and pancreatic cancer and is growing outside the U.S. in pancreatic cancer. 
We made significant progress on our pipeline during the quarter. We expect to submit a new drug application to FDA for AG-221 in relapsed/refractory AML by year-end. We have further advanced our CC-122 program in a variety of diseases, and our FUSION program for durvalumab continues to enroll 6 trials in hematologic diseases. Our luspatercept and CC-486 programs enrolled well into pivotal programs in myeloid malignancies. Through our recent acquisition of EngMab and the lead molecule EM901, Celgene is now uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development opportunities using 2 key platforms: CAR T and CD-3-redirected killing. Our teams are diligently preparing for the upcoming ASH Congress in San Diego. We expect to have a robust set of data presentations across both our in-line brands and pipeline assets. 
REVLIMID had an outstanding third quarter, with 30% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue growth, reflecting strong underlying demand across the globe. The ongoing NDMM launch provides significant market share gains in key markets where we have reimbursements. In addition, we secured NDMM reimbursement for Italy in September. We expect to have reimbursement in Switzerland by the end of the year and in France, by Q1 2017. Duration continues to increase in all geographies. 
REVLIMID benefits from a stream of positive data, including another New England Journal of Medicine publication, the POLLUX trial. As a reminder, the starter for Rd plus daratumumab in relapsed/refractory myeloma demonstrates an estimated progression-free survival for the combination of well over 40 months. Coupled with the FDA breakthrough starters for Rd plus daratumumab for treatment in relapsed/refractory myeloma, we are optimistic about a major growth opportunity ahead for REVLIMID. 
In addition, we have submitted applications to the FDA and EMA for REVLIMID as maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after receiving autologous stem-cell transplantation. The FDA has provided the application with a Priority Review designation and a PDUFA date of February 24, 2017. The decision of the European authority is expected in the first half of 2017.  Furthermore, we are excited about the REVLIMID myeloma data to be presented at ASH this year, including final overall survival data for MM-020 and key analysis for Myeloma XI. This trial, conducted by the MRC study group in the U.K., randomized more than 3,800 transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed myeloma patients and is the largest myeloma study to date. REVLIMID has been investigated both in the induction and maintenance setting, and respective results will be presented at the Congress. 
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered strong growth, with 33% year-over-year and 7% sequential growth. Most launched markets have achieved leadership positions in the third-line-plus patient segment, and duration continues to grow. POMALYST/IMNOVID demand continues to grow in spite of some competitive pressure in the fourth-line-plus patient segment with the launch of daratumumab. We have seen overall demand increase due to the use of POMALYST in triplet combination, including in combination with daratumumab. NCCN guidelines were recently updated to include 3 POMALYST-based triplets for relapsed/refractory myeloma. In addition, FDA has recently granted standard review to daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma with a PDUFA date in June 2017. 
During the third quarter, we received EMA approval for an IMNOVID label update for patients with renal impairment, facilitating the use of pomalidomide in this difficult-to-treat patient population. We expect all of these growth drivers to lead to share and duration gains in the future.  We are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID to further support the use of multiple combination. Our Phase III OPTIMISMM trial in combination with bortezomib and second or later treatment line is on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017. 
ABRAXANE continues to have stable performance. ABRAXANE grew 1% year-over-year, with growth coming from outside of the United States. U.S. ABRAXANE maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and demand is stable in breast and lung cancer in spite of the underlying competitive dynamics. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 5% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter, driven by pancreatic cancer in markets with reimbursement, including Germany, Spain and Italy. 
ABRAXANE has generated additional impact for data in difficult-to-treat solid tumors. Data from multiple studies evaluating the use of ABRAXANE alone, in standard combination or in combination with mobile agents in pancreatic cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer were presented during the ESMO meeting in October. We plan to present the results of the ABRAXANE randomized Phase II tnAcity trial in first-line triple-negative breast cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. Data from the ABRAXANE ABOUND lung cancer study will be presented at the World Congress on Lung Cancer in December. And we are awaiting the results of the ongoing pivotal ABRAXANE dicentric combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. 
Additional Celgene data will be presented at several key congresses by year-end. In addition to the Myeloma XI and MM-020 studies that I already mentioned, data presentations at the forthcoming ASH Congress in San Diego include our REMARC study of REVLIMID maintenance in elderly first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients; data for REVLIMID maintenance in CLL from the CONTINUUM trial and interim analysis of our R2 MAGNIFY study in indolent lymphoma; as well as CC-122, CD20 combination data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and indolent lymphoma. In addition, a number of our collaboration partners will be presenting data on early and mid-stage assets. 
As I noted earlier, we'll have key ABRAXANE presentations at the World Congress on Lung Cancer and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium before year-end. We are also very excited about the very encouraging Phase I Marizomib data in combination with Avastin in glioblastoma to be presented by our partner, Triphase, at the Society for Neuro-Oncology in November. 
In addition to the excellent performance of our in-line brands, we are making very good progress in advancing our early- and later-stage pipeline. The luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron continues to advance. Our 2 Phase III trials in low-risk MDS and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia are enrolling extremely well. And we are actively engaged in planning to further maximize the opportunity of the assets in additional patient segments and indications. We are making progress with our I/O pipeline and CD19 and BCMA and CAR-T programs with our partners Juno and bluebird bio. We received an EMA PRIME designation for the development of JAK 15 [ph] in adult relapsed/refractory ALL in Europe, which may enable accelerated development and approval.  The FUSION program is advancing, evaluating durvalumab in combination with key in-line brands and mobile agents. We expect data readouts to begin in early 2017. 
Our recent acquisition of EngMab and the lead molecule EM901 further complements our industry-leading portfolio and pipeline of myeloma assets. We see B-cell maturation antigen, BCMA, as an ideal target for immune-based therapies such as CAR-T and CD-3-redirected killing. Celgene is uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development opportunities using both platforms, which we view as highly complementary. In addition to monotherapy, both platforms provide the opportunity for rational combination therapies with our CELMoDs and checkpoint inhibitors in order to further improve treatment efficacy as well as for clinical development in other BCMA expressing B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma. 
Finally, we are aggressively pursuing our protein homeostasis pipeline. The CC-122 program is enrolling multiple proof-of-concept studies in myeloma, lymphoma, CLL and hepatocellular carcinoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. The data obtained will allow us to start making pivotal decisions in the first half of 2017.  In addition, and as highlighted at our research meeting in New York earlier this month, our new AML CELMoD, CC-90009, has progressed into Phase I. And we have identified additional CELMoD successor compounds with high potential in various hematological malignancies. 
In summary, our Hematology & Oncology franchise has had another outstanding quarter. Our key brands have delivered strong financial performance, and the momentum gives us the confidence to raise our outlook for 2016 and 2017. Our early- and late-stage clinical programs have advanced nicely during the quarter, and the acquisition of EngMab is a perfect fit for our myeloma and lymphoma pipeline. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott."

Q3 was an important quarter for I&I, full of advancement for both our marketed and pipeline assets. With OTEZLA, we've seen revenue continue to accelerate throughout the quarter, with growth in both psoriasis and PSA indications, as demand, market share and persistency continue to increase. At the same time, we have expanded the global access footprint for OTEZLA. As of this month, reimbursement for OTEZLA has now been achieved in 20 countries worldwide.  In Q3, we advanced development of our pipeline programs, progressing multiple assets through important milestones. 
Turning now to OTEZLA. Global net sales in Q3 were $275 million. This represents a 98% year-on-year increase. Sales in Q3 continued to grow despite the regular market declines in prescribing typically seen in the summer months. While we remain focused on the launch execution in Germany and other early launch markets, we were able to achieve critical reimbursement decisions from several key European markets. NICE granted a positive opinion for OTEZLA in psoriasis, which reverses previous guidance and enables access for patients in England and Wales. With multiple positive reimbursement decisions in hand, we are now preparing to execute the next wave of launches in the EU. 
Focusing now on the U.S. market dynamics. The physician consumer campaigns continue to drive increases in demand for OTEZLA. With the sustained leadership position in new to brand share, we are seeing a continued rise in market share for OTEZLA, which now represents more than 1/5 of the systemic-treated psoriasis market. Consistent with the OTEZLA value proposition on pricing strategy today, much of this growth is coming from the pre-biologic market segment. 
Last week, the interim results from the GED-0301 CD-001 trial were represented as a late breaker at UEGW meeting in Vienna. These results represented early exploratory look at the data and are part of a broader development program that is well underway. As a reminder, the objective of the study was to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic improvements in a broader, more difficult-to-treat Crohn's population than studied previously. It enrolled 63 patients across 3 active treatment groups. All patients had a confirmed endoscopic damage at baseline and clinically advanced disease. The CD-001 results are generally consistent with the clinical outcomes seen in the placebo-controlled IGON program and support GED utilization across a broad Crohn's patient population. With the IGON studies, there was compelling evidence to view GED-0301 as a potentially transformational therapy. As an oral treatment with unprecedented rates and clinical response and remission and negligible systemic exposure, it could allow patients to be treated in a fundamentally different way than other therapies in development or on the market. 
In CD-001, with a more heterogeneous population, GED-0301 demonstrated meaningful clinical and endoscopic outcomes across different patient types, including CNS naïve in failures, those with prior surgeries as well as patients with proximal and distal disease. Once confirmed in pivotal programs, we are confident that this product will be transformational for patient care. Data rollout is expected to continue through the rest of the year. The focus of these data will be the 3- and 4-year results from the PALACE and ESTEEM programs, which show a highly differentiated benefit risk profile for OTEZLA relative to other competitive products. Data from positive Phase II studies for RPC4046 in EoE and CC-220 in lupus will also be disseminated. 
Q3 was a quarter full of advancement for Celgene I&I. OTEZLA's share and duration continue to improve, while access gains expand the geographic breadth of the product. OTEZLA is well on track to achieve blockbusters data from 2016 and in the years to come. We moved all major development programs ahead and look forward to multiple upcoming proof-of-concept study readouts, including GED and OTEZLA in the UC, ozanimod in Crohn's disease and CC-220 in cutaneous lupus. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio. 
Thank you for your attention this morning, and I'd like to turn the call over to Jackie."

Quarters like this are only made possible by the cumulative hard work of our teams around the world, work that builds over time to produce the type of momentum we are currently generating. Our Q3 performance demonstrates we are stronger than ever, and we advance into 2017 and the coming years in a great position. Our 2016 milestone chart shows us well on track to achieve what we set out to achieve this year, and we feel very good about where we are at this point in the fourth quarter.  Even though there are only 2 months remaining in the year, there is still exciting data to be presented at AACR, ASH, San Antonio Breast and other medical meetings, so stay tuned for those presentations. 
This year, we started to see data readouts from the Phase III trials in our pipeline. This is just the beginning of a multiyear period, during which we will have readouts on a number of potentially transformative programs. Michael and Scott spoke about some of these. The Phase III trials still to read out over the coming 12 to 24 months give us the potential to see upside for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapies; to expand ABRAXANE's presence in pancreatic cancer; to take REVLIMID into lymphoma; to further expand and diversify our myeloid business; to see the expansion and diversification of our I&I franchise with 2 new compounds, ozanimod and GED-0301, and 2 new therapeutic categories, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease; and much more. We will also have Phase II and proof-of-concept data for a number of indications across several compounds, including CC-122, CC-220, durvalumab, CAR-T, CC-486 and demcizumab, and the flow of data will be strong and steady for some time to come. 
On the commercial side, building on the strong momentum of 2016 and 2017, we look forward to launches across multiple geographies for REVLIMID in the stem-cell transplant setting of newly diagnosed myeloma; the U.S. launch of AG-221 in IDH2-mutated AML; the ongoing global uptake of triplet regimens on IMiD backbones; and the geographic expansion of OTEZLA, including the important market of Japan. These commercial catalysts and the clinical catalysts I highlighted give us high confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2017 and 2020 targets and produce strong growth for many years beyond.

So there's a very distinct opportunity. When it comes to the U.S., there is usage driven by the data, but I can remind you as to what happened with our NDMM launch in elderly patients. So once we had the launch and the opportunity to really talk about it and educate, the market shares and the duration went up. And we're going to see the same thing happening in the U.S. So -- in this situation. So it's an opportunity for both sides of the Atlantic, although, I would say, the opportunity for Europe is probably slightly bigger. So that's the first part of the question. With the second part, you're right. And talking about treatment duration, you just have to think about kind of where we are with progression-free survival with the triplet combination. At this moment of time, those which are approved already provide anything between 20 to 28 months. Our current treatment duration in the U.S. is 18 months. And then you have the POLLUX trial that was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, where we were talking about progression-free survival of 40 to 50 months. Treatment duration needs a little bit of time to build up, and that's the point that I wanted to make. Once a drug is available and the clinical data is there and approval is there, it needs a little bit of time to build up. So we need to go beyond the 18 months. I think when you're looking at our results, we already see kind of the impact of the treatment duration really impacting very positively. With our new label in transplant-eligible NDMM and with the POLLUX data, we think this is going to accelerate even further."

The REVLIMID, daratumumab data is actually really intriguing because 40 to 50 months of progression-free survival in relapsed/refractory myeloma is absolutely intriguing. Is that going to have an impact on the overall treatment segment sequence in pomalidomide? Yes, likely. But I think it's going to be in a way that -- especially in the U.S., REVLIMID, daratumumab is going to be quickly taken up the first-line usage as it is such a great regimen. And that allows pomalidomide to then really go into the second-line space and be used immediately after. So if you have a great triplet to start with, you want to have another triplet to go on with. And the sequence of REVLIMID and pomalidomide is actually extremely compelling, and that's what -- something we're seeing already in the market happening."

And I still owe Geoff kind of also the question that you were just asking. So the treatment duration in Europe is not quite where the U.S. is, and it's understandable because a lot of the duration in the U.S., of course, is driven by this year-long availability of RD in first-line treatment. So in Europe, we are at roundabout 13 to 14 months at this moment of time, increasing foreseeingly with the NDMM launch. And as I said, in the U.S., a first usage, 18 months; and then aggregate use, 24 months. So there's still a really good way to go for Europe, and the NDMM launch is going to absolutely drive this. With your question of NDMM pricing, I think the speed upon which we've been getting the 20 reimbursements in Europe should provide you with confidence that there is a lot of appreciation of the data and the value proposition of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma with payers. So we -- and by the way, the overall survival data and the MM-020 data is really driving that, and we're happy to being able to provide an update of this data at ASH so you can all look at this. As a consequence, the price reductions that you have to have in some European markets, not in all, but in some, with a new label were absolutely moderate and 100% in line with our expectation. Of course, there is this trend in the U.S., where you can maintain the price or increase the price upon value proposition. And in Europe, payers are driving you down. So the trends, of course, of prices in the U.S. and Europe are absolutely not the same. What I can tell you is that we are extremely happy with the speed, but then also with the appreciation and support that we got by payers in the NDMM situation in Europe."

That said, these data are really going to provide us with very, very important information for the future positioning and investigation of CELMoDs in CLL. And we think that there is a very distinct need for better therapies in CLL, and we think also that CELMoD is an excellent drug class for that purpose.

We're going to show myeloma study -- Myeloma XI data in induction and maintenance from the biggest myeloma study ever, and I hope you're all going to be there when those data is going to be presented.

And I think the right way of answering it is just reminding ourselves that there is -- when we're thinking about multiple myeloma, there's still segments with a very distinct medical need. So there is absolutely the need to bring better therapies, although we see now all these triplet data reading out. When we're thinking about patients who are relapsing very, very quickly, and it's actually 25% to 30% after post-REVLIMID and daratumumab, when we're thinking about patients with high risks such as genetic features, when we're thinking of patients who are relapsing after daratumumab and pomalidomide. There's many patient segments that under -- even with the available current therapies, are really not doing well. That's the first point that I wanted to make. The second point, BCMA is really a great target. It's selectively expressed. It's almost expressed in 100% of the multiple myeloma patients. It's not a really ideal target for immune therapies. And having both platforms available, which is CAR-T and CD-3-redirected killing, gives us really the opportunity to start thinking about treatment sequence. So you could think about using one earlier and the other one later, using it in the same patient, think about induction therapy, or if the patient relapses after one, you can use the other one. And then there is a third element that I think is very important. CAR-T is not for everyone. CAR-T is for younger patients, and there will be some reimbursement questions around CAR-T, so you are really happy then if you have an antibody in your portfolio with the same -- going against the same target. And then finally, I just wanted to make this remark. Apart from having both, we really have very distinct combination opportunities. We will be able to combine with IMiDs. We will be able to combine with checkpoint inhibitors. Everything we have in our portfolio is extremely complementary, so we feel extremely good about that."

So I think there was a lot of really important learnings for those who were at ESMO and coming back. I think the way to look at the space at this moment of time is that there is a rather small and well-defined population of high-expressing PDL-1 that is going to be treated with monotherapy. Everybody else is obviously needing a combination, and there's an option of treating those patients either with I/O, I/O combinations or with I/O, chemo combination. When I'm looking at the data and I'm talking to key opinion leaders, there's a little bit of a sentiment to say like -- you have a very low or no PDL-1 expression that will be a preference for chemotherapy. And of course, the data from the larger randomized studies has to play out at the end of the day, and there will be some overlaps between those segments and the usage of both. But I think what's definitely worth to be said is that at ESMO, the combination of chemo and I/O was absolutely strengthened. We think we are extremely well positioned with that. The data that we've been showing with ABRAXANE dicentric are extremely positive. And we're looking forward to having our data being reading out."

What we're seeing from a commercial perspective, and I do believe I had a slide that addressed this, approximately 90% of patients are coming to OTEZLA therapy from something other than a biologic. So they're either switching off an oral, switching off topical or coming onto OTEZLA from nothing and on and only 10% are coming on from a biologic therapy. In terms of duration, what we're seeing is duration at 1 year, which looks at the high biologic range. And so the -- we feel very good about that duration. Certainly, well above what you see for other oral compounds in the space. So the duration of therapy actually looks quite good. One thing from the clinical studies that is very heartening to me and there's some 4-year data, which will come out in a little while, and that says that 65% of the patients who finished 1 year in the clinical trial were still on drug at 4 years, which is really unprecedented. And these were in PsA studies, which is really unprecedented relative to data from any other comparator or any other clinical trial. So the compliance is good for 1 -- through 1 year. I can't -- I don't have the commercial experience to say what it looks like for 2 years or 3 years because we don't have that data yet. But we believe the compliance will continue and continue to get better over time."

I think I would like to start your question with kind of what we've been saying a couple of times already. I think with the upcoming approval of REVLIMID [indiscernible] NDMM in maintenance, this is going to be the standard, and it's going to broadly applied. It's already used very broadly in the U.S. based, by the way, upon data that we've been obtaining from 3 studies and we – during the meta-analysis, really nice to show the 2.5 years overall survival benefit. Those are very strong data. Now the application and the usage and the uptake is going to start in Europe. That's the first thing I wanted to say. There is an ongoing study of daratumumab in that indication, but maintenance is really a long-term game. If you think back about kind of when we started to put REVLIMID into maintenance, and we are now at the point of really going to the finish line, this is something that takes multiple years. And I just wanted to, once again, say the usage and the approval is driven upon overall survival data that we've been generating from multiple studies, and the bar here is 2.5 years on overall survival benefit. Thinking about our future iMiDs, is there a place for them in maintenance? Maybe. We are particularly excited when we're looking at those iMiDs and Rupert has been talking about those in New York because they have a very, very deep B-cell kill effect. So whether those are going to be primarily used in maintenance or not needs to be decided, but I would not rule it out."

But the use of triplets is really picking up very, very quickly. And the reason is very, very clear. When you're looking at the progression-free survival and the response rate and the depth of the response that you can get, there's a compelling reason to do so. There's multiple opportunities. But I would make the argument that also in the foreseeable future, if you're an elderly frail patient or if you're a standard-risk patient, doublets remain a very attractive option. So that's the first point that I wanted to make. When coming to the second point of your question, we really think that REVLIMID and pomalidomide are great drugs. We really are compelled by the New England Journal publication that we've been seeing in the New England Journal of Medicine. Even when you look at the best available data, and I was trying to say this, 25% to 30% of patients even with Rev/Dex daratumumab are relapsing after 6 to 12 months. There is extremely limited options if a patient is relapsing after daratumumab or after pomalidomide. And the overall survival of patients with high risk, such as genetic features, despite all these new available therapies is still only 3 or 4 years. That's very bad. That's absolutely not good enough. We can define these patient populations very clearly. We can define them clinically. We can define them molecularly, and this is exactly where we want to test our new CELMoDs in. And we feel extremely good about that."

So when we're looking at the pomalidomide duration both in the U.S. and Europe, it's steadily increasing. What I can share with you is that the treatment duration in the U.S. is now over 10 months. A lot of that is driven by 2 factors: a, the use in combinatorial therapy. There's a lot of data available. NCCN guidance has recently been updated, and there's going to be, by the way, increasing use. As you heard, pomalidomide, daratumumab is submitted to the FDA, and there's a PDUFA date available. So that's one element driving pomalidomide duration, the usage in combination. The other element is the increasing usage earlier in therapy. So if you use REVLIMID either in combination, as I was trying to say earlier, and patients are relapsing afterwards, you want to have another triplet right after again with an IMiDs and another combination partner. And that's exactly what we are seeing. And I think the great performance of pomalidomide that we had in the third quarter is really a reflection of exactly that."

And then two, as we think about the evolution of Celgene post-REVLIMID genericization in mid-2020s, how do you think about Celgene's ability to grow through a REVLIMID patent cliff in a theoretical scenario, where REVLIMID outperformance makes it more difficult to grow through that cliff or even keep through that -- flat through that cliff?"

I think we have always had a tendency to be a little bit conservative in terms of when we look forward what we put in our models for duration. And we have wanted to wait and see what actual experience is in the marketplace and think about how the data supports that. So I think as everything has played out, it's gone extremely well. And on a go-forward basis, we would expect that to continue. So with respect to your question about the patent issue -- and I think we've at least highlighted this, if not completely quantitatively directionally, in some of the things that we have been presenting. We have a tremendous number of things going on in the pipeline not only in the multiple myeloma area, where all of the things that Michael and Mark and others have spoken about today, including BCMA and other things that we have going on. So we see great potential to continue to have a very strong multiple myeloma franchise for a long time to come. While that is happening, we've also got this great diversification coming in the I&I business, tremendous growth there. We have a lot going on in the myeloid space, where it's a franchise that we talk about a little bit less maybe just because today, it's nowhere near the size of the myeloma business. But we see that business growing tremendously. And then, Michael has also talked about some of the things that we've learned with respect to CLL and other diseases that are not in the model at all. So I think there's a lot of optionality in the portfolio, and we feel very confident in our ability as we get out there to continue to grow for a long time beyond 2026."

We all have a big cold, and we pass it to each other in this room. So the first thing I really wanted to say is CD47 is really a part of this growing opportunity that -- and pipeline that Celgene has been building in I/O. We have new CELMoDs at play in that space. We have cellular therapy, and we talked about BCMA, CAR-T, and we talked about our CD19 program. We have multiple opportunities regarding T-cells not just through our cooperation with AZ, but also other checkpoint inhibitors that we are extremely interested in, both on the activating and on the suppressing side. And I think CD47 plays extremely nicely into this whole building toolbox that we haven't -- having as it's an ability to really activate macrophages. So we see this in the context of this building our I/O pipeline. That's number one. And of course, we were trying to test it very broadly. We're starting in acute -- in AML. As you well know, there is the opportunity to take this asset into more diseases. Lymphoma comes to mind. Solid tumors comes to mind. But AML/MDS is certainly amongst the first indications that we're interested in. We hope to obtain a strong signal, and then we're going to see and how to take it forward."

The triplet usage in the U.S. is, of course, already broader. In Europe, you always have to take this -- the reimbursement hurdle. But triplets are increasingly also reimbursed in Europe. So where we see a really steep increase at this moment of time is through truly in combination of REVLIMID and dexamethasone with Velcade, based upon the data of SWOG 777, the first-line study that has been presented roundabout a year ago. And just to remind everybody, compared with Rd alone has a 12 months overall survival benefit. So that's quite a lot. There's a lot of usage of this combination, not just in an elderly population. That's what we see, but in also certainly in the induction setting. What makes this very compelling, and when we're thinking about Europe, is certainly the fact that at a certain time point, Velcade is going to become generic. So you have a very well-tolerated, very effective triplet, which may come along with a very reasonable cost. We're putting a lot of effort behind this combination. And then of course, there is the combination of -- and I just wanted to point it out once again because the New England Journal of Medicine was so nice. The Rd, daratumumab combination, 40 to 50 months progression-free survival. That's going to drive our treatment duration big time, and we see it as a catalyst, again, starting in the U.S., but I have no doubt that it's also going to come to Europe."
