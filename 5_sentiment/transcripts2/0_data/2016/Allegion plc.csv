241782379,321866442,931267,"Allegion Plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Allegion plc","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.

Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results and closed out a very strong year. I'm proud of the company we have built over our first 2 years and believe we have one of the safest and most engaged workforce in the industry that drives a high level of execution and performance. 
Now onto the fourth quarter. Revenues of $545.4 million grew 4.8% on an organic basis, led by strength in the Americas and European regions. Total revenue declined 4.9%, reflecting the impacts of divestitures in foreign currency. Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million decreased to 2.9% versus the prior year, which again, reflects recent divestitures. We realized solid leverage on incremental volume, which improved overall operating margin by 40 basis points. The ability to deliver improved margins while absorbing incremental investments continues to demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of our business.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.89 increased 17% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by divestitures, incremental investments and foreign exchange impacts. This is our sixth straight quarter of double digits earnings per share growth. 
Please go to Slide 4. As we did last year, I'd like to step back and review our performance scorecard. We exceeded revenue expectations on a reported and organic basis. Markets performed as expected, and we achieved a high level of contribution from all -- from our new product introduction and channel-led initiatives. We delivered an effective tax rate below 22% and exceeded our adjusted EPS goals.
Before taking into account the realization of the lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high-end of our original guidance by $0.07. Our results demonstrate the benefit of a balanced investment in the business, which also fell within guidance range. And although available cash flow, as a percentage of earnings, exceeded original guidance, I would comment that cash flow is shown on a reported basis.
In 2015, this was somewhat distorted due to the onetime divestitures changes -- charges. As discussed last quarter, we expect to do a little better in absolute cash flow for the year, but we realized the reduction in collections associated with the Bocom Wincent business in Asia Pacific, which has now been divested.
Please go to Slide 5. If we look beyond the financial scorecard, our 2015 accomplishments demonstrate our continued focus on our 5  growth pillars: Core market expansion; innovation; opportunistic acquisitions; enterprise excellence; and growth in emerging markets. Allegion remains committed to health and safety of the company, which was evident by the improvement of our safety metrics that were already some of the best in the industry. We made the necessary decisions on divestitures and leverage acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio. We've managed our debt structure efficiency -- efficiently and made incremental investments to drive performance. Our growth in new products has been strong, with a vitality index that has doubled from the prior year. The business is executing at an extremely high level. The decisions and performance in 2015 have positioned us well for 2016.
Please go to Slide 6. When reflecting on the opportunities for long-term revenue growth, it's important to acknowledge knowledge the role of Allegion's well-rounded broad portfolio will play, especially in terms of electromechanical convergence. Our investments in new products will provide growth not just for 2016 but for sustaining growth in the future. In the residential market, resolutions include innovative products from our 2015 acquisitions in Schlage leading and trusted home automation products. In the fourth quarter, Schlage launch a next generation of electronic access solutions, including the Schlage Sense for residential homes, designed to work with Apple HomeKit as well as our Schlage Control smart blocks for multifamily use that streamlines operations for building managers while giving residents convenient smart cars and phone credentials.
In the commercial market, our historic pioneer brands like an Interflex are raising the bar in terms of innovative solutions for Allegion customers. And our acquisitions are also contributing as reflected by the SimonsVoss smart system, which was recently earned the well-renowned German design award. These products are just a sampling of our leading electromechanical solutions, which will continue to build out innovation in existing and new categories. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for both fourth quarter and full year. Our focus on the Allegion results and cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 4.8% and 5.4% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The strong organic growth reflects improved markets, the introduction of new products and the company's channel initiatives. Pricing was essentially flat in the quarter with favorable pricing in the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions were offset by slight decline in the Americas, driven by unfavorable residential pricing. 
Specific to the quarter, the residential business absorbed higher returns versus the prior year within the retail segment, as well as higher rebates, reflecting increased and while volume thresholds achieved within the quarter. It's important to note that the residential volumes were up low double digits in the quarter. Pricing for the commercial segment continues to get good traction. We continue to face foreign currency headwinds related to the strong U.S. dollar. However, the currency headwind is decelerating as noted by the negative 3.2% decline in the quarter as compared for the full year decline of 6.8%. 
And acquisitions contributed over $45 million in revenues for the quarter, which were more than offset by the divestitures of our Venezuela and Bocom businesses.
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $545.4 million. This reflects a decrease of 4.9% versus the prior year, up 4.8% on an organic basis. The reported revenue reflects the currency and divestiture headwinds discussed previously, which drove a 17.6% year-over-year decline. This was partially offset by acquisitions and strong organic growth in Americas, EMEIA and the Asia Pacific mechanical and electronic hardware business. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 28% compared to the prior-year period. In addition, we continue to make significant progress with our new product introductions and channel initiatives as reflected in the vitality index improvement mentioned by Dave earlier. Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million, declined 2.9% compared to the prior year. Good incremental volume leverage on continued progress in our EMEIA margin transformation are reflected in the adjusted operating margin and improved 40 basis points. These benefits also cover incremental investment headwind at 20 basis points. Excluding the divestiture of Venezuela and Bocom, year-over-year margins accelerated 120 basis points compared to the prior-year period. And the adjusted industry-leading EBITDA margin with 21.6% is a 110 basis point improvement versus the prior year and 160 basis points, excluding the divestitures. The business is executing on extremely high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and margin improvement in all regions while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.37, adjusting $0.39 for the prior year's operation and restructuring expenses and other items as noted, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.76. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12 as favorable operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts.
The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.08 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions, the continued execution of the companies tax strategies and the benefits of discreet tax item recorded in the quarter. Acquisitions added $0.05 in the quarter while divestitures were a $0.09 reduction. As you may remember, our Q3 guidance already anticipated a $0.05 headwind for the slowdown of the Bocom business. The actual results reflected an additional headwind versus prior guidance of approximately $0.03 related to the divestiture occurring sooner than previously forecasted.
Next, interest, currency in other income, were a net $0.02 reduction. The higher interest is related to the issuance with $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter. Other income primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities, partially offset by net currency losses. And lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were $0.01 reduction. This result in adjusted fourth quarter 2015 EPS of $0.89 per share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.15 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges, partially offset by favorable divestiture charge. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at the fourth quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.74.
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $383.1 million, down 2% or an increase of 6.6% on an organic basis. Reported revenue year-over-year comparisons were unfavorably impacted by currency movements in Canada and Colombia and the divestiture of the Venezuelan business. Strong organic growth reflects strong market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. As noted on the chart, we experienced a very strong residential performance, mid-single-digit growth in nonresidential products and strength in the electronics across the portfolio. Americas' adjusted operating income of $100.2 million, was up slightly versus the prior-year period. Incremental volume leverage and productivity more than cover the Venezuelan divestiture, higher inflation, foreign currency and investments. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 50 basis point headwind in the quarter. Excluding the Venezuela business from prior-year results, operating margins improved 140 basis points. The ability to drive growth, improve our market-leading margins and drag investments demonstrates excellent performance by the entire Americas team.
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter for the EMEIA region was $129.2 million, up 24.8% or up 3.1% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by acquisitions, and the organic growth partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions accounted for $35 million of the revenue increase in the quarter. Both SimonsVoss and AXA performed well in the quarter and are delivering on the expected results. The organic growth reflects pricing strength and hospitality, and general market improvements. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $17.6 million increased 51.7% versus the prior-year period. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the regions margin. And although it isn't reflected on the slide, the full year adjusted operating margin for EMEIA was 7.9%. If you remember, the 2013 adjusted operating margin for this business was approximately 1%. This is a significant accomplishment, and we feel we are well-positioned with continued margin improvement in 2016.
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $33.1 million, down 58% versus the prior year. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the system integration business, which drove a $55 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 43%. This reflects the contribution of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 12%. Organic growth was strong in Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $2.2 million was down $7.5 million, reflecting the divestiture. Operating margin, excluding the integration business, reflects a positive story, with an increase of 400 basis points versus the prior year. The operating margin improvement reflects volume leverage, productivity and accretive acquisitions that more than offset inflation and currency headwinds.
Please go to Slide #13. Available cash flow for 2015 was $222.2 million, an increase of $14.7 million compared to the prior-year period. The increase in the year-over-year cash flow is primarily due to reduced capital expenditures. Specific to capital expenditures, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million more in 2016 and 2015 for new product development, operations and IT projects. 
As noted on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. Although this recalibrates the baseline somewhat, it doesn't change our commitment to an effective and efficient working capital structure to maintain minimum levels of investment.
Please go to Slide #14. You remember our capital allocation strategy for our Investor Day that defines a balance and flexible approach. This reflected our strategy on day 1 remains our focus and commitment for 2016. We ended the year with a gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.5, which reflects the impact of the recent debt offering that facilitated our acquisitions in 2015. Given EBITDA growth and debt amortization, we will be able to quickly delever to be within our target range of 2.75 to 3.25. As Dave will mention later in the guidance, we continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2015 performance, we believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with higher returns on invested capital. We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. We have gained considerable experience, successfully integrating a number of acquisitions over the past year that have been accretive to our results. And the M&A pipeline continues to remain active. And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions to increase dividends that reflect strength and confidence and cash flow, and we'll continue to repurchase shares of the dilution and to be opportunistic when appropriate. In summary, due to the consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to yield high returns for our shareholders. I'll now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We expect continued growth in our primary markets in 2016 but recognize that we are in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility. Our expectation is that the organic investments combined with our ability to execute will deliver better than market growth. In the Americas, our exposure to nonresidential construction markets remain a positive. However, U.S. GDP levels are forecasted to remain below 3%, which I believe is a point that defines sustained growth. And if you were to review industry assessments for commercial markets today, you would find a wide variance in expectations. We remain positive but cautious in this area. 
On the institutional markets, we continue to expect slow improvement, characterized by more balanced educational demand between K-12 and higher education. [indiscernible]  school initiatives and school security upgrades is evident when you review state legislative priorities. The outlook for health care remains more subdued in 2016 with flat to moderate increases. Overall, we anticipate low to mid-single-digit growth for the nonresidential segment. The U.S. residential market will continue to increase mid-single digits, driven by both builder and Big Box segments. Single-family home construction will continue its recovery, although we continue to expect segment by labor and land availability. The multifamily segment will continue to grow, but we expect a deceleration in the rate of growth as compared to the last few years. 
Consolidating the market outlooks. We project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6% and reported revenue growth of 4% to 5%, reflecting some currency pressure. From the European region, with anticipate low single-digit market growth overall. We expect continued growth in the German and U.K. markets and modest growth and Italy. We believe a recovery France will continue to lag, and we expect further contraction in Eastern Europe. For the region, we project organic growth of 1% to 3%. When we combine the impacts of acquisitions partially offset by currency, we project reported revenue growth of 25% to 27% for the year. The Asia Pacific markets continue to show low to mid-single-digit growth in residential and nonresidential segments. Our current portfolio reduces our risks to the slowing China economy and positions us well in Australia, New Zealand and Korea. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 5% to 7% and total revenue is estimated to decline 16% to 18%, which reflects the system integration divestiture. All in, we are projecting organic growth of 4% to 5%. Incorporating the net benefit of acquisitions that offset divestitures and currency headwinds, we expect total revenue to grow to 7% to 8%.
Please go to Slide 16. Our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range is $3.25 to $3.40, an increase of 7% to 12%. The earnings increases is primarily driven by operational improvements and the net benefit of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by investments in the business, currency headwind, interest and a higher effective tax rate assumed to be between 18% and 19% for the year. We are forecasting strong organic growth in margin expansion in all of our reporting regions. Incremental investments, which are forecasted to be lower in 2015, will be focused on new products and channel development to meet demands of the electro-mechanical conversion, as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. Our guidance assumed outstanding diluted shares of approximately 97 million, which reflects the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with buybacks. Restructuring and acquisition expenses are expected to be in the range of negative $0.05 to $0.10, resulting in a reported EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35.
Please go to Slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2015 results that deliver organic revenue growth over 5% and increased our operating margins by 50 basis points. The growth of both revenue margin will make investments in our business demonstrate the disciplined approach we set out 2 years ago. We've made tremendous progress improving our European profitability, from slightly positive 2 years ago to an 8% rate today. It's truly a great accomplishment by the entire team to achieve these results so quickly. And we delivered on our effective tax rate commitments, sustaining below 20%. We continue to generate strong cash flow and are recognizing growth from our organic investments. We look forward to 2016 as an opportunity to build on our prior results. Although we expect continued market volatility in currency headwinds, we remain focused on our growth strategies to guide us through the challenging markets. We have a safe and strong team in place, committed to our vision to make the world safer and secure the places where people thrive. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

From a volume perspective, again, really strong organic growth in 2015. There was a couple of quarters early in the year easier comparisons. But volume is still anticipated to be fairly strong but down a little bit year-over-year. If you look at the margins for the full year, we showed a little slight improvement. And I'll just remind you that was kind of weighted down a little bit because of the Venezuela divestiture. Extracting that, we had pretty good margin growth. We're on a path now. We've got pretty good visibility to productivity, and we'll participate in a deflationary economy that we're seeing in commodities. And we'll continue to get good leverage on the incremental volumes. So I would anticipate the margin improvement to accelerate a little bit in 2016 based on the incremental volume forecasted."

Having said that, if you kind of break out the components and you look at the base business, continue really excellent execution relative to our march towards the 10% target, I'd say, we ended the year pretty much in line with our expectations. Moving some of the production of our facility this year, we'll continue to get us productivity benefits in '16 and some carry forward in '17 after that's completed. And so I feel really good about the progress there. The acquisitions completed last year are accretive to the margins in the region. And so what you saw collectively, we ended  -- pretty much on a full year basis, close to 8%, which was about 400 basis point improvement compared to full year 2014. You're looking at 2016 at a low kind of double-digit margin range. And I'd just remind you also that there's a big delta between EBIT and EBITDA margins in that region because of the acquisitions. EBITDA margins would be in the neighborhood of mid- to high-teens, which is fairly significant and kind of in line with our peer group in the region."

On the investments, as we highlighted in the Investor Day last year in March, we did highlight we expected that to start tapering down a little bit. You're correct in that. We continue to annualize that to offer annual operating plans. We believe that from a capital allocation perspective to the extent we can drive good organic growth that have really strong returns on invested capital, we're going to make those bets. And because of the traction we've seen relative to electronic products growth and the channel initiative here in North America, we're accelerating some of those things. So that's why it's down year-over-year. But maybe not as down as what you'd anticipated. But I still think it's good return on capital. Relative to your incremental margin question, I think it's a pretty good way that you're looking at it. 50% is high. We've always kind of stated this 40% type of target, and we really delivered on that. And in 2015, the extra benefit we're getting in this deflationary economy specific the commodities is we'll start seeing that come into our numbers a little bit more than what we saw in 2015, just given the spot rates raids relative to the average rates in 2015."

The other thing to keep in mind, we've historically targeted 100% of earnings. If you run the math, you wouldn't be saying that for 2016. The primary purpose or reason for that is because, in 2015, we recorded some restructuring costs associated with the manufacturing relocation. And those cash expenditures haven't yet happened. That will occur in 2016, so that's putting a drag on that ratio. But even with that, still pretty good cash flow conversion, and we'll put it to use in the best way possible."

241782379,321866442,931515,"Allegion Plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Allegion plc","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.

Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results and closed out a very strong year. I'm proud of the company we have built over our first 2 years and believe we have one of the safest and most engaged workforce in the industry that drives a high level of execution and performance. 
Now on to the fourth quarter. Revenues of $545.4 million grew 4.8% on an organic basis, led by strength in the Americas and European regions. Total revenue declined 4.9%, reflecting the impacts of divestitures in foreign currency. Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million decreased to 2.9% versus the prior year, which again reflects recent divestitures. We realized solid leverage on incremental volume, which improved overall operating margin by 40 basis points. The ability to deliver improved margins while absorbing incremental investments continues to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our business.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.89 increased 17% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by divestitures, incremental investments and foreign exchange impact. This is our sixth straight quarter of double digits earning per share growth. 
Please go to Slide 4. As we did last year, I'd like to step back and review our performance scorecard. We exceeded revenue expectations on a reported and organic basis. Markets performed as expected, and we achieved a high level of contribution from all -- from our new product introduction and channel-led initiatives. We delivered an effective tax rate below 22% and exceeded our adjusted EPS goals.
Before taking into account the realization of the lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high-end of our original guidance by $0.07. Our results demonstrate the benefit of a balanced investment in the business, which also fell within guidance range. And although available cash flow, as a percentage of earnings, exceeded original guidance, I would comment that cash flow is shown on a reported basis.
In 2015, this was somewhat distorted due to the onetime divestiture changes -- charges. As discussed last quarter, we expect to do a little better in absolute cash flow for the year, but we realized a reduction in collections associated with the Bocom Wincent business in Asia Pacific, which has now been divested.
Please go to Slide 5. If we look beyond the financial scorecard, our 2015 accomplishments demonstrate our continued focus on our 5 growth pillars: core market expansion, innovation, opportunistic acquisitions, enterprise excellence and growth in emerging markets. 
Allegion remains committed to health and safety as a company, which was evident by the improvement of our safety metrics that were already some of the best in the industry. We made the necessary decisions on divestitures and leveraged acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio. We've managed our debt structure efficiency -- efficiently and made incremental investments to drive performance. Our growth in new products has been strong, with a vitality index that has doubled from the prior year. The business is executing at an extremely high level. The decisions and performance in 2015 have positioned us well for 2016.
Please go to Slide 6. When reflecting on the opportunities for long-term revenue growth, it's important to acknowledge the role Allegion's well-rounded brand portfolio will play, especially in terms of electromechanical convergence. Our investments in new products will provide growth not just for 2016, but for sustaining growth in the future. In the residential market, those resolutions include innovative products from our 2015 acquisitions in Schlage leading and trusted home automation products. In the fourth quarter, Schlage launched the next-generation of electronic access solutions, including the Schlage Sense for residential homes, designed to work with Apple HomeKit, as well as our Schlage Control Smart Locks for multifamily use that streamlines operations for building managers while giving residents convenient smart card and phone credentials.
In the commercial market, our historic pioneer brands like Von Duprin, CISA and Interflex are raising the bar in terms of innovative solutions for Allegion customers. And our acquisitions are also contributing as reflected by the SimonsVoss SmartIntego system, which was recently earned the well-renowned German Design Award. These products are just a sampling of our leading electromechanical solutions, which will continue to build out innovation in existing and new categories. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for both fourth quarter and full year. I'll focus on the Allegion results and cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 4.8% and 5.4% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The strong organic growth reflects improved markets, the introduction of new products and the company's channel initiatives. Pricing was essentially flat in the quarter, with favorable pricing in the EMEIA, and Asia Pacific regions were offset by slight decline in the Americas, driven by unfavorable residential pricing. 
Specific to the quarter, the residential business absorbed higher returns versus the prior year within the retail segment as well as higher rebates reflecting increased annual volume thresholds achieved within the quarter. It is important to note that the residential volumes were up low double-digits in the quarter. Pricing for the commercial segment continues to get good traction. We continue to face foreign currency headwinds related to the strong U.S. dollar. However, the currency headwind is decelerating as noted by the negative 3.2% decline in the quarter as compared to the full year decline of 6.8%. And acquisitions contributed over $45 million in revenues in the quarter, which were more than offset by the divestitures of our Venezuela and Bocom businesses.
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $545.4 million. This reflects a decrease of 4.9% versus the prior year, up 4.8% on an organic basis. The reported revenue reflects the currency and divestiture headwinds discussed previously, which drove a 17.6% year-over-year decline. This was partially offset by acquisitions and strong organic growth in Americas, EMEIA and the Asia Pacific mechanical and electronic hardware business. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 28% compared to the prior year period. In addition, we continue to make significant progress with our new product introductions and channel initiatives as reflected in the vitality index improvement mentioned by Dave earlier. 
Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million declined 2.9% compared to the prior year. Good incremental volume leverage on continued progress in our EMEIA margin transformation are reflected in the adjusted operating margin and improved 40 basis points. These benefits also covered incremental investment headwind at 20 basis points. Excluding the divestiture of Venezuela and Bocom, year-over-year margins accelerated 120 basis points compared to the prior year period. And the adjusted industry-leading EBITDA margin of 21.6% is a 110-basis-point improvement versus the prior year and 160 basis points excluding the divestitures. The business is executing at an extremely high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and margin improvement in all regions while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.37, adjusting $0.39 for the prior year's separation and restructuring expenses and other items as noted. The 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.76. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12 as favorable operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.08 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions, the continued execution of the company's tax strategies and the benefits of discrete tax item recorded in the quarter. 
Acquisitions added $0.05 in the quarter, while divestitures were a $0.09 reduction. As you may remember, our Q3 guidance already anticipated a $0.05 headwind for the slowdown of the Bocom business. The actual results reflect an additional headwind versus prior guidance of approximately $0.03 related to the divestiture occurring sooner than previously forecasted.
Next, interest, currency and other income were a net $0.02 reduction. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter. Other income primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities, partially offset by net currency losses. 
And lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.01 reduction. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2015 EPS of $0.89 per share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.15 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges, partially offset by favorable divestiture charge. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at the fourth quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.74.
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $383.1 million, down 2% or an increase of 6.6% on an organic basis. Reported revenue year-over-year comparisons were unfavorably impacted by currency movements in Canada and Colombia and the divestiture of the Venezuelan business. Strong organic growth reflects strong market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. 
As noted on the chart, we experienced very strong residential performance, mid-single-digit growth in nonresidential products and strength in electronics across the portfolio. Americas adjusted operating income of $100.2 million was up slightly versus the prior year period. Incremental volume leverage and productivity more than covered the Venezuelan divestiture, higher inflation, foreign currency and investments. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points, while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 50-basis-point headwind in the quarter. Excluding the Venezuela business from prior year results, operating margins improved 140 basis points. The ability to drive growth, improve our market-leading margins and drive investments demonstrates excellent performance by the entire Americas team.
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter for the EMEIA region were $129.2 million, up 24.8% or up 3.1% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by acquisitions and the organic growth, partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions accounted for $35 million of the revenue increase in the quarter. Both SimonsVoss and AXA performed well in the quarter and are delivering on the expected results. The organic growth reflects price and strength in hospitality, Interflex and general market improvements. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $17.6 million, increased 51.7% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. And although it isn't reflected on the slide, the full year adjusted operating margin for EMEIA was 7.9%. If you remember, the 2013 adjusted operating margin for this business was approximately 1%. This is a significant accomplishment, and we feel we are well positioned for continued margin improvement in 2016.
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $33.1 million, down 58% versus the prior year. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the system integration business, which drove a $55 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 43%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 12%. Organic growth was strong in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $2.2 million was down $7.5 million, reflecting the divestiture. Operating margin excluding the integration business reflects a positive story, with an increase of 400 basis points versus the prior year. The operating margin improvement reflects volume leverage, productivity and accretive acquisitions that more than offset inflation and currency headwinds.
Please go to Slide #13. Available cash flow for 2015 was $222.2 million, an increase of $14.7 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in the year-over-year cash flow is primarily due to reduced capital expenditures. Specific to capital expenditures, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million more in 2016 and 2015 for new product development, operations and IT projects. 
As noted on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. Although this recalibrates the baseline somewhat, it doesn't change our commitment to an effective and efficient working capital structure to maintain minimum levels of investment.
Please go to Slide #14. You remember our capital allocation strategy for our Investor Day that defines a balanced and flexible approach. This reflected our strategy on Day 1 and remains our focus and commitment for 2016. We ended the year with a gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.5, which reflects the impact of the recent debt offering that facilitated our acquisitions in 2015. Given EBITDA growth and debt amortization, we'll be able to quickly delever to be within our targeted range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
As Dave will mention later in the guidance, we continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2015 performance, we believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with higher returns on invested capital. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. We have gained considerable experience, successfully integrating a number of acquisitions over the past year that have been accretive to our results, and the M&A pipeline continues to remain active. 
And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends that reflect strength and confidence in cash flow, and we will continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution and to be opportunistic when appropriate. In summary, due to the consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to yield high returns for our shareholders. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide 15. We expect continued growth in our primary markets in 2016, but recognize that we are in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility. Our expectation is that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will deliver better than market growth. 
In the Americas, our exposure to nonresidential construction markets remain a positive. However, U.S. GDP levels are forecasted to remain below 3%, which I believe is a point that defines sustained growth. And if you were to review industry assessments for commercial markets today, you would find a wide variance in expectations. We remain positive but cautious in this area. 
On the institutional markets, we continue to expect slow improvement, characterized by more balanced educational demand between K-12 and higher education. Since Safe School initiatives and the need for school security upgrade, it's evident when you review state legislative priorities. 
The outlook for health care remains more subdued in 2016, with flat to moderate increases. Overall, we anticipate low to mid-single-digit growth for the nonresidential segment. 
The U.S. residential market will continue to increase mid-single digits, driven by both builder and Big Box segments. Single-family home construction will continue its recovery, although we continue to expect variance in this segment, driven by labor and land availability. The multifamily segment will continue to grow, but we expect a deceleration in the rate of growth as compared to the last few years. 
Consolidating the market outlooks, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6% and reported revenue growth of 4% to 5%, reflecting some currency pressure. 
From the European region, with anticipate low single-digit market growth overall. We expect continued growth in the German and U.K. markets and modest growth in Italy. We believe a recovery France will continue to lag, and we expect further contraction in Eastern Europe. For the region, we project organic growth of 1% to 3%. When we combine the impacts of acquisitions partially offset by currency, we project reported revenue growth of 25% to 27% for the year. 
The Asia Pacific markets continue to show low to mid-single-digit growth in residential and nonresidential segments. Our current portfolio reduces our risks to the slowing China economy and positions us well in Australia, New Zealand and Korea. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 5% to 7%, and total revenue is estimated to decline 16% to 18%, which reflects the system integration divestiture. 
All in, we are projecting organic growth of 4% to 5%. Incorporating the net benefit of acquisitions that offset divestitures and currency headwinds, we expect total revenue to grow to 7% to 8%.
Please go to Slide 16. Our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range is $3.25 to $3.40, an increase of 7% to 12%. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and the net benefit of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by investments in the business, currency headwind, interest and a higher effective tax rate assumed to be between 18% and 19% for the year. We are forecasting strong organic growth in margin expansion in all of our reporting regions. 
Incremental investments, which are forecasted to be lower in 2015, will be focused on new products and channel development to meet demands of the electro-mechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. 
Our guidance assumes outstanding diluted shares of approximately 97 million, which reflects the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with buybacks. 
Restructuring and acquisition expenses are expected to be in the range of negative $0.05 to $0.10, resulting in a reported EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35.
Please go to Slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2015 results that delivered organic revenue growth of over 5% and increased our operating margins by 50 basis points. The growth of both revenue margin, while making investments in our business, demonstrates the disciplined approach we set out 2 years ago. 
We made tremendous progress improving our European profitability, from slightly positive 2 years ago to an 8% rate today. It's truly a great accomplishment by the entire team to achieve these results so quickly. 
And we delivered on our effective tax rate commitments, sustaining below 20%. We continue to generate strong cash flow and are recognizing growth from our organic investments. 
We look forward to 2016 as an opportunity to build on our prior results. Although we expect continued market volatility and currency headwinds, we remain focused on our growth strategies to guide us through the challenging markets. We have a safe and strong team in place, committed to our vision to make the world safer and secure the places where people thrive. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

If you kind of look at the components in organic growth, we ended 2015 full year pricing of about 50 basis points improvement. A little pressure from the residential segment but getting pretty good traction on the commercial segment. I would expect this to show a little improvement there in 2016. From a volume perspective, again, really strong organic growth in 2015. There was a couple of quarters early in the year, easier comparisons. But volume is still anticipated to be fairly strong, but down a little bit year-over-year. If you look at the margins for the full year, we showed a slight improvement. And I'll just remind you, that was kind of weighted down a little bit because of the Venezuela divestiture. Extracting that, we had pretty good margin growth. We're on a path now. We've got pretty good visibility to productivity. We'll participate in a deflationary economy that we're seeing in commodities. And we'll continue to get good leverage on the incremental volumes. So I would anticipate the margin improvement to accelerate a little bit in 2016, basis of the incremental volume forecasted."

Having said that, if you kind of break out the components and you look at the base business, continue really excellent execution relative to our march towards the 10% target, I'd say we ended the year pretty much in line with our expectations. Moving the -- some of the production out of our CISA facility this year will continue to get us productivity benefits in '16 and some carry forward in '17 after that's completed. So I feel really good about the progress there. The acquisitions completed last year are accretive to the margins in the region. And so what you saw collectively, we ended pretty much, for a full year basis, close to 8%, which was about 400 basis points improvement compared to full year 2014. You're looking at 2016 at a low kind of double-digit margin range. And I'd just remind you also that there's a big delta between EBIT and EBITDA margins in that region because of the acquisitions. EBITDA margins would be in the neighborhood of mid- to high-teens, which is fairly significant and kind of in line with our peer group in the region."

We've got some improvement baked in relative to the deflationary situation on commodities. I mean, those would be the 3 primary drivers of why you're seeing the high leverage on the incremental volume. And then of course, the continuous improvement in the European margins is also helping that as well."

The other thing to keep in mind, we've historically targeted 100% of earnings. If you run the math, you wouldn't be seeing that for 2016. The primary purpose or reason for that is because, in 2015, we recorded some restructuring cost associated with the CISA manufacturing relocation, and those cash expenditures haven't yet happened. That will occur in 2016, and so that's putting a drag on that ratio. But even with that, still pretty good cash flow conversion, and we'll put it to use in the best way possible."

241782379,321866442,931637,"Allegion Plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Allegion plc","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.

Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results and closed out a very strong year. I'm proud of the company we have built over our first 2 years and believe we have one of the safest and most engaged workforce in the industry that drives a high level of execution and performance. 
Now on to the fourth quarter. Revenues of $545.4 million grew 4.8% on an organic basis, led by strength in the Americas and European regions. Total revenue declined 4.9%, reflecting the impacts of divestitures in foreign currency. Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million decreased to 2.9% versus the prior year, which again reflects recent divestitures. We realized solid leverage on incremental volume, which improved overall operating margin by 40 basis points. The ability to deliver improved margins while absorbing incremental investments continues to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our business.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.89 increased 17% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by divestitures, incremental investments and foreign exchange impact. This is our sixth straight quarter of double digits earning per share growth. 
Please go to Slide 4. As we did last year, I'd like to step back and review our performance scorecard. We exceeded revenue expectations on a reported and organic basis. Markets performed as expected, and we achieved a high level of contribution from all -- from our new product introduction and channel-led initiatives. We delivered an effective tax rate below 22% and exceeded our adjusted EPS goals.
Before taking into account the realization of the lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high-end of our original guidance by $0.07. Our results demonstrate the benefit of a balanced investment in the business, which also fell within guidance range. And although available cash flow, as a percentage of earnings, exceeded original guidance, I would comment that cash flow is shown on a reported basis.
In 2015, this was somewhat distorted due to the onetime divestiture changes -- charges. As discussed last quarter, we expect to do a little better in absolute cash flow for the year, but we realized a reduction in collections associated with the Bocom Wincent business in Asia Pacific, which has now been divested.
Please go to Slide 5. If we look beyond the financial scorecard, our 2015 accomplishments demonstrate our continued focus on our 5 growth pillars: core market expansion, innovation, opportunistic acquisitions, enterprise excellence and growth in emerging markets. 
Allegion remains committed to health and safety as a company, which was evident by the improvement of our safety metrics that were already some of the best in the industry. We made the necessary decisions on divestitures and leveraged acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio. We've managed our debt structure efficiency -- efficiently and made incremental investments to drive performance. Our growth in new products has been strong, with a vitality index that has doubled from the prior year. The business is executing at an extremely high level. The decisions and performance in 2015 have positioned us well for 2016.
Please go to Slide 6. When reflecting on the opportunities for long-term revenue growth, it's important to acknowledge the role Allegion's well-rounded brand portfolio will play, especially in terms of electromechanical convergence. Our investments in new products will provide growth not just for 2016, but for sustained growth in the future. In the residential market, those resolutions include innovative products from our 2015 acquisitions in Schlage leading and trusted home automation products. In the fourth quarter, Schlage launched the next-generation of electronic access solutions, including the Schlage Sense for residential homes, designed to work with Apple HomeKit, as well as our Schlage Control Smart Locks for multifamily use that streamlines operations for building managers while giving residents convenient smart card and phone credentials.
In the commercial market, our historic pioneer brands like Von Duprin, CISA and Interflex are raising the bar in terms of innovative solutions for Allegion customers. And our acquisitions are also contributing as reflected by the SimonsVoss SmartIntego system, which was recently earned the well-renowned German Design Award. These products are just a sampling of our leading electromechanical solutions, which will continue to build out innovation in existing and new categories. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our 2016 guidance."

I'll focus on the Allegion results and cover the",1630,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for both fourth quarter and full year. I'll focus on the Allegion results and cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 4.8% and 5.4% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The strong organic growth reflects improved markets, the introduction of new products and the company's channel initiatives. Pricing was essentially flat in the quarter, with favorable pricing in the EMEIA, and Asia Pacific regions were offset by slight decline in the Americas, driven by unfavorable residential pricing. 
Specific to the quarter, the residential business absorbed higher returns versus the prior year within the retail segment as well as higher rebates reflecting increased annual volume thresholds achieved within the quarter. It is important to note that the residential volumes were up low double-digits in the quarter. Pricing for the commercial segment continues to get good traction. We continue to face foreign currency headwinds related to the strong U.S. dollar. However, the currency headwind is decelerating as noted by the negative 3.2% decline in the quarter as compared to the full year decline of 6.8%. And acquisitions contributed over $45 million in revenues in the quarter, which were more than offset by the divestitures of our Venezuela and Bocom businesses.
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $545.4 million. This reflects a decrease of 4.9% versus the prior year, up 4.8% on an organic basis. The reported revenue reflects the currency and divestiture headwinds discussed previously, which drove a 17.6% year-over-year decline. This was partially offset by acquisitions and strong organic growth in Americas, EMEIA and the Asia Pacific mechanical and electronic hardware business. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 28% compared to the prior year period. In addition, we continue to make significant progress with our new product introductions and channel initiatives as reflected in the vitality index improvement mentioned by Dave earlier. 
Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million declined 2.9% compared to the prior year. Good incremental volume leverage and continued progress in our EMEIA margin transformation are reflected in the adjusted operating margin and improved 40 basis points. These benefits also covered incremental investment headwind at 20 basis points. Excluding the divestiture of Venezuela and Bocom, year-over-year margins accelerated 120 basis points compared to the prior year period. And the adjusted industry-leading EBITDA margin of 21.6% is a 110-basis-point improvement versus the prior year and 160 basis points excluding the divestitures. The business is executing at an extremely high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and margin improvement in all regions while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.37, adjusting $0.39 for the prior year's separation and restructuring expenses and other items as noted. The 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.76. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12 as favorable operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.08 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions, the continued execution of the company's tax strategies and the benefits of discrete tax items recorded in the quarter. 
Acquisitions added $0.05 in the quarter, while divestitures were a $0.09 reduction. As you may remember, our Q3 guidance already anticipated a $0.05 headwind for the slowdown of the Bocom business. The actual results reflect an additional headwind versus prior guidance of approximately $0.03 related to the divestiture occurring sooner than previously forecasted.
Next, interest, currency and other income were a net $0.02 reduction. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter. Other income primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities, partially offset by net currency losses. 
And lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.01 reduction. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2015 EPS of $0.89 per share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.15 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges, partially offset by favorable divestiture charge. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at the fourth quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.74.
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $383.1 million, down 2% or an increase of 6.6% on an organic basis. Reported revenue year-over-year comparisons were unfavorably impacted by currency movements in Canada and Colombia and the divestiture of the Venezuelan business. Strong organic growth reflects strong market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. 
As noted on the chart, we experienced very strong residential performance, mid-single-digit growth in nonresidential products and strength in electronics across the portfolio. Americas adjusted operating income of $100.2 million was up slightly versus the prior year period. Incremental volume leverage and productivity more than covered the Venezuelan divestiture, higher inflation, foreign currency and investments. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points, while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 50-basis-point headwind in the quarter. Excluding the Venezuela business from prior year results, operating margins improved 140 basis points. The ability to drive growth, improve our market-leading margins and drive investments demonstrates excellent performance by the entire Americas team.
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter for the EMEIA region were $129.2 million, up 24.8% or up 3.1% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by acquisitions and the organic growth, partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions accounted for $35 million of the revenue increase in the quarter. Both SimonsVoss and AXA performed well in the quarter and are delivering on the expected results. The organic growth reflects price and strength in hospitality, Interflex and general market improvements. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $17.6 million, increased 51.7% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. And although it isn't reflected on the slide, the full year adjusted operating margin for EMEIA was 7.9%. If you remember, the 2013 adjusted operating margin for this business was approximately 1%. This is a significant accomplishment, and we feel we are well positioned for continued margin improvement in 2016.
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $33.1 million, down 58% versus the prior year. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the system integration business, which drove a $55 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 43%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 12%. Organic growth was strong in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $2.2 million was down $7.5 million, reflecting the divestiture. Operating margin excluding the integration business reflects a positive story, with an increase of 400 basis points versus the prior year. The operating margin improvement reflects volume leverage, productivity and accretive acquisitions that more than offset inflation and currency headwinds.
Please go to Slide #13. Available cash flow for 2015 was $222.2 million, an increase of $14.7 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in the year-over-year cash flow is primarily due to reduced capital expenditures. Specific to capital expenditures, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million more in 2016 than 2015 for new product development, operations and IT projects. 
As noted on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. Although this recalibrates the baseline somewhat, it doesn't change our commitment to an effective and efficient working capital structure to maintain minimum levels of investment.
Please go to Slide #14. You remember our capital allocation strategy for our Investor Day that defines a balanced and flexible approach. This reflected our strategy on Day 1 and remains our focus and commitment for 2016. We ended the year with a gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.5, which reflects the impact of the recent debt offering that facilitated our acquisitions in 2015. Given EBITDA growth and debt amortization, we'll be able to quickly delever to be within our targeted range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
As Dave will mention later in the guidance, we continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2015 performance, we believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with higher returns on invested capital. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. We have gained considerable experience, successfully integrating a number of acquisitions over the past year that have been accretive to our results, and the M&A pipeline continues to remain active. 
And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends that reflect strength and confidence in cash flow, and we will continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution and to be opportunistic when appropriate. In summary, due to the consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to yield high returns for our shareholders. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide 15. We expect continued growth in our primary markets in 2016, but recognize that we are in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility. Our expectation is that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will deliver better than market growth. 
In the Americas, our exposure to nonresidential construction markets remain a positive. However, U.S. GDP levels are forecasted to remain below 3%, which I believe is a point that defines sustained growth. And if you were to review industry assessments for commercial markets today, you would find a wide variance in expectations. We remain positive but cautious in this area. 
On the institutional markets, we continue to expect slow improvement, characterized by more balanced educational demand between K-12 and higher education. Since Safe School initiatives and the need for school security upgrade, is evident when you review state legislative priorities. 
The outlook for health care remains more subdued in 2016, with flat to moderate increases. Overall, we anticipate low to mid-single-digit growth for the nonresidential segment. 
The U.S. residential market will continue to increase mid-single digits, driven by both builder and Big Box segments. Single-family home construction will continue its recovery, although we continue to expect variance in this segment, driven by labor and land availability. The multifamily segment will continue to grow, but we expect a deceleration in the rate of growth as compared to the last few years. 
Consolidating the market outlooks, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6% and reported revenue growth of 4% to 5%, reflecting some currency pressure. 
For the European region, with anticipate low single-digit market growth overall. We expect continued growth in the German and U.K. markets and modest growth in Italy. We believe a recovery France will continue to lag, and we expect further contraction in Eastern Europe. For the region, we project organic growth of 1% to 3%. When we combine the impacts of acquisitions partially offset by currency, we project reported revenue growth of 25% to 27% for the year. 
The Asia Pacific markets continue to show low to mid-single-digit growth in residential and nonresidential segments. Our current portfolio reduces our risks to the slowing China economy and positions us well in Australia, New Zealand and Korea. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 5% to 7%, and total revenue is estimated to decline 16% to 18%, which reflects the system integration divestiture. 
All in, we are projecting organic growth of 4% to 5%. Incorporating the net benefit of acquisitions that offset divestitures and currency headwinds, we expect total revenue to grow to 7% to 8%.
Please go to Slide 16. Our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range is $3.25 to $3.40, an increase of 7% to 12%. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and the net benefit of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by investments in the business, currency headwind, interest and a higher effective tax rate assumed to be between 18% and 19% for the year. We are forecasting strong organic growth and margin expansion in all of our reporting regions. 
Incremental investments, which are forecasted to be lower in 2015, will be focused on new products and channel development to meet demands of the electro-mechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. 
Our guidance assumes outstanding diluted shares of approximately 97 million, which reflects the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with buybacks. 
Restructuring and acquisition expenses are expected to be in the range of negative $0.05 to $0.10, resulting in a reported EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35.
Please go to Slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2015 results that delivered organic revenue growth over 5% and increased our operating margins by 50 basis points. The growth of both revenue margin, while making investments in our business, demonstrates the disciplined approach we set out 2 years ago. 
We made tremendous progress improving our European profitability, from slightly positive 2 years ago to an 8% rate today. It's truly a great accomplishment by the entire team to achieve these results so quickly. 
And we delivered on our effective tax rate commitments, sustaining below 20%. We continue to generate strong cash flow and are recognizing growth from our organic investments. 
We look forward to 2016 as an opportunity to build on our prior results. Although we expect continued market volatility and currency headwinds, we remain focused on our growth strategies to guide us through the challenging markets. We have a safe and strong team in place, committed to our vision to make the world safer and secure the places where people thrive. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

From a volume perspective, again, really strong organic growth in 2015. There was a couple of quarters early in the year, easier comparisons. But volume is still anticipated to be fairly strong, but down a little bit year-over-year. If you look at the margins for the full year, we showed a slight improvement. And I'll just remind you, that was kind of weighted down a little bit because of the Venezuela divestiture. Extracting that, we had pretty good margin growth. We're on a path now. We've got pretty good visibility to productivity. We'll participate in a deflationary economy that we're seeing in commodities. And we'll continue to get good leverage on the incremental volumes. So I would anticipate the margin improvement to accelerate a little bit in 2016, basis of the incremental volume forecasted."

Having said that, if you kind of break out the components and you look at the base business, continued really excellent execution relative to our march towards the 10% target, I'd say we ended the year pretty much in line with our expectations. Moving the -- some of the production out of our CISA facility this year will continue to get us productivity benefits in '16 and some carry forward in '17 after that's completed. So I feel really good about the progress there. The acquisitions completed last year are accretive to the margins in the region. And so what you saw collectively, we ended pretty much, for a full year basis, close to 8%, which was about 400 basis points improvement compared to full year 2014. You're looking at 2016 at a low kind of double-digit margin range. And I'd just remind you also that there's a big delta between EBIT and EBITDA margins in that region because of the acquisitions. EBITDA margins would be in the neighborhood of mid- to high-teens, which is fairly significant and kind of in line with our peer group in the region."

241782379,321866442,932055,"Allegion Plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Allegion plc","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results and closed out a very strong year. I'm proud of the company we have built over our first 2 years and believe we have one of the",737,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 
Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results and closed out a very strong year. I'm proud of the company we have built over our first 2 years and believe we have one of the safest and most engaged workforce in the industry that drives a high level of execution and performance. 
Now on to the fourth quarter. Revenues of $545.4 million grew 4.8% on an organic basis, led by strength in the Americas and European regions. Total revenue declined 4.9%, reflecting the impacts of divestitures in foreign currency. Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million decreased to 2.9% versus the prior year, which again reflects recent divestitures. We realized solid leverage on incremental volume, which improved overall operating margin by 40 basis points. The ability to deliver improved margins while absorbing incremental investments continues to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our business.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.89 increased 17% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by divestitures, incremental investments and foreign exchange impact. This is our sixth straight quarter of double digits earning per share growth. 
Please go to Slide 4. As we did last year, I'd like to step back and review our performance scorecard. We exceeded revenue expectations on a reported and organic basis. Markets performed as expected, and we achieved a high level of contribution from all -- from our new product introduction and channel-led initiatives. We delivered an effective tax rate below 22% and exceeded our adjusted EPS goals.
Before taking into account the realization of the lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high-end of our original guidance by $0.07. Our results demonstrate the benefit of a balanced investment in the business, which also fell within guidance range. And although available cash flow, as a percentage of earnings, exceeded original guidance, I would comment that cash flow is shown on a reported basis.
In 2015, this was somewhat distorted due to the onetime divestiture changes -- charges. As discussed last quarter, we expect to do a little better in absolute cash flow for the year, but we realized a reduction in collections associated with the Bocom Wincent business in Asia Pacific, which has now been divested.
Please go to Slide 5. If we look beyond the financial scorecard, our 2015 accomplishments demonstrate our continued focus on our 5 growth pillars: core market expansion, innovation, opportunistic acquisitions, enterprise excellence and growth in emerging markets. 
Allegion remains committed to health and safety as a company, which was evident by the improvement of our safety metrics that were already some of the best in the industry. We made the necessary decisions on divestitures and leveraged acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio. We've managed our debt structure efficiency -- efficiently and made incremental investments to drive performance. Our growth in new products has been strong, with a vitality index that has doubled from the prior year. The business is executing at an extremely high level. The decisions and performance in 2015 have positioned us well for 2016.
Please go to Slide 6. When reflecting on the opportunities for long-term revenue growth, it's important to acknowledge the role Allegion's well-rounded brand portfolio will play, especially in terms of electromechanical convergence. Our investments in new products will provide growth not just for 2016, but for sustained growth in the future. In the residential market, those resolutions include innovative products from our 2015 acquisitions in Schlage leading and trusted home automation products. In the fourth quarter, Schlage launched the next-generation of electronic access solutions, including the Schlage Sense for residential homes, designed to work with Apple HomeKit as well as our Schlage Control Smart Locks for multifamily use that streamlines operations for building managers while giving residents convenient smart card and phone credentials.
In the commercial market, our historic pioneer brands like Von Duprin, CISA and Interflex are raising the bar in terms of innovative solutions for Allegion customers. And our acquisitions are also contributing as reflected by the SimonsVoss SmartIntego system, which was recently earned the well-renowned German Design Award. These products are just a sampling of our leading electromechanical solutions, which will continue to build out innovation in existing and new categories. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for both fourth quarter and full year. I'll focus on the Allegion results and cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 4.8% and 5.4% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The strong organic growth reflects improved markets, the introduction of new products and the company's channel initiatives. Pricing was essentially flat in the quarter, with favorable pricing in the EMEIA, and Asia Pacific regions were offset by slight decline in the Americas, driven by unfavorable residential pricing. 
Specific to the quarter, the residential business absorbed higher returns versus the prior year within the retail segment as well as higher rebates reflecting increased annual volume thresholds achieved within the quarter. It is important to note that the residential volumes were up low double-digits in the quarter. Pricing for the commercial segment continues to get good traction. We continue to face foreign currency headwinds related to the strong U.S. dollar. However, the currency headwind is decelerating as noted by the negative 3.2% decline in the quarter as compared to the full year decline of 6.8%. And acquisitions contributed over $45 million in revenues in the quarter, which were more than offset by the divestitures of our Venezuela and Bocom businesses.
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $545.4 million. This reflects a decrease of 4.9% versus the prior year, up 4.8% on an organic basis. The reported revenue reflects the currency and divestiture headwinds discussed previously, which drove a 17.6% year-over-year decline. This was partially offset by acquisitions and strong organic growth in Americas, EMEIA and the Asia Pacific mechanical and electronic hardware business. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 28% compared to the prior year period. In addition, we continue to make significant progress with our new product introductions and channel initiatives as reflected in the vitality index improvement mentioned by Dave earlier. 
Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million declined 2.9% compared to the prior year. Good incremental volume leverage and continued progress in our EMEIA margin transformation are reflected in the adjusted operating margin and improved 40 basis points. These benefits also covered incremental investment headwind at 20 basis points. Excluding the divestiture of Venezuela and Bocom, year-over-year margins accelerated 120 basis points compared to the prior year period. And the adjusted industry-leading EBITDA margin of 21.6% is a 110-basis-point improvement versus the prior year and 160 basis points excluding the divestitures. The business is executing at an extremely high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and margin improvement in all regions while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.37, adjusting $0.39 for the prior year's separation and restructuring expenses and other items as noted. The 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.76. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12 as favorable operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.08 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions, the continued execution of the company's tax strategies and the benefits of discrete tax items recorded in the quarter. 
Acquisitions added $0.05 in the quarter, while divestitures were a $0.09 reduction. As you may remember, our Q3 guidance already anticipated a $0.05 headwind for the slowdown of the Bocom business. The actual results reflect an additional headwind versus prior guidance of approximately $0.03 related to the divestiture occurring sooner than previously forecasted.
Next, interest, currency and other income were a net $0.02 reduction. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter. Other income primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities, partially offset by net currency losses. 
And lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.01 reduction. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2015 EPS of $0.89 per share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.15 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges, partially offset by favorable divestiture charge. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at the fourth quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.74.
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $383.1 million, down 2% or an increase of 6.6% on an organic basis. Reported revenue year-over-year comparisons were unfavorably impacted by currency movements in Canada and Colombia and the divestiture of the Venezuelan business. Strong organic growth reflects strong market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. 
As noted on the chart, we experienced very strong residential performance, mid-single-digit growth in nonresidential products and strength in electronics across the portfolio. Americas adjusted operating income of $100.2 million was up slightly versus the prior year period. Incremental volume leverage and productivity more than covered the Venezuelan divestiture, higher inflation, foreign currency and investments. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points, while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 50-basis-point headwind in the quarter. Excluding the Venezuela business from prior year results, operating margins improved 140 basis points. The ability to drive growth, improve our market-leading margins and drive investments demonstrates excellent performance by the entire Americas team.
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter for the EMEIA region were $129.2 million, up 24.8% or up 3.1% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by acquisitions and the organic growth, partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions accounted for $35 million of the revenue increase in the quarter. Both SimonsVoss and AXA performed well in the quarter and are delivering on the expected results. The organic growth reflects price and strength in hospitality, Interflex and general market improvements. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $17.6 million, increased 51.7% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. And although it isn't reflected on the slide, the full year adjusted operating margin for EMEIA was 7.9%. If you remember, the 2013 adjusted operating margin for this business was approximately 1%. This is a significant accomplishment, and we feel we are well positioned for continued margin improvement in 2016.
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $33.1 million, down 58% versus the prior year. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the system integration business, which drove a $55 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 43%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 12%. Organic growth was strong in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $2.2 million was down $7.5 million, reflecting the divestiture. Operating margin excluding the integration business reflects a positive story, with an increase of 400 basis points versus the prior year. The operating margin improvement reflects volume leverage, productivity and accretive acquisitions that more than offset inflation and currency headwinds.
Please go to Slide #13. Available cash flow for 2015 was $222.2 million, an increase of $14.7 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in the year-over-year cash flow is primarily due to reduced capital expenditures. Specific to capital expenditures, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million more in 2016 than 2015 for new product development, operations and IT projects. 
As noted on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. Although this recalibrates the baseline somewhat, it doesn't change our commitment to an effective and efficient working capital structure to maintain minimum levels of investment.
Please go to Slide #14. You remember our capital allocation strategy for our Investor Day that defines a balanced and flexible approach. This reflected our strategy on Day 1 and remains our focus and commitment for 2016. We ended the year with a gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.5, which reflects the impact of the recent debt offering that facilitated our acquisitions in 2015. Given EBITDA growth and debt amortization, we'll be able to quickly delever to be within our targeted range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
As Dave will mention later in the guidance, we continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2015 performance, we believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with higher returns on invested capital. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. We have gained considerable experience, successfully integrating a number of acquisitions over the past year that have been accretive to our results, and the M&A pipeline continues to remain active. 
And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends that reflect strength and confidence in cash flow, and we will continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution and to be opportunistic when appropriate. In summary, due to the consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to yield high returns for our shareholders. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide 15. We expect continued growth in our primary markets in 2016, but recognize that we are in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility. Our expectation is that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will deliver better than market growth. 
In the Americas, our exposure to nonresidential construction markets remain a positive. However, U.S. GDP levels are forecasted to remain below 3%, which I believe is a point that defines sustained growth. And if you were to review industry assessments for commercial markets today, you would find a wide variance in expectations. We remain positive but cautious in this area. 
On the institutional markets, we continue to expect slow improvement, characterized by more balanced educational demand between K-12 and higher education. Since Safe School initiatives and the need for school security upgrade, is evident when you review state legislative priorities. 
The outlook for health care remains more subdued in 2016, with flat to moderate increases. Overall, we anticipate low to mid-single-digit growth for the nonresidential segment. 
The U.S. residential market will continue to increase mid-single digits, driven by both builder and Big Box segments. Single-family home construction will continue its recovery, although we continue to expect variance in this segment, driven by labor and land availability. The multifamily segment will continue to grow, but we expect a deceleration in the rate of growth as compared to the last few years. 
Consolidating the market outlooks, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6% and reported revenue growth of 4% to 5%, reflecting some currency pressure. 
For the European region, with anticipate low single-digit market growth overall. We expect continued growth in the German and U.K. markets and modest growth in Italy. We believe a recovery France will continue to lag, and we expect further contraction in Eastern Europe. For the region, we project organic growth of 1% to 3%. When we combine the impacts of acquisitions partially offset by currency, we project reported revenue growth of 25% to 27% for the year. 
The Asia Pacific markets continue to show low to mid-single-digit growth in residential and nonresidential segments. Our current portfolio reduces our risks to the slowing China economy and positions us well in Australia, New Zealand and Korea. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 5% to 7%, and total revenue is estimated to decline 16% to 18%, which reflects the system integration divestiture. 
All in, we are projecting organic growth of 4% to 5%. Incorporating the net benefit of acquisitions that offset divestitures and currency headwinds, we expect total revenue to grow to 7% to 8%.
Please go to Slide 16. Our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range is $3.25 to $3.40, an increase of 7% to 12%. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and the net benefit of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by investments in the business, currency headwind, interest and a higher effective tax rate assumed to be between 18% and 19% for the year. We are forecasting strong organic growth and margin expansion in all of our reporting regions. 
Incremental investments, which are forecasted to be lower in 2015, will be focused on new products and channel development to meet demands of the electro-mechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. 
Our guidance assumes outstanding diluted shares of approximately 97 million, which reflects the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with buybacks. 
Restructuring and acquisition expenses are expected to be in the range of negative $0.05 to $0.10, resulting in a reported EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35.
Please go to Slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2015 results that delivered organic revenue growth over 5% and increased our operating margins by 50 basis points. The growth of both revenue margin, while making investments in our business, demonstrates the disciplined approach we set out 2 years ago. 
We made tremendous progress improving our European profitability, from slightly positive 2 years ago to an 8% rate today. It's truly a great accomplishment by the entire team to achieve these results so quickly. 
And we delivered on our effective tax rate commitments, sustaining below 20%. We continue to generate strong cash flow and are recognizing growth from our organic investments. 
We look forward to 2016 as an opportunity to build on our prior results. Although we expect continued market volatility and currency headwinds, we remain focused on our growth strategies to guide us through the challenging markets. We have a safe and strong team in place, committed to our vision to make the world safer and secure the places where people thrive. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

From a volume perspective, again, really strong organic growth in 2015. There was a couple of quarters early in the year, easier comparisons. But volume is still anticipated to be fairly strong, but down a little bit year-over-year. If you look at the margins for the full year, we showed a slight improvement. And I'll just remind you, that was kind of weighted down a little bit because of the Venezuela divestiture. Extracting that, we had pretty good margin growth. We're on a path now. We've got pretty good visibility to productivity. We'll participate in a deflationary economy that we're seeing in commodities. And we'll continue to get good leverage on the incremental volumes. So I would anticipate the margin improvement to accelerate a little bit in 2016, basis of the incremental volume forecasted."

Having said that, if you kind of break out the components and you look at the base business, continued really excellent execution relative to our march towards the 10% target, I'd say we ended the year pretty much in line with our expectations. Moving the -- some of the production out of our CISA facility this year will continue to get us productivity benefits in '16 and some carry forward in '17 after that's completed. So I feel really good about the progress there. The acquisitions completed last year are accretive to the margins in the region. And so what you saw collectively, we ended pretty much, for a full year basis, close to 8%, which was about 400 basis points improvement compared to full year 2014. You're looking at 2016 at a low kind of double-digit margin range. And I'd just remind you also that there's a big delta between EBIT and EBITDA margins in that region because of the acquisitions. EBITDA margins would be in the neighborhood of mid- to high-teens, which is fairly significant and kind of in line with our peer group in the region."

And I think the overall momentum in the market as state budgets -- local budgets improve, the investments are going in. So we see lots -- we see activity and think it will continue to improve over the next 36 months."

On the investments, as we highlighted in the Investor Day last year in March, we did highlight we had expected to start tapering down a little bit. You're correct in that. We continue to analyze that through our annual operating plans. And we believe that, from a capital allocation perspective, to the extent we can drive good organic growth that have really strong returns on invested capital, we're going to make those bets. And because of the traction we've seen relative to electronic products growth and the channel initiative here in North America, we're accelerating some of those things. And that's why it's down year-over-year. But maybe not as down as what you'd anticipated. But I still think it's good return on capital. Relative to your incremental margin question, I think it's a pretty good way that you're looking at it. 50% is high. We've always kind of stated this 40% type of target, and we really delivered on that. And in 2015, the extra benefit we're getting in this deflationary economy, specific to commodities, is we'll start seeing that come into our numbers a little bit more than what we saw in 2015, just given the spot rate trades relative to the average rates in 2015."

241782379,321866442,933315,"Allegion Plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Allegion plc","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.

Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results and closed out a very strong year. I'm proud of the company we have built over our first 2 years and believe we have one of the safest and most engaged workforce in the industry that drives a high level of execution and performance. 
Now on to the fourth quarter. Revenues of $545.4 million grew 4.8% on an organic basis led by strength in the Americas and European regions. Total revenue declined 4.9%, reflecting the impacts of divestitures and foreign currency. Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million decreased 2.9% versus the prior year, which again reflects recent divestitures. We realized solid leverage on incremental volume, which improved overall operating margin by 40 basis points. The ability to deliver improved margins while absorbing incremental investments continues to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our business.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.89 increased 17% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by divestitures, incremental investments and foreign exchange impact. This is our sixth straight quarter of double digits earning per share growth. 
Please go to Slide 4. As we did last year, I'd like to step back and review our performance scorecard. We exceeded revenue expectations on a reported and organic basis. Markets performed as expected and we achieved a high level of contribution from all -- from our new product introduction and channel led initiatives. We delivered an effective tax rate below 22% and exceeded our adjusted EPS goals.
Before taking into account the realization of the lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high end of our original guidance by $0.07. Our results demonstrate the benefit of a balanced investment in the business, which also fell within guidance range. And although available cash flow, as a percentage of earnings, exceeded original guidance, I would comment that cash flow is shown on a reported basis.
In 2015, this was somewhat distorted due to the onetime divestiture changes -- charges. As discussed last quarter, we expect to do a little better in absolute cash flow for the year, but we realized a reduction in collections associated with the Bocom Wincent business in Asia Pacific, which has now been divested.
Please go to Slide 5. If we look beyond the financial scorecard, our 2015 accomplishments demonstrate our continued focus on our 5 growth pillars: core market expansion, innovation, opportunistic acquisitions, enterprise excellence and growth in emerging markets. 
Allegion remains committed to health and safety as a company, which was evident by the improvement of our safety metrics that were already some of the best in industry. We made the necessary decisions on divestitures and leveraged acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio. We've managed our debt structure efficiency -- efficiently and made incremental investments to drive performance. Our growth in new products has been strong, with a vitality index that has doubled from the prior year. The business is executing at an extremely high level. The decisions and performance in 2015 have positioned us well for 2016.
Please go to Slide 6. When reflecting on the opportunities for long-term revenue growth, it's important to acknowledge the role Allegion's well-rounded brand portfolio will play, especially in terms of electromechanical convergence. Our investments in new products will provide growth not just for 2016, but for sustained growth in the future. In the residential market, those solutions include innovative products from our 2015 acquisitions and Schlage's leading and trusted home automation products. In the fourth quarter, Schlage launched the next generation of electronic access solutions, including the Schlage Sense for residential homes, designed to work with Apple HomeKit as well as our Schlage Control Smart Locks for multifamily use that streamlines operations for building managers while giving residents convenient smart card and phone credentials.
In the commercial market, our historic pioneer brands like Von Duprin, CISA and Interflex are raising the bar in terms of innovative solutions for Allegion customers. And our acquisitions are also contributing as reflected by the SimonsVoss SmartIntego system, which was recently earned the well-renowned German Design Award. These products are just a sampling of our leading electromechanical solutions, which will continue to build out innovation in existing and new categories. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for both fourth quarter and full year. I'll focus on the Allegion results and cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 4.8% and 5.4% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The strong organic growth reflects improved markets, the introduction of new products and the company's channel initiatives. Pricing was essentially flat in the quarter, with favorable pricing in the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions were offset by slight decline in the Americas driven by unfavorable residential pricing. 
Specific to the quarter, the residential business absorbed higher returns versus the prior year within the retail segment as well as higher rebates reflecting increased annual volume thresholds achieved within the quarter. It is important to note that the residential volumes were up low double digits in the quarter. Pricing for the commercial segment continues to get good traction. We continue to face foreign currency headwinds related to the strong U.S. dollar. However, the currency headwind is decelerating as noted by the negative 3.2% decline in the quarter as compared to the full year decline of 6.8%. And acquisitions contributed over $45 million in revenues in the quarter, which were more than offset by the divestitures of our Venezuela and Bocom businesses.
Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $545.4 million. This reflects a decrease of 4.9% versus the prior year, up 4.8% on an organic basis. The reported revenue reflects the currency and divestiture headwinds discussed previously, which drove a 17.6% year-over-year decline. This was partially offset by acquisitions and strong organic growth in Americas, EMEIA and the Asia Pacific mechanical and electronic hardware business. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 28% compared to the prior year period. In addition, we continue to make significant progress with our new product introductions and channel initiatives as reflected in the vitality index improvement mentioned by Dave earlier. 
Adjusted operating income of $103.5 million declined 2.9% compared to the prior year. Good incremental volume leverage and continued progress in our EMEIA margin transformation are reflected in the adjusted operating margin that improved 40 basis points. These benefits also covered incremental investment headwind at 20 basis points. Excluding the divestiture of Venezuela and Bocom, year-over-year margins accelerated 120 basis points compared to the prior year period. And the adjusted industry-leading EBITDA margin of 21.6% is 110 basis point improvement versus the prior year and 160 basis point excluding the divestitures. The business is executing at an extremely high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and margin improvement in all regions while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth.
Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.37. Adjusting $0.39 for the prior year's separation and restructuring expenses and other items as noted, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.76. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12 as favorable operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.08 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions, the continued execution of the company's tax strategies and the benefit of discrete tax items recorded in the quarter. 
Acquisitions added $0.05 in the quarter, while divestitures were a $0.09 reduction. As you may remember, our Q3 guidance already anticipated a $0.05 headwind for the slowdown of the Bocom business. The actual results reflect an additional headwind versus prior guidance of approximately $0.03 related to the divestiture occurring sooner than previously forecasted.
Next, interest, currency and other income were a net $0.02 reduction. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter. Other income primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities partially offset by net currency losses. 
And lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.01 reduction. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2015 EPS of $0.89 per share. 
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.15 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges, partially offset by favorable divestiture charge. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.74.
Please go to Slide #10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $383.1 million, down 2% or an increase of 6.6% on an organic basis. Reported revenue year-over-year comparisons were unfavorably impacted by currency movements in Canada and Colombia and the divestiture of the Venezuelan business. Strong organic growth reflects strong market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. 
As noted on the chart, we experienced very strong residential performance, mid-single-digit growth in nonresidential products and strength in electronics across the portfolio. Americas adjusted operating income of $100.2 million was up slightly versus the prior year period. Incremental volume leverage and productivity more than covered the Venezuelan divestiture, higher inflation, foreign currency and investments. 
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 60 basis points, while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 50 basis point headwind in the quarter. Excluding the Venezuela business from prior year results, operating margins improved 140 basis points. The ability to drive growth, improve our market-leading margins and drive investments demonstrates excellent performance by the entire Americas team.
Please go to Slide #11. Fourth quarter for the EMEIA region were $129.2 million, up 24.8% or up 3.1% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by acquisitions and the organic growth, partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions accounted for $35 million of the revenue increase in the quarter. Both SimonsVoss and AXA performed well in the quarter and are delivering on the expected results. The organic growth reflects price and strength in hospitality, Interflex and general market improvements. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $17.6 million, increased 51.7% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions which were accretive to the region's margins. And although it isn't reflected on the slide, the full year adjusted operating margin for EMEIA was 7.9%. If you remember, the 2013 adjusted operating margin for this business was approximately 1%. This is a significant accomplishment, and we feel we are well positioned for continued margin improvement in 2016.
Please go to Slide #12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $33.1 million, down 58% versus the prior year. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the system integration business, which drove a $55 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 43%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 12%. Organic growth was strong in Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. 
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income of $2.2 million was down $7.5 million, reflecting the divestiture. Operating margin excluding the integration business reflects a positive story, with an increase of 400 basis points versus the prior year. The operating margin improvement reflects volume leverage, productivity and accretive acquisitions that more than offset inflation and currency headwinds.
Please go to Slide #13. Available cash flow for 2015 was $222.2 million, an increase of $14.7 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in the year-over-year cash flow is primarily due to reduced capital expenditures. Specific to capital expenditures, we anticipate investing approximately $10 million more in 2016 than 2015 for new product development, operations and IT projects. 
As noted on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. Although this recalibrates the baseline somewhat, it doesn't change our commitment to an effective and efficient working capital structure to maintain minimum levels of investment.
Please go to Slide #14. You will remember our capital allocation strategy from our Investor Day that defines a balanced and flexible approach. This reflected our strategy on Day 1, remains our focus and commitment for 2016. We ended the year with a gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.5, which reflects the impact of the recent debt offering that facilitated our acquisitions in 2015. Given EBITDA growth and debt amortization, we'll be able to quickly delever to be within our targeted range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
As Dave will mention later in the guidance, we continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies in enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2015 performance, we believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with higher returns on invested capital. We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. We have gained considerable experience successfully integrating a number of acquisitions over the past year that have been accretive to our results, and the M&A pipeline continues to remain active. 
And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends that reflect strength and confidence in cash flow, and we will continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution and to be opportunistic when appropriate. In summary, due to the consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to yield high returns for our shareholders. 
I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide 15. We expect continued growth in our primary markets in 2016, but recognize that we are in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility. Our expectation is that the organic investments combined with our ability to execute will deliver better than market growth. 
In the Americas, our exposure to nonresidential construction markets remain a positive. However, U.S. GDP levels are forecasted to remain below 3%, which I believe is a point that defines sustained growth. And if you were to review industry assessments for commercial markets today, you would find a wide variance in expectations. We remain positive but cautious in this area. 
On the institutional markets, we continue to expect slow improvement, characterized by more balanced educational demand between K through 12 and higher education. Since safe school initiatives and the need for school security upgrade is evident when you review state legislative priorities. The outlook for health care remains more subdued in 2016, with flat to moderate increases. Overall, we anticipate low to mid-single-digit growth for the nonresidential segment. 
The U.S. residential market will continue to increase mid-single digits, driven by both builder and big box segments. Single family home construction will continue its recovery, although we continue to expect variance in this segment, driven by labor and land availability. The multifamily segment will continue to grow, but we expect a deceleration in the rate of growth as compared to the last few years. 
Consolidating the market outlooks, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6% and reported revenue growth of 4% to 5%, reflecting some currency pressure. From the European region, we anticipate low single-digit market growth overall. We expect continued growth in the German and U.K. markets and modest growth in Italy. We believe a recovery in France will continue to lag, and we expect further contraction in Eastern Europe. For the region, we project organic growth of 1% to 3%. When we combine the impacts of acquisitions partially offset by currency, we project reported revenue growth of 25% to 27% for the year. 
The Asia Pacific markets continued to show low to mid-single-digit growth in residential and nonresidential segments. Our current portfolio reduces our risks to the slowing China economy and positions us well in Australia, New Zealand and Korea. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 5% to 7%, and total revenue is estimated to decline 16% to 18%, which reflects the system integration divestiture. All in, we are projecting organic growth of 4% to 5%. Incorporating the net benefit of acquisitions that offset divestitures and currency headwinds, we expect total revenue to grow to 7% to 8%.
Please go to Slide 16. Our 2016 adjusted earnings per share range is $3.25 to $3.40, an increase of 7% to 12%. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and the net benefit of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by investments in the business, currency headwind, interest and a higher effective tax rate assumed to be between 18% and 19% for the year. We are forecasting strong organic growth and margin expansion in all of our reporting regions. 
Incremental investments, which are forecasted to be lower in 2015, will be focused on new products and channel development to meet demands of the electro-mechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. Our guidance assumes outstanding diluted shares of approximately 97 million, which reflects the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with buybacks. Restructuring and acquisition expenses are expected to be in the range of negative $0.05 to $0.10, resulting in a reported EPS range of $3.15 to $3.35.
Please go to Slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2015 results that delivered organic revenue growth over 5% and increased our operating margins by 50 basis points. The growth of both revenue margin will make an investments in our business and demonstrates the disciplined approach we set out 2 years ago. 
We've made tremendous progress improving our European profitability, from slightly positive 2 years ago to an 8% rate today. It's truly a great accomplishment by the entire team to achieve these results so quickly. And we delivered on our effective tax rate commitments, sustaining below 20%. We continue to generate strong cash flow and are recognizing growth from our organic investments. 
We look forward to 2016 as an opportunity to build on our prior results. Although we expect continued market volatility and currency headwinds, we remain focused on our growth strategies to guide us through the challenging markets. We have a safe and strong team in place, committed to our vision to make the world safer and secure the places where people thrive. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

From my volume perspective, again, really strong organic growth in 2015. There's a couple quarters early in the year, easier comparisons. But volume is still anticipated to be fairly strong, but down a little bit year-over-year. If you look at the margins for the full year, we showed a slight improvement. And I just remind you, that was kind of weighted down a little bit because of the Venezuela divestiture. Extracting that, we had pretty good margin growth. We're on a path now. We've got pretty good visibility to productivity. We'll participate in a deflationary economy that we're seeing in commodities, and we'll continue to get good leverage on the incremental volume. So I would anticipate the margin improvement to accelerate a little bit in 2016, basis of the incremental volume forecasted."

So a couple things, just as a reminder, Q4, historically, from a seasonal perspective, always operates at a much higher margin than the first 3 quarters of the year. So you're seeing a much higher than the 10% target that we had targeted in Q4. Having said that, if you kind of break out the components and you look at the base business, continued really excellent execution relative to our march towards the 10% target, I'd say we ended the year pretty much in line with our expectations. Moving the -- some of the production out of our CISA facility this year will continue to get us productivity benefits in '16 and some carryforward in '17 after that's completed. So I feel really good about the progress there. The acquisitions completed last year are accretive to the margins in the region. And so what you saw collectively, we ended pretty much for full year basis, close to 8%, which was about 400 basis points improvement compared to full year 2014. You're looking at 2016 at a low kind of double-digit margin range. And I'd just remind you also that there's a big delta between EBIT and EBITDA margins in that region because of the acquisitions. EBITDA margins would be in the neighborhood of mid- to high teens, which is fairly significant and kind of in line with our peer group in the region."

And that's why it's down year-over-year, but maybe not as down as what you'd anticipated. But I still think it's good return on capital. Relative to your incremental margin question, I think it's a pretty good way that you're looking at it. 50% is high. We've always kind of stated this 40% type of target and we really delivered on that.

The other thing to keep in mind, we've historically targeted 100% of earnings. If you run the math, you wouldn't be seeing that for 2016. The primary purpose or reason for that is because, in 2015, we recorded some restructuring costs associated with the CISA manufacturing relocation and those cash expenditures haven't yet happened. That will occur in 2016, and so that's putting a drag on that ratio. But even with that, still pretty good cash flow conversion and we'll put it to use in the best way possible."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We posted a solid quarter of results, delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies.

We posted a solid quarter of results, delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies. Revenues of $502 million grew 9.5%, reflecting organic growth of 3.6%, as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions. Europe and Asia Pacific revenues were in line with expectations from a market and performance level. 
I would like to note that the Americas organic growth of 3.4% was delivered despite the implementation of a new operating system at our Indianapolis operation facility. This is part of a natural evolution of an older legacy system that will allow Allegion to continue to deliver best-in-class products and solutions. 
I am very pleased with the progress thus far and the speed and flexibility demonstrated by our teams to make the continuous improvements necessary to quickly restore our industry-leading delivery cycles of the Indianapolis plant. 
We believe the nonresidential markets continue to show stable growth, as reflected in the strength of our orders and backlogs in the first quarter. Patrick will provide further details when discussing the Americas financials. 
Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% versus the prior year. Overall operating margin improved by 40 basis points, with all regions delivering increases versus the prior year period. 
We remain focused on our growth strategies and continue to balance ongoing investments with improved operating performance. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 increased more than 19% versus the prior year period, primarily driven from the improved operating performance and acquisitions. This is our seventh straight quarter with double digit adjusted earnings per share growth. 
Also in the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares. This is consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy and goal to offset dilution at a minimum. 
Please go to Slide 4. In the Americas, Allegion's distinctive position as both a nonresidential and residential market leader gives our team the capabilities to leverage technologies across both markets. Utilizing these unique capabilities, we've implemented a new multifamily strategy to drive profit and grow market share, as well as establish threat leadership as the key implementation of multifamily strategy. Allegion has created Schlage Control, the next generation of electronic access for the world of multifamily. The open integration capabilities deliver the ability for property owners to manage both residential and common area doors on a single superior system and from anywhere using cloud or web-based apps. Schlage Control eliminates dealing with traditional keys while providing residents convenient smart card and phone credentials. Our deadbolts launched in December 2015 and our interconnected warlocks are set to launch in May. A number of other multifamily growth opportunities are being pursued, including accelerating OEM software platforms, leveraging relationships with market influencers and creating standards specification guidelines. With all these initiatives, Allegion has completed -- created a complete solution package to offer multifamily customers. We look forward to watching for more success in the multifamily segment throughout 2016 and beyond. 
Patrick will now you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year guidance."

Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides. 
As indicated, we delivered 3.6% organic growth in the first quarter, with balanced contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization and volume growth was supported by stable markets that performed as expected. Foreign currency remains a headwind but is moderating sequentially when compared to prior quarters. And acquisitions contributed approximately $46 million or 10% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $502.3 million, which is a 9.5% increase versus the prior year period. I was pleased with the revenue growth, given solid price realization, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region. We continue to experience solid electronic product growth and are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% compared to the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins and this reflects the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year margin and growth. The benefit of acquisitions, favorable pricing, productivity and net commodity deflation more than offset other inflation and investments. Of note, volume increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix in the quarter, most notably related to the mix of products sold in the Americas. I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 19.8%, an improvement of 100 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2015, reported EPS was $0.47. Adjusting $0.04 for the prior year, Venezuela devaluation and noncash impairment charge, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.51. Operational results increased EPS by $0.07 as favorable price, foreign exchange and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign denominated cost resulting in a slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.04 in the quarter. Next, interest and other income were a net $0.03 increase. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter 2015. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities in a onetime benefit from equity investments. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.01 per share decline versus the prior year. The first quarter effective tax rate is higher than the full year guidance, reflecting the timing of certain tax positions. Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.03 reduction. This resulted in adjusted first quarter 2016 EPS of $0.61 per share, an increase of approximately 20% versus the prior year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at first quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.60. 
Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $363 million, up 2.5% or an increase of 3.4% on an organic basis. The residential business continues to perform well, delivering high single-digit growth, with strength across all channels. Our investments in electronic products, in style and design solutions continue to deliver strong results. The nonresidential segment delivered low single-digit growth while implementing a new operating system at our Indianapolis facility. It's important to note that we realized high single-digit nonresidential order growth in the first quarter and associated increase in backlog, primarily driven by the system transition. As such, we expect some quarterly timing impacts as we work through the backlog. We continue to believe that the market fundamentals for nonresidential construction remain in place for low to the mid-single-digit growth for the year. Americas adjusted operating income of $91.6 million was up 3.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by favorable price, material productivity and material deflation that fully offset unfavorable mix in the quarter. The unfavorable mix was due to the strength of residential growth as well as a mix of commercial product as impacted by the timing effect of shipments related to the operating system transition. 
Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $118.5 million, up 45% or up 3.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. Acquisitions delivered more than $36 million in incremental revenue. Electronic product growth continues to be strong, driven by hospitality and [indiscernible] products. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $8.3 million increased 219% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 380 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 550 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. 
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $20.8 million, down 8.4% versus the prior year period. As noted on this slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $9.9 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 63%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 14%. Most subregions performed well, with notable strength in our China hardware and Australia/New Zealand segments. Asia Pacific broke even on adjusted operating income basis, which reflects an improvement of $2.6 million versus the prior year period. We continue to drive focus on mechanical and electronic hardware solutions, are leveraging the acquisitions made in 2015 and are making good progress in addressing stranded costs related to the system integration divestiture. 
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for first quarter 2016 was negative $8.2 million, slightly below prior year. The negative cash flow in the quarter's typical of our historical performance and reflects the seasonal use of working capital. As evident in the increased ratios on this slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed on effective and efficient use of working capital. Lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year. 
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for update on our full year 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide 12. We are affirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and earnings per share, as noted on this slide. Our view of the global markets remain unchanged, with better confidence given first quarter performance. The Americas residential markets continue to perform well, especially in big box and e-commerce after market segments. And although U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated slightly, we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential markets. Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education, with flat to modest health care expansion. For Americas' revenue, the heavy lifting of our Indianapolis operating center integration is behind us, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve full year organic growth of 5% to 6%. I am pleased with growth delivered in the first quarter from our EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions in support of our full year targets. Our acquisitions are delivering growth and the markets are performing as expected. 
Please go to Slide 13. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our first quarter results that delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all of our reporting segments, and earnings per share growth of more than 19%. Allegion is executing on our margin improvement in EMEIA, benefiting from our acquisitions and realizing contributions for our new product introductions, especially within the electronic segment. Finally, we remain on track and are positioned well to deliver our original guidance. 
Now Patrick and I will take your questions."

So I would say, maybe another way to look at it is, without this, we certainly would have participated well within that range, probably at the higher end of that full year range. So as we look going forward, we're making good strides of progress. Production is up relative to year-over-year were eating into the backlog every day.

You would have that in any case associated with these transitions. So perhaps a blip in productivity. But in terms of affecting our overall operating results, nothing of significance to highlight there. As you know, those products have very good margins. So should be an issue going forward. On the proposed legislation, actually, a couple of comments there. You're aware that right now, they are -- it is proposed. It's open for a commentary period. We'll see how it shapes out. But basis of the current proposed legislation, it's all prospective looking. And so when we look at the effect on our business, I would say, no immediate impact today, for 2016 or our planning horizon over the next 3 to 5 years. I would also comment on, relative to the proposed legislation that it has a lot of documentation requirements, we feel like we're fairly buttoned up in this area. You may recall in 2014, we had some incremental investments associated with some external advisers from both the tax and legal perspective. I think we're on very solid foundation relative to some of those items that these regulations address. Going forward, it does require maybe some more rigor and tax planning strategies. But we've got many tools in our toolbox that will continue to execute. The regulations, by the way, are specific to U.S. entities or foreign subsidiaries underneath U.S. entities. So it doesn't impact our every entity within our structure. And it doesn't preclude or eliminate debt transactions with a solid and sound business purpose. So I just remind you, being an Irish domiciled company, I believe we have a very tax efficient structure. We have a lot of optionality and we have the ability to continue even with these regulations to move cash around the globe tax efficiently that gives us a competitive advantage."

The next system that will replace will be a -- it's called a bull system. Probably only old guys like me remember this, but it doesn't have near the scope. But what we installed in Indianapolis is the platform that will replace the bull system. So logical steps that I think give our people the tools and our customers the capability to expect in a modern marketplace."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We posted a solid quarter of results, delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies. Revenues of $502 million grew 9.5%, reflecting organic growth of 3.6%",513,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 
We posted a solid quarter of results, delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies. Revenues of $502 million grew 9.5%, reflecting organic growth of 3.6% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions. Europe and Asia Pacific revenues were in line with expectations from a market and performance level.
I would like to note that the Americas organic growth of 3.4% was delivered despite the implementation of a new operating system at our Indianapolis operation facility. This is part of a natural evolution of an older legacy system that will allow Allegion to continue to deliver best-in-class products and solutions. I am very pleased with the progress thus far and the speed and flexibility demonstrated by our teams to make the continuous improvements necessary to quickly restore our industry-leading delivery cycles at the Indianapolis plant. 
We believe the nonresidential markets continue to show stable growth, as reflected in the strength of our orders and backlogs in the first quarter. Patrick will provide further details when discussing the Americas financials.
Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% versus the prior year. Overall operating margin improved by 40 basis points, with all regions delivering increases versus the prior year period.
We remain focused on our growth strategies and continue to balance ongoing investments with improved operating performance.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 increased more than 19% versus the prior year period, primarily driven from improved operating performance and acquisitions. This is our seventh straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
Also in the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares. This is consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy and goal to offset dilution at a minimum.
Please go to Slide 4. In the Americas, Allegion's distinctive position as both a nonresidential and residential market leader gives our team the capabilities to leverage technologies across both markets. Utilizing these unique capabilities, we've implemented a new multifamily strategy to drive profit and grow market share as well as establish thought leadership as the key implementation of multifamily strategy. Allegion has created Schlage Control, the next generation of electronic access for the world of multifamily. The open integration capabilities deliver the ability for property owners to manage both residential and common area doors on a single superior system and from anywhere using cloud or web-based apps. Schlage Control eliminates dealing with traditional keys while providing residents convenient smart card and phone credentials. Our deadbolts launched in December 2015, and our interconnected locks are set to launch in May.
A number of other multifamily growth opportunities are being pursued, including accelerating the OEM software platforms, leveraging relationships with market influencers and creating standard specification guidelines. With all these initiatives, Allegion has completed -- created a complete solution package to offer multifamily customers. We look forward to watching for more success in the multifamily segment throughout 2016 and beyond.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year guidance."

Thank you for joining the call.Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter.

Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 3.6% organic growth in the first quarter with balanced contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization, and volume growth was supported by stable markets that performed as expected. Foreign currency remains a headwind but is moderating sequentially when compared to prior quarters. And acquisitions contributed approximately $46 million or 10% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $502.3 million, which is a 9.5% increase versus the prior year period. I was pleased with the revenue growth given solid price realization, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region. We continue to experience solid electronic product growth and are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% compared to the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins, and this reflects the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year margin and growth. The benefit of acquisitions, favorable pricing, productivity and net commodity deflation more than offset other inflation and investments. Of note, volume increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix in the quarter, most notably related to the mix of products sold in the Americas. I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 19.8%, an improvement of 100 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2015, reported EPS was $0.47. Adjusting $0.04 for the prior year Venezuela devaluation and noncash impairment charge, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.51. Operational results increased EPS by $0.07 as favorable price, foreign exchange and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs, resulting in a slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.04 in the quarter.
Next, interest and other income were a net $0.03 increase. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter 2015. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities and a onetime benefit from equity investments. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.01 per share decline versus the prior year. The first quarter effective tax rate is higher than the full year guidance, reflecting the timing of certain tax positions.
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.03 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2016 EPS of $0.61 per share, an increase of approximately 20% versus the prior year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at first quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.60.
Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $363 million, up 2.5% or an increase of 3.4% on an organic basis. The residential business continues to perform well, delivering high single-digit growth with strength across all channels. Our investments in electronic products and style and design solutions continue to deliver strong results. The nonresidential segment delivered low single-digit growth while implementing a new operating system at our Indianapolis facility. It's important to note that we realized high single-digit nonresidential order growth in the first quarter and associated increase in backlog, primarily driven by the system transition. As such, we expect some quarterly timing impacts as we work through the backlog. We continue to believe that the market fundamentals for nonresidential construction remain in place for low to the mid-single-digit growth for the year.
Americas adjusted operating income of $91.6 million was up 3.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by favorable price, material productivity and material deflation that fully offset unfavorable mix in the quarter. The unfavorable mix was due to the strength of residential growth as well as a mix of commercial product as impacted by the timing effect on shipments related to the operating system transition.
Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $118.5 million, up 45% or up 3.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. Acquisitions delivered more than $36 million in incremental revenue. Electronic product growth continues to be strong, driven by hospitality and CISA products. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $8.3 million increased 219% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 380 basis points. And adjusted EBITDA margins increased 550 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $20.8 million, down 8.4% versus the prior year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $9.9 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 63%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 14%. Most subregions performed well with notable strength in our China hardware and Australia/New Zealand segments. Asia Pacific broke even on adjusted operating income basis, which reflects an improvement of $2.6 million versus the prior year period. We continue to drive focus on mechanical and electronic hardware solutions, are leveraging the acquisitions made in 2015 and are making good progress in addressing stranded costs related to the system integration divestiture.
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for first quarter 2016 was negative $8.2 million, slightly below prior year. The negative cash flow in the quarter is typical of our historical performance and reflects the seasonal use of working capital. As evident in the increased ratios on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed on effective and efficient use of working capital. Lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide 12. We are affirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and earnings per share, as noted on the slide. Our view of the global markets remain unchanged with better confidence given first quarter performance. The Americas residential markets continue to perform well, especially in big box and e-commerce after-market segments. And although U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated slightly, we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential markets. Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education with flat to modest health care expansion. For Americas revenue, the heavy lifting of our Indianapolis operating center integration is behind us, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve full year organic growth of 5% to 6%. I am pleased with growth delivered in the first quarter from our EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions in support of our full year targets. Our acquisitions are delivering growth and the markets are performing as expected.
Please go to Slide 13. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our first quarter results that delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all of our reporting segments and earnings per share growth of more than 19%. Allegion is executing on our margin improvement in EMEIA, benefiting from our acquisitions and realizing contributions for our new product introductions, especially within the electronic segment. Finally, we remain on track and are positioned well to deliver our original guidance.
Now Patrick and I will take your questions."

Order activity, probably a little bit north of our full year organic growth expectations that we gave, 5% to 6% in Americas. The backlog would reflect that. So I would say maybe another way to look at it is without this, we certainly would have participated well within that range, probably at the higher end of that full year range. So as we look going forward, we're making good strides of progress. Production is up relative to year-over-year. We're eating into the backlog every day. And so the thought would be to make it up as soon as possible because our delivery cycles back to customer demand quickly. But it's probably going to be a Q2, Q3 fully caught up."

You would have that in any case associated with these transitions. So perhaps a blip in productivity. But in terms of affecting our overall operating results, nothing of significance to highlight there. As you know, those products have very good margins. So it shouldn't be an issue going forward. On the proposed legislation, actually, a couple of comments there. You're aware that right now, they are -- it is proposed. It was open for a commentary period. We'll see how it shakes out. But basis of the current proposed legislation, it's all prospective looking. And so when we look at the effect on our business, I would say no immediate impact today for 2016 or our planning horizon over the next 3 to 5 years. I would also comment on -- relative to the proposed legislation that it has a lot of documentation requirements. We feel like we're fairly buttoned up in this area. You may recall in 2014, we had some incremental investments associated with some external advisers from both the tax and legal perspective. I think we're on very solid foundation relative to some of those items that these regulations address. Going forward, it does require maybe some more rigor and tax planning strategies. But we've got many tools in our toolbox that we'll continue to execute. The regulations, by the way, are specific to U.S. entities or foreign subsidiaries underneath U.S. entities. So it doesn't impact our every entity within our structure. And it doesn't preclude or eliminate debt transactions with a solid and sound business purpose. So I just remind you, being an Irish-domiciled company, I believe we have a very tax-efficient structure. We have a lot of optionality, and we have the ability to continue even with these regulations to move cash around the globe tax efficiently that gives us a competitive advantage."

We think modern tools, Windows-based tools on the floor, will continue to give us differentiation on those factors. I think second, it's important that we look at the end customer. Why would I want a common system? I can't ship today on one invoice from our various manufacturing facilities. And customers want this. It's something, I think, over the long-term planning horizon, we've got to plan for. Another dimension of the optics of lead time and the change management to happen as we turn on the new system, I mean, clearly, we changed some things and are coming back quickly. But we closed the books financially at a faster pace than we had at any ops ever. I'd like to be able to spend less money on financial consolidation and more on analysis, analysis of our profitability, our customers. So there's multi-dimensions in terms of these systems but we'll hold them to a business case. And we think will drive the things that are important to us, return on invested capital, high inventory turnover and time."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We posted a solid quarter of results, delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies. Revenues of $502 million grew 9.5%, reflecting organic growth of 3.6%",510,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 
We posted a solid quarter of results, delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies. Revenues of $502 million grew 9.5%, reflecting organic growth of 3.6% as well as the benefit of prior-year acquisitions. Europe and Asia Pacific revenues were in line with expectations from a market and performance level.
I would like to note that the Americas organic growth of 3.4% was delivered despite the implementation of a new operating system at our Indianapolis operation facility. This is part of a natural evolution of an older legacy system that will allow Allegion to continue to deliver best-in-class products and solutions. I am very pleased with the progress thus far and the speed and flexibility demonstrated by our teams to make the continuous improvements necessary to quickly restore our industry-leading delivery cycles at the Indianapolis plant. 
We believe the nonresidential markets continue to show stable growth as reflected in the strength of our orders and backlogs in the first quarter. Patrick will provide further details when discussing the Americas financials.
Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% versus the prior year. Overall operating margin improved by 40 basis points with all regions delivering increases versus the prior-year period.
We remain focused on our growth strategies and continue to balance ongoing investments with improved operating performance.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 increased more than 19% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven from improved operating performance and acquisitions. This is our seventh straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
Also in the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares. This is consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy and goal to offset dilution at a minimum.
Please go to Slide 4. In the Americas, Allegion's distinctive position as both a nonresidential and residential market leader gives our team the capabilities to leverage technologies across both markets. Utilizing these unique capabilities, we've implemented a new multifamily strategy to drive profit and grow market share as well as establish thought leadership as the key implementation of multifamily strategy. 
Allegion has created Schlage Control, the next generation of electronic access for the world of multifamily. The open integration capabilities deliver the ability for property owners to manage both residential and common area doors on a single superior system and from anywhere using cloud or web-based apps. Schlage Control eliminates dealing with traditional keys while providing residents convenient smart card and phone credentials. Our deadbolts launched in December 2015, and our interconnected locks are set to launch in May.
A number of other multifamily growth opportunities are being pursued, including accelerating the OEM software platforms, leveraging relationships with market influencers and creating standard specification guidelines. With all these initiatives, Allegion has completed -- created a complete solution package to offer multifamily customers. We look forward to watching for more success in the multifamily segment throughout 2016 and beyond.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year guidance."

Thank you for joining the call.Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter.

Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 3.6% organic growth in the first quarter with balanced contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization, and volume growth was supported by stable markets that performed as expected. Foreign currency remains a headwind but is moderating sequentially when compared to prior quarters. And acquisitions contributed approximately $46 million or 10% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $502.3 million, which is a 9.5% increase versus the prior-year period. I was pleased with the revenue growth given solid price realization, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region. We continue to experience solid electronic product growth and are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% compared to the prior year. 
All regions delivered improved operating margins, and this reflects the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year margin and growth. The benefit of acquisitions, favorable pricing, productivity and net commodity deflation more than offset other inflation and investments. Of note, volume increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix in the quarter, most notably related to the mix of products sold in the Americas. I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 19.8%, an improvement of 100 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2015, reported EPS was $0.47. Adjusting $0.04 for the prior year, Venezuela devaluation and noncash impairment charge, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.51. Operational results increased EPS by $0.07 as favorable price, foreign exchange and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs, resulting in a slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.04 in the quarter.
Next, interest and other income were a net $0.03 increase. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter 2015. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities and a onetime benefit from equity investments. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.01 per share decline versus the prior year. The first quarter effective tax rate is higher than the full year guidance, reflecting the timing of certain tax positions.
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.03 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2016 EPS of $0.61 per share, an increase of approximately 20% versus the prior year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at first quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.60.
Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $363 million, up 2.5% or an increase of 3.4% on an organic basis. The residential business continues to perform well, delivering high single-digit growth with strength across all channels. Our investments in electronic products and style and design solutions continue to deliver strong results. 
The nonresidential segment delivered low single-digit growth while implementing a new operating system at our Indianapolis facility. It's important to note that we realized high single-digit nonresidential order growth in the first quarter and associated increase in backlog, primarily driven by the system transition. As such, we expect some quarterly timing impacts as we work through the backlog. We continue to believe that the market fundamentals for nonresidential construction remain in place for low to mid-single-digit growth for the year.
Americas adjusted operating income of $91.6 million was up 3.6% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by favorable price, material productivity and material deflation that fully offset unfavorable mix in the quarter. The unfavorable mix was due to the strength of residential growth as well as a mix of commercial product as impacted by the timing effect on shipments related to the operating system transition.
Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $118.5 million, up 45% or up 3.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. Acquisitions delivered more than $36 million in incremental revenue. Electronic product growth continues to be strong, driven by hospitality and CISA products. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $8.3 million increased 219% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 380 basis points. And adjusted EBITDA margins increased 550 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $20.8 million, down 8.4% versus the prior-year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $9.9 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 63%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 14%. 
Most subregions performed well with notable strength in our China hardware and Australia/New Zealand segments. Asia Pacific broke even on adjusted operating income basis, which reflects an improvement of $2.6 million versus the prior-year period. We continue to drive focus on mechanical and electronic hardware solutions, are leveraging the acquisitions made in 2015 and are making good progress in addressing stranded costs related to the system integration divestiture.
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for first quarter 2016 was negative $8.2 million, slightly below prior year. The negative cash flow in the quarter is typical of our historical performance and reflects the seasonal use of working capital. As evident in the increased ratios on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed on effective and efficient use of working capital. Lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We are affirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and earnings per share, as noted on the slide. Our view of the global markets remain unchanged with better confidence, given first quarter performance. The 
Americas residential markets continue to perform well, especially in big box and e-commerce after-market segments. And although U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated slightly, we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential markets. 
Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education with flat to modest health-care expansion. For Americas revenue, the heavy lifting of our Indianapolis operating center integration is behind us, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve full year organic growth of 5% to 6%. I am pleased with growth delivered in the first quarter from our EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions in support of our full year targets. Our acquisitions are delivering growth, and the markets are performing as expected.
Please go to Slide 13. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our first quarter results that delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all of our reporting segments and earnings per share growth of more than 19%. Allegion is executing on our margin improvement in EMEIA, benefiting from our acquisitions and realizing contributions for our new product introductions, especially within the electronic segment. Finally, we remain on track and are positioned well to deliver our original guidance.
Now Patrick and I will take your questions."

Order activity, probably a little bit north of our full year organic growth expectations that we give 5% to 6% in Americas. The backlog would reflect that. So I would say, maybe another way to look at it is, without this, we certainly would have participated well within that range, probably at the higher end of that full year range. So as we look going forward, we're making good strides of progress. Production is up relative to year-over-year. We're eating into the backlog every day. And so the thought would be to make it up as soon as possible because our delivery cycles back to customer demand quickly. But it's probably going to be a Q2, Q3 fully caught up."

You would have that in any case associated with these transitions. So perhaps a blip in productivity. But in terms of affecting our overall operating results, nothing of significance to highlight there. As you know, those products have very good margins. So it shouldn't be an issue going forward. On the proposed legislation, actually, a couple comments there. You're aware that, right now, they are -- it is proposed, so it's open for a commentary period. We'll see how it shakes out. But basis of the current proposed legislation, it's all prospective looking. And so when we look at the effect on our business, I would say no immediate impact today for 2016 or our planning horizon over the next 3 to 5 years. I would also comment on -- relative to the proposed legislation, that it has a lot of documentation requirements. We feel like we're fairly buttoned up in this area. You may recall in 2014, we had some incremental investment associated with some external advisers from both a tax and legal perspective. I think we're on very solid foundation relative to some of those items that these regulations address. Going forward, it does require maybe some more rigor and tax-planning strategies. But we've got many tools in our toolbox that we'll continue to execute. The regulations, by the way, are specific to U.S. entities or foreign subsidiaries underneath U.S. entities. So it doesn't impact our every entity within our structure. And it doesn't preclude or eliminate debt transactions with a solid and sound business purpose. So I just remind you, being an Irish-domiciled company, I believe we have a very tax-efficient structure. We have a lot of optionality, and we have the ability to continue even with these regulations to move cash around the globe, tax efficiently that gives us a competitive advantage."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We posted a solid quarter of results, delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies.

We posted a solid quarter of results, delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies. Revenues of $502 million grew 9.5%, reflecting organic growth of 3.6% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions. Europe and Asia Pacific revenues were in line with expectations from a market and performance level.
I would like to note that the Americas organic growth of 3.4% was delivered despite the implementation of a new operating system at our Indianapolis operation facility. This is part of a natural evolution of an older legacy system that will allow Allegion to continue to deliver best-in-class products and solutions. I am very pleased with the progress thus far and the speed and flexibility demonstrated by our teams to make the continuous improvements necessary to quickly restore our industry-leading delivery cycles at the Indianapolis plant. 
We believe the nonresidential markets continue to show stable growth as reflected in the strength of our orders and backlogs in the first quarter. Patrick will provide further details when discussing the Americas financials.
Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% versus the prior year. Overall operating margin improved by 40 basis points with all regions delivering increases versus the prior year period.
We remain focused on our growth strategies and continue to balance ongoing investments with improved operating performance.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 increased more than 19% versus the prior year period, primarily driven from improved operating performance and acquisitions. This is our seventh straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.
Also in the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares. This is consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy and goal to offset dilution at a minimum.
Please go to Slide 4. In the Americas, Allegion's distinctive position as both a nonresidential and residential market leader gives our team the capabilities to leverage technologies across both markets. Utilizing these unique capabilities, we've implemented a new multifamily strategy to drive profit and grow market share as well as establish thought leadership as the key implementation of multifamily strategy. 
Allegion has created Schlage Control, the next generation of electronic access for the world of multifamily. The open integration capabilities deliver the ability for property owners to manage both residential and common area doors on a single superior system and from anywhere using cloud or web-based apps. Schlage Control eliminates dealing with traditional keys while providing residents convenient smart card and phone credentials. Our deadbolts launched in December 2015, and our interconnected locks are set to launch in May.
A number of other multifamily growth opportunities are being pursued, including accelerating the OEM software platforms, leveraging relationships with market influencers and creating standard specification guidelines. With all these initiatives, Allegion has completed -- created a complete solution package to offer multifamily customers. We look forward to watching for more success in the multifamily segment throughout 2016 and beyond.
Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year guidance."

Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides.
As indicated, we delivered 3.6% organic growth in the first quarter with balanced contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization, and volume growth was supported by stable markets that performed as expected. Foreign currency remains a headwind but is moderating sequentially when compared to prior quarters. And acquisitions contributed approximately $46 million or 10% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $502.3 million, which is a 9.5% increase versus the prior year period. I was pleased with the revenue growth given solid price realization, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region. We continue to experience solid electronic product growth and are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% compared to the prior year. 
All regions delivered improved operating margins, and this reflects the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year margin and growth. The benefit of acquisitions, favorable pricing, productivity and net commodity deflation more than offset other inflation and investments. Of note, volume increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix in the quarter, most notably related to the mix of products sold in the Americas. I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 19.8%, an improvement of 100 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2015, reported EPS was $0.47. Adjusting $0.04 for the prior year, Venezuela devaluation and noncash impairment charge, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.51. Operational results increased EPS by $0.07 as favorable price, foreign exchange and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs, resulting in a slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.04 in the quarter.
Next, interest and other income were a net $0.03 increase. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter 2015. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities and a onetime benefit from equity investments. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.01 per share decline versus the prior year. The first quarter effective tax rate is higher than the full year guidance, reflecting the timing of certain tax positions.
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.03 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2016 EPS of $0.61 per share, an increase of approximately 20% versus the prior year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at first quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.60.
Please go to Slide #8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $363 million, up 2.5% or an increase of 3.4% on an organic basis. The residential business continues to perform well, delivering high single-digit growth with strength across all channels. Our investments in electronic products and style and design solutions continue to deliver strong results. 
The nonresidential segment delivered low single-digit growth while implementing a new operating system at our Indianapolis facility. It's important to note that we realized high single-digit nonresidential order growth in the first quarter and associated increase in backlog, primarily driven by the system transition. As such, we expect some quarterly timing impacts as we work through the backlog. We continue to believe that the market fundamentals for nonresidential construction remain in place for low to mid-single-digit growth for the year.
Americas adjusted operating income of $91.6 million was up 3.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by favorable price, material productivity and material deflation that fully offset unfavorable mix in the quarter. The unfavorable mix was due to the strength of residential growth as well as a mix of commercial product as impacted by the timing effect on shipments related to the operating system transition.
Please go to Slide #9. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $118.5 million, up 45% or up 3.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. Acquisitions delivered more than $36 million in incremental revenue. Electronic product growth continues to be strong, driven by hospitality and CISA products. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $8.3 million increased 219% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 380 basis points. And adjusted EBITDA margins increased 550 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins.
Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $20.8 million, down 8.4% versus the prior year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $9.9 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 63%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 14%. 
Most subregions performed well with notable strength in our China hardware and Australia/New Zealand segments. Asia Pacific broke even on adjusted operating income basis, which reflects an improvement of $2.6 million versus the prior year period. We continue to drive focus on mechanical and electronic hardware solutions, are leveraging the acquisitions made in 2015 and are making good progress in addressing stranded costs related to the system integration divestiture.
Please go to Slide #11. Available cash flow for first quarter 2016 was negative $8.2 million, slightly below prior year. The negative cash flow in the quarter is typical of our historical performance and reflects the seasonal use of working capital. As evident in the increased ratios on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed on effective and efficient use of working capital. Lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

Americas residential markets continue to perform well, especially in big box and e-commerce after-market segments. And although U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated slightly, we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential markets. 
Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education with flat to modest health-care expansion. For Americas revenue, the heavy lifting of our Indianapolis operating center integration is behind us, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve full year organic growth of 5% to 6%. I am pleased with growth delivered in the first quarter from our EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions in support of our full year targets. Our acquisitions are delivering growth, and the markets are performing as expected.
Please go to Slide 13. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our first quarter results that delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all of our reporting segments and earnings per share growth of more than 19%. Allegion is executing on our margin improvement in EMEIA, benefiting from our acquisitions and realizing contributions for our new product introductions, especially within the electronic segment. Finally, we remain on track and are positioned well to deliver our original guidance.
Now Patrick and I will take your questions."

So I would say, maybe another way to look at it is, without this, we certainly would have participated well within that range, probably at the higher end of that full year range. So as we look going forward, we're making good strides of progress. Production is up relative to year-over-year. We're eating into the backlog every day. And so the thought would be to make it up as soon as possible because our delivery cycles back to customer demand quickly. But it's probably going to be a Q2, Q3 fully caught up."

But in terms of affecting our overall operating results, nothing of significance to highlight there. As you know, those products have very good margins. So it shouldn't be an issue going forward. On the proposed legislation, actually, a couple comments there. You're aware that, right now, they are -- it is proposed, so it's open for a commentary period. We'll see how it shakes out. But basis of the current proposed legislation, it's all prospective looking. And so when we look at the effect on our business, I would say no immediate impact today for 2016 or our planning horizon over the next 3 to 5 years. I would also comment on -- relative to the proposed legislation, that it has a lot of documentation requirements. We feel like we're fairly buttoned up in this area. You may recall in 2014, we had some incremental investment associated with some external advisers from both a tax and legal perspective. I think we're on very solid foundation relative to some of those items that these regulations address. Going forward, it does require maybe some more rigor and tax-planning strategies. But we've got many tools in our toolbox that we'll continue to execute. The regulations, by the way, are specific to U.S. entities or foreign subsidiaries underneath U.S. entities. So it doesn't impact our every entity within our structure. And it doesn't preclude or eliminate debt transactions with a solid and sound business purpose. So I just remind you, being an Irish-domiciled company, I believe we have a very tax-efficient structure. We have a lot of optionality, and we have the ability to continue even with these regulations to move cash around the globe, tax efficiently that gives us a competitive advantage."

I'm extremely pleased with the company's second quarter results. We continue to deliver profitable growth that reflect continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investment in the business. 
Revenues of $584.9 million grew 12.6%, reflecting organic growth of 8.9% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions. The Americas had organic growth of 9.8%, which was driven by strong revenue growth in our nonresidential business. This included an anticipated shift in revenue from Q1 to Q2 associated with our ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. 
If you recall, we ended the first quarter with elevated levels of backlog associated with the implementation. I am pleased to say we made significant progress in the second quarter to improve throughput and reduce the associated backlog. 
We caught up on shipments and I expect a normal flow of shipments for the second half of the year. EMEIA organic revenues grew at 3% and our Asia Pacific business had a very strong organic revenue growth of 12.9%. 
If we exclude the previously divested system integration businesses, business revenues from prior year amounts, the Asia Pacific business achieved organic growth of 23.6%. 
Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% versus the prior year. Overall operating margin improved by 200 basis points. This is the second straight quarter in which all Allegion regions delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion. Once again, demonstrating our ability to efficiently leverage incremental volume. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.99 increased more than 39% versus the prior-year period driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate. This is our eighth straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. 
As a result, we are improving our full year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%. In addition, we are tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.30 to $3.40 per share. 
Please go to Slide 4. Shifting a bit from the financials, I am equally pleased with our safety performance of our business. We believe that excellent and safety is a true north metric of enterprise excellence, and having a workforce committed to safety is crucial for continued operational success in delivering shareholder value. As you can see from the chart, Allegion has consistently been a leader among our peers and other manufacturing companies for total recordable incident rates. We incorporate safety in our business systems and measure ourselves against annual goals. 
Year-to-date 2016, we continue to see an improvement of 13% by forecasting on risk and a reduction of injuries at home and at work. Be safe and be healthy is one of Allegion's core values in providing and maintaining safe work environment is my #1 priority. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financials, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2016 guidance."

Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter.

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 8.9% organic growth in the second quarter with contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization as well as volume growth. 
Foreign currency was a modest headwind in the quarter while acquisitions contributed approximately $40 million of incremental revenue or 7.7% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $584.9 million, which is a 12.6% increase versus the prior year period. 
I was pleased with the revenue growth, driven by volume increases, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region. As Dave mentioned earlier, our revenue growth reflects increased shipments following our Q1 ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. 
We continue to experience solid electronic product growth, which was up in the midteens, and we are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. 
Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% compared to the prior year. The benefit of strong leverage on incremental volumes help deliver 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins and this reflects the 5th straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our North America nonresidential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. 
I will discuss this in more detail when we're reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.2%, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2015, reported EPS was $0.66 adjusting $0.05 for prior year restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures to 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.71. Operational results increased EPS by $0.18 as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity and inflation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. 
And although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs resulting in slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate will be $0.05 per share reduction versus the prior year. 
The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions and the continued execution of the company's tax planning strategies. Acquisitions net of divestitures added $0.03 in the quarter. 
Next, interest and other income were a net reset increased to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities. This represents the full liquidation of the securities. 
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities from new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were $0.01 reduction. 
This reflects an adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.99 per share, an increase of approximately $0.28 or 39.4% versus the prior-year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring costs. After giving effect to this onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.98 per share. 
Please go to Slide #8. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.5 million, up 8.6% or an increase of 9.8% on an organic basis. Growth in our electronics products increased midteen percent versus the prior year as we continue to see better-than-market growth from this product category in both residential and nonresidential markets. 
The nonresidential segment delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, pricing remained solid and end markets are performing, as expected, with growth in both commercial and institutional areas. Additionally, the second quarter results were inclusive higher-than-normal shipments at our Indianapolis facility which underwent an ERP implementation in Q1 and had experienced delays in shipments. 
On a year-to-date basis, the nonresidential segment grew high single digits. The residential business grew at low single digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior year results. Volume growth in new construction builder channels and e-commerce was partially offset by pricing weakness. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single digits, consistent with the original market expectations share during our February call. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $130 million was up 16.2% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage and favorable mix attributable to the strength of nonresidential growth. Overall inflation was partially offset by pricing and productivity in the quarter. A higher inflation reflects some quarterly timing differences. 
When looking at the year-to-date performance, pricing and productivity more than offset inflation. We would expect this to be the case for the balance of the year although we are expecting to see some additional commodity inflation pressure in the second half. 
And as noted in the presentation, investments have been a modest headwind year-to-date. We expect additional investment headwind to be back-end loaded for the Americas segment. 
Please go to Slide #9. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $121.6 million, up 44.9% or up 3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. 
Acquisitions delivered approximately $35 million in incremental revenue. We have not seen any meaningful impact from the U.K. EU referendum vote or Brexit. It's too early to quantify any potential impacts for our business or industry. But I would note that the U.K. sales are historically less than 10% of our EMEIA portfolio. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $9.3 million increased 116.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 250 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 440 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the regions margins. This represent the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year margin improvement. 
Please go to Slide #10. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $26.8 million, down 20% versus the prior-year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove $15.2 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business in prior year numbers, total revenue grew 46.2% and organic revenues grew approximately 23.6%. 
Most subregions performed well with notable strength in China hardware and Australia/New Zealand. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income was $2.3 million, which reflects an improvement of $3.7 million versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 1,280 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margins improved 830 basis points, excluding the previously divested system integration business and acquisitions. 
The increase in margin reflects strong volume leverage, cost improvements and year-over-year benefit of divesting the system integration business as well as the acquisitions. 
Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2016 was $84.7 million, a $69.9 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow is primarily attributable to increased earnings, decreased operating cash requirements and lower capital expenditures. As evident in the increased ratios on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. And lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year. 
Please go to Slide #12. You will remember our capital allocation strategy that a balanced and flexible approach. The company improved its debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 3x at the end of the second quarter, in the middle of our targeted long-term range of 2.75 to 3.25. This represents a half turn improvement over the ratio at 12/31/15 of 3.5 times. The decrease in the leverage ratio is a component of increased EBITDA and normal debt amortization and demonstrates the ability of our company to deleverage quickly from profitable growth, low capital requirements and strong cash generation. Additionally, I wanted to highlight that Standard & Poor's have upgraded Allegion to investment-grade during the second quarter of 2016. 
We continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2016 performance, we continue to believe these investments will enable the company to grow in an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with high returns on invested capital. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Trelock GmbH. Trelock, a portable safety and security provider producing bicycle locks, lights and electronic control units strengthens our global portfolio, security and safety offerings. 
We will continue to evaluate acquisitions that are core to our business and can expand our global footprint and product portfolio and provide a favorable return on invested capital. 
And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, due to consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We are improving our 2016 guidance for revenue and EPS as noted on the slide. We are increasing revenue growth for all regions given first half performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. This results in total organic revenue improving full point versus prior guidance to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue improving to a range of 8% to 9%. 
If we look closer at the Americas business, residential market indicators still suggests continued growth. New construction starts are approaching $1.2 million with resilient strength in the multifamily segment. 
The residential aftermarket is also performing well, given increased home pricing and low mortgage rates. Nonresidential markets continue to perform well, and we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential segments. Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education, and are seeing slight improvement in health care aftermarket with an increase in renovations and additions. 
In the commercial segment, office construction remains strong, driven by employment growth and reduced vacancy rates. European markets have stabilized and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase of our organic guidance. We are still recognizing the benefits of prior year acquisitions and are leveraging a broader portfolio to accelerate growth. 
In the Asia Pacific segment, we continue to make progress with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals. For example, multifamily in Australia and New Zealand and transportation in China. We are also tightening and raising the low end of EPS guidance, reflecting confidence in achieving the improved top line outlook. However, we are anticipating some pressure on second half earnings due to  inflationary headwinds, second half weighted investments and a tax rate at a high end of prior guidance. 
I would also note that our guidance now reflect the inclusion of the Trelock acquisition for the second half of the year. 
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our second quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew over 12%, organic revenue grew almost 9%, operating margin increased 200 basis points. EBITDA margins grew 260 basis points. EPS grew over 39%. These are strong numbers. We have increased our revenue growth expectations for the year and have tighten a range for our full year EPS outlook. 
Before we take questions, I'd like to take a moment to share some news with regard to an organizational change at Allegion. Tom Martineau will be assuming the role of Vice President of Finance for the EMEIA reason. As you know, Tom has been in the Investor Relations role since the creation of Allegion. During this time, Tom has established the company's Investor Relations program and has served as a valuable voice of the shareholder community along with the leadership team. This is a great opportunity for Tom, and I'm sure you'll all want to congratulate him on this exciting move. 
As we move forward, Mike [ph], Allegion's Vice President and Treasurer, will assume the additional responsibilities of Investor Relations. Mike has been with Allegion and Ingersoll Rand for 10 years and brings a wealth of financial experience and that will position him well as the company's primary representative to the investment community. Congratulations to you both. 
The transition will occur at the month of August with formal transition by the end of August. Please continue to contact Tom during this time for any investor-related questions. 
Now Patrick, and I will not be happy to take your questions."

So a couple of quick things as you saw on the results, Q2 sequentially down a little bit and pricing up still pretty good traction and in nonresi. The pressure there was more in the residential side, nothing really out of the normal course of business but some added cost associated with rebates, advertising, merchandising credits, those types of things. We would anticipate the back half to improve relative to Q2. So as Dave mentioned, still anticipate the kind of pass on to the extent we can pricing relative to the increase in inflation, but there's always a lag attached to that. And as it relates to inflation, as you know, I mean, the commodity input costs are rising particularly steel, which is up the last numbers I saw like 60% relative to the beginning of the year in terms of spot rates. So that's going to put a little pressure on our numbers in the back half of the year."

I'd say there's a little bit more pressure there in terms of what we originally anticipated given some of the inflationary headwinds we talked about. We've stepped up some of our investments in the business as well to better position us for growth going forward, particularly as we look at our long-range planning cycle in 2017 and beyond. So that's going to have a little pressure as well. But if you look at the business in the quarter, good performance. EBIT margin is up 250 basis points, EBITDA, 440. So we like the progress there. We are executing to our margin improvement plan. But maybe a little bit of delay but collectively, a good story, particularly when you look at where we started the journey. You may recall 2013 was like a 1% EBIT margin. So significant progress, continue to move forward, probably not as quick as we would like but yet, we're not capitulating on our 10% objective."

But then when you go below the line, it's when the year-over-year comparabilities get very difficult. So you've got -- you may recall last year, other income was up on the sale of marketable securities. We had a lower tax rate last year because of some favorabilities and onetime items there that are nonrecurring this year.

It seems like your guidance embeds a slowdown in the revenue growth rate. Organic growth, you've been running well above 5% for more than 2 years now with the exception of the first quarter and the production disruptions. But it seems to me that your guidance embeds something below 5%. Is that correct? And what's driving this pricing slowing down or your commentary on the market sounded pretty optimistic."

Q2 was abnormally high given some of the catch-up relative to the ERP implementation, which we now have behind us. But you kind of look at the first half, mid-single digits. Second half up slightly lower than that so you're comment is correct. Predominantly because last year, we had difficult -- we've got really strong quarters particularly in the residential business where we had some loadings on new products. You may recall the launch of the Schlage Sense product, which is a big driver in Q4 in particular last year. So that's kind of what we're looking at difficult comparisons. But the core business will continue to grow, again, we're making really good traction on our initiatives in terms of some of the new product launches, the channel initiatives. Dave talked about the retrofit opportunity getting good traction there. So it's more about more difficult comparisons in the back half of the year."

But we have commented previously, raw commodity costs of roughly 10% of our material purchases, still being probably 50% of that, so that's the biggest commodity input, that's the biggest mover that we've seen recently. If you try to quantify it, it's probably put it on additional pressure $0.02 to $0.03 in the back half of the year. We manage that through supply lock contracts but everything is not hedged. And so the unhedged portion kind of flows through the business as we purchase of those components. Additionally, obviously, you've got from our supply base they're buying the same inputs and so you've got pressure in terms of potential cost increases from our suppliers and also, coming equation. But we'll continue to manage it and offset set it. As we said earlier, we have the mechanism to try to do that through pricing."

A couple of things worth noting here. The acquisitions of the businesses we've acquired predominantly being European base have higher working capital needs and that's distorting the year-over-year comparatives. If you kind of back that out, we are about 5% working capital as a percentage of revenue, about 50 days cash conversion cycle. So there is some impact of the acquisitions, which [ph] will continue to drive that and look for ways to become more efficient. Secondly, as it relates to some of these facility moves and the ERP implementation, you carry higher inventory of safety stock. So as we make those transitions effectively, we'll burn more inventory. So the number should come down. But longer term basis, I would anticipate us to build, operate effectively, efficiently and about a 5% working capital as a percentage of revenue."

I'm extremely pleased with the company's second quarter results. We continued to deliver profitable growth that reflect continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investments in the business. 
Revenues of $584.9 million grew 12.6%, reflecting organic growth of 8.9% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions. The Americas had organic growth of 9.8%, which was driven by strong revenue growth in our nonresidential business. This included an anticipated shift in revenue from Q1 to Q2 associated with our ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. 
If you recall, we ended the first quarter with elevated levels of backlog associated with the implementation. I am pleased to say we made significant progress in the second quarter to improve throughput and reduce the associated backlog. 
We caught up on shipments and I expect a normal flow of shipments for the second half of the year. EMEIA organic revenues grew at 3% and our Asia Pacific business had a very strong organic revenue growth of 12.9%. 
If we exclude the previously divested system integration businesses, business revenues from prior year amounts, the Asia Pacific business achieved organic growth of 23.6%. 
Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 200 basis points. This is the second straight quarter in which all Allegion regions delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion, once again demonstrating our ability to efficiently leverage incremental volume. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.99 increased more than 39% versus the prior-year period driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate. This is our eighth straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. 
As a result, we are improving our full year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%. In addition, we are tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.30 to $3.40 per share. 
Please go to Slide 4. Shifting a bit from the financials, I am equally pleased with our safety performance of our business. We believe that excellent and safety is a true north metric of enterprise excellence, and having a workforce committed to safety is crucial for continued operational success in delivering shareholder value. As you can see from the chart, Allegion has consistently been a leader among our peers and other manufacturing companies for total recordable incident rates. We incorporate safety in our business system and measure ourselves against annual goals. 
Year-to-date 2016, we continue to see an improvement of 13% by forecasting on risk and a reduction of injuries at home and at work. Be safe and be healthy is one of Allegion's core values in providing and maintaining safe work environment is my #1 priority. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financials, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2016 guidance."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 8.9% organic growth in the second quarter with contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization as well as volume growth. 
Foreign currency was a modest headwind in the quarter, while acquisitions contributed approximately $40 million of incremental revenue or 7.7% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $584.9 million, which is a 12.6% increase versus the prior year period. 
I was pleased with the revenue growth, driven by volume increases, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region. As Dave mentioned earlier, our revenue growth reflects increased shipments following our Q1 ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. 
We continue to experience solid electronic product growth, which was up in the midteens, and we are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. 
Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% compared to the prior year. The benefit of strong leverage on incremental volumes helped deliver 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins and this reflects the 5th straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our North America nonresidential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. 
I will discuss this in more detail when we're reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.2%, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2015, reported EPS was $0.66 adjusting $0.05 for prior year restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures to 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.71. Operational results increased EPS by $0.18 as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity and inflation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. 
And although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs resulting in slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate will be $0.05 per share reduction versus the prior year. 
The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions and the continued execution of the company's tax planning strategies. Acquisitions net of divestitures added $0.03 in the quarter. 
Next, interest and other income were a net reset increased to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities. This represents the full liquidation of the securities. 
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were $0.01 reduction. 
This reflects an adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.99 per share, an increase of approximately $0.28 or 39.4% versus the prior-year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring costs. After giving effect to this onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter of 2016 reported EPS of $0.98 per share. 
Please go to Slide #8. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.5 million, up 8.6% or an increase of 9.8% on an organic basis. Growth in our electronics products increased midteen percent versus the prior year as we continue to see better-than-market growth from this product category in both residential and nonresidential markets. 
The nonresidential segment delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, pricing remained solid and end markets are performing, as expected, with growth in both commercial and institutional areas. Additionally, the second quarter results were inclusive higher-than-normal shipments at our Indianapolis facility, which underwent an ERP implementation in Q1 and had experienced delays in shipments. 
On a year-to-date basis, the nonresidential segment grew high single digits. The residential business grew at low single digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior year results. Volume growth in new construction builder channels and e-commerce was partially offset by pricing weakness. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single digits, consistent with the original market expectations share during our February call. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $130 million was up 16.2% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage and favorable mix attributable to the strength of nonresidential growth. Overall inflation was largely offset by pricing and productivity in the quarter. A higher inflation reflects some quarterly timing differences. 
When looking at the year-to-date performance, pricing and productivity more than offset inflation. We would expect this to be the case for the balance of the year although we are expecting to see some additional commodity inflation pressure in the second half. 
And as noted in the presentation, investments have been a modest headwind year-to-date. We expect additional investment headwind to be back-end loaded for the Americas segment. 
Please go to Slide #9. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $121.6 million, up 44.9% or up 3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. 
Acquisitions delivered approximately $35 million in incremental revenue. We have not seen any meaningful impact from the U.K. EU referendum vote or Brexit. It's too early to quantify any potential impacts for our business or industry. But I would note that the U.K. sales are historically less than 10% of our EMEIA portfolio. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $9.3 million increased 116.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 250 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 440 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the regions margins. This represent the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year margin improvement. 
Please go to Slide #10. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $26.8 million, down 20% versus the prior-year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove by $15.2 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business in prior year numbers, total revenue grew 46.2% and organic revenues grew approximately 23.6%. 
Most subregions performed well with notable strength in China hardware and Australia/New Zealand. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income was $2.3 million, which reflects an improvement of $3.7 million versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 1,280 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margins improved 830 basis points, excluding the previously divested system integration business and acquisitions. 
The increase in margin reflects strong volume leverage, cost improvements and year-over-year benefit of divesting the system integration business as well as the acquisitions. 
Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2016 was $84.7 million, a $69.9 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow is primarily attributable to increased earnings, decreased operating cash requirements and lower capital expenditures. As evident in the increased ratios on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. And lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year. 
Please go to Slide #12. You will remember our capital allocation strategy that [ph] demands a balanced and flexible approach. The company improved its debt to EBITDA ratio to 3x at the end of the second quarter, in the middle of our targeted long-term range of 2.75x to 3.25x. This represents a half turn improvement over the ratio at 12/31/15 of 3.5x. The decrease in the leverage ratio is a component of increased EBITDA and normal debt amortization and demonstrates the ability of our company to deleverage quickly from profitable growth, low capital requirements and strong cash generation. Additionally, I wanted to highlight that Standard & Poor's have upgraded Allegion to investment-grade during the second quarter of 2016. 
We continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2016 performance, we continue to believe these investments will enable the company to grow in an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with high returns on invested capital. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Trelock GmbH. Trelock, a portable safety and security provider producing bicycle locks, lights and electronic control units strengthens our global portfolio, security and safety offerings. 
We will continue to evaluate acquisitions that are core to our business and can expand our global footprint and product portfolio and provide a favorable return on invested capital. 
And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, due to consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We are improving our 2016 guidance for revenue and EPS as noted on the slide. We are increasing revenue growth for all regions given first half performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. This",601,"Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 13. We are improving our 2016 guidance for revenue and EPS as noted on the slide. We are increasing revenue growth for all regions given first half performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. This results in total organic revenue improving 1% versus prior guidance to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue improving to a range of 8% to 9%. 
If we look closer at the Americas business, residential market indicators still suggests continued growth. New construction starts are approaching $1.2 million with resilient strength in the multifamily segment. 
The residential aftermarket is also performing well, given increased home pricing and low mortgage rates. Nonresidential markets continue to perform well, and we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential segments. Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education, and are seeing slight improvement in health care aftermarket with an increase in renovations and additions. 
In the commercial segment, office construction remains strong, driven by employment growth and reduced vacancy rates. European markets have stabilized and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase of our organic guidance. We are still recognizing the benefits of prior year acquisitions and are leveraging a broader portfolio to accelerate growth. 
In the Asia Pacific segment, we continue to make progress with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals. For example, multifamily in Australia and New Zealand and transportation in China. We are also tightening and raising the low end of EPS guidance, reflecting confidence in achieving the improved top line outlook. However, we are anticipating some pressure on second half earnings due to the inflationary headwinds, second half weighted investments and a tax rate at the high end of prior guidance. 
I would also note that our guidance now reflect the inclusion of the Trelock acquisition for the second half of the year. 
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our second quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew over 12%, organic revenue grew almost 9%, operating margin increased 200 basis points. EBITDA margins grew 260 basis points. EPS grew over 39%. These are strong numbers. We have increased our revenue growth expectations for the year and have tightened the range for our full year EPS outlook. 
Before we take questions, I'd like to take a moment to share some news with regard to an organizational change at Allegion. Tom Martineau will be assuming the role of Vice President of Finance for the EMEIA reason. As you know, Tom has been in the Investor Relations role since the creation of Allegion. During this time, Tom has established the company's Investor Relations program and has served as a valuable voice of the shareholder community along with the leadership team. This is a great opportunity for Tom, and I'm sure you'll all want to congratulate him on this exciting move. 
As we move forward, Mike Wagnes, Allegion's Vice President and Treasurer, will assume the additional responsibilities of Investor Relations. Mike has been with Allegion and Ingersoll-Rand for 10 years and brings a wealth of financial experience that will position him well as the company's primary representative to the investment community. Congratulations to you both. 
The transition will occur in the month of August with formal transition by the end of August. Please continue to contact Tom during this time for any investor-related questions. 
Now Patrick, and I will be happy to take your questions."

The pressure there was more in the residential side, nothing really out of the normal course of business but some added cost associated with the rebates, advertising, merchandising credits, those type of things. We would anticipate the back half to improve relative to Q2. So as Dave mentioned, still anticipate the kind of pass on to the extent we can pricing relative to the increase in inflation, but there's always a lag attached to that. And as it relates to inflation, as you know, I mean, the commodity input costs are rising particularly steel, which is up by -- in the last numbers I saw like 60% relative to the beginning of the year in terms of spot rates. So that's going to put a little pressure on our numbers in the back half of the year."

So that's going to have a little pressure as well. But if you look at the business in the quarter, good performance. EBIT margin is up 250 basis points, EBITDA, 440. So we like the progress there. We are executing to our margin improvement plan. But maybe a little bit of delay, but collectively, a good story, particularly when you look at where we started the journey.

But then when you go below the line, it's when the year-over-year comparabilities get very difficult. So you've got -- you may recall last year, other income was up on the sale of marketable securities. We had a lower tax rate last year because of some favorabilities and onetime items there that are nonrecurring this year.

Going forward, as the business grows, we will continue to show some leverage and we're targeting in the near term horizon, have a 10% margin opportunity, is where we'd like to see the business go with kind of high single digits to low double-digit growth in that business."

So there is some impact of the acquisitions, which, hey, look, we'll continue to drive that and look for ways to become more efficient. Secondly, as it relates to some of these facility moves and the ERP implementation, you carry higher inventory of safety stock. So as we make those transitions effectively, we'll burn more inventory.

What's the level of revenue we'd like to add, I'd like to think $50 million to $200 million on an annualized basis would be a nice cadence. But I want to remind you, we're going to be disciplined in the capital deployment and build on what's right for Allegion. So that's how I describe it."

I'm extremely pleased with the company's second quarter results. We continued to deliver profitable growth that reflects continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investments in the business. 
Revenues of $584.9 million grew 12.6%, reflecting organic growth of 8.9% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions. The Americas had organic growth of 9.8%, which was driven by strong revenue growth in our nonresidential business. This included an anticipated shift in revenue from Q1 to Q2 associated with our ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. 
If you recall, we ended the first quarter with elevated levels of backlog associated with the implementation. I am pleased to say we made significant progress in the second quarter to improve throughput and reduce the associated backlog. 
We caught up on shipments and I expect a normal flow of shipments for the second half of the year. EMEIA organic revenues grew at 3% and our Asia Pacific business had a very strong organic revenue growth of 12.9%. 
If we exclude the previously divested system integration businesses, business revenues from prior year amounts, the Asia Pacific business achieved organic growth of 23.6%. 
Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 200 basis points. This is the second straight quarter in which all Allegion regions delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion, once again demonstrating our ability to efficiently leverage incremental volume. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.99 increased more than 39% versus the prior-year period driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate. This is our eighth straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. 
As a result, we are improving our full year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%. In addition, we are tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.30 to $3.40 per share. 
Please go to Slide 4. Shifting a bit from the financials, I am equally pleased with our safety performance of our business. We believe that excellent and safety is a true north metric of enterprise excellence, and having a workforce committed to safety is crucial for continued operational success in delivering shareholder value. As you can see from the chart, Allegion has consistently been a leader among our peers and other manufacturing companies for total recordable incident rates. We incorporate safety in our business system and measure ourselves against annual goals. 
Year-to-date 2016, we continue to see an improvement of 13% by forecasting on risk and a reduction of injuries at home and at work. Be safe and be healthy is one of Allegion's core values, and providing and maintaining a safe work environment is my #1 priority. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financials, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2016 guidance."

Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter.

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 8.9% organic growth in the second quarter, with contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization as well as volume growth. 
Foreign currency was a modest headwind in the quarter, while acquisitions contributed approximately $40 million of incremental revenue or 7.7% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $584.9 million, which is a 12.6% increase versus the prior year period. 
I was pleased with the revenue growth, driven by volume increases, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region. As Dave mentioned earlier, our revenue growth reflects increased shipments following our Q1 ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. 
We continue to experience solid electronic product growth, which was up in the midteens, and we are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. 
Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% compared to the prior year. The benefit of strong leverage on incremental volumes helped deliver 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins and this reflects the 5th straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our North America nonresidential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. 
I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.2%, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2015, reported EPS was $0.66. Adjusting $0.05 for prior year restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.71. Operational results increased EPS by $0.18 as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity and inflation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. 
And although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs, resulting in slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate will be $0.05 per share reduction versus the prior year. 
The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions and the continued execution of the company's tax planning strategies. Acquisitions net of divestitures added $0.03 in the quarter. 
Next, interest and other income were a net reset increase to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. Favorable other net items primarily reflect the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities. This represents the full liquidation of the securities. 
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.01 reduction. 
This reflects an adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.99 per share, an increase of approximately $0.28 or 39.4% versus the prior-year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring costs. After giving effect to this onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.98 per share. 
Please go to Slide #8. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.5 million, up 8.6% or an increase of 9.8% on an organic basis. Growth in our electronics products increased midteen percent versus the prior year, as we continue to see better-than-market growth from this product category in both residential and nonresidential markets. 
The nonresidential segment delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, pricing remained solid and end markets are performing as expected, with growth in both commercial and institutional areas. Additionally, the second quarter results were inclusive higher-than-normal shipments at our Indianapolis facility, which underwent an ERP implementation in Q1 and had experienced delays in shipments. 
On a year-to-date basis, the nonresidential segment grew high single digits. The residential business grew at low single digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior year results. Volume growth in new construction builder channels and e-commerce was partially offset by pricing weakness. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single digits, consistent with the original market expectations shared during our February call. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $130 million was up 16.2% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage and favorable mix attributable to the strength of nonresidential growth. Overall inflation was largely offset by pricing and productivity in the quarter. The higher inflation reflects some quarterly timing differences. 
When looking at the year-to-date performance, pricing and productivity more than offset inflation. We would expect this to be the case for the balance of the year although we are expecting to see some additional commodity inflation pressure in the second half. 
And as noted in the presentation, investments have been a modest headwind year-to-date. We expect additional investment headwind to be back-end loaded for the Americas segment. 
Please go to Slide #9. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $121.6 million, up 44.9% or up 3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. 
Acquisitions delivered approximately $35 million in incremental revenue. We have not seen any meaningful impact from the U.K. EU referendum vote, or Brexit. It's too early to quantify any potential impacts for our business or industry, but I would note that the U.K. sales are historically less than 10% of our EMEIA portfolio. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $9.3 million increased 116.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 250 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 440 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. This represent the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year margin improvement. 
Please go to Slide #10. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $26.8 million, down 20% versus the prior-year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $15.2 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business in prior year numbers, total revenue grew 46.2% and organic revenues grew approximately 23.6%. 
Most subregions performed well, with notable strength in China hardware and Australia/New Zealand. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income was $2.3 million, which reflects an improvement of $3.7 million versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 1,280 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margins improved 830 basis points, excluding the previously divested system integration business and acquisitions. 
The increase in margin reflects strong volume leverage, cost improvements and year-over-year benefit of divesting the system integration business as well as the acquisitions. 
Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2016 was $84.7 million, a $69.9 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow is primarily attributable to increased earnings, decreased operating cash requirements and lower capital expenditures. As evident in the increased ratios on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. And lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year. 
Please go to Slide #12. You will remember our capital allocation strategy that defines a balanced and flexible approach. The company improved its debt to EBITDA ratio to 3x at the end of the second quarter, in the middle of our targeted long-term range of 2.75x to 3.25x. This represents a half turn improvement over the ratio at 12/31/15 of 3.5x. The decrease in the leverage ratio is a component of increased EBITDA and normal debt amortization and demonstrates the ability of our company to deleverage quickly from profitable growth, low capital requirements and strong cash generation. Additionally, I wanted to highlight that Standard & Poor's upgraded Allegion to investment-grade during the second quarter of 2016. 
We continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2016 performance, we continue to believe these investments will enable the company to grow in an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market, with high returns on invested capital. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Trelock GmbH. Trelock, a portable safety and security provider producing bicycle locks, lights and electronic control units, strengthens our global portfolio, security and safety offerings. 
We will continue to evaluate acquisitions that are core to our business and can expand our global footprint and product portfolio and provide a favorable return on invested capital. 
And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, due to consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We are improving our 2016 guidance for revenue and EPS, as noted on the slide. We are increasing revenue growth for all regions, given first half performance, in our expectations for the remainder of the year. This results in total organic revenue improving a full point versus prior guidance to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue improving to a range of 8% to 9%. 
If we look closer at the Americas business, residential market indicators still suggest continued growth. New construction starts are approaching $1.2 million, with resilient strength in the multifamily segment. 
The residential aftermarket is also performing well, given increased home pricing and low mortgage rates. Nonresidential markets continue to perform well, and we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential segments. Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education and are seeing slight improvement in health care aftermarket, with an increase in renovations and additions. 
In the commercial segment, office construction remains strong, driven by employment growth and reduced vacancy rates. European markets have stabilized and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase of our organic guidance. We are still recognizing the benefits of prior year acquisitions and are leveraging a broader portfolio to accelerate growth. 
In the Asia Pacific segment, we continue to make progress, with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals, for example, multifamily in Australia and New Zealand and transportation in China. We are also tightening and raising the low end of EPS guidance, reflecting confidence in achieving the improved top line outlook. However, we are anticipating some pressure on second half earnings due to the inflationary headwinds, second half weighted investments and a tax rate at the high end of prior guidance. 
I would also note that our guidance now reflects the inclusion of the Trelock acquisition for the second half of the year. 
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our second quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew over 12%, organic revenue grew almost 9%, operating margin increased 200 basis points. EBITDA margins grew 260 basis points. EPS grew over 39%. These are strong numbers. We have increased our revenue growth expectations for the year and have tightened the range for our full year EPS outlook. 
Before we take questions, I'd like to take a moment to share some news with regard to an organizational change at Allegion. Tom Martineau will be assuming the role of Vice President of Finance for the EMEIA reason. As you know, Tom has been in the Investor Relations role since the creation of Allegion. During this time, Tom has established the company's Investor Relations program and has served as a valuable voice of the shareholder community along with the leadership team. This is a great opportunity for Tom, and I'm sure you'll all want to congratulate him on this exciting move. 
As we move forward, Mike Wagnes, Allegion's Vice President and Treasurer, will assume the additional responsibilities of Investor Relations. Mike has been with Allegion and Ingersoll-Rand for 10 years and brings a wealth of financial experience that will position him well as the company's primary representative to the investment community. Congratulations to you both. 
The transition will occur in the month of August, with formal transition by the end of August. Please continue to contact Tom during this time for any investor-related questions.

The pressure there was more in the residential side, nothing really out of the normal course of business but some added cost associated with the rebates, advertising, merchandising credits, those type of things. We would anticipate the back half to improve relative to Q2. So as Dave mentioned, still anticipate the kind of pass on to the extent we can pricing relative to the increase in inflation, but there's always a lag attached to that. And as it relates to inflation, as you know, I mean, the commodity input costs are rising, particularly steel, which is up by -- in the last numbers I saw like 60% relative to the beginning of the year in terms of spot rates. So that's going to put a little pressure on our numbers in the back half of the year."

So that's going to have a little pressure as well. But if you look at the business in the quarter, good performance. EBIT margin is up 250 basis points, EBITDA, 440. So we like the progress there. We are executing to our margin improvement plan. But maybe a little bit of delay, but collectively, a good story, particularly when you look at where we started the journey.

In organic growth, you've been running well above 5% for more than 2 years now with the exception of the first quarter and the production disruptions.

Q2 was abnormally high given some of the catch-up relative to the ERP implementation, which we now have behind us. But you kind of look at the first half, mid-single digits. Second half up slightly lower than that so your comment is correct. Predominantly because last year, we had difficult -- we had really strong quarters, particularly in the residential business where we had some load-ins on new products. You may recall the launch of the Schlage Sense product, which was a big driver in Q4 in particular last year. So that's kind of what we're looking at, difficult comparisons. But the core business will continue to grow. Again, we're making really good traction on our initiatives in terms of some of the new product launches, the channel initiatives. Dave talked about the retrofit opportunity getting good traction there. So it's more about more-difficult comparisons in the back half of the year."

But we had commented previously, raw commodity cost of roughly 10% of our material purchases, steel being probably 50% of that, so that's the biggest commodity input, that's the biggest mover that we've seen recently. If you try to quantify it, it's probably putting on additional pressure $0.02 to $0.03 in the back half of the year. We manage that through supply lock contracts, but everything is not hedged. And so the unhedged portion kind of flows through the business as we purchase those components. Additionally, obviously, you've got from our supply base they're buying the same inputs and so you've got pressure in terms of potential cost increases from our suppliers that also come into the equation. But we'll continue to manage it and offset it. As we said earlier, we have the mechanism to try to do that through pricing."

A couple of things worth noting here. The acquisitions, so the businesses we've acquired. predominantly being European based, have higher working capital needs and that's distorting the year-over-year comparatives. If you kind of back that out, we're at about 5% working capital as a percentage of revenue, about 50 days cash conversion cycle. So there is some impact of the acquisitions, which, hey, look, we'll continue to drive that and look for ways to become more efficient. Secondly, as it relates to some of these facility moves and the ERP implementation, you carry higher inventory of safety stock. So as we make those transitions effectively, we'll burn more inventory. And so the number should come down. But longer-term basis, I would anticipate us to be able to operate effectively, efficiently at about a 5% working capital as a percentage of revenue."

We continued to deliver profitable growth that reflects continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investments in the business. 
Revenues of $584.9 million grew 12.6%, reflecting organic growth of 8.9% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions. The Americas had organic growth of 9.8%, which was driven by strong revenue growth in our nonresidential business. This included an anticipated shift in revenue from Q1 to Q2 associated with our ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. 
If you recall, we ended the first quarter with elevated levels of backlog associated with the implementation. I am pleased to say we made significant progress in the second quarter to improve throughput and reduce the associated backlog. 
We caught up on shipments and I expect a normal flow of shipments for the second half of the year. EMEIA organic revenues grew at 3% and our Asia Pacific business had a very strong organic revenue growth of 12.9%. 
If we exclude the previously divested system integration businesses, business revenues from prior year amounts, the Asia Pacific business achieved organic growth of 23.6%. 
Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 200 basis points. This is the second straight quarter in which all Allegion regions delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion, once again demonstrating our ability to efficiently leverage incremental volume. 
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.99 increased more than 39% versus the prior-year period driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate. This is our eighth straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. 
As a result, we are improving our full year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%. In addition, we are tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.30 to $3.40 per share. 
Please go to Slide 4. Shifting a bit from the financials, I am equally pleased with our safety performance of our business. We believe that excellent and safety is a true north metric of enterprise excellence, and having a workforce committed to safety is crucial for continued operational success in delivering shareholder value. As you can see from the chart, Allegion has consistently been a leader among our peers and other manufacturing companies for total recordable incident rates. We incorporate safety in our business system and measure ourselves against annual goals. 
Year-to-date 2016, we continue to see an improvement of 13% by forecasting on risk and a reduction of injuries at home and at work. Be safe and be healthy is one of Allegion's core values, and providing and maintaining a safe work environment is my #1 priority. 
Patrick will now walk you through the financials, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2016 guidance."

Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide #5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter.

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 8.9% organic growth in the second quarter, with contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization as well as volume growth. 
Foreign currency was a modest headwind in the quarter, while acquisitions contributed approximately $40 million of incremental revenue or 7.7% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures. 
Please go to Slide #6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $584.9 million, which is a 12.6% increase versus the prior year period. 
I was pleased with the revenue growth, driven by volume increases, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region. As Dave mentioned earlier, our revenue growth reflects increased shipments following our Q1 ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. 
We continue to experience solid electronic product growth, which was up in the midteens, and we are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives. 
Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% compared to the prior year. The benefit of strong leverage on incremental volumes helped deliver 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins and this reflects the 5th straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our North America nonresidential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. 
I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.2%, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2015, reported EPS was $0.66. Adjusting $0.05 for prior year restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.71. Operational results increased EPS by $0.18 as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity and inflation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. 
And although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs, resulting in slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate will be $0.05 per share reduction versus the prior year. 
The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions and the continued execution of the company's tax planning strategies. Acquisitions net of divestitures added $0.03 in the quarter. 
Next, interest and other income were a net reset increase to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. Favorable other net items primarily reflect the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities. This represents the full liquidation of the securities. 
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.01 reduction. 
This reflects an adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.99 per share, an increase of approximately $0.28 or 39.4% versus the prior-year period. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring costs. After giving effect to this onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.98 per share. 
Please go to Slide #8. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.5 million, up 8.6% or an increase of 9.8% on an organic basis. Growth in our electronics products increased midteen percent versus the prior year, as we continue to see better-than-market growth from this product category in both residential and nonresidential markets. 
The nonresidential segment delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, pricing remained solid and end markets are performing as expected, with growth in both commercial and institutional areas. Additionally, the second quarter results were inclusive higher-than-normal shipments at our Indianapolis facility, which underwent an ERP implementation in Q1 and had experienced delays in shipments. 
On a year-to-date basis, the nonresidential segment grew high single digits. The residential business grew at low single digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior year results. Volume growth in new construction builder channels and e-commerce was partially offset by pricing weakness. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single digits, consistent with the original market expectations shared during our February call. 
Americas adjusted operating income of $130 million was up 16.2% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage and favorable mix attributable to the strength of nonresidential growth. Overall inflation was largely offset by pricing and productivity in the quarter. The higher inflation reflects some quarterly timing differences. 
When looking at the year-to-date performance, pricing and productivity more than offset inflation. We would expect this to be the case for the balance of the year although we are expecting to see some additional commodity inflation pressure in the second half. 
And as noted in the presentation, investments have been a modest headwind year-to-date. We expect additional investment headwind to be back-end loaded for the Americas segment. 
Please go to Slide #9. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $121.6 million, up 44.9% or up 3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. 
Acquisitions delivered approximately $35 million in incremental revenue. We have not seen any meaningful impact from the U.K. EU referendum vote, or Brexit. It's too early to quantify any potential impacts for our business or industry, but I would note that the U.K. sales are historically less than 10% of our EMEIA portfolio. 
EMEIA adjusted operating income of $9.3 million increased 116.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 250 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 440 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. This represent the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year margin improvement. 
Please go to Slide #10. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $26.8 million, down 20% versus the prior-year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $15.2 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business in prior year numbers, total revenue grew 46.2% and organic revenues grew approximately 23.6%. 
Most subregions performed well, with notable strength in China hardware and Australia/New Zealand. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income was $2.3 million, which reflects an improvement of $3.7 million versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 1,280 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margins improved 830 basis points, excluding the previously divested system integration business and acquisitions. 
The increase in margin reflects strong volume leverage, cost improvements and year-over-year benefit of divesting the system integration business as well as the acquisitions. 
Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2016 was $84.7 million, a $69.9 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow is primarily attributable to increased earnings, decreased operating cash requirements and lower capital expenditures. As evident in the increased ratios on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. And lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year. 
Please go to Slide #12. You will remember our capital allocation strategy that defines a balanced and flexible approach. The company improved its debt to EBITDA ratio to 3x at the end of the second quarter, in the middle of our targeted long-term range of 2.75x to 3.25x. This represents a half turn improvement over the ratio at 12/31/15 of 3.5x. The decrease in the leverage ratio is a component of increased EBITDA and normal debt amortization and demonstrates the ability of our company to deleverage quickly from profitable growth, low capital requirements and strong cash generation. Additionally, I wanted to highlight that Standard & Poor's upgraded Allegion to investment-grade during the second quarter of 2016. 
We continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2016 performance, we continue to believe these investments will enable the company to grow in an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market, with high returns on invested capital. 
We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Trelock GmbH. Trelock, a portable safety and security provider producing bicycle locks, lights and electronic control units, strengthens our global portfolio, security and safety offerings. 
We will continue to evaluate acquisitions that are core to our business and can expand our global footprint and product portfolio and provide a favorable return on invested capital. 
And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends and share repurchases. 
In summary, due to consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders. I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We are improving our 2016 guidance for revenue and EPS, as noted on the slide. We are increasing revenue growth for all regions, given first half performance, in our expectations for the remainder of the year. This results in total organic revenue improving a full point versus prior guidance to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue improving to a range of 8% to 9%. 
If we look closer at the Americas business, residential market indicators still suggest continued growth. New construction starts are approaching $1.2 million, with resilient strength in the multifamily segment. 
The residential aftermarket is also performing well, given increased home pricing and low mortgage rates. Nonresidential markets continue to perform well, and we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential segments. Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education and are seeing slight improvement in health care aftermarket, with an increase in renovations and additions. 
In the commercial segment, office construction remains strong, driven by employment growth and reduced vacancy rates. European markets have stabilized and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase of our organic guidance. We are still recognizing the benefits of prior year acquisitions and are leveraging a broader portfolio to accelerate growth. 
In the Asia Pacific segment, we continue to make progress, with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals, for example, multifamily in Australia and New Zealand and transportation in China. We are also tightening and raising the low end of EPS guidance, reflecting confidence in achieving the improved top line outlook. However, we are anticipating some pressure on second half earnings due to the inflationary headwinds, second half weighted investments and a tax rate at the high end of prior guidance. 
I would also note that our guidance now reflects the inclusion of the Trelock acquisition for the second half of the year. 
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our second quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew over 12%, organic revenue grew almost 9%, operating margin increased 200 basis points. EBITDA margins grew 260 basis points. EPS grew over 39%. These are strong numbers. We have increased our revenue growth expectations for the year and have tightened the range for our full year EPS outlook. 
Before we take questions, I'd like to take a moment to share some news with regard to an organizational change at Allegion. Tom Martineau will be assuming the role of Vice President of Finance for the EMEIA reason. As you know, Tom has been in the Investor Relations role since the creation of Allegion. During this time, Tom has established the company's Investor Relations program and has served as a valuable voice of the shareholder community along with the leadership team. This is a great opportunity for Tom, and I'm sure you'll all want to congratulate him on this exciting move. 
As we move forward, Mike Wagnes, Allegion's Vice President and Treasurer, will assume the additional responsibilities of Investor Relations. Mike has been with Allegion and Ingersoll-Rand for 10 years and brings a wealth of financial experience that will position him well as the company's primary representative to the investment community. Congratulations to you both. 
The transition will occur in the month of August, with formal transition by the end of August. Please continue to contact Tom during this time for any investor-related questions. 
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

We would anticipate the back half to improve relative to Q2. So as Dave mentioned, still anticipate the kind of pass on to the extent we can pricing relative to the increase in inflation, but there's always a lag attached to that. And as it relates to inflation, as you know, I mean, the commodity input costs are rising, particularly steel, which is up by -- in the last numbers I saw like 60% relative to the beginning of the year in terms of spot rates. So that's going to put a little pressure on our numbers in the back half of the year."

So that's going to have a little pressure as well. But if you look at the business in the quarter, good performance. EBIT margin is up 250 basis points, EBITDA, 440. So we like the progress there. We are executing to our margin improvement plan. But maybe a little bit of delay, but collectively, a good story, particularly when you look at where we started the journey.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the company's third quarter results.

Third quarter revenues came in at $581 million, growing 6.7% over prior year and reflecting organic growth of 5% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions.
Americas had organic growth of 5.6%, which was driven by solid revenue growth in our nonresidential business.
Europe organic revenues grew 1.6%, and our Asia-Pacific business grew at 7.3% organically. If we exclude the previous -- divested systems integration business, revenues from prior year amounts, the Asia-Pacific business achieved organic growth of 10.6%. Adjusted operating income of $126.7 million increased 8.4% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 30 basis points driven by continued price realization, volume leverage and favorable mix, which is more than offset by incremental investments, which was the headwind of 70 basis points.
Americas and Asia Pacific saw year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin with Europe being slightly down. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 increased slightly versus the prior-year period and driven primarily by improving operating performance.
As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%.
In addition, we are updating the full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.38 to $3.43 per share. This EPS guidance is inclusive of an estimated $0.03 impact from adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Please go to Slide 5. Shifting a bit from the financials, I would like to talk about the electromechanical conversions in the industry and one of our upcoming product launches. With our pioneering brand emphasis on innovation, Allegion continues to lead our industry in electromechanical convergence innovation. Electromechanical convergence doesn't mean we're asking customers to completely convert to electronic security products. We encouraged them to use electronic solutions to complement their mechanical. We are discussing both mechanical and electronic to enable the optimize balance in addressing the physical security needs and unique applications that are secure, cost-effective and convenient to use.
The latest addition to the Schlage Locke family, the LE Series, exemplifies the electromechanical conversions in a commercial environment.
This connected solution will complement our Schlage series for doors with -- and Schlage control for -- applications, all part of our engage connected platform strategy. The locks are able to work with the systems that end users are databases and the benefit of electronic access controls to more doors deeper inside the building. Schlage control NDE and the LE Series lock can also be managed as an offline solution with the engage mobile app. This provides billing access control solutions that is simpler and more cost effective to manage than mechanical keys alone.
Allegion will continue to embrace electromechanical convergence, balanced convenience and security through products like Schlage and LE Series, Schlage control for multifamily and Schlage -- for single-family residential application. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2016 guidance."

This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in the respective slides.
Total reported revenue growth was 6.7.% for the quarter. As indicated, we delivered 5% organic growth with contributions from all regions.
Each region also contributed to both price realization as well as volume growth. Foreign currency was a slight headwind while acquisitions contributed approximately $26 million of incremental revenue or 4.9% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Please go to Slide #7. Reported net revenue for the quarter was $581.1 million, which is a 6.7% increase versus the prior-year period. I was extremely pleased with the solid organic growth from Americas and Asia. In addition, the acquisitions completed in the past 12 months have contributed nicely to revenue growth particularly in the EMEIA region. Adjusted operating income of $126.7 million increased 8.4% compared to the prior year. The benefit of modest margin expansion on incremental volumes net of incremental investments helped deliver 30 basis points of improvement versus the prior year. This reflects the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our Americas nonresidential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. I'll discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.5%, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2015, reported EPS was a loss of $0.28. Adjusting $1.20 for the prior year loss on divestitures, restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.92 per share. Operational results increased EPS by $0.14 as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity inflation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. And although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated cost resulting in a slightly favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions net of divestitures added $0.01 in the quarter.
Next, interest and other income were a net $0.05 decrease to EPS. The higher interest expense was related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. The unfavorable other net items primarily reflects the positive impact from the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities last year.
The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.05 per share degrees versus the prior year. The increase in rate is due to the favorable resolution to uncertain tax positions in 2015 partially offset by favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.04 reduction. This results in an adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.93 per share, an increase of approximately $0.01 or 1.1% versus the prior-year period.
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.91 per share reduction for impairments, restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures.
Third quarter 2016 results included an impairment charge of $84.4 million or $0.87 per share, primarily related to the receivable recorded as consideration for the previously divested system integration business in China.
The impairment write-off reflects our belief that the remaining receivable left on the books when the business was divested was no longer collectible.
Divesting the system integration business was an important step in our portfolio. However, collection of our receivable has been difficult given the deteriorating business conditions and the poor performance of the divesting business.
After giving effect to these items, we arrived at the third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.02. 
Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.2 million, up 4.1% or an increase of 5.6% on an organic basis. The nonresidential segment delivered high single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Pricing remained solid and strength across the nonresidential product portfolio drove the solid growth. The residential business grew at low single-digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior year results.
Favorable volume growth in new construction builder channels was partially offset by weakness in the retail channel. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single-digits.
Americas adjusted operating income of $132.3 million was up 8.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage, pricing and the favorable mix attributable to the strength of nonresidential growth. Overall, price and productivity more than offset the impact in inflation and incremental investment.
We did see higher commodity prices in the third quarter and expect that additional commodity inflation pressure to continue.
And as noted in the presentation, investments were 60 basis points headwind in the quarter. We expect additional investment headwind to continue through the remainder of the year.
Please go to Slide #10. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $116.4 million, up 27.2% or up 1.6% on an organic basis.
Acquisitions delivered approximately $25 million in the incremental revenue. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $7.3 million increased 23.7% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points. The base European business showed margin expansion in the third quarter. This was offset by margin deterioration related to the recent Trelock acquisition driven by seasonality in their markets and operating performance being below expected levels. Although margins declined slightly in the quarter, we anticipate operating income and margin improvement to continue in Q4 and close the year with record performance for Allegion. Similar to the Americas region, price and productivity more than offset impacts from inflation and incremental investments for Europe. During the third quarter, we did begin to see an impact from the U.K. EU referendum vote or Brexit. We saw an unfavorable impact both on the top line revenue as well as operating income.
On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted operating margin is up 200 basis points for the EMEIA region.
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $28.5 million, down 16.4% versus the prior-year period.
As noted on the slide, a decrease was specific to that 2015 divestiture of the system integration business located in China, which drove a $10.6 million reduction in revenues year-over-year.
Excluding the system integration business in prior year numbers, organic revenues grew approximately 10.6%. Most subregions performed well with notable strength in Australia and New Zealand.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income was $1.8 million, which reflects an improvement of $1.1 million versus the prior-year period.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 420 basis points versus the prior-year period. The year-over-year operating income and margin improvement was driven by the impact of the system integration business divestiture in 2015. 
Please go to Slide #12. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2016 of was $152 million, a $53.3 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow was primarily attributable to increased earnings. Working capital as a percent of revenues in the ratio for cash conversion cycle has increased slightly in 2016. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital.
And lastly, we are raising our guidance for full year available cash flow to approximately $300 million, the high end of our previous guidance of $280 million to $300 million. This represents an approximate increase of 35% compared to the prior year.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and updating and tightening our guidance for EPS as noted on this slide. Total organic revenue guidance remains at a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue remaining at a range of 8% to 9%.
If you look closer, the Americas business, nonresidential markets continue to perform well, and we expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential segments.
Modest growth is expected in institutional verticals and solid growth in commercial markets. Residential market indicators still suggest continued growth as new housing starts remain stable but still remain below historical average with resilient strength in the multifamily segment.
Strength in new housing is offset by challenging conditions in big box retailers. European markets have stabilized, and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase in our organic guidance and are leveraging our broader portfolio to accelerate growth.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to make progress with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals. We are tightening our EPS guidance by raising the low end of the range. We are also updating both ends of the guidance for an estimated $0.03 impact related to the adoption of accounting standards for stock-based compensation.
With these changes, we are guiding full year adjusted EPS at $3.38 to $3.43 compared to guidance of $3.30 to $3.40. As we look to 2017, we see markets remaining steady with modest expansion globally.
North American markets are expected to continue to be solid while European markets are expected to be modest. Additionally, we see growth potential in the Asia Pacific markets that we participate in.
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our third quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew close to 7%. Organic revenue grew at 5%. Operating margin increased 30 basis points. It was the sixth straight quarter with year-over-year margin improvement.
EBITDA margin grew by 80 basis points. EPS grew year-over-year despite below the pressure. These are strong numbers.

As you are aware, Q3 normally seasonally is a weaker quarter given some of the shutdowns in the European area. As you mentioned, it was a little bit disappointing to us. I'd say couple of factors to that specifically. One was as you're aware, what they facility closer we announced last year moving from Italy to third-party suppliers has taken a little bit longer than what we had originally anticipated. We're still getting some benefits but not getting as much as we had anticipated in the quarter and the year. It's more of a timing issue as we finish that transition at the beginning of next year. We'll fully realized the benefits there. Secondly, in conjunction with the acquisition of Trelock completed at the end of Q2, startup problems, the seasonality of the business is lower in Q3, a couple of operational hiccups. Not a big business but weighed on the margin expectations, a little bit of an inflation headwind as well. But I think, more importantly, I look at it and step back and say is the region off on the right trajectory, and the answer is yes. We finished the quarter with really strong backlog. It was one of those quarters that started out slow, continued to progress positively in the back half of the quarter, so we ended the quarter with strong backlog that supports an improvement in organic growth sequentially and year-over-year for Q4. And we would expect the margin dollars and margin improvement to continue in Q4 as what you've seen historically in the last several quarters. And I will just remind you historically, when we started this journey 3 years ago, it's been we had in EBIT margin of like 1% and now we're marching towards the objective of 10%. And going forward, we would spend kind of continuous improvement going forward so..."

Where would that end up? How are you thinking about next year? Are you putting through pricing now? And then in terms of investment spend, if we just true up the $0.10 to $0.15, which is the initial target for spend for this year you talk about impact this quarter, how should we think about framing that for '17 at least relative to what your target was for this year?"

We'll continue to invest in the business if we think it's a good return on capital and we can drive accelerated growth faster than the broader market so more to come on that on the next call. Relative to the the price inflation investment equation, I mean, we've always said that we manage the business to ensure that if you look at those components, those inputs, you try to net those out to 0, so that the effect of incremental volume you get margin expansion. That's the financial model that we're trying to drive. You saw that in the quarter. You've seen it in the last 6 quarters, and that's the continued expectation. To the extent inflation rise is faster and we're seeing that and some of the inputs particularly on steel, which is up like 40% relative to where we ended Q2. The expectation over extended period of time is we'll be able to offset that in price. We've done that historically. There's always going to be a timing gap. You can't go out in the market and do that immediately, but that would be the expectation that we could -- we'd be able to offset the inflationary pressure with price and we can drive productivity, operational excellence and do some things later in our facilities."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the company's third quarter results. We continue to deliver profitable growth that reflects continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investments in the business.
Third quarter revenues came in at a $581 million, growing 6.7% over prior year and reflecting organic growth of 5% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions.
Americas had organic growth of 5.6%, which was driven by solid revenue growth in our nonresidential business.
Europe organic revenues grew 1.6%, and our Asia-Pacific business grew at 7.3% organically. If we exclude the previously divested systems integration business, revenues from prior year amounts, the Asia-Pacific business achieved organic growth of 10.6%. Adjusted operating income of $126.7 million increased 8.4% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 30 basis points driven by continued price realization, volume leverage and favorable mix, which is more than offset by incremental investments, which was the headwind of 70 basis points.
Americas and Asia Pacific saw year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin with Europe being slightly down. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 increased slightly versus the prior-year period and driven primarily by improving operating performance.
As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%.
In addition, we are updating and tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.38 to $3.43 per share. This EPS guidance is inclusive of an estimated $0.03 impact from adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Please go to Slide 5. Shifting a bit from the financials, I would like to talk about the electromechanical conversions in the industry and one of our upcoming product launches. With our pioneering brands in emphasis on innovation, Allegion continues to lead our industry in electromechanical convergence and innovation. Electro-mechanical convergence doesn't mean we're asking customers to completely convert to electronic security products. We encouraged them to use electronic solutions to complement their mechanical. We are discussing both mechanical and electronic to enable the optimize balance in addressing the physical security needs and unique applications that are secure, cost-effective and convenient to use.
The latest addition to the Schlage [ph] family, the LE Series, exemplifies the electromechanical conversions in a commercial environment.
This connected motor solution will complement our Schlage NDE series for doors with cylindrical prep and Schlage control for [ph] both applications, all part of our engage connected platform strategy. The locks are able to work with the systems that end users already have in place to extend the benefit of electronic access controls some more doors, deeper inside the building. Schlage control NDE and the LE Series locks can also be managed as an offline solution with the engage mobile app. This provides building owners [ph] billing an access control solutions that is simpler and more cost effective to manage than mechanical keys alone.
Allegion will continue to embrace electro-mechanical convergence, balancing convenience and security through products like Schlage NDE and LE Series, Schlage control for multifamily and Schlage sense for single-family residential application. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide #6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides.
Total reported revenue growth was 6.7.% for the quarter. As indicated, we delivered 5% organic growth with contributions from all regions.
Each region also contributed to both price realization as well as volume growth. Foreign currency was a slight headwind in the quarter, while acquisitions contributed approximately $26 million of incremental revenue of 4.9% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Please go to Slide #7. Reported net revenue for the quarter was $581.1 million, which is a 6.7% increase versus the prior-year period. I was extremely pleased with the solid organic growth from Americas and Asia. In addition, the acquisitions completed in the past 12 months have contributed nicely to revenue growth particularly in the EMEIA region. Adjusted operating income of a $126.7 million increased 8.4% compared to the prior year. The benefit of modest margin expansion on incremental volumes net of incremental investments helped deliver 30 basis points of improvement versus the prior year. This reflects the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our Americas nonresidential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. I'll discuss this in more detail when we're reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.5%, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2015, reported EPS was a loss of $0.28. Adjusting $1.20 for the prior year loss on divestitures, restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.92 per share. Operational results increased EPS by $0.14 as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity inflation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. And although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated cost resulting in a slightly favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.01 in the quarter.
Next, interest and other income were a net $0.05 decrease to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. The unfavorable other net items primarily reflects the positive impact from the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities last year.
The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.05 per share decrease versus the prior year. The increase in rate is due to the favorable resolution to uncertain tax positions in 2015 partially offset by favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.93 per share, an increase of approximately $0.01 or 1.1% versus the prior year period.
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.91 per share reduction for impairments, restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures.
Third quarter 2016 results included an impairment charge of $84.4 million or $0.87 per share, primarily related to the receivable recorded as consideration for the previously divested system integration business in China.
The impairment light-off reflects our belief that the remaining receivable left on the books when the business was divested was no longer collectible.
Divesting the system integration business was an important step improving [ph] our portfolio. However, collection of our receivable has been difficult given the deteriorating business conditions and the poor performance of the divested business.  After giving effect to these items, we arrived at the third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.02.
Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.2 million, up 4.1% or an increase of 5.6% on an organic basis. The nonresidential segment delivered high single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Pricing remained solid and strength across the nonresidential product portfolio drove the solid growth. The residential business grew at low single-digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior year results.
Favorable volume growth in new construction builder channels was partially offset by weakness in the retail channel. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single-digits.
Americas adjusted operating income of a $132.3 million was up 8.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage, pricing and the favorable mix attributable to the strength of nonresidential growth. Overall, price and productivity more than offset the impact from inflation and incremental investment.
We did see higher commodity prices in the third quarter and expect that additional commodity inflation pressure to continue.
And as noted in the presentation, investments were 60 basis points headwind in the quarter. We expect additional investment headwind to continue through the remainder of the year.
Please go to Slide #10. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $116.4 million, up 27.2% or up 1.6% on an organic basis.
Acquisitions delivered approximately $25 million in the incremental revenue. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $7.3 million increased 23.7% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points. The base European business showed margin expansion in the third quarter. This was offset by margin deterioration related to the recent Trelock acquisition driven by seasonality in their markets and operating performance being below expected levels. Although margins declined slightly in the quarter, we anticipate operating income and margin improvement to continue in Q4 and close the year with record performance for Allegion. Similar to the Americas region, price and productivity more than offset impacts from inflation and incremental investments for Europe. During the third quarter, we did begin to see an impact from the U.K., EU referendum vote or Brexit. We saw an unfavorable impact both on the top line revenue as well as operating income.
On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted operating margin is up 200 basis points for the EMEIA region.
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $28.5 million, down 16.4% versus the prior-year period.
As noted on the slide, a decrease was specific to that 2015 divestiture of the system integration business located in China, which drove a $10.6 million reduction in revenues year-over-year.
Excluding the system integration business in prior year numbers, organic revenues grew approximately 10.6%. Most subregions performed well with notable strength in Australia and New Zealand.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income was $1.8 million, which reflects an improvement of $1.1 million versus the prior-year period.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 420 basis points versus the prior-year period. The year-over-year operating income and margin improvement was driven by the impact of the system integration business divestiture in 2015.
Please go to Slide #12. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2016 of was a $152 million, a $53.3 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow is primarily attributable to increased earnings. Working capital as a percent of revenues in the ratio for cash conversion cycle has increased slightly in 2016. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital.
And lastly, we are raising our guidance for full year available cash flow to approximately $300 million, a high end of our previous guidance of $280 million to $300 million. This represents an approximate increase of 35% compared to the prior year.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and updating and tightening our guidance for EPS as noted on this slide. Total organic revenue guidance remains at a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue remaining at a range of 8% to 9%.
If you look closer, the Americas business, nonresidential markets continue to perform well, and we expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential segments.
Modest growth is expected in institutional verticals and solid growth in commercial markets. Residential market indicators still suggest continued growth as new housing starts remain stable but still remain below historical average with resilient strength in the multifamily segment.
Strength in new housing is offset by challenging conditions in big box retailers. European markets have stabilized, and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase in our organic guidance and are leveraging our broader portfolio to accelerate growth.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to make progress with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals. We are tightening our EPS guidance by raising the low end of the range. We are also updating both ends of the guidance for an estimated $0.03 impact related to the adoption of accounting standards for stock-based compensation.
With these changes, we are guiding full year adjusted EPS at $3.38 to $3.43 compared to guidance of $3.30 to $3.40. As we look to 2017, we see markets remaining steady with modest expansion globally.
North American markets are expected to continue to be solid while European markets are expected to be modest. Additionally, we see growth potential in the Asia Pacific markets that we participate in.
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our third quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew close to 7%. Organic revenue grew at 5%. Operating margin increased 30 basis points. It was the sixth straight quarter with year-over-year margin improvement.
EBITDA margin grew by 80 basis points. EPS grew year-over-year despite below the [indiscernible] pressure. These are strong numbers. We are reaffirming our revenue growth expectations for the year, have tightened the range for the full year EPS outlook and have adjusted our available cash flow guidance to the high end of our prior range.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

I'd say couple of factors to that specifically. One was as you're aware, what they facility closure we announced last year moving from Italy to third-party supplier has taken a little bit longer than what we had originally anticipated. We're still getting some benefits but not getting as much as we had anticipated in the quarter and the year. It's more of a timing issue as we finish that transition at the beginning of next year. We'll fully realized the benefits there. Secondly, in conjunction with the acquisition of Trelock completed at the end of Q2, startup problems, the seasonality of the business is lower in Q3, a couple of operational hiccups. Not a big business but weighed on the margin expectations, a little bit of an inflation headwinds as well. But I think, more importantly, I look at it and step back and say is the region off on the right trajectory? And the answer is yes. We finished the quarter with really strong backlog. It was one of those quarters that started out slow, are continued to progress positively in the back half of the quarter, so we ended the quarter with strong backlog that supports an improvement in organic growth sequentially and year-over-year for Q4. And we would expect the margin dollars and margin improvement to continue in Q4 as what you've seen historically in the last several quarters. And I would just remind you historically, when we started this journey 3 years ago, it's been we had in EBIT margin of like 1% and now we're marching towards the objective of 10%.

You may recall long-earning cycle with government municipalities, bad return on invested capital, and so divesting the business given that we had nothing really to leverage within our portfolio, good move there. The write-down last year was just based on the anticipated consideration that we're going to receive. And what happened since the sale basically is the businesses deteriorated relative to its future ongoing cash requirements. The receivables coming in lower than anticipated again from the government municipalities. And so you kind of look at what the expectation is going forward, and we determine that the consideration isn't collectible at this moment. We'll continue to endeavor to do we can to our work with the business to collect on those moneys. But right now, don't anticipate any collections. It has no impact relative to our available cash flow projections. As indicated, we upped our ACF guidance, has no impact really going forward. It was not included in our guidance to begin with.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the company's third quarter results. We continue to deliver profitable growth that reflects continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investments in the business.
Third quarter revenues came in at a $581 million, growing 6.7% over prior year and reflecting organic growth of 5% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions.
Americas had organic growth of 5.6%, which was driven by solid revenue growth in our nonresidential business.
Europe organic revenues grew 1.6%, and our Asia Pacific business grew at 7.3% organically. If we exclude the previously divested System integration business, revenues from prior year amounts, the Asia Pacific business achieved organic growth of 10.6%. Adjusted operating income of $126.7 million increased 8.4% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 30 basis points driven by continued price realization, volume leverage and favorable mix, which is more than offset by incremental investments, which was the headwind of 70 basis points.
Americas and Asia Pacific saw year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin with Europe being slightly down. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 increased slightly versus the prior-year period and driven primarily by improving operating performance.
As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%.
In addition, we are updating and tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.38 to $3.43 per share. This EPS guidance is inclusive of an estimated $0.03 impact from adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Please go to Slide 5. Shifting a bit from the financials, I would like to talk about the electromechanical convergence in the industry and one of our upcoming product launches. With our pioneering brand and emphasis on innovation, Allegion continues to lead our industry in electromechanical convergence and innovation. Electromechanical convergence doesn't mean we're asking customers to completely convert to electronic security products. We encouraged them to use electronic solutions to complement their mechanical. We are discussing both mechanical and electronic to enable the optimize balance in addressing the physical security needs and unique applications that are secure, cost-effective and convenient to use.
The latest addition to the Schlage lock family, the LE Series, exemplifies the electromechanical conversions in a commercial environment.
This connected motor solution will complement our Schlage NDE series for doors with cylindrical prep and Schlage control for dead bolt applications, all part of our ENGAGE connected platform strategy. The locks are able to work with the systems that end users already have in place to extend the benefit of electronic access controls to more doors deeper inside the building. Schlage control NDE and the LE Series locks can also be managed as an offline solution with the ENGAGE mobile app. This provides building owners an access control solution that is simpler and more cost effective to manage than mechanical keys alone.
Allegion will continue to embrace electromechanical convergence, balancing convenience and security through products like Schlage NDE and LE Series, Schlage control for multifamily and Schlage Sense that connect for single-family residential applications. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2016 guidance."

Thank you for joining the call this morning.Please go to Slide #6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter.

Please go to Slide #6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides.
Total reported revenue growth was 6.7.% for the quarter. As indicated, we delivered 5% organic growth with contributions from all regions.
Each region also contributed to both price realization as well as volume growth. Foreign currency was a slight headwind in the quarter, while acquisitions contributed approximately $26 million of incremental revenue of 4.9% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Please go to Slide #7. Reported net revenue for the quarter was $581.1 million, which is a 6.7% increase versus the prior-year period. I was extremely pleased with the solid organic growth from Americas and Asia. In addition, the acquisitions completed in the past 12 months have contributed nicely to revenue growth particularly in the EMEIA region. Adjusted operating income of $126.7 million increased 8.4% compared to the prior year. The benefit of modest margin expansion on incremental volumes net of incremental investments helped deliver 30 basis points of improvement versus the prior year. This reflects the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our Americas nonresidential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. I'll discuss this in more detail when we're reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.5%, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2015, reported EPS was a loss of $0.28. Adjusting $1.20 for the prior year loss on divestitures, restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.92 per share. Operational results increased EPS by $0.14 as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity inflation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. And although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs resulting in a slightly favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.01 in the quarter.
Next, interest and other income were a net $0.05 decrease to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. The unfavorable other net items primarily reflects the positive impact from the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities last year.
The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.05 per share decrease versus the prior year. The increase in rate is due to the favorable resolution to uncertain tax positions in 2015 partially offset by favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.93 per share, an increase of approximately $0.01 or 1.1% versus the prior year period.
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.91 per share reduction for impairments, restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures.
Third quarter 2016 results included an impairment charge of $84.4 million or $0.87 per share, primarily related to the receivable recorded as consideration for the previously divested System integration business in China.
The impairment write-off reflects our belief that the remaining receivable left on the books when the business was divested was no longer collectible.
Divesting the System integration business was an important step pruning our portfolio. However, collection of our receivable has been difficult given the deteriorating business conditions and the poor performance of the divested business. After giving effect to these items, we arrived at the third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.02.
Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.2 million, up 4.1% or an increase of 5.6% on an organic basis. The nonresidential segment delivered high single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Pricing remained solid and strength across the nonresidential product portfolio drove the solid growth. The residential business grew at low single-digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior year results.
Favorable volume growth in new construction builder channels was partially offset by weakness in the retail channel. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single-digits.
Americas adjusted operating income of $132.3 million was up 8.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage, pricing and the favorable mix attributable to the strength of nonresidential growth. Overall, price and productivity more than offset the impact from inflation and incremental investment.
We did see higher commodity prices in the third quarter and expect that additional commodity inflation pressure to continue.
And as noted in the presentation, investments were 60 basis points headwind in the quarter. We expect additional investment headwind to continue through the remainder of the year.
Please go to Slide #10. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $116.4 million, up 27.2% or up 1.6% on an organic basis.
Acquisitions delivered approximately $25 million in the incremental revenue. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $7.3 million increased 23.7% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points. The base European business showed margin expansion in the third quarter. This was offset by margin deterioration related to the recent Trelock acquisition driven by seasonality in their markets and operating performance being below expected levels. Although margins declined slightly in the quarter, we anticipate operating income and margin improvement to continue in Q4 and close the year with record performance for Allegion. Similar to the Americas region, price and productivity more than offset impacts from inflation and incremental investments for Europe. During the third quarter, we did begin to see an impact from the U.K., EU referendum vote for Brexit. We saw an unfavorable impact both on the top line revenue as well as operating income.
On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted operating margin is up 200 basis points for the EMEIA region.
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $28.5 million, down 16.4% versus the prior-year period.
As noted on the slide, a decrease was specific to that 2015 divestiture of the system integration business located in China, which drove a $10.6 million reduction in revenues year-over-year.
Excluding the system integration business in prior year numbers, organic revenues grew approximately 10.6%. Most subregions performed well with notable strength in Australia and New Zealand.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income was $1.8 million, which reflects an improvement of $1.1 million versus the prior-year period.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 420 basis points versus the prior-year period. The year-over-year operating income and margin improvement was driven by the impact of the system integration business divestiture in 2015.
Please go to Slide #12. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2016 was $152 million, a $53.3 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow was primarily attributable to increased earnings. Working capital as a percent of revenues in the ratio for cash conversion cycle has increased slightly in 2016. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital.
And lastly, we are raising our guidance for full year available cash flow to approximately $300 million, the high end of our previous guidance of $280 million to $300 million. This represents an approximate increase of 35% compared to the prior year.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and updating and tightening our guidance for EPS as noted on this slide. Total organic revenue guidance remains at a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue remaining at a range of 8% to 9%.
If you look closer, the Americas business nonresidential markets continue to perform well, and we expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential segments.
Modest growth is expected in institutional verticals and solid growth in commercial markets. Residential market indicators still suggest continued growth as new housing starts remain stable, but still remain below historical average with resilient strength in the multifamily segment.
Strength in new housing is offset by challenging conditions in big box retailers. European markets have stabilized, and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase in our organic guidance and are leveraging our broader portfolio to accelerate growth.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to make progress with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals. We are tightening our EPS guidance by raising the low end of the range. We are also updating both ends of the guidance for an estimated $0.03 impact related to the adoption of accounting standards for stock-based compensation.
With these changes, we are guiding full year adjusted EPS at $3.38 to $3.43 compared to guidance of $3.30 to $3.40. As we look to 2017, we see markets remaining steady with modest expansion globally.
North American markets are expected to continue to be solid while European markets are expected to be modest. Additionally, we see growth potential in the Asia Pacific markets that we participate in.
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our third quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew close to 7%. Organic revenue grew at 5%. Operating margin increased 30 basis points. It was the sixth straight quarter with year-over-year margin improvement.
EBITDA margin grew by 80 basis points. EPS grew year-over-year despite below the line pressure. These are strong numbers. We are reaffirming our revenue growth expectations for the year, have tightened the range for our full year EPS outlook and have adjusted our available cash flow guidance to the high end of our prior range.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

As you are aware, Q3 normally, seasonally is a weaker quarter, given some of the shutdowns in the European area. As you mentioned, it was a little bit disappointing to us. I'd say couple of factors to that specifically. One was as you're aware, with a facility closure we announced last year moving from Italy to a third-party supplier has taken a little bit longer than what we had originally anticipated. We're still getting some benefits but not getting as much as we had anticipated in the quarter and the year. It's more of a timing issue as we finish that transition at the beginning of next year. We'll fully realize the benefits there. Secondly, in conjunction with the acquisition of Trelock completed at the end of Q2, startup problems, the seasonality of the business is lower in Q3, a couple of operational hiccups. Not a big business but weighed on the margin expectations. A little bit of inflation headwinds as well, but I think, more importantly, I look at it and step back and say, ""Is the region off on the right trajectory?"" And the answer is yes. We finished the quarter with really strong backlog. It was one of those quarters that started out slow, continued to progress positively in the back half of the quarter, so we ended the quarter with strong backlog of supports and improvement in organic growth sequentially and year-over-year for Q4. And we would expect the margin dollars and margin improvement to continue in Q4 as what you've seen historically in the last several quarters. And I would just remind you historically, when we started this journey 3 years ago it's been, we had in EBIT margin of like 1% and now we're marching towards the objective of 10%.

Relative to the price inflation investment equation, we've always said that we manage the business to ensure that if you look at those components, those inputs, you try to net those out to 0, so that of the effect of incremental volume you get margin expansion. That's the financial model that we're trying to drive. You saw that in the quarter. You've seen it in the last 6 quarters, and that's the continued expectation. To the extent inflation rises faster and we're seeing that in some of the inputs particularly on steel, which is up like 40% relative to where we ended Q2. The expectation over extended period of time is we'll be able to offset that in price. We've done that historically. There's always going to be a timing gap. You can't go out in the market and do that immediately, but that would be the expectation that we could -- we'd be able to offset the inflationary pressure with price, and we can drive productivity, operational excellence and do some things leaner at our facilities."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the company's third quarter results. We continue to deliver profitable growth that reflects continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investments in the business.
Third quarter revenues came in at a $581 million, growing 6.7% over prior year and reflecting organic growth of 5% as well as the benefit of prior year acquisitions.
Americas had organic growth of 5.6%, which was driven by solid revenue growth in our nonresidential business.
Europe organic revenues grew 1.6%, and our Asia Pacific business grew at 7.3% organically. If we exclude the previously divested System integration business, revenues from prior year amounts, the Asia Pacific business achieved organic growth of 10.6%. Adjusted operating income of $126.7 million increased 8.4% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 30 basis points driven by continued price realization, volume leverage and favorable mix, which is more than offset by incremental investments, which was the headwind of 70 basis points.
Americas and Asia Pacific saw year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin with Europe being slightly down. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 increased slightly versus the prior-year period and driven primarily by improving operating performance.
As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%.
In addition, we are updating and tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.38 to $3.43 per share. This EPS guidance is inclusive of an estimated $0.03 impact from adoption of a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Please go to Slide 5. Shifting a bit from the financials, I would like to talk about the electromechanical convergence in the industry and one of our upcoming product launches. With our pioneering brand and emphasis on innovation, Allegion continues to lead our industry in electromechanical convergence and innovation. Electromechanical convergence doesn't mean we're asking customers to completely convert to electronic security products. We encouraged them to use electronic solutions to complement their mechanical. We are discussing both mechanical and electronic to enable the optimize balance in addressing the physical security needs and unique applications that are secure, cost-effective and convenient to use.
The latest addition to the Schlage lock family, the LE Series, exemplifies the electromechanical conversions in a commercial environment.
This connected motor solution will complement our Schlage NDE series for doors with cylindrical prep and Schlage control for dead bolt applications, all part of our ENGAGE connected platform strategy. The locks are able to work with the systems that end users already have in place to extend the benefit of electronic access controls to more doors deeper inside the building. Schlage control NDE and the LE Series locks can also be managed as an offline solution with the ENGAGE mobile app. This provides building owners an access control solution that is simpler and more cost effective to manage than mechanical keys alone.
Allegion will continue to embrace electromechanical convergence, balancing convenience and security through products like Schlage NDE and LE Series, Schlage control for multifamily and Schlage Sense that connect for single-family residential applications. Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2016 guidance."

Please go to Slide #6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides.
Total reported revenue growth was 6.7.% for the quarter. As indicated, we delivered 5% organic growth with contributions from all regions.
Each region also contributed to both price realization as well as volume growth. Foreign currency was a slight headwind in the quarter, while acquisitions contributed approximately $26 million of incremental revenue of 4.9% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Please go to Slide #7. Reported net revenue for the quarter was $581.1 million, which is a 6.7% increase versus the prior-year period. I was extremely pleased with the solid organic growth from Americas and Asia. In addition, the acquisitions completed in the past 12 months have contributed nicely to revenue growth particularly in the EMEIA region. Adjusted operating income of $126.7 million increased 8.4% compared to the prior year. The benefit of modest margin expansion on incremental volumes net of incremental investments helped deliver 30 basis points of improvement versus the prior year. This reflects the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth. Of note, volume increases in our Americas nonresidential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. I'll discuss this in more detail when we're reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.5%, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter.
Please go to Slide #8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2015, reported EPS was a loss of $0.28. Adjusting $1.20 for the prior year loss on divestitures, restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.92 per share. Operational results increased EPS by $0.14 as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts. The unfavorable net productivity inflation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. And although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs resulting in a slightly favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.01 in the quarter.
Next, interest and other income were a net $0.05 decrease to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. The unfavorable other net items primarily reflects the positive impact from the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities last year.
The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.05 per share decrease versus the prior year. The increase in rate is due to the favorable resolution to uncertain tax positions in 2015 partially offset by favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.93 per share, an increase of approximately $0.01 or 1.1% versus the prior year period.
Continuing on, we have a negative $0.91 per share reduction for impairments, restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures.
Third quarter 2016 results included an impairment charge of $84.4 million or $0.87 per share, primarily related to the receivable recorded as consideration for the previously divested System integration business in China.
The impairment write-off reflects our belief that the remaining receivable left on the books when the business was divested was no longer collectible.
Divesting the System integration business was an important step pruning our portfolio. However, collection of our receivable has been difficult given the deteriorating business conditions and the poor performance of the divested business. After giving effect to these items, we arrived at the third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.02.
Please go to Slide #9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.2 million, up 4.1% or an increase of 5.6% on an organic basis. The nonresidential segment delivered high single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Pricing remained solid and strength across the nonresidential product portfolio drove the solid growth. The residential business grew at low single-digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior year results.
Favorable volume growth in new construction builder channels was partially offset by weakness in the retail channel. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single-digits.
Americas adjusted operating income of $132.3 million was up 8.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage, pricing and the favorable mix attributable to the strength of nonresidential growth. Overall, price and productivity more than offset the impact from inflation and incremental investment.
We did see higher commodity prices in the third quarter and expect that additional commodity inflation pressure to continue.
And as noted in the presentation, investments were 60 basis points headwind in the quarter. We expect additional investment headwind to continue through the remainder of the year.
Please go to Slide #10. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $116.4 million, up 27.2% or up 1.6% on an organic basis.
Acquisitions delivered approximately $25 million in the incremental revenue. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $7.3 million increased 23.7% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points. The base European business showed margin expansion in the third quarter. This was offset by margin deterioration related to the recent Trelock acquisition driven by seasonality in their markets and operating performance being below expected levels. Although margins declined slightly in the quarter, we anticipate operating income and margin improvement to continue in Q4 and close the year with record performance for Allegion. Similar to the Americas region, price and productivity more than offset impacts from inflation and incremental investments for Europe. During the third quarter, we did begin to see an impact from the U.K., EU referendum vote for Brexit. We saw an unfavorable impact both on the top line revenue as well as operating income.
On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted operating margin is up 200 basis points for the EMEIA region.
Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $28.5 million, down 16.4% versus the prior-year period.
As noted on the slide, a decrease was specific to that 2015 divestiture of the system integration business located in China, which drove a $10.6 million reduction in revenues year-over-year.
Excluding the system integration business in prior year numbers, organic revenues grew approximately 10.6%. Most subregions performed well with notable strength in Australia and New Zealand.
Asia Pacific adjusted operating income was $1.8 million, which reflects an improvement of $1.1 million versus the prior-year period.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 420 basis points versus the prior-year period. The year-over-year operating income and margin improvement was driven by the impact of the system integration business divestiture in 2015.
Please go to Slide #12. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2016 was $152 million, a $53.3 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow was primarily attributable to increased earnings. Working capital as a percent of revenues in the ratio for cash conversion cycle has increased slightly in 2016. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital.
And lastly, we are raising our guidance for full year available cash flow to approximately $300 million, the high end of our previous guidance of $280 million to $300 million. This represents an approximate increase of 35% compared to the prior year.
I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2016 guidance."

We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and updating and tightening our guidance for EPS as noted on this slide. Total organic revenue guidance remains at a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue remaining at a range of 8% to 9%.
If you look closer, the Americas business nonresidential markets continue to perform well, and we expect slow and steady improvement in our core nonresidential segments.
Modest growth is expected in institutional verticals and solid growth in commercial markets. Residential market indicators still suggest continued growth as new housing starts remain stable, but still remain below historical average with resilient strength in the multifamily segment.
Strength in new housing is offset by challenging conditions in big box retailers. European markets have stabilized, and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase in our organic guidance and are leveraging our broader portfolio to accelerate growth.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to make progress with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals. We are tightening our EPS guidance by raising the low end of the range. We are also updating both ends of the guidance for an estimated $0.03 impact related to the adoption of accounting standards for stock-based compensation.
With these changes, we are guiding full year adjusted EPS at $3.38 to $3.43 compared to guidance of $3.30 to $3.40. As we look to 2017, we see markets remaining steady with modest expansion globally.
North American markets are expected to continue to be solid while European markets are expected to be modest. Additionally, we see growth potential in the Asia Pacific markets that we participate in.
Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our third quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew close to 7%. Organic revenue grew at 5%. Operating margin increased 30 basis points. It was the sixth straight quarter with year-over-year margin improvement.
EBITDA margin grew by 80 basis points. EPS grew year-over-year despite below the line pressure. These are strong numbers. We are reaffirming our revenue growth expectations for the year, have tightened the range for our full year EPS outlook and have adjusted our available cash flow guidance to the high end of our prior range.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions."

As you are aware, Q3 normally, seasonally is a weaker quarter, given some of the shutdowns in the European area. As you mentioned, it was a little bit disappointing to us. I'd say couple of factors to that specifically. One was as you're aware, with a facility closure we announced last year moving from Italy to a third-party supplier has taken a little bit longer than what we had originally anticipated. We're still getting some benefits but not getting as much as we had anticipated in the quarter and the year. It's more of a timing issue as we finish that transition at the beginning of next year. We'll fully realize the benefits there. Secondly, in conjunction with the acquisition of Trelock completed at the end of Q2, startup problems, the seasonality of the business is lower in Q3, a couple of operational hiccups. Not a big business but weighed on the margin expectations. A little bit of inflation headwinds as well, but I think, more importantly, I look at it and step back and say, ""Is the region off on the right trajectory?"" And the answer is yes. We finished the quarter with really strong backlog. It was one of those quarters that started out slow, continued to progress positively in the back half of the quarter, so we ended the quarter with strong backlog of supports and improvement in organic growth sequentially and year-over-year for Q4. And we would expect the margin dollars and margin improvement to continue in Q4 as what you've seen historically in the last several quarters. And I would just remind you historically, when we started this journey 3 years ago it's been, we had in EBIT margin of like 1% and now we're marching towards the objective of 10%.

The write-down last year was just based on the anticipated consideration that we were going to receive. And what's happened since the sale, basically, is the business has deteriorated relative to its future ongoing cash requirements. The receivables coming in lower than anticipated, again from the government municipalities. And so you kind of look at what the expectation is going forward, and we determined that the consideration isn't collectible at this moment. We'll continue to endeavor to do we can to our work with the business to collect on those moneys. But right now, don't anticipate any collections. It has no impact relative to our available cash flow projections. As indicated, we upped our ACF guidance, has no impact really going forward. It was not included in our guidance to begin with.
