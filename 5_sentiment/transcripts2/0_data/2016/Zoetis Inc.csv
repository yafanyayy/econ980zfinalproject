In today's call, I will provide perspective based on the performance for full year 2015 and our goal for 2016. Paul will discuss some of the fourth quarter highlights, the 2015 net results and our guidance for 2016 and '17. 
In 2015, we affirmed Zoetis reputation as a global leader in the animal health industry with strong financial performance, continued investment in our future growth and a commitment to creating value for our customers and shareholders. For 2015, our diverse portfolio enabled us to grow our revenues by 8% operationally. We have particular strengths coming from R&D innovations and acquired [indiscernible] for animal health -- Abbott Animal Health. In our 3 years as a public company, we have been delivering consistent operational revenue growth and expect our 2015 to show again that we are growing faster than the industry. We grew our adjusted net income by 24% operationally and grew our adjusted EBIT margin from 25% to 28% as we continue our focus on greater efficiency in our business. 
Even while we are scrutinized our efficiency, we also continue to allocate resources for future growth. We invested $1.6 billion in 2015 across the strategic acquisitions, internal research and development and capital expenditures in areas like manufacturing and supply. And finally, in 2015, we returned approximately $370 million in excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This performance reflects a disciplined implementation of our business plan and our colleagues are [indiscernible] to serving our customers. I'm pleased to say that, as a result, we met our guidance for revenue and exceeded our guidance for adjusted net income in 2015. 
On a reported basis, we have flat [ph] revenue growth due to an 800 basis point impact from foreign currency, but we still grew our reported adjusted net income by 13%, thanks to our continued focus on achieving our efficiency goals. Looking ahead to 2016, first and foremost, we are focused on delivering our financial guidance for the year. We are projecting 2% to 4% operational revenue growth, which reflects the impact of our SKU reduction and changes to our operations in Venezuela. Excluding those impacts, we expect to grow revenues 8% to 10% operationally. We have 2 percentage points coming from the regional PHARMAQ. This means our organic growth is expected to be faster than the market again. And for 2017, we expect to continue growing the flat revenue [ph] market at a rate of 5% to 9% as we are confident in our end markets, business model, the prospects for new product launches, improved product supply and progress in our efficiency goals. We are also confident in our pricing strategy. Our prices are defined by the value that we can demonstrate to our customers, who buy and pay for the products we show to them with no influence from third party peers. 
In January, we updated our adjusted EPS guidance for '16 and '17 to reflect the impact of the European Commission decision on our tax rate. Today, we are pleased to reaffirm our 2016 and 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per share despite the negative impact of foreign currency and the change in our operations in Venezuela. which will have a negative impact of $0.06 in 2016 and $0.08 in 2017. 
Our second objective for 2016 is to ensure the successful launch of new products that are critical for our long-term revenue growth. We are increasing supply for APOQUEL and also launching in new markets. This product already surpassed $100 million with limited availability in 2015 and we see significant room to grow from this level with a long-term fix sales of more than $300 million. In our important breakthrough in the area of dermatology, our canine antibody therapy against atopic dermatitis has been introduced in the U.S. to the veterinarian dermatologist, and we are preparing for broader market availability later in 2016. 
Meanwhile, SIMPARICA a new oral parasiticide will help us to better compete in the global market of flea and tick products, a market of approximately $3 billion. SIMPARICA was approved in the EU later last year and we are awaiting approval in the U.S. this quarter. We expect the launch in both the U.S. and EU in the first quarter of 2016 and see sales ramp up during the year, as our major objective is enhancing that supply and customer service, an area where we fell short last year, and we continue with our supply network strategy. We are making steady improvements, most notably in APOQUEL. We are also investing to bring capacity into product categories that will be an important part of our future revenue base. In the near term, we believe that a simplified supply chain with fewer manufacturing plants focused on a [indiscernible] set of products will improve our performance. 
We also remain on track to complete the global implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system or ERP in the first quarter. The ERP will support our overall efficiency goals and will help us better manage the processes and information to run our business. And we continue to refine these systems over the course of the year. We will make certain we are exceeding our customer expectations. 
Our fourth major objective is around capital allocation and how we maximize our cost structure, investment in R&D and business development. We are making good progress with shaping our cost structure as part of the overall efficiency planned we announced last May. That work has been accelerated and the additional cost savings we included in our guidance. It is equally important to realize that while we are implementing these plans, we have remained committed to building the same interconnected capabilities that drive our success with our customers: sales; innovative R&D and high-quality and reliable manufacturing and supply. This [indiscernible] mentioned is being well resourced even as we go through changes in other areas of the company. 
Our investment in R&D continues showing high returns and support for our future growth. I'm very pleased to say that our effort to retrace our portfolio with innovative [indiscernible] offering especially in companion animal are paying off. Last year, we launched a new combination of vaccine for dogs across the EU called Versican Plus and have been very well received by customers. In the fourth quarter, Zoetis was granted a conditional license from the USDA to market our canine influenza vaccine, the first conditional license vaccine which can control diseases associated with canine influenza, the various age 3 and 2. In this December, we received a U.S. license for VANGUARD crLyme, a vaccine that [indiscernible] in the production of conditions associated with Lyme disease in dogs. And in November, we expanded our INNOVATOR [indiscernible] vaccine franchise in the U.S. with the launch of vaccine 28 [ph]  In the prevention of leptospirosis. Meanwhile, in aquatic health, shortly after closing our deal with PHARMAQ in the fourth quarter, one of their new vaccine for salmon received an [indiscernible] licensed [indiscernible] one of the world's largest pharma efficient markets. Our focus on enhancing our portfolio resulted in recent approvals for new indications of formulations of existing products. In January, Zoetis received FDA approval for an update to the labeling for [indiscernible] which allow for intravenous administration during surgical protocols that [indiscernible] that induce vomiting. We launched a new formulation of LUTALYSE, [indiscernible] for use in daily and different cattle in the U.S. We also [indiscernible] as a partner of choice for all innovators in the  industry. In January, we entered into an agreement with Anatara Lifescience, a company in Australia. We'll be evaluating the antibiotic and infective products as an alternative antibiotic that could treat and control infections in farm animals. And finally, in terms of business development, we'll continue to look for M&A opportunities like we did last year with Abbott Animal Health and PHARMAQ while we continue with our internal investment in new products, lifecycle innovation and research alliances. 
In summary, we delivered an excellent 2015 built in our diverse and market-leading portfolio of products for animal health. We are getting significant traction in the business as we continue reducing complexity, achieving efficiencies and freeing up resources for our most promising growth opportunities. And we remain well positioned as industry leader based on our core capabilities and singular focus on animal health. 
With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?"

Let me put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's overview of 2015. What a terrific year we had. If you think back to a year ago, we had a number of very challenging initiatives in front of us, most notably the design and implementation of the efficiency initiative that we announced in May and also the rollout of our enterprisewide SAP system in our most important market, the U.S., as well as many other key locations around the world. I can tell you that both of those projects put enormous pressure on the company, on our colleagues and, in some cases, impacted our customers, but we were able to stay on task, overcome many challenges and deliver results that we are very proud of. 
So let's talk about our performance. We had very strong sales growth in the U.S., up 13% for the full year, driven by good livestock sales primarily in cattle, the addition of Abbott Animal Health and increased supplies of APOQUEL. In the international business, we delivered operational sales growth of 4%, which reflected good performance in major markets like Brazil and China, which grew 11% and 17%, respectively, partially offset by the business changes that we are making in Venezuela. We reduced our total operating expenses by 1% on an operational basis in '15 compared with '14 while growing revenue 8% operationally. We kicked off our efficiency initiative in May and we're able to capture meaningful savings in 2015, particularly in the second half of the year when we reduced our operating expenses by 3% on an operational basis while we were growing revenue 7% operationally. 
To be fair, the true test of the operating efficiency improvements that we're making will come over the long term. Any one can cut cost and improve profits in the short term. The challenge is to improve profits and then grow that larger profit pool at an attractive rate. To do that, you need to be thoughtful about where, how and how much you reduce costs. We continue to prioritize and spend activities that deliver value to our customers and that would support our growth, namely our sales forces, our R&D engine and our supply chain, so very good stuff for the full year 2015. 
Let me turn to the quarter quickly. You can read the details of our fourth quarter results in the press release and tables, but let me hit on a few highlights focusing on things that may be impactful on our future results. Starting with revenue. Again, good operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter coming against very strong quarter in 2014. Next, improvement in operating efficiency. Total operating expenses were down 8% operationally in the quarter and this enabled us to grow adjusted net income by 29% operationally. 
Foreign currency continued to be a strong headwind for us as it is for most multinationals. Changes in FX rates reduced Q4 reported revenue growth compared with the prior year quarter by some 900 basis points. This award for that is brutal. Setting aside FX, we feel very good about the underlying drivers of our operational, that is constant currency revenue growth. For the quarter, the 6% operational revenue growth included 3% increase APOQUEL sales due to better supply, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increases across the portfolio and 1% from new products. These drivers were partially offset by a 3% decline of in-line product revenues. I want to point out that is primarily related to ongoing changes in our business model in Venezuela and other countries like India, which were initiated as part of our efficiency program. 
As I've said previously, the changes we've made and are making to our business model is certain markets impacted our second half 2015 performance and will have impacts on our 2016 revenue growth, but these changes improve our prospects for longer-term revenue and profit growth. That's the price. 
In case of Venezuela, you'll recall that we are reducing our activities there due to unfavorable economic conditions from [indiscernible] multinational companies. We've been selling down our inventories in the country, limiting our exports to Venezuela. And this quarter, we decided to re-value our assets and liabilities there based on the freeloading exchange rate. In the case of India, we remain committed to our business there especially in our companion animal and poultry businesses with a direct field force. However, we are making changes in our approach to the dairy segment. That segment has not consolidated in a way that we had expected over the last several years and so we are eliminating our dairy field force there and pursuing a distributor partnership to serve those market needs. 
It's worth noting that revenue from our other emerging market geography includes Venezuela and India and declined 3% operationally in the fourth quarter. If you want to go back, you can exclude India and Venezuela, other emerging markets would've grown by 12%. The other emerging market segment will continue to be an area where we see some noise in 2016 as it includes the countries that will be most significantly impacted by the SKU reductions as well as market changes the we are undertaking as part of our efficiency program. 
While I'm on the subject of international markets, I know there continue to be general concerns with the outlook for countries like China and Brazil given lots of recent media reports about their slower GDP growth and their economic outlooks. Generally, demand for Animal Health products is tied to more stable growth drivers, namely the demand for animal proteins and the increased adoption and medicalization of pets, both of which move as a function of population, income and urbanization. Fundamentals in the Animal Health segments in both China and Brazil remained strong and here's the proof. For the full year 2015, we grew revenue in China and Brazil on an operational basis 17% and 11%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, China and Brazil grew 14% and 10%, respectively. Both markets on a constant currency basis are growing at healthy rates and the growth prospects of these markets remain solid. So I pose the question rhetorically, why is that? Well, for China it's 2 things. One is the back of the consumption of animal [indiscernible] is growing, it has continued to grow even in challenging economic times. Second is the goal of the Chinese government to see an improvement in the productivity, safety and quality of their food supply. That means moving from smaller farms producing animal proteins to a more industrialized model and that model requires more animal health products to maintain and drive the productivity of the business. Frankly, as I'm saying, the second factor should be the first. It's a powerful driver and it will last for many years. 
Now turning to Brazil, yes Brazil is a very developed livestock market and domestic consumption of animal protein is only a part of the equation. Brazil was a significant exporter of meat. And so to the extent that the consumption falls within the borders, they have the opportunity to use exports to maintain the health of their livestock businesses. With the weakness of the real, exports are even more attractive today. So counter to what you might conclude when seeing negative headlines about conditions in Brazil, the Brazilian livestock industry and the supporting animal health industry are quite strong. Using China and Brazil as examples, the key takeaway should be that we're operating in an industry that is very resilient, now I use that word quite a bit, even in times of economic stress and that applies to developed as well as emerging markets. 
Turning to restructuring charges. This quarter, we had significant one-time costs and saw a decrease in our reported GAAP net income and earnings per share. Let me explain this quarter's major charges in terms of the 3 buckets that we use. First, the stand-up costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $34 million in the quarter. That work will be substantially completed by mid-2016. We recorded $4 million of costs associated with our supply network strategy and that we are still in early days of that initiative. And we also recorded $52 million of one-time costs associated with our operational efficiency initiative, which reflected the acceleration of some of those plans and the associated costs into the fourth quarter of 2015. And finally, we have taken accounting options related to the revaluation of our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities in Venezuela this quarter. We believe it is appropriate to change samadhi rates as our exchange rate for Venezuela. And accordingly, we recorded charges of approximately $93 million in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we also announced the sale or exit the 5 manufacturing sites in the U.S., India and Taiwan, which we expect to generate proceeds in excess of $80 million of cash during 2016. 
Turning to guidance. We've provided a bridge in our tables and slides to help show the change in our guidance for 2016 and '17 to spotlight the impact of changes in FX rates and changes to our operations in Venezuela. We now expect for the full year 2016 revenue will be between $4.65 billion to $4.775 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.30 and $1.48 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.71 and $1.81 per share. For full year 2017, we expect revenue between $4.95 billion to $5.15 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.95 to $2.13 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.18 and $2.32 per share. Our revise guidance reflects the impact of the European Commission's decisions on Belgian tax rulings and related effect on our earnings which we disclosed in early January. 
Our effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is expected to be approximately 33% in 2016 and 30% in 2017. In January, we communicated that the changes to our tax rates reduced our expectations for adjusted diluted EPS guidance over 2016 and '17 by $0.13 and $0.06 per share, respectively. Note that we expect to record one-time net tax charges during 2016 of approximately $55 million of which approximately of $35 million to $45 million will be recorded in Q1. These Q1 charges related to the nullification of our Belgian tax ruling by European Commission for the periods from 2013 through '15. Included in the total $55 million charge is an estimate of a future impact of the revaluation of deferred tax accounts currently associated with our Belgian operation. You can see these $55 million of one-time costs footnoted in our guidance bridge for 2016. 
Our revise guidance today also reflects our latest views of our operations in Venezuela, updated FX rates as of the end of January and other efficiency improvements to offset some of those impacts. Here's some really good news. Other than the impact of the change to our expected tax rate due to the EC ruling, a factor over which we have no control, we're holding our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for both 2016 and '17. We expect the momentum that we carried through Q4, combined with the expected pace and magnitude of the efficiency initiative, should enable us to offset the unrelenting headwinds of FX rates and the change to our business model in Venezuela. We're proud of that. 
And since I have the floor and I'd like to talk about our company, here's my summary of the year. Looking back at 2015, what you see is another year where the global animal health industry posted solid mid-single-digit growth despite many challenges in many economies around the world. You saw our company, Zoetis, deliver strong operational growth of revenue, up 8% by pulling on all the levers that we have available to us: the best animal health salesforce is on the planet, the most productive R&D team in the industry, value-generative M&A and supply chain as a core strength of the company. And we delivered operational growth of adjusted earnings per share of 24% for the year. Now I'm going to repeat that because it's awesome. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 increased 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.77 per share. I call out the $1.77 because while we always measure ourselves on a constant currency basis, at the end of the day, we put an actual dollar amount on the table. Way back in November of 2014, we put 2015 guidance on the table. We guided the revenue in the range of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 to $1.68. Since that time, we, like many multinational companies, have been battered by FX that dramatically reduced our reported revenue. But here's where we're different from many of those other multinationals. Throughout 2015, we held the line on our guidance for adjusted earnings per share. In the November of 2015, we actually raised the range to $1.70 to $1.74, and now we report actual results of $1.77 per share. We are able to do that because we, as a management team, brought forward a plan in May last year to improve the efficiency of our cost structure. And then the we, as a team, got after it and reduced and control the expenses to give us the best shot of delivering to you, our shareholders, the best earnings we could under the circumstances. So I have to say, it's pretty good. 
So here's my pitch. The global animal health industry is not just resilient. It has characteristics that point to an extended period of predictable mid-single-digit growth, and the #1 company in the global animal health industry is Zoetis. In the 3 years since we've been public, we put results on the board that support what we see as our key value drivers. First, we can grow our revenues at a rate equal to or fast the double-digit growth rate we expect to for our industry. Second, we can leverage our expense structure to drive increasing operating margins, delivering profit growth faster than revenue growth. And third, we can intelligently allocate our capital, actively manage our capital structure to grow adjusted earnings per share faster than operating profits. 
In today's dystopian financial markets, where investments are maybe looking for shelter from the storm, I think my suggestion would be to look at companies in reverse alphabetic order and [indiscernible] z for Zoetis. That's it for my prepared remarks. I'd like to get to Q&A. Keith?"

From the 2% to 4%, the operational efficiency initiative, the effect on SKUs and now Venezuela and other markets where we're going to change our model, reduce that by some 600 basis points. You could see that if you look at that Slide 18, 600 basis points. So there's 8 to 10 if you're thinking about what our actual expectations are for normalized operational revenue growth in '16 [indiscernible] '15 and if you want to take PHARMAQ at of the equation to go what's the organic cushion of that, it's about 200 basis points. So as you look at that slide, again, I'll call everyone's attention to it, we tried our level best to help you think about the strength of 2016 because this is quite a strong year by showing you this waterfall slide. So 2 to 4, 600 basis points int eh efficiency initiative SKU reduction Venezuela in India et cetera gets you to 8 to 10. And if you want to look at that on an organic basis, it will be 6 to 8 by taking PHARMAQ out of the mix. I do before I can see the point I want to say, 2 things before I talk about 2017 about 2015 -- I'm sorry, about 2016, because we did change from 3% to 5% operational growth to 2% to 4%. That is predominantly because we had previously articulated that range at the midpoint of our 2015 guidance for revenue. And as you saw, we had strong revenue in Q4, and for 2015, it was about $25 million higher than that, and that accounts for the change from 3% to 5% down to 2% to 4%. We feel really good about what we put on the table in 2015. And as we think about it, we really are excited about 2016 even though it will be masked a little bit by the changes that we're making to our model. Now last before I can see the fourth quarter has a question what do we expect? In 2017, we expect a return to the same kind of solid growth that you would expect -- you would have expected in 2016 but for the change in efficiency initiative. We were currently forecasting on an operational basis 5% to 9%. That's pretty solid and that's being driven mainly by new products."

FX is hard to forecast when it flows through cost in sales, but it sure does. The second thing, I think you asked a question about sha reprice. Yes, we're watching our company, along with many others, move value at least in the eyes of shareholders and people who are holding our stock. We continue to do what we can do. We are driving real fundamental value. We post a question about our share buybacks and the scale of that et cetera. To point out that in the [indiscernible] last window like that's what we've seen in the early part of November stock was $43, $44 I think, [indiscernible] $43, $44, and we elected at that point in time to increase the pace of our purchases.

I know that's not a ton but, as I said also many times, made a lot of calls on tax [ph] in 2016. But even so we elected to increase the pace at which we were wanting to acquire shares.

So set that aside, we are very disappointed, and obviously, it's not something that we are planning on. And let's pretend that didn't happen for a second. We have previously articulated that we thought our tax rate in, call it, '17 would have been on the order of 28%. Our adjusted ETR roughly 28% and now it's 30%. So we lost a couple of hundred basis points there in 2017. What I would suggest to you is, just as we had articulated with respect to a structure before this happened, we can provide that now but we would be grinding it down. First thing for us is we were doing pretty well fine-tuning our global operating model to be efficient. And we have to go back and we have to change courses a little bit, not something that -- it's not a happy day for us but we are responding the best way that we can.

And in the rest of the market, it depends. In high inflationary markets, we increased significantly the prices to compensate there for inflation, and in some cases, to compensate for foreign exchange. In some markets, where the economies are -- the inflation is very stable or probably not having any inflation at all, so we are also trying to adjust our adjustment base on this situation. So in Europe or Japan or some other markets that we have been increasing prices but at a lower rate than in the U.S. or some of the markets where we had the opportunity to increase the prices because of inflation. The second question was related to the consolidation of the industry. And the total 4 or 5 now animal health care companies represent almost 70% of the total market, which has already been increasing significantly from some years ago. Do I see opportunities for further translation? I think there are still opportunities especially on the second tier of the company. After these 4 or 5 companies, we see opportunities for the consolidation. We expect now the merger of Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health being completed. It's another round of consolidation and maybe in the future also we'll see some additional consolidation. Definitely, the consolidation will be limited because of antitrust issues. But without these antitrust issues or managing these antitrust issues, definitely, consolidation can represent a good opportunity for the animal health industry. The last comment I want to add is that the top 10 companies in the animal health represent something like 80% of the total market. On the 20% which is remaining, we have maybe 100 companies that are [indiscernible]. I expect this will be a significant consolidation here. And Paul will add some comments in terms of the pricing."

I think when you're looking at trying to hedge operations around the world against foreign currency, I'd say you have 2 choices. You can either a technical term, let it slide, which is what we do, with respect to the operations like many other -- many, many other multinational companies do what you can attempt to hedge if you hedge. You hedge within the quarter and the analysis that we have done is suggested that you're essentially chasing down your limit but the cost of the hedges, ultimately, make it less than fruitful exercise. Others will tell you that they're -- they can do it. That's okay. That would be their point of view. I'd point out that a couple of the currencies that tend to be the most volatile, they are not markets for us. They go out and hedge. I think they're not deep enough. They're not efficient enough. And so you wouldn't be able to fully offset that. I think I love [indiscernible] pace [indiscernible] I might have mispronounce of that.

Those are sort of -- I call them not normal and they will go away and most of them will go away towards the latter part of 2016. But in 2016, it's a fairly significant call on our cash. So primarily, we've continued to be in the face of investing in our supply chain. We continue to invest capital there. So our CapEx is tracking at a rate that exceeds our ongoing depreciation rate. So net-net, we continue to invest there. Of course, we called out that we have a program that anybody can do the math. At least the current expectation is we're purchasing shares at a rate of $75 million a quarter. It's $300 million this year plus our dividend, you can do that math, and those are, other than our earnings, the things that you need to take into consideration when we think about our cash flow. I do not want to stop without speaking about efficiency of working capital. Yes, that is something that is to come. It's not something that you would see necessarily in '15 and not in an enormous way in 2016. By the end of this quarter, we expect to have our ERP system up and running in all of our locations around the world, which is going to give us the ability to then implement tools to much better manage primarily our investment in our inventories. Our receivables kind of -- I think we do a pretty good job there and we certainly do the same things as everyone else with respect to payables, but yes, we will not start to see some maybe significant cash flow from the improvement in adjusted working capital really until 2017. I wasn't specific there, David. I wasn't specific for reasons we don't want to provide guidance -- specific guidance with respect to free cash flow, but I believe we provided each of the components that we enabled you to look out '16, '17 and then beyond. I think when you get out into the latter part of this decade kind of our depreciation should start to normalize at a level close to our depreciation. I'll stop there."

In terms of the comments that you made in the France, definitely, in 2015, we saw an impact because of the change of the legislation in France. This was affecting antibiotics. We expect also that antibiotics will continue having discussions and restrictions in some of the markets. This has been be incorporated in our guidance for '16 and '17 and we also think that the progression of that external sources are making about the total animal health industry and also the growth in antibiotics are consistent with what we had our projections. So the industry will be growing about 5%. Antibiotics is expected to grow half of this rate. The advantage for us we, I think that we would have in our portfolio, antibiotics which are injectable, which are considered as premium antibiotics that are kept by the veterinarians as a resource to ensure that they are treating, in some cases, protecting also animals against infection. So we are confident that the impact that we have in antibiotics will be lower in our revenues, but in any case, all this revenue have been incorporated in our projections."

In today's call, I will provide perspective based on the performance for full year 2015 and our goal for 2016. Paul will discuss some of the fourth quarter highlights, the 2015 net results and our guidance for 2016 and '17. 
In 2015, we affirmed Zoetis reputation as a global leader in the animal health industry with a strong financial performance, continued investment in our future growth and a commitment to creating value for our customers and shareholders. For 2015, our diverse portfolio enabled us to grow our revenues by 8% operationally. We had particular strengths coming from R&D innovations and acquired pros from animal health -- Abbott Animal Health. In our 3 years, as a public company, we have been delivering consistent operational revenue growth and expect our 2015 to show again, that we are growing faster than the industry. We grew our adjusted net income by 24% operationally and grew our adjusted EBIT margin from 25% to 28% as we continue our focus on greater efficiency in our business. 
Even while we have scrutinized our efficiency, we also continue to allocate resources for future growth. We invested $1.6 billion in 2015 across the strategic acquisitions, internal research and development and capital expenditures in areas like manufacturing and supply. And finally, in 2015, we returned approximately $370 million in excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This performance reflects a disciplined implementation of our business plan and our colleagues' tremendous dedication to serving our customers. I'm pleased to say that, as a result, we met our guidance for revenue and exceeded our guidance for adjusted net income in 2015. 
On a reported basis, we had flat revenue growth due to an 800 basis point impact from foreign currency, but we still grew our reported adjusted net income by 13%, thanks to our continued focus on achieving our efficiency goals. Looking ahead to 2016, first and foremost, we are focused on delivering our financial guidance for the year. We are projecting 2% to 4% operational revenue growth, which reflects the impact of our SKU reduction and changes to our operations in Venezuela. Excluding those impacts, we expect to grow revenues 8% to 10% operationally. We have 2 percentage points coming from the regional PHARMAQ. This means our organic growth is expected to be faster than the market again. And for 2017, we expect to continue growing faster than the market at a rate of 5% to 9% as we are confident in our end markets, business model, the prospects for new product launches, improved product supply and progress in our efficiency goals. We are also confident in our pricing strategy. Our prices are defined by the value that we can demonstrate to our customers, who buy and pay for the products we show to them, with no influence from third-party peers. 
In January, we updated our adjusted EPS guidance for '16 and '17 to reflect the impact of the European Commission decision on our tax rate. Today, we are pleased to reaffirm our 2016 and 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per share despite the negative impact of foreign currency and the change in our operations in Venezuela, which will have a negative impact of $0.06 in 2016 and $0.08 in 2017. 
Our second objective for 2016 is to ensure the successful launch of new products that are critical for our long-term revenue growth. We are increasing supply for APOQUEL and also launching in new markets. This product already surpassed $100 million with limited availability in 2015 and we see significant room to grow from this level, with a long-term big sales of more than $300 million. Another important breakthrough in the area of dermatology, our canine antibody therapy against atopic dermatitis has been introduced in the U.S. to veterinarian dermatologists, and we are preparing for broader market availability later in 2016. 
Meanwhile, SIMPARICA, a new oral parasiticide will help us to better compete in the global market of flea and tick products, a market of approximately $3 billion. SIMPARICA was approved in the EU later last year, and we are awaiting approval in the U.S. this quarter. We expect the launch in both the U.S. and EU in the first quarter of 2016 and see sales ramp up during the year. Our third major objective this year is enhancing the supply and customer service, an area where we fell short last year. As we continue with our supply network strategy, we are making steady improvements, most notably in APOQUEL. We are also investing to bring capacity in product categories that will be an important part of our future revenue base. In the near term, we believe that a simplified supply chain with fewer manufacturing plants, focus on assembling a set of products will improve our performance. 
We also remain on track to complete the global implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system or ERP in the first quarter. The ERP will support our overall efficiency goals and will help us better manage the processes and information to run our business, and we continue to refine these systems over the course of the year. We will make certain, we are exceeding our customer expectations. 
Our fourth major objective is around capital allocation and how we maximize our cost structure, investment in R&D and business development. We are making good progress with shaping our cost structure as part of the overall efficiency plan we announced last May. That work has been accelerated and the additional cost savings has been included in our guidance. It is equally important to realize that while we are implementing these plans, we have remained committed to building the 3 interconnected capabilities that drive our success with our customers: unit sales; innovative R&D; and high quality and reliable manufacturing and supply. This mission is been well resourced even as we go through changes in other areas of the company. 
Our investment in R&D continues showing high returns and support for our future growth. I'm very pleased to say that our effort to refresh our portfolio with innovative vaccines offering, especially in companion animals are paying off. Last year, we launched a new combination vaccine for dogs across the EU called Versican Plus and have been very well received by customers. In the fourth quarter, Zoetis was granted a conditional license from the USDA to market our canine influenza vaccine, the first conditional license vaccine who have control diseases associated with canine influenza, the virus at -- it's at age 3 and 2. In December, we received a U.S. license for VANGUARD crLyme, a vaccine that aids in the prevention of conditions associated with Lyme disease in dogs. And in November, we expanded our INNOVATOR horse vaccine franchise in the U.S. with the launch of a vaccine to aid in the prevention of leptospirosis. Meanwhile, in aquatic health, shortly after closing our deal with PHARMAQ in the fourth quarter, one of their new vaccine for salmon received an emergency license in Chile, one of the world's largest farmed fish markets. Our focus on enhancing our portfolio resulted in recent approvals for new indications of formulations of existing products. In January, Zoetis received FDA approval for an update to the labeling for CERENIA, which allow for intravenous administration during surgical protocols that use medication that induces vomiting. We launched a new formulation of LUTALYSE, a reproductive product for use in daily and beef cattle in the U.S. We are also viewed as a partner of choice for all of innovators in the industry. In January, we entered into an agreement with Anatara Lifescience, a company in Australia. We'll be evaluating their nonantibiotic anti-infective products as an alternative to antibiotic that could treat and control infections in farm animals. And finally, in terms of business development, we'll continue to look for M&A opportunities like we did last year with Abbott Animal Health and PHARMAQ, while we continue with our internal investment in new products, life cycle innovation and research alliances. 
In summary, we delivered an excellent 2015 built in our diverse and market-leading portfolio of products for animal health. We are getting significant traction in the business as we continue reducing the complexity, achieving efficiencies and freeing up resources for our most promising growth opportunities. And we remain well positioned as the industry leader based on our core capabilities and singular focus on animal health. 
With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?"

Let me put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's overview of 2015. What a terrific year we had. If you think back to a year ago, we had a number of very challenging initiatives in front of us, most notably the design and implementation of the efficiency initiative that we announced in May and also the rollout of our enterprise-wide SAP system in our most important market, the U.S. as well as many other key locations around the world. I can tell you that both of those projects put enormous pressure on the company, on our colleagues and in some cases, impacted our customers, but we were able to stay on task, overcome many challenges and deliver results that we're very proud of. 
So let's talk about our performance. We had very strong sales growth in the U.S., up 13% for the full year, driven by good livestock sales primarily in cattle, the addition of Abbott Animal Health and increased supplies of APOQUEL. In the international business, we delivered operational sales up 4%, which reflected good performance in major markets like Brazil and China, which grew 11% and 17%, respectively, partially offset by the business changes that we are making in Venezuela. We reduced our total operating expenses by 1% on an operational basis in '15 compared with '14 while growing revenue 8% operationally. We kicked off our efficiency initiative in May, and were able to capture meaningful savings in 2015, particularly in the second half of the year when we reduced our operating expenses by 3% on an operational basis, while we were growing revenue 7% operationally. 
To be fair, the true test of the operating efficiency improvements that we're making will come over the long term. Anyone can cut costs and improve profits in the short term. The challenge is to improve profits and then grow that larger profit pool at an attractive rate. To do that, you need to be thoughtful about where, how and how much you reduce costs. We continue to prioritize and spend behind activities that deliver value to our customers and that would support our growth, namely our sales forces, our R&D engine and our supply chain, so very good stuff for the full year 2015. 
Let me turn to the quarter quickly. You can read the details of our fourth quarter results in the press release and tables, but let me hit on a few highlights focusing on things that may be impactful on our future results. Starting with revenue. Again, good operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, coming against a very strong quarter in 2014. Next, improvement in operating efficiency. Total operating expenses were down 8% operationally in the quarter and this enabled us to grow adjusted net income by 29% operationally. 
Foreign currency continued to be a strong headwind for us as it is for most multinationals. Changes in FX rates reduced Q4 reported revenue growth compared with the prior year quarter by some 900 basis points. This -- a word for that it's brutal. Setting aside FX, we feel very good about the underlying drivers of our operational that is constant currency revenue growth. For the quarter, the 6% operational revenue growth included 3% from increased APOQUEL sales due to better supply, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increases across the portfolio and 1% from new products. These drivers were partially offset by a 3% decline of in-line product revenues. I want to point out that's primarily related to ongoing changes to our business model in Venezuela and other countries like India, which were initiated as part of our efficiency program. 
As I've said previously, the changes we've made and are making to our business model in certain markets impacted our second half 2015 performance and will have impacts on our 2016 revenue growth, but these changes improve our prospects for longer-term revenue and profit growth. That's the price. 
In case of Venezuela, you'll recall that we are reducing our activities there due to unfavorable economic conditions for not multinational companies. We've been selling down our inventories in the country, limiting our future exports to Venezuela. And this quarter, we decided to re-value our assets and liabilities there based on the free-floating Simadi exchange rate. In the case of India, we remain committed to our business there, especially in our companion animal and poultry businesses with a direct field force. However, we are making changes in our approach to the dairy segment. That segment has not consolidated in a way that we had expected over the last several years, and so we are eliminating our dairy field force there and pursuing a distributor partnership to serve those market needs. 
It's worth noting that revenue from our other emerging market geography includes Venezuela and India and declined 3% operationally in the fourth quarter. If you want to go back, you can exclude India and Venezuela, other emerging markets would've grown by 12%. The other emerging market segment will continue to be an area where we see some noise in 2016 as it includes the countries that will be most significantly impacted by the SKU reductions as well as market changes that we are undertaking as part of our efficiency program. 
While I'm on the subject of international markets, I know there continue to be general concerns with the outlook for countries like China and Brazil given lots of recent media reports about their slower GDP growth and their economic outlooks. Generally, demand for Animal Health products is tied to more stable growth drivers, namely the demand for animal proteins and the increased adoption and medicalization of pets, both of which move as a function of population, income and urbanization. Fundamentals in the Animal Health segments of both China and Brazil remained strong and here's the proof. For the full year 2015, we grew revenue in China and Brazil on an operational basis 17% and 11%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, China and Brazil grew 14% and 10%, respectively. Both markets on a constant currency basis are growing at healthy rates and the growth prospects of these markets remain solid. And so I pose the question rhetorically, why is that? Well, for China it's 2 things. One is the back of the consumption of animal protein in China is growing. It has continued to grow even in challenging economic times. Second is the goal of the Chinese government to see an improvement in the productivity, safety and quality of their food supply. That means moving from smaller farms producing animal proteins to a more industrialized model, and that model requires more animal health products to maintain and drive the productivity of the business. Frankly, as I'm saying, as the second factor should be the first. It's a powerful driver and it will last for many years. 
Now turning to Brazil, yes Brazil is a very developed livestock market and domestic consumption of the animal protein is only a part of the equation. Brazil was a significant exporter of meat. And so to the extent that the consumption falls within their borders, they have the opportunity to use exports to maintain the health of their livestock businesses. With the weakness of the real, exports are even more attractive today. So counter to what you might conclude when seeing negative headlines about conditions in Brazil, the Brazilian livestock industry and the supporting animal health industry are quite strong. Using China and Brazil as examples, the key takeaway should be that we operate in an industry that's very resilient, now I use that word quite a bit. Even in times of economic stress and that applies to developed as well as emerging markets. 
Turning to restructuring charges. This quarter, we had significant onetime costs that drove the decrease in our reported GAAP net income and earnings per share. Let me explain this quarter's major charges in terms of the 3 buckets that we use. First, the stand-up costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $34 million in the quarter. That work will be substantially completed by mid-2016. We recorded $4 million of costs associated with our supply network strategy, and we are still in the early days of that initiative. And we also recorded $52 million of onetime costs associated with our operational efficiency initiative, which reflected the acceleration of some of those plans and the associated costs into the fourth quarter of 2015. And finally, we have taken accounting options related to the revaluation of our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities in Venezuela this quarter. We believe it's appropriate to changing the Simadi rate as our exchange rate for Venezuela. And accordingly, we recorded charges of approximately $93 million in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we also announced the sale or exit of 5 manufacturing sites in the U.S., India and Taiwan, which we expect to generate proceeds in excess of $80 million of cash during 2016. 
Turning to guidance. We've provided a bridge in our tables and slides to help show the changes in our guidance for 2016 and '17 to spotlight the impact of changes in FX rates and changes to our operations in Venezuela. We now expect for the full year 2016 revenue will be between $4.65 billion to $4.775 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.30 and $1.48 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.71 and $1.81 per share. For full year 2017, we expect revenue between $4.95 billion to $5.15 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.95 to $2.13 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.18 and $2.32 per share. Our revised guidance reflects the impact of the European Commission's decisions on Belgium's tax rulings and the related effect on our earnings which we disclosed in early January. 
Our effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is expected to be approximately 33% in 2016 and 30% in 2017. In January, we communicated that the changes to our tax rates reduced our expectations for adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 and '17 by $0.13 and $0.06 per share, respectively. Note that we expect to record onetime net tax charges during 2016 of approximately $55 million of which approximately $35 million to $45 million will be recorded in Q1. These Q1 charges relate to the nullification of our Belgium tax ruling by European Commission for the periods from 2013 through '15. Included in the total $55 million charge is an estimate of the future impact of the revaluation of deferred tax accounts currently associated with our Belgian operation. You can see these $55 million of onetime costs footnoted in our guidance bridge for 2016. 
Our revised guidance, today also reflects our latest views of our operations in Venezuela, updated FX rates as of the end of January and other efficiency improvements to offset some of those impacts. Here's some really good news. Other than the impact of the change to our expected tax rate due to the EC ruling, a factor over which we have no control, we're holding our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for both 2016 and '17. We expect the momentum that we carried through Q4, combined with the expected pace and magnitude of the efficiency initiative, should enable us to offset the unrelenting headwinds of FX rates and the change to our business model in Venezuela. We're proud of that. 
And since I have the floor, and I like to talk about our company, here's my summary of the year. Looking back at 2015, what you see is another year where the global animal health industry posted solid mid-single-digit growth despite many challenges in many economies around the world. And you saw our company, Zoetis, deliver strong operational growth of revenue, up 8% by pulling all the levers that we have available to us: the best animal health sales force is on the planet; the most productive R&D team in the industry; value-generative M&A; and the supply chain is core strength of the company. And we delivered operational growth of adjusted earnings per share of 24% for the year. Now I'm going to repeat that because it's awesome. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 increased 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.77 per share. I call out the $1.77 because while we always measure ourselves on a constant currency basis, at the end of the day, we put an actual dollar amount on the tape. Way back in November of 2014, we put 2015 guidance on the table. We guided the revenue in the range of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 to $1.68. Since that time, we, like many multinational companies, have been battered by FX that dramatically reduced our reported revenue. But here's where we're different from many of those other multinationals. Throughout 2015, we held the line on our guidance for adjusted earnings per share. In the November of 2015, we actually raised the range to $1.70 to $1.74, and now we report actual results of $1.77 per share. We're able to do that because we, as a management team, brought forward a plan in May of last year to improve the efficiency of our cost structure. And then we, as a team, got after it and reduced and controlled the expenses to give us the best shot of delivering to you, our shareholders, the best earnings we could under the circumstances. So I love to say, it's pretty good. 
So here's my pitch. The global animal health industry is not just resilient. It has characteristics that point to an extended period of predictable mid-single-digit growth, and the #1 company in the global animal health industry is Zoetis. In the 3 years since we've been public, we put results on the board that support what we see as our key value drivers. First, we can grow our revenues at a rate equal to or faster than the mid-single-digit growth that you expected for our industry. Second, we can leverage our expense structure to drive increasing operating margins, delivering profit growth faster than revenue growth. And third, we can intelligently allocate our capital, actively manage our capital structure to grow adjusted earnings per share faster than operating profits. 
In today's dystopian financial markets, where investors may be looking for shelter from the storm, I think my suggestion would be to look at companies in reverse alphabetic order and start with z for Zoetis. That's it for my prepared remarks. I'd like to get to Q&A. Keith?"

Then the offset to that was about a 3% decline of what I guess, we'll call revenues of all other products, and again that is primarily related to changes in our business model in Venezuela, and countries like India and places that were affected by our efficiency initiative. I hope that answers the question."

What's up with that? So let'",446,"Sure. Louise, it's Paul. Let me take that, and thank you for asking the question, Louise, because if you just take the headline and say, gee we're looking at 2% to 4% operational growth in revenue next year, people say, where? What's up with that? So let's start with -- from the 2% to 4%, the operational efficiency initiative, the effect on SKUs and now, Venezuela and other markets where we're going to change our model, reduce that by some 600 basis points. You could see that if you look at that Slide 18, 600 basis points. So there's 8 to 10 if you're thinking about what our actual expectations are for normalized operational revenue growth in '16 v the '15 and if you want to take PHARMAQ out of the equation to go what's the organic portion of that, it's about 200 basis points. So as you look at that slide, again, I'll call everyone's attention to it. We tried our level best to help you think about the strength of 2016 because this is quite a strong year by showing you this waterfall slide. So 2 to 4, 600 basis points in the efficiency initiative, SKU reduction Venezuela, India et cetera gets you to 8 to 10. And if you want to look at that on an organic basis, it will be 6 to 8 by taking PHARMAQ out of the mix. I do -- before I can see the point I want to say, 2 things before I talk about 2017 -- about 2015 -- I'm sorry, about 2016, because we did change from 3% to 5% operational growth to 2% to 4%. That is predominantly because we had previously articulated that range at the midpoint of our 2015 guidance for revenue. And as you saw, we had strong revenue in Q4, and for 2015, it was about $25 million higher than that, and that accounts for the change from 3% to 5% down to 2% to 4%. We feel really good about what we put on the table in 2015. And as we think about it, we really are excited about 2016 even though it will be masked a little bit by the changes that we are making to our model. Now last before I can cede the floor. You asked the question about what could we expect? In 2017, we expect to return to the same kind of solid growth that you would expect -- you would have expected in '16 but for the change in the efficiency initiative. We were currently forecasting on an operational basis 5% to 9%. That's pretty solid and that's being driven mainly by new products."

Things happen in a 90-day period that smooths itself out over the year. I would look at the 65-odd percent margin that we put on the board for the full year and that's indicative of the strength. But the one thing in the fourth quarter was FX. FX is hard to forecast when it flows through cost of sales, but it sure does. The second thing, I think you asked a question about the share price. Yes, we're watching our company, along with many others. We value at least in the eyes of shareholders, the people who are holding our stock. We continue to do what we can do. We're driving real fundamental value. You post the question about our share buyback and the scale of add et cetera, point out that in the -- we're last in a window, like that's what we've seen in the early part of November, stock was $43, $44 I think, I'm going from memory here $43, $44, and we elected at that point in time to increase the pace of our purchases. As everybody can do the math, we bought about $50 million a quarter through 2015. We're currently buying stock back at a pace of about $75 million a quarter. I know that's not a ton, but as I said also many times, we have a lot of calls on cash in 2016. But even so we elected to increase the pace at which we were wanting to acquire shares.

Now they've used it to attract employment and investment into their country, and yes, it's a shame. So set that aside, we're very disappointed, and obviously, it was not something that we are planning on. And let's pretend that, that didn't happen for a second. We had previously articulated we thought our tax rate in, call it, '17 would have been on the order of 28%. Our adjusted ETR roughly 28% and now it's 30%. So we lost a couple of hundred basis points there in 2017. What I would suggest you is, just as we had articulated with respect to our structure before this happened, we can grind that down, but we won't be grinding it down. First anything for us is, we were doing pretty well fine-tuning our global operating model to be efficient. And we have to go back and we have to change courses a little bit. And so not something that -- it's not a happy day for us, but we're responding the best way that we can. And I think the way we look at it is, we just have 200 basis points higher ETR in '17 and now our job is to grind that down."

The 6% impact in our revenues is net result of reduction and also the assumption that some of this reduction of SKUs will be moved to other SKUs in our portfolio. In terms of reaction from customers, I think, in some cases, they would like to have these products in their portfolio, but they also understand that more important than offering 13,000 SKUs, it's ensuring that we have a reliable supply. What they want is to make sure that when they place an order, they get the order on time to treat or protect the animals. And this is one of the important strategic rationale for our SKU rationalization.

And that would be relative to the prior year. It will be a significant factor that we'll have to keep our eye on. The second part is, with respect to our cost -- our efficiency initiative, we continued to ramp up the amount of savings that we're seeing flow through, and of course, in the first half of last year, we had a modest amount of cost containment or -- that occurred in the first half, but that steps up and we currently are tracking, as you saw, with an 8% operational reduction in operating expenses in Q4, tracking at a much lower rate. So that will be a very helpful drive on the operating expense side in the first half of the year. And then that benefit, if you will, compare that to the prior year will moderate over the second half of the year. And, I think, yes, that's about all we want to cover on phasing.

As you are now -- congratulations 3 years as an independent company and it's been very exciting to see how Zoetis has evolved and achieved such tremendous success in a short period of time, congratulations. But maybe to just sort of step back and tell us, when I look at the industry, the animal health industry, it doesn't seem there's a whole lot of change. It still remains highly fragmented. We've seen a little bit of movement with Novartis sloppiness business to literally you've made a couple of small acquisitions. But by and large, the industry hasn't changed much. Do you see more consolidation going forward? Or do you see some of your peers spinning out their animal health businesses like you have done for yourself?

So in terms of the 2%, so the 2% it's -- as you mentioned, it's a global increase. And in terms of where we see we this 2% in the different geographies, definitely, we have been very consistent in the U.S. with price increases of around 3%. And in the rest of the market, it depends. So in high inflationary markets, we increased significantly the prices to compensate there for inflation, and in some cases, to compensate for foreign exchange. In some markets, where the economies are -- the inflation is very stable or probably not having any inflation at all, so we are also trying to adjust our prices based on this situation. So in Europe or Japan or some other markets, we have been increasing prices, but at a lower rate than in the U.S. or some of the markets where we had the opportunity to increase the prices because of inflation. The second question was related to the consolidation of the industry. And the total 4 or 5 now animal health companies represent almost 70% of the total market, which is already been increase significantly from some years ago. Do I see opportunities for further consolidation? I think there are still opportunities especially on the second tier of companies. After these 4 or 5 companies, we see opportunities for the consolidation. We expect now the merger of Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health being completed. There is another round of consolidation. And maybe in the future also we'll see some additional consolidation. Definitely, the consolidation will be limited because of antitrust issues. But without these antitrust issues or managing these antitrust issues, definitely, consolidation can represent a good opportunity for the animal health industry. The last comment I want to add is that, the top 10 companies in the animal health represent something like 80% of the total market. On the 20%, which is remaining, we have maybe 100 of companies that and where I expect that this will be a significant consolidation here. And Paul will add some comments in terms of the pricing."

It's not only diversity in terms of therapeutic carrier or in terms of different types of our products, but also within the MFAs, we have a lot of diversity and for products that will be -- maybe facing some challenge because changes on the approach of the use of antibiotics. And I mentioned in the medical important antibiotics in MFAs with indication of growth promotion. This will be admitted, but in our portfolio, we also have a nonmedical important antibiotics. In MFAs, that can be a good replacement for dogs that will be eliminated. We have in total in MFAs, $500 million in sales, and we grew operationally in 2015 by 8%.

But yes, we will not start to see some maybe significant cash flow from the improvement in adjusted working capital really until 2017. I wasn't specific there, David. I wasn't specific for a reason, we don't want to provide guidance -- specific guidance with respect to free cash flow, but I believe we provided each of the components that we will enable you to look out '16, '17 and then beyond. I think when you get out into the latter part of this decade kind of our depreciation should start to normalize at a level close to our depreciation. I'll stop there."

What we saw during the due diligence when we acquire in terms of the pipeline, it's confirming now with the launch of the product in Chile that it was under this emergency license and we will continue progressing in the plans that we have for PHARMAQ. So we are very excited about the opportunities of PHARMAQ. We are working also in terms of integrating the 2 companies, but ensuring that PHARMAQ remain a leader in the public health with enough identity to maximize the relationship with the customers that they have already built through many years. In terms of the comments that you made in France, definitely, in 2015, we saw an impact because of the change of the legislation in France. This was affecting antibiotics. We expect also that antibiotics, we will continue having discussions and restrictions in some of the markets. This has been incorporated in our guidance for '16 and '17. And we also think that the projections that external sources are making about the total animal health industry and also the growth in antibiotics are consistent with what -- with our projection. So the industry will be growing about 5%. Antibiotics is expected to grow at half of this rate. The advantage for us, which is that we have in our portfolio, antibiotics, which are injectables, which are considered as premium antibiotics that are kept by the veterinarians as a resource to ensure that they are treating and in some cases, protecting also animals against the infection. So we are confident that the impact that we will have in antibiotics will be lower in our revenues, but in any case, all this revenue has been incorporated in our projections."

In today's call, I will provide perspective based on the performance for full year 2015 and our goal for 2016. Paul will discuss some of the fourth quarter highlights, the 2015 net results and our guidance for 2016 and '17. 
In 2015, we affirmed Zoetis reputation as a global leader in the animal health industry with a strong financial performance, continued investment in our future growth and a commitment to creating value for our customers and shareholders. For 2015, our diverse portfolio enabled us to grow our revenues by 8% operationally. We had particular strengths coming from R&D innovations and acquired products from animal health -- Abbott Animal Health. In our 3 years as a public company, we have been delivering consistent operational revenue growth and expect our 2015 to show again, that we are growing faster than the industry. We grew our adjusted net income by 24% operationally and grew our adjusted EBIT margin from 25% to 28% as we continue our focus on greater efficiency in our business. 
Even while we have scrutinized our efficiency, we also continue to allocate resources for future growth. We invested $1.6 billion in 2015 across the strategic acquisitions, internal research and development and capital expenditures in areas like manufacturing and supply. And finally, in 2015, we returned approximately $370 million in excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This performance reflects a disciplined implementation of our business plan and our colleagues' tremendous dedication to serving our customers. I'm pleased to say that, as a result, we met our guidance for revenue and exceeded our guidance for adjusted net income in 2015. 
On a reported basis, we had flat revenue growth due to an 800 basis point impact from foreign currency, but we still grew our reported adjusted net income by 13% thanks to our continued focus on achieving our efficiency goals. Looking ahead to 2016, first and foremost, we are focused on delivering our financial guidance for the year. We are projecting 2% to 4% operational revenue growth, which reflects the impact of our SKU reduction and changes to our operations in Venezuela. Excluding those impacts, we expect to grow revenues 8% to 10% operationally. We have 2 percentage points coming from the region of PHARMAQ. This means our organic growth is expected to be faster than the market again. And for 2017, we expect to continue growing faster than the market at a rate of 5% to 9% as we are confident in our end markets, business model, the prospects for new product launches, improved product supply and progress in our efficiency goals. We are also confident in our pricing strategy. Our prices are defined by the value that we can demonstrate to our customers, who buy and pay for the products we sell to them with no influence from third-party payers. 
In January, we updated our adjusted EPS guidance for '16 and '17 to reflect the impact of the European Commission decision on our tax rate. Today, we are pleased to reaffirm our 2016 and 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per share despite the negative impact of foreign currency and the change in our operations in Venezuela, which will have a negative impact of $0.06 in 2016 and $0.08 in 2017. 
Our second objective for 2016 is to ensure the successful launch of new products that are critical for our long-term revenue growth. We are increasing supply for APOQUEL and also launching in new markets. This product already surpassed $100 million with limited availability in 2015 and we see significant room to grow from this level, with a long-term big sales of more than $300 million. Another important breakthrough in the area of dermatology, our canine antibody therapy against atopic dermatitis has been introduced in the U.S. to veterinarian dermatologists, and we are preparing for broader market availability later in 2016. 
Meanwhile, SIMPARICA, a new oral parasiticide will help us to better compete in the global market of flea and tick products, a market of approximately $3 billion. SIMPARICA was approved in the EU later last year, and we are awaiting approval in the U.S. this quarter. We expect the launch in both the U.S. and EU in the first quarter of 2016 and see sales ramp up during the year. Our third major objective this year is enhancing supply and customer service, an area where we fell short last year. As we continue with our supply network strategy, we are making steady improvements, most notably in APOQUEL. We are also investing to bring capacity in product categories that will be an important part of our future revenue base. In the near term, we believe that a simplified supply chain with fewer manufacturing plants focused on a streamlined set of products will improve our performance. 
We also remain on track to complete the global implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system or ERP in the first quarter. The ERP will support our overall efficiency goals and will help us better manage the processes and information to run our business, and we continue to refine these systems over the course of the year. We will make certain we are exceeding our customer expectations. 
Our fourth major objective is around capital allocation and how we maximize our cost structure, investment in R&D and business development. We are making good progress reshaping our cost structure as part of the overall efficiency plan we announced last May. That work has been accelerated and the additional cost savings has been included in our guidance. It is equally important to realize that while we are implementing these plans, we have remained committed to building the 3 interconnected capabilities that drive our success with customers: direct sales; innovative R&D; and high quality and reliable manufacturing and supply. This mission is being well resourced even as we go through changes in other areas of the company. 
Our investment in R&D continues showing high returns and support for our future growth. I'm very pleased to say that our effort to refresh our portfolio with innovative vaccines offering, especially in companion animals are paying off. Last year, we launched a new combination vaccine for dogs across the EU called Versican Plus and has been very well received by customers. In the fourth quarter, Zoetis was granted a conditional license from the USDA to market our canine influenza vaccine, the first conditional licensed vaccine to help control diseases associated with canine influenza, the virus that -- it's at age 3 and 2. In December, we received a U.S. license for VANGUARD crLyme, a vaccine that aids in the prevention of conditions associated with Lyme disease in dogs. And in November, we expanded our INNOVATOR horse vaccine franchise in the U.S. with the launch of a vaccine to aid in the prevention of leptospirosis. Meanwhile, in aquatic health, shortly after closing our deal with PHARMAQ in the fourth quarter, one of their new vaccine for salmon received an emergency license in Chile, one of the world's largest farmed fish markets. Our focus on enhancing our portfolio resulted in recent approvals for new indications of formulations of existing products. In January, Zoetis received FDA approval for an update to the labeling for CERENIA, which allow for intravenous administration during surgical protocols that use medication that induce vomiting. We launched a new formulation of LUTALYSE, a reproductive product for use in dairy and beef cattle in the U.S. We are also viewed as a partner of choice for other innovators in the industry. In January, we entered into an agreement with Anatara Lifesciences, a company in Australia. We'll be evaluating their nonantibiotic anti-infective products as an alternative to antibiotic that could treat and control infections in farm animals. And finally, in terms of business development, we'll continue to look for M&A opportunities like we did last year with Abbott Animal Health and PHARMAQ, while we continue with our internal investment in new products, life cycle innovation and research alliances. 
In summary, we delivered an excellent 2015 built in our diverse and market-leading portfolio of products for animal health. We are getting significant traction in the business as we continue reducing the complexity, achieving efficiencies and freeing up resources for our most promising growth opportunities. And we remain well positioned as the industry leader based on our core capabilities and singular focus on animal health. 
With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?"

Let me put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's overview of 2015. What a terrific year we had. If you think back to a year ago, we had a number of very challenging initiatives in front of us, most notably the design and implementation of the efficiency initiative that we announced in May and also the rollout of our enterprise-wide SAP system in our most important market, the U.S. as well as many other key locations around the world. I can tell you that both of those projects put enormous pressure on the company, on our colleagues and in some cases impacted our customers, but we were able to stay on task, overcome many challenges and deliver results that we're very proud of. 
So let's talk about our performance. We had very strong sales growth in the U.S., up 13% for the full year, driven by good livestock sales primarily in cattle, the addition of Abbott Animal Health and increased supplies of APOQUEL. In the international business, we delivered operational sales growth of 4%, which reflected good performance in major markets like Brazil and China, which grew 11% and 17%, respectively, partially offset by the business changes that we are making in Venezuela. We reduced our total operating expenses by 1% on an operational basis in '15 compared with '14 while growing revenue 8% operationally. We kicked off our efficiency initiative in May, and were able to capture meaningful savings in 2015, particularly in the second half of the year when we reduced our operating expenses by 3% on an operational basis, while we were growing revenue 7% operationally. 
To be fair, the true test of the operating efficiency improvements that we're making will come over the long term. Anyone can cut costs and improve profits in the short term. The challenge is to improve profits and then grow that larger profit pool at an attractive rate. To do that, you need to be thoughtful about where, how and how much you reduce costs. We continue to prioritize and spend behind activities that deliver value to our customers and therefore support our growth, namely our sales forces, our R&D engine and our supply chain, so very good stuff for the full year 2015. 
Let me turn to the quarter quickly. You can read the details of our fourth quarter results in the press release and tables, but let me hit on a few highlights focusing on themes that may be impactful on our future results. Starting with revenue. Again, good operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, coming against a very strong quarter in 2014. Next, improvement in operating efficiency. Total operating expenses were down 8% operationally in the quarter and this enabled us to grow adjusted net income by 29% operationally. 
Foreign currency continued to be a strong headwind for us as it is for most multinationals. Changes in FX rates reduced Q4 reported revenue growth compared with the prior year quarter by some 900 basis points. There's a word for that: it's brutal. Setting aside FX, we feel very good about the underlying drivers of our operational that is constant currency revenue growth. For the quarter, the 6% operational revenue growth included 3% from increased APOQUEL sales due to better supply, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increases across the portfolio and 1% from new products. These drivers were partially offset by a 3% decline of in-line product revenues. I want to point out that's primarily related to ongoing changes to our business model in Venezuela and other countries like India, which were initiated as part of our efficiency program. 
As I've said previously, the changes we've made and are making to our business model in certain markets impacted our second half 2015 performance and will have impacts on our 2016 revenue growth, but these changes improve our prospects for longer-term revenue and profit growth. That's the prize. 
In case of Venezuela, you'll recall that we are reducing our activities there due to unfavorable economic conditions for -- multinational companies. We've been selling down our inventories in the country, limiting our future exports to Venezuela. And this quarter, we decided to revalue our assets and liabilities there based on the free-floating Simadi exchange rate. In the case of India, we remain committed to our business there, especially in our companion animal and poultry businesses with a direct field force. However, we are making changes in our approach to the dairy segment. That segment has not consolidated in a way that we had expected over the last several years, and so we are eliminating our dairy field force there and pursuing a distributor partnership to serve those market needs. 
It's worth noting that revenue from our other emerging market geography includes Venezuela and India and declined 3% operationally in the fourth quarter. If you want to go back, and you can exclude India and Venezuela, other emerging markets would've grown by 12%. The other emerging market segment will continue to be an area where we see some noise in 2016 as it includes the countries that will be most significantly impacted by the SKU reductions as well as market changes that we are undertaking as part of our efficiency program. 
While I'm on the subject of international markets, I know there continue to be general concerns with the outlook for countries like China and Brazil given lots of recent media reports about their slower GDP growth and their economic outlooks. Generally, demand for Animal Health products is tied to more stable growth drivers, namely the demand for animal proteins and the increased adoption and medicalization of pets, both of which move as a function of population, income and urbanization. Fundamentals in the Animal Health segments of both China and Brazil remain strong and here's the proof: for the full year 2015, we grew revenue in China and Brazil on an operational basis 17% and 11%, respectively; in the fourth quarter, China and Brazil grew 14% and 10%, respectively. Both markets on a constant currency basis are growing at healthy rates and the growth prospects of these markets remain solid. And so I pose the question rhetorically, why is that? Well, for China it's 2 things. One is the fact that the consumption of animal proteins in China is growing. It has continued to grow even in challenging economic times. Second is the goal of the Chinese government to see an improvement in the productivity, safety and quality of their food supply. That means moving from smaller farms producing animal proteins to a more industrialized model, and that model requires more animal health products to maintain and drive the productivity of the business. Frankly, as I'm saying this, the second factor should be the first. It's a powerful driver and it will last for many years. 
Now turning to Brazil, yes Brazil is a very developed livestock market and domestic consumption of animal protein is only a part of the equation. Brazil is a significant exporter of meat. And so to the extent that the consumption falls within their borders, they have the opportunity to use exports to maintain the health of their livestock businesses. With the weakness of the real, exports are even more attractive today. So counter to what you might conclude when seeing negative headlines about conditions in Brazil, the Brazilian livestock industry and the supporting animal health industry are quite strong. Using China and Brazil as examples, the key takeaway should be that we operate in an industry that's very resilient, now I use that word quite a bit. Even in times of economic stress and that applies to developed as well as emerging markets. 
Turning to restructuring charges. This quarter, we had significant onetime costs that drove a decrease in our reported GAAP net income and earnings per share. Let me explain this quarter's major charges in terms of the 3 buckets that we use. First, the stand-up costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $34 million in the quarter. That work will be substantially completed by mid-2016. We recorded $4 million of costs associated with our supply network strategy, and we are still in the early days of that initiative. And we also recorded $52 million of onetime costs associated with our operational efficiency initiative, which reflected the acceleration of some of those plans and the associated costs into the fourth quarter of 2015. And finally, we have taken accounting actions related to the revaluation of our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities in Venezuela this quarter. We believe it's appropriate to changes in the Simadi rate as our exchange rate for Venezuela. And accordingly, we recorded charges of approximately $93 million in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we also announced the sale or exit of 5 manufacturing sites in the U.S., India and Taiwan, which we expect to generate proceeds in excess of $80 million of cash during 2016. 
Turning to guidance. We've provided a bridge in our tables and slides to help show the changes in our guidance for 2016 and '17 to spotlight the impact of changes in FX rates and changes to our operations in Venezuela. We now expect for the full year 2016 revenue will be between $4.65 billion to $4.775 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.30 and $1.48 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.71 and $1.81 per share. For full year 2017, we expect revenue between $4.95 billion to $5.15 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.95 to $2.13 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.18 and $2.32 per share. Our revised guidance reflects the impact of the European Commission's decision on Belgium's tax rulings and the related effect on our earnings which we disclosed in early January. 
Our effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is expected to be approximately 33% in 2016 and 30% in 2017. In January, we communicated that the changes to our tax rates reduced our expectations for adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 and '17 by $0.13 and $0.06 per share, respectively. Note that we expect to record onetime net tax charges during 2016 of approximately $55 million of which approximately $35 million to $45 million will be recorded in Q1. These Q1 charges relate to the nullification of our Belgian tax ruling by European Commission for the periods from 2013 through '15. Included in the total $55 million charge is an estimate of the future impact of the revaluation of deferred tax accounts currently associated with our Belgian operation. You can see these $55 million of onetime costs footnoted in our guidance bridge for 2016. 
Our revised guidance today also reflects our latest views of our operations in Venezuela, updated FX rates as of the end of January and other efficiency improvements to offset some of those impacts. Here's some really good news. Other than the impact of the change to our expected tax rate due to the EC ruling, a factor over which we had no control, we're holding our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for both 2016 and '17. We expect the momentum that we carried through Q4, combined with the expected pace and magnitude of the efficiency initiative, should enable us to offset the unrelenting headwinds of FX rates and the change to our business model in Venezuela. We're proud of that. 
And since I have the floor, and I like to talk about our company, here's my summary of the year. Looking back at 2015, what you see is another year where the global animal health industry posted solid mid-single-digit growth despite many challenges in many economies around the world. And you saw our company, Zoetis, deliver strong operational growth of revenue, up 8% by pulling all the levers that we have available to us: the best animal health sales forces on the planet; the most productive R&D team in the industry; value-generative M&A; and a supply chain that is a core strength of the company. And we delivered operational growth of adjusted earnings per share of 24% for the year. And I'm going to repeat that because it's awesome. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 increased 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.77 per share. I call out the $1.77 because while we always measure ourselves on a constant currency basis, at the end of the day, we put an actual dollar amount on the tape. Way back in November of 2014, we put 2015 guidance on the table. We guided to revenue in the range of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 to $1.68. Since that time, we, like many multinational companies, have been battered by FX that dramatically reduced our reported revenue. But here's where we're different from many of those other multinationals. Throughout 2015, we held the line on our guidance for adjusted earnings per share, and in November 2015, we actually raised the range to $1.70 to $1.74 and now we report actual results of $1.77 per share. We're able to do that because we, as a management team, brought forward a plan in May of last year to improve the efficiency of our cost structure. And then we, as a team, got after it and reduced and controlled expenses to give us the best shot of delivering to you, our shareholders, the best earnings we could under the circumstances. So I love to say: pretty good. 
So here's my pitch. The global animal health industry is not just resilient. It has characteristics that point to an extended period of predictable mid-single-digit growth, and the #1 company in the global animal health industry is Zoetis. In the 3 years since we've been public, we put results on the board that support what we see as our key value drivers. First, we can grow our revenues at a rate equal to or faster than the mid-single-digit growth they expected for our industry. Second, we can leverage our expense structure to drive increasing operating margins, delivering profit growth faster than revenue growth. And third, we can intelligently allocate our capital, actively manage our capital structure to grow adjusted earnings per share faster than operating profits. 
In today's dystopian financial markets, where investors may be looking for shelter from the storm, I think my suggestion would be to look at companies in reverse alphabetic order and start with z for Zoetis. That's it for my prepared remarks. Let's get to Q&A. Keith?"

Then the offset to that was about a 3% decline of what I guess we'll call revenues of all other products, and again that is primarily related to changes in our business model in Venezuela, and countries like India and places that were affected by our efficiency initiative. I hope that answers the question."

What's up with that? So let'",443,"Sure. Louise, it's Paul. Let me take that, and thank you for asking the question, Louise, because if you just take the headline and say, gee we're looking at 2% to 4% operational growth in revenue next year, people say, where? What's up with that? So let's start with -- from the 2% to 4%, the operational efficiency initiative, the effect on SKUs and now Venezuela and other markets where we're going to change our model reduced that by some 600 basis points. You could see that if you look at that Slide 18, 600 basis points. So there's 8% to 10% if you're thinking about what our actual expectations are for normalized operational revenue growth in '16 v. '15 and if you want to take PHARMAQ out of the equation and go what's the organic portion of that, it's about 200 basis points. So as you look at that slide, again, I'll call everyone's attention to it. We tried our level best to help you think about the strength of 2016, because this is quite a strong year, by showing you this waterfall slide. So 2% to 4%, 600 basis points from the efficiency initiative, SKU reduction, Venezuela, India et cetera gets you to 8% to 10%. And if you want to look at that on an organic basis, it'd be 6% to 8% by taking PHARMAQ out of the mix. I do, before I can cede the floor I want to say, 2 things before I talk about 2017 -- about 2015 -- I'm sorry, about 2016, because we did change from 3% to 5% operational growth to 2% to 4%. That is predominantly because we had previously articulated that range at the midpoint of our 2015 guidance for revenue. And as you saw, we had strong revenue in Q4, and for 2015, it was about $25 million higher than that, and that accounts for the change from 3% to 5% down to 2% to 4%. We feel really good about what we put on the table in 2015. And as we think about it, we really are excited about 2016 even though it will be masked a little bit by the changes that we are making to our model. Now last before I can cede the floor. You asked the question about what could we expect? In 2017 we expect a return to the same kind of solid growth that you would expect -- you would have expected in '16 but for the change in the efficiency initiative. We were currently forecasting on an operational basis 5% to 9%. That's pretty solid and that's being driven mainly by new products."

Again, I would look at the full year and how we came out and it was in line with what we're expecting. I know, Alex, we traveled together a little bit. You look at a quarter, there can be a lot of variability that sneaks into the equation. You're comparing against this, that and the other thing. Things happen in a 90-day period that smooth themselves out over the year. I would look at the 65-odd percent margin that we put on the board for the full year and that's indicative of the strength. But the one thing in the fourth quarter was FX. FX is hard to forecast when it flows through cost of sales, but it sure does. The second thing, I think you asked a question about the share price. Yes, we're watching our company, along with many others, lose value at least in the eyes of shareholders, the people that are holding our stock. We continue to do what we can do. We're driving real fundamental value. You posed the question about our share buyback and the scale of that et cetera. Point out that in -- when we were last in a window, I guess which was in the early part of November, stock was $43, $44 I think, I'm going from memory here $43, $44, and we elected at that point in time to increase the pace of our purchases. As everybody can do the math, we bought about $50 million a quarter through 2015. We're currently buying stock back at a pace of about $75 million a quarter. I know that's not a ton, but as I said also many times, we have a lot of calls on cash in 2016. But even so we elected to increase the pace at which we were wanting to acquire shares. So I hope that answers the questions."

We had previously articulated we thought our tax rate in, call it, '17 would have been on the order of 28% -- our adjusted ETR roughly 28% and now it's 30%.

The 6% impact in our revenues is the net result of reduction and also the assumption that some of this reduction of SKUs will be moved to other SKUs in our portfolio. In terms of reaction from customers, I think, in some cases they would like to have these products in their portfolio, but they also understand that more important than offering 13,000 SKUs, it's ensuring that we have a reliable supply. What they want is to make sure that when they place an order, they get the order on time to treat or protect the animals.

It was not only to improve gross margin, but also to ensure that our supply to the market is much more consistent and we can meet all customer expectations. And then Paul will take the question on the phasing in terms of our quarters."

Recall that we announced this program in the middle part of 2015. And so we're just starting to see here in Q4 and a line into Q1, Q2 the impacts of the SKU rationalization. And it will be -- relative to the prior year it will be a significant factor that we'll have to keep our eye on. The second part is, with respect to our cost -- our efficiency initiative, we continued to ramp up the amount of savings that we're seeing flow through. And of course, the first half of last year we had a modest amount of cost containment or -- that occurred in the first half, but that steps up and we currently are tracking -- as you saw, with an 8% operational reduction in operating expenses in Q4, tracking at a much lower rate. So that will be a very helpful driver on the operating expense side in the first half of the year. And then that benefit, if you will, comparing back to the prior year will moderate over the second half of the year. And I think, yes, that's about all we want to cover on phasing. And just lastly, I will say it again and again and again, we look at our business on a yearly basis. Trying to pull -- I know you have to and that's what you do and all. And we'll try to be as helpful as we can with respect to the phasing, but we run our business on an annual basis."

And then, Juan Ramón, just a question for you. As you are now -- congratulations 3 years as an independent company and it's been very exciting to see how Zoetis has evolved and achieved such tremendous success in a short period of time, congratulations. But maybe you could just sort of step back and tell us, when I look at the industry, the animal health industry, it doesn't seem that a whole lot has changed. It still remains highly fragmented. We've seen a little bit of movement with Novartis swapping its business to Lilly. You've made a couple of small acquisitions. But by and large, the industry hasn't changed much. Do you see more consolidation going forward? Or do you see some of your peers spinning out their animal health businesses like you have done so yourself? And what does this all mean for your future in terms of M&A?"

So in terms of the 2%, so the 2% it's -- as you mentioned, it's a global increase. And in terms of where we see we this 2% in the different geographies, definitely, we have been very consistent in the U.S. with price increases of around 3%. And in the rest of the market, it depends. So in high inflationary markets, we increased significantly the prices to compensate there for inflation, and in some cases, to compensate for foreign exchange. In some markets, where the economies are -- the inflation it's very stable or probably not having any inflation at all, so we are also trying to adjust our prices based on this situation. So in Europe or Japan or some other markets, we have been increasing prices, but at a lower rate than in the U.S. or some of the markets where we had the opportunity to increase the prices because of inflation. The second question was related to the consolidation of the industry. And the total -- 4 or 5 now animal health companies represent almost 70% of the total market, which has already been increased significantly from some years ago. Do I see opportunities for further consolidation? I think there are still opportunities especially on the second tier of companies. After these 4 or 5 companies, we see opportunities for the consolidation. We expect now the merger of Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health being completed. There is another round of consolidation. And maybe in the future also we'll see some additional consolidation. Definitely, the consolidation will be limited because of antitrust issues. But without these antitrust issues or managing these antitrust issues, definitely, consolidation can represent a good opportunity for the animal health industry. The last comment I want to add is that, the top 10 companies in animal health represent something like 80% of the total market. On the 20% which is remaining, we have maybe 100 companies that are where I expect that this will be a significant consolidation here. And Paul will add some comments in terms of the pricing."

At the same time, also the plan is to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where the product was put on hold because of product availability. So we are convinced that during 2016, we will be able to meet all the demand from the market. In terms of MFAs, I think MFAs in our case continue growing very strongly. And we have -- the advantage of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio. It's not only diversity in terms of therapeutic carriers or in terms of different types of our products, but also within the MFAs, we have a lot of diversity and for products that will be maybe facing some challenge because of changes on the approach of the use of antibiotics. And I mentioned in the medically important antibiotics in MFAs with indication of growth promotion. This will be eliminated, but in our portfolio, we also have nonmedically important antibiotics in MFAs that can be a good replacement for drugs that will be eliminated. We have in total in MFAs, $500 million in sales, and we grew operationally in 2015 by 8%. So definitely, we expect that those products with the only indication of growth promotion which are medically important for human health, they will have an impact in the revenues but this impact will be minimum."

If you look at our guidance tables, we call out the amount or the expected amount of the acquisition costs that we expect to incur in '16 and then again in '17, those are sort of -- I call them they're not normal and they will go away and most of them will go away towards the latter part of 2016. But in 2016, it's a fairly significant call on our cash. Secondarily, we continue to be in a phase of investing in our supply chain. We continue to invest capital there. So our CapEx is tracking at a rate that exceeds our ongoing depreciation rate. So net-net, we continue to invest there. Of course, we called out that we have a program that everybody can do the math, where at least the current expectation is we're purchasing shares at the rate of $75 million a quarter. It's $300 million this year plus our dividend, you can do that math. And those are, other than our earnings, the things that you need to take into consideration, when thinking about our cash flow. I don't want to stop without speaking about efficiency of working capital, that is something that is to come. It's not something that you would see necessarily in '15 and not in an enormous way in 2016. By the end of this quarter, we expect to have our ERP system up and running in all of our locations around the world, which is going to give us the ability to then implement tools to much better manage primarily our investment in our inventories. Our receivables kind of -- I think we do a pretty good job there and we certainly do the same things as everyone else with respect to payables. But yes, we will not start to see some maybe significant cash flow from the improvement in adjusted working capital really until 2017. I wasn't specific there, David. I wasn't specific for a reason, we don't want to provide guidance -- specific guidance with respect to free cash flow. But I believe we provided each of the components that would enable you to look out '16, '17 and then beyond.

In terms of the comments that you made in France, definitely, in 2015, we saw an impact because of the change of the legislation in France. This was affecting antibiotics. We expect also that antibiotics, we will continue having discussions and restrictions in some of the markets. This has been incorporated in our guidance for '16 and '17. And we also think that the projections that external sources are making about the total animal health industry and also the growth in antibiotics are consistent with what -- with our projection. So the industry will be growing about 5%. Antibiotics is expected to grow at half of this rate. The advantage for us, which is that we have in our portfolio antibiotics which are injectable, which are considered as premium antibiotics that are kept by veterinarians as a resource to ensure that they are treating and in some cases protecting, also, animals against the infection.

In today's call, I will provide perspective based on the performance for full year 2015 and our goal for 2016. Paul will discuss some of the fourth quarter highlights, the 2015 net results and our guidance for 2016 and '17. 
In 2015, we affirmed Zoetis reputation as a global leader in the animal health industry with a strong financial performance, continued investment in our future growth and a commitment to creating value for our customers and shareholders. For 2015, our diverse portfolio enabled us to grow our revenues by 8% operationally. We had particular strengths coming from R&D innovations and acquired products from animal health -- Abbott Animal Health. In our 3 years as a public company, we have been delivering consistent operational revenue growth and expect our 2015 to show again, that we are growing faster than the industry. We grew our adjusted net income by 24% operationally and grew our adjusted EBIT margin from 25% to 28% as we continue our focus on greater efficiency in our business. 
Even while we have scrutinized our efficiency, we also continue to allocate resources for future growth. We invested $1.6 billion in 2015 across the strategic acquisitions, internal research and development and capital expenditures in areas like manufacturing and supply. And finally, in 2015, we returned approximately $370 million in excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This performance reflects a disciplined implementation of our business plan and our colleagues' tremendous dedication to serving our customers. I'm pleased to say that, as a result, we met our guidance for revenue and exceeded our guidance for adjusted net income in 2015. 
On a reported basis, we had flat revenue growth due to an 800 basis point impact from foreign currency, but we still grew our reported adjusted net income by 13% thanks to our continued focus on achieving our efficiency goals. Looking ahead to 2016, first and foremost, we are focused on delivering our financial guidance for the year. We are projecting 2% to 4% operational revenue growth, which reflects the impact of our SKU reduction and changes to our operations in Venezuela. Excluding those impacts, we expect to grow revenues 8% to 10% operationally. We have 2 percentage points coming from the region of PHARMAQ. This means our organic growth is expected to be faster than the market again. And for 2017, we expect to continue growing faster than the market at a rate of 5% to 9% as we are confident in our end markets, business model, the prospects for new product launches, improved product supply and progress in our efficiency goals. We are also confident in our pricing strategy. Our prices are defined by the value that we can demonstrate to our customers, who buy and pay for the products we sell to them with no influence from third-party payers. 
In January, we updated our adjusted EPS guidance for '16 and '17 to reflect the impact of the European Commission decision on our tax rate. Today, we are pleased to reaffirm our 2016 and 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per share despite the negative impact of foreign currency and the change in our operations in Venezuela, which will have a negative impact of $0.06 in 2016 and $0.08 in 2017. 
Our second objective for 2016 is to ensure the successful launch of new products that are critical for our long-term revenue growth. We are increasing supply for APOQUEL and also launching in new markets. This product already surpassed $100 million with limited availability in 2015 and we see significant room to grow from this level, with a long-term big sales of more than $300 million. Another important breakthrough in the area of dermatology, our canine antibody therapy against atopic dermatitis has been introduced in the U.S. to veterinarian dermatologists, and we are preparing for broader market availability later in 2016. 
Meanwhile, SIMPARICA, a new oral parasiticide will help us to better compete in the global market of flea and tick products, a market of approximately $3 billion. SIMPARICA was approved in the EU later last year, and we are awaiting approval in the U.S. this quarter. We expect the launch in both the U.S. and EU in the first quarter of 2016 and see sales ramp up during the year. Our third major objective this year is enhancing supply and customer service, an area where we fell short last year. As we continue with our supply network strategy, we are making steady improvements, most notably in APOQUEL. We are also investing to bring capacity in product categories that will be an important part of our future revenue base. In the near term, we believe that a simplified supply chain with fewer manufacturing plants focused on a streamlined set of products will improve our performance. 
We also remain on track to complete the global implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system or ERP in the first quarter. The ERP will support our overall efficiency goals and will help us better manage the processes and information to run our business, and we continue to refine these systems over the course of the year. We will make certain we are exceeding our customer expectations. 
Our fourth major objective is around capital allocation and how we maximize our cost structure, investment in R&D and business development. We are making good progress reshaping our cost structure as part of the overall efficiency plan we announced last May. That work has been accelerated and the additional cost savings has been included in our guidance. It is equally important to realize that while we are implementing these plans, we have remained committed to building the 3 interconnected capabilities that drive our success with customers: direct sales; innovative R&D; and high quality and reliable manufacturing and supply. This mission is being well resourced even as we go through changes in other areas of the company. 
Our investment in R&D continues showing high returns and support for our future growth. I'm very pleased to say that our effort to refresh our portfolio with innovative vaccines offering, especially in companion animals are paying off. Last year, we launched a new combination vaccine for dogs across the EU called Versican Plus and has been very well received by customers. In the fourth quarter, Zoetis was granted a conditional license from the USDA to market our canine influenza vaccine, the first conditional licensed vaccine to help control diseases associated with canine influenza, the virus that -- it's at age 3 and 2. In December, we received a U.S. license for VANGUARD crLyme, a vaccine that aids in the prevention of conditions associated with Lyme disease in dogs. And in November, we expanded our INNOVATOR horse vaccine franchise in the U.S. with the launch of a vaccine to aid in the prevention of leptospirosis. Meanwhile, in aquatic health, shortly after closing our deal with PHARMAQ in the fourth quarter, one of their new vaccine for salmon received an emergency license in Chile, one of the world's largest farmed fish markets. Our focus on enhancing our portfolio resulted in recent approvals for new indications of formulations of existing products. In January, Zoetis received FDA approval for an update to the labeling for CERENIA, which allow for intravenous administration during surgical protocols that use medication that induce vomiting. We launched a new formulation of LUTALYSE, a reproductive product for use in dairy and beef cattle in the U.S. We are also viewed as a partner of choice for other innovators in the industry. In January, we entered into an agreement with Anatara Lifesciences, a company in Australia. We'll be evaluating their nonantibiotic anti-infective products as an alternative to antibiotic that could treat and control infections in farm animals. And finally, in terms of business development, we'll continue to look for M&A opportunities like we did last year with Abbott Animal Health and PHARMAQ, while we continue with our internal investment in new products, life cycle innovation and research alliances. 
In summary, we delivered an excellent 2015 built in our diverse and market-leading portfolio of products for animal health. We are getting significant traction in the business as we continue reducing the complexity, achieving efficiencies and freeing up resources for our most promising growth opportunities. And we remain well positioned as the industry leader based on our core capabilities and singular focus on animal health. 
With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?"

Let me put an exclamation point on Juan Ramón's overview of 2015. What a terrific year we had. If you think back to a year ago, we had a number of very challenging initiatives in front of us, most notably the design and implementation of the efficiency initiative that we announced in May and also the rollout of our enterprise-wide SAP system in our most important market, the U.S. as well as many other key locations around the world. I can tell you that both of those projects put enormous pressure on the company, on our colleagues and in some cases impacted our customers, but we were able to stay on task, overcome many challenges and deliver results that we're very proud of. 
So let's talk about our performance. We had very strong sales growth in the U.S., up 13% for the full year, driven by good livestock sales primarily in cattle, the addition of Abbott Animal Health and increased supplies of APOQUEL. In the international business, we delivered operational sales growth of 4%, which reflected good performance in major markets like Brazil and China, which grew 11% and 17%, respectively, partially offset by the business changes that we are making in Venezuela. We reduced our total operating expenses by 1% on an operational basis in '15 compared with '14 while growing revenue 8% operationally. We kicked off our efficiency initiative in May, and were able to capture meaningful savings in 2015, particularly in the second half of the year when we reduced our operating expenses by 3% on an operational basis, while we were growing revenue 7% operationally. 
To be fair, the true test of the operating efficiency improvements that we're making will come over the long term. Anyone can cut costs and improve profits in the short term. The challenge is to improve profits and then grow that larger profit pool at an attractive rate. To do that, you need to be thoughtful about where, how and how much you reduce costs. We continue to prioritize and spend behind activities that deliver value to our customers and therefore support our growth, namely our sales forces, our R&D engine and our supply chain, so very good stuff for the full year 2015. 
Let me turn to the quarter quickly. You can read the details of our fourth quarter results in the press release and tables, but let me hit on a few highlights focusing on themes that may be impactful on our future results. Starting with revenue. Again, good operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, coming against a very strong quarter in 2014. Next, improvement in operating efficiency. Total operating expenses were down 8% operationally in the quarter and this enabled us to grow adjusted net income by 29% operationally. 
Foreign currency continued to be a strong headwind for us as it is for most multinationals. Changes in FX rates reduced Q4 reported revenue growth compared with the prior year quarter by some 900 basis points. There's a word for that: it's brutal. Setting aside FX, we feel very good about the underlying drivers of our operational that is constant currency revenue growth. For the quarter, the 6% operational revenue growth included 3% from increased APOQUEL sales due to better supply, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increases across the portfolio and 1% from new products. These drivers were partially offset by a 3% decline of in-line product revenues. I want to point out that's primarily related to ongoing changes to our business model in Venezuela and other countries like India, which were initiated as part of our efficiency program. 
As I've said previously, the changes we've made and are making to our business model in certain markets impacted our second half 2015 performance and will have impacts on our 2016 revenue growth, but these changes improve our prospects for longer-term revenue and profit growth. That's the prize. 
In case of Venezuela, you'll recall that we are reducing our activities there due to unfavorable economic conditions for -- multinational companies. We've been selling down our inventories in the country, limiting our future exports to Venezuela. And this quarter, we decided to revalue our assets and liabilities there based on the free-floating Simadi exchange rate. In the case of India, we remain committed to our business there, especially in our companion animal and poultry businesses with a direct field force. However, we are making changes in our approach to the dairy segment. That segment has not consolidated in a way that we had expected over the last several years, and so we are eliminating our dairy field force there and pursuing a distributor partnership to serve those market needs. 
It's worth noting that revenue from our other emerging market geography includes Venezuela and India and declined 3% operationally in the fourth quarter. If you want to go back, and you can exclude India and Venezuela, other emerging markets would've grown by 12%. The other emerging market segment will continue to be an area where we see some noise in 2016 as it includes the countries that will be most significantly impacted by the SKU reductions as well as market changes that we are undertaking as part of our efficiency program. 
While I'm on the subject of international markets, I know there continue to be general concerns with the outlook for countries like China and Brazil given lots of recent media reports about their slower GDP growth and their economic outlooks. Generally, demand for Animal Health products is tied to more stable growth drivers, namely the demand for animal proteins and the increased adoption and medicalization of pets, both of which move as a function of population, income and urbanization. Fundamentals in the Animal Health segments of both China and Brazil remain strong and here's the proof: for the full year 2015, we grew revenue in China and Brazil on an operational basis 17% and 11%, respectively; in the fourth quarter, China and Brazil grew 14% and 10%, respectively. Both markets on a constant currency basis are growing at healthy rates and the growth prospects of these markets remain solid. And so I pose the question rhetorically, why is that? Well, for China it's 2 things. One is the fact that the consumption of animal proteins in China is growing. It has continued to grow even in challenging economic times. Second is the goal of the Chinese government to see an improvement in the productivity, safety and quality of their food supply. That means moving from smaller farms producing animal proteins to a more industrialized model, and that model requires more animal health products to maintain and drive the productivity of the business. Frankly, as I'm saying this, the second factor should be the first. It's a powerful driver and it will last for many years. 
Now turning to Brazil, yes Brazil is a very developed livestock market and domestic consumption of animal protein is only a part of the equation. Brazil is a significant exporter of meat. And so to the extent that the consumption falls within their borders, they have the opportunity to use exports to maintain the health of their livestock businesses. With the weakness of the real, exports are even more attractive today. So counter to what you might conclude when seeing negative headlines about conditions in Brazil, the Brazilian livestock industry and the supporting animal health industry are quite strong. Using China and Brazil as examples, the key takeaway should be that we operate in an industry that's very resilient, now I use that word quite a bit. Even in times of economic stress and that applies to developed as well as emerging markets. 
Turning to restructuring charges. This quarter, we had significant onetime costs that drove a decrease in our reported GAAP net income and earnings per share. Let me explain this quarter's major charges in terms of the 3 buckets that we use. First, the stand-up costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $34 million in the quarter. That work will be substantially completed by mid-2016. We recorded $4 million of costs associated with our supply network strategy, and we are still in the early days of that initiative. And we also recorded $52 million of onetime costs associated with our operational efficiency initiative, which reflected the acceleration of some of those plans and the associated costs into the fourth quarter of 2015. And finally, we have taken accounting actions related to the revaluation of our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities in Venezuela this quarter. We believe it's appropriate to changes in the Simadi rate as our exchange rate for Venezuela. And accordingly, we recorded charges of approximately $93 million in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we also announced the sale or exit of 5 manufacturing sites in the U.S., India and Taiwan, which we expect to generate proceeds in excess of $80 million of cash during 2016. 
Turning to guidance. We've provided a bridge in our tables and slides to help show the changes in our guidance for 2016 and '17 to spotlight the impact of changes in FX rates and changes to our operations in Venezuela. We now expect for the full year 2016 revenue will be between $4.65 billion to $4.775 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.30 and $1.48 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.71 and $1.81 per share. For full year 2017, we expect revenue between $4.95 billion to $5.15 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.95 to $2.13 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.18 and $2.32 per share. Our revised guidance reflects the impact of the European Commission's decision on Belgium's tax rulings and the related effect on our earnings which we disclosed in early January. 
Our effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is expected to be approximately 33% in 2016 and 30% in 2017. In January, we communicated that the changes to our tax rates reduced our expectations for adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 and '17 by $0.13 and $0.06 per share, respectively. Note that we expect to record onetime net tax charges during 2016 of approximately $55 million of which approximately $35 million to $45 million will be recorded in Q1. These Q1 charges relate to the nullification of our Belgian tax ruling by European Commission for the periods from 2013 through '15. Included in the total $55 million charge is an estimate of the future impact of the revaluation of deferred tax accounts currently associated with our Belgian operation. You can see these $55 million of onetime costs footnoted in our guidance bridge for 2016. 
Our revised guidance today also reflects our latest views of our operations in Venezuela, updated FX rates as of the end of January and other efficiency improvements to offset some of those impacts. Here's some really good news. Other than the impact of the change to our expected tax rate due to the EC ruling, a factor over which we had no control, we're holding our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for both 2016 and '17. We expect the momentum that we carried through Q4, combined with the expected pace and magnitude of the efficiency initiative, should enable us to offset the unrelenting headwinds of FX rates and the change to our business model in Venezuela. We're proud of that. 
And since I have the floor, and I like to talk about our company, here's my summary of the year. Looking back at 2015, what you see is another year where the global animal health industry posted solid mid-single-digit growth despite many challenges in many economies around the world. And you saw our company, Zoetis, deliver strong operational growth of revenue, up 8% by pulling all the levers that we have available to us: the best animal health sales forces on the planet; the most productive R&D team in the industry; value-generative M&A; and a supply chain that is a core strength of the company. And we delivered operational growth of adjusted earnings per share of 24% for the year. And I'm going to repeat that because it's awesome. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 increased 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.77 per share. I call out the $1.77 because while we always measure ourselves on a constant currency basis, at the end of the day, we put an actual dollar amount on the tape. Way back in November of 2014, we put 2015 guidance on the table. We guided to revenue in the range of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 to $1.68. Since that time, we, like many multinational companies, have been battered by FX that dramatically reduced our reported revenue. But here's where we're different from many of those other multinationals. Throughout 2015, we held the line on our guidance for adjusted earnings per share, and in November 2015, we actually raised the range to $1.70 to $1.74 and now we report actual results of $1.77 per share. We're able to do that because we, as a management team, brought forward a plan in May of last year to improve the efficiency of our cost structure. And then we, as a team, got after it and reduced and controlled expenses to give us the best shot of delivering to you, our shareholders, the best earnings we could under the circumstances. So I love to say: pretty good. 
So here's my pitch. The global animal health industry is not just resilient. It has characteristics that point to an extended period of predictable mid-single-digit growth, and the #1 company in the global animal health industry is Zoetis. In the 3 years since we've been public, we put results on the board that support what we see as our key value drivers. First, we can grow our revenues at a rate equal to or faster than the mid-single-digit growth they expected for our industry. Second, we can leverage our expense structure to drive increasing operating margins, delivering profit growth faster than revenue growth. And third, we can intelligently allocate our capital, actively manage our capital structure to grow adjusted earnings per share faster than operating profits. 
In today's dystopian financial markets, where investors may be looking for shelter from the storm, I think my suggestion would be to look at companies in reverse alphabetic order and start with z for Zoetis. That's it for my prepared remarks. Let's get to Q&A. Keith?"

Then the offset to that was about a 3% decline of what I guess we'll call revenues of all other products, and again that is primarily related to changes in our business model in Venezuela, and countries like India and places that were affected by our efficiency initiative. I hope that answers the question."

What's up with that? So let'",443,"Sure. Louise, it's Paul. Let me take that, and thank you for asking the question, Louise, because if you just take the headline and say, gee we're looking at 2% to 4% operational growth in revenue next year, people say, where? What's up with that? So let's start with -- from the 2% to 4%, the operational efficiency initiative, the effect on SKUs and now Venezuela and other markets where we're going to change our model reduced that by some 600 basis points. You could see that if you look at that Slide 18, 600 basis points. So there's 8% to 10% if you're thinking about what our actual expectations are for normalized operational revenue growth in '16 v. '15 and if you want to take PHARMAQ out of the equation and go what's the organic portion of that, it's about 200 basis points. So as you look at that slide, again, I'll call everyone's attention to it. We tried our level best to help you think about the strength of 2016, because this is quite a strong year, by showing you this waterfall slide. So 2% to 4%, 600 basis points from the efficiency initiative, SKU reduction, Venezuela, India et cetera gets you to 8% to 10%. And if you want to look at that on an organic basis, it'd be 6% to 8% by taking PHARMAQ out of the mix. I do, before I can cede the floor I want to say, 2 things before I talk about 2017 -- about 2015 -- I'm sorry, about 2016, because we did change from 3% to 5% operational growth to 2% to 4%. That is predominantly because we had previously articulated that range at the midpoint of our 2015 guidance for revenue. And as you saw, we had strong revenue in Q4, and for 2015, it was about $25 million higher than that, and that accounts for the change from 3% to 5% down to 2% to 4%. We feel really good about what we put on the table in 2015. And as we think about it, we really are excited about 2016 even though it will be masked a little bit by the changes that we are making to our model. Now last before I can cede the floor. You asked the question about what could we expect? In 2017 we expect a return to the same kind of solid growth that you would expect -- you would have expected in '16 but for the change in the efficiency initiative. We were currently forecasting on an operational basis 5% to 9%. That's pretty solid and that's being driven mainly by new products."

Again, I would look at the full year and how we came out and it was in line with what we're expecting. I know, Alex, we traveled together a little bit. You look at a quarter, there can be a lot of variability that sneaks into the equation. You're comparing against this, that and the other thing. Things happen in a 90-day period that smooth themselves out over the year. I would look at the 65-odd percent margin that we put on the board for the full year and that's indicative of the strength. But the one thing in the fourth quarter was FX. FX is hard to forecast when it flows through cost of sales, but it sure does. The second thing, I think you asked a question about the share price. Yes, we're watching our company, along with many others, lose value at least in the eyes of shareholders, the people that are holding our stock. We continue to do what we can do. We're driving real fundamental value. You posed the question about our share buyback and the scale of that et cetera. Point out that in -- when we were last in a window, I guess which was in the early part of November, stock was $43, $44 I think, I'm going from memory here $43, $44, and we elected at that point in time to increase the pace of our purchases. As everybody can do the math, we bought about $50 million a quarter through 2015. We're currently buying stock back at a pace of about $75 million a quarter. I know that's not a ton, but as I said also many times, we have a lot of calls on cash in 2016. But even so we elected to increase the pace at which we were wanting to acquire shares. So I hope that answers the questions."

And yes, it's a shame. So set that aside. We're very disappointed, and obviously, it was not something that we were planning on. And let's pretend that, that didn't happen for a second. We had previously articulated we thought our tax rate in, call it, '17 would have been on the order of 28% -- our adjusted ETR roughly 28% and now it's 30%. So we lost a couple of hundred basis points there in 2017. What I would suggest you is, just as we had articulated with respect to our structure before this happened, we can grind that down, but we will be grinding it down. Frustrating thing for us is we were doing pretty well fine-tuning our global operating model to be efficient. And here we have to go back and we have to change course a little bit. And so not something that -- it's not a happy day for us, but we're responding the best way that we can.

The 6% impact in our revenues is the net result of reduction and also the assumption that some of this reduction of SKUs will be moved to other SKUs in our portfolio. In terms of reaction from customers, I think, in some cases they would like to have these products in their portfolio, but they also understand that more important than offering 13,000 SKUs, it's ensuring that we have a reliable supply. What they want is to make sure that when they place an order, they get the order on time to treat or protect the animals. And this is one of the important strategic rationale for our SKU rationalization. It was not only to improve gross margin, but also to ensure that our supply to the market is much more consistent and we can meet all customer expectations.

And it will be -- relative to the prior year it will be a significant factor that we'll have to keep our eye on. The second part is, with respect to our cost -- our efficiency initiative, we continued to ramp up the amount of savings that we're seeing flow through. And of course, the first half of last year we had a modest amount of cost containment or -- that occurred in the first half, but that steps up and we currently are tracking -- as you saw, with an 8% operational reduction in operating expenses in Q4, tracking at a much lower rate. So that will be a very helpful driver on the operating expense side in the first half of the year. And then that benefit, if you will, comparing back to the prior year will moderate over the second half of the year. And I think, yes, that's about all we want to cover on phasing. And just lastly, I will say it again and again and again, we look at our business on a yearly basis. Trying to pull -- I know you have to and that's what you do and all.

But maybe you could just sort of step back and tell us, when I look at the industry, the animal health industry, it doesn't seem that a whole lot has changed. It still remains highly fragmented. We've seen a little bit of movement with Novartis swapping its business to Lilly. You've made a couple of small acquisitions. But by and large, the industry hasn't changed much.

So in terms of the 2%, so the 2% it's -- as you mentioned, it's a global increase. And in terms of where we see we this 2% in the different geographies, definitely, we have been very consistent in the U.S. with price increases of around 3%. And in the rest of the market, it depends. So in high inflationary markets, we increased significantly the prices to compensate there for inflation, and in some cases, to compensate for foreign exchange. In some markets, where the economies are -- the inflation it's very stable or probably not having any inflation at all, so we are also trying to adjust our prices based on this situation. So in Europe or Japan or some other markets, we have been increasing prices, but at a lower rate than in the U.S. or some of the markets where we had the opportunity to increase the prices because of inflation. The second question was related to the consolidation of the industry. And the total -- 4 or 5 now animal health companies represent almost 70% of the total market, which has already been increased significantly from some years ago. Do I see opportunities for further consolidation? I think there are still opportunities especially on the second tier of companies. After these 4 or 5 companies, we see opportunities for the consolidation. We expect now the merger of Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health being completed. There is another round of consolidation. And maybe in the future also we'll see some additional consolidation. Definitely, the consolidation will be limited because of antitrust issues. But without these antitrust issues or managing these antitrust issues, definitely, consolidation can represent a good opportunity for the animal health industry. The last comment I want to add is that, the top 10 companies in animal health represent something like 80% of the total market. On the 20% which is remaining, we have maybe 100 companies that are where I expect that this will be a significant consolidation here. And Paul will add some comments in terms of the pricing."

And in terms of the increase for APOQUEL, so let me start saying that we have now 2 sources of the production of API. And the second source that will be a company in Switzerland, which is called Siegfried, that will double the capacity of the production of the active product ingredient. We plan to now offer APOQUEL to more veterinarians and also to offer more available product to existing veterinarians. At the same time, also the plan is to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where the product was put on hold because of product availability. So we are convinced that during 2016, we will be able to meet all the demand from the market. In terms of MFAs, I think MFAs in our case continue growing very strongly. And we have -- the advantage of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio. It's not only diversity in terms of therapeutic carriers or in terms of different types of our products, but also within the MFAs, we have a lot of diversity and for products that will be maybe facing some challenge because of changes on the approach of the use of antibiotics. And I mentioned in the medically important antibiotics in MFAs with indication of growth promotion. This will be eliminated, but in our portfolio, we also have nonmedically important antibiotics in MFAs that can be a good replacement for drugs that will be eliminated. We have in total in MFAs, $500 million in sales, and we grew operationally in 2015 by 8%. So definitely, we expect that those products with the only indication of growth promotion which are medically important for human health, they will have an impact in the revenues but this impact will be minimum."

If you hedge, you hedge within a quarter and the analysis that we've done has suggested that you're essentially chasing down -- you limit but the cost of the hedges ultimately make it a less than fruitful exercise. Now others will tell you that they can do it. And that's okay, that would be their point of view. I'd point out that a couple of the currencies that tend to be the most volatile, there are not markets for us to go out and hedge. I think they're not deep enough. They're not efficient enough. And so you wouldn't be able to fully offset that. I think I loved your word the opacity -- or I might have mispronounced that.

We do now and we will continue to manage ourselves on an operational basis, meaning a constant currency basis.

We have a large amount of expenses that we're incurring with respect to one, the stand up from Pfizer; second, the operational efficiency initiative; and now, we add to the list a potential true-up of our international taxes in light of the EC's comments. If you look at our guidance tables, we call out the amount or the expected amount of the acquisition costs that we expect to incur in '16 and then again in '17, those are sort of -- I call them they're not normal and they will go away and most of them will go away towards the latter part of 2016. But in 2016, it's a fairly significant call on our cash. Secondarily, we continue to be in a phase of investing in our supply chain. We continue to invest capital there. So our CapEx is tracking at a rate that exceeds our ongoing depreciation rate. So net-net, we continue to invest there. Of course, we called out that we have a program that everybody can do the math, where at least the current expectation is we're purchasing shares at the rate of $75 million a quarter. It's $300 million this year plus our dividend, you can do that math. And those are, other than our earnings, the things that you need to take into consideration, when thinking about our cash flow. I don't want to stop without speaking about efficiency of working capital, that is something that is to come. It's not something that you would see necessarily in '15 and not in an enormous way in 2016. By the end of this quarter, we expect to have our ERP system up and running in all of our locations around the world, which is going to give us the ability to then implement tools to much better manage primarily our investment in our inventories. Our receivables kind of -- I think we do a pretty good job there and we certainly do the same things as everyone else with respect to payables. But yes, we will not start to see some maybe significant cash flow from the improvement in adjusted working capital really until 2017. I wasn't specific there, David. I wasn't specific for a reason, we don't want to provide guidance -- specific guidance with respect to free cash flow. But I believe we provided each of the components that would enable you to look out '16, '17 and then beyond. I think when you get out into the latter part of this decade kind of our depreciation should start to normalize at a level close to our depreciation amount. I'll stop there."

So we are very excited about the opportunities of PHARMAQ. We are working also in terms of integrating the 2 companies, but ensuring that PHARMAQ remain a leader in aquatic health with enough identity to maximize the relationship with the customers that they already built through many years. In terms of the comments that you made in France, definitely, in 2015, we saw an impact because of the change of the legislation in France. This was affecting antibiotics. We expect also that antibiotics, we will continue having discussions and restrictions in some of the markets. This has been incorporated in our guidance for '16 and '17. And we also think that the projections that external sources are making about the total animal health industry and also the growth in antibiotics are consistent with what -- with our projection. So the industry will be growing about 5%. Antibiotics is expected to grow at half of this rate. The advantage for us, which is that we have in our portfolio antibiotics which are injectable, which are considered as premium antibiotics that are kept by veterinarians as a resource to ensure that they are treating and in some cases protecting, also, animals against the infection. So we are confident that the impact that, that will have in antibiotics will be lower in our revenues, but in any case, all these elements have been incorporated in our projections."

We delivered another solid quarter and we're taking our steady and predictable growth and confirming the strength of Zoetis of the industry leader in animal health. The diversity of our portfolio in terms of geographies, species and geographic areas as well as our business model continues driving our performance. In previous years, we have seen the different species leading our growth based on changes in market trends and the needs of producing our portfolio. For example, in 2013, our growth was driven largely by swine and poultry products. In 2014, it was driven by cattle and swine, and in 2015, companion animal and cattle led the way. This quarter, the most significant operational growth driver by far has been our portfolio of our companion animal, a trend we expect to continue through 2016. 
Our companion animal business is growing, thanks to the increasing sales of APOQUEL, [indiscernible] of Abbott Animal Health products, interaction of [indiscernible] U.S. [indiscernible] in the Europe and U.S. and the overall positive performance of the rest of our portfolio. It's important as we experience software growth in livestock. 
We continue to invest across our portfolio, and in the first quarter, our R&D investment continue to show many positive results including the approval of SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide in the U.S., Brazil and Canada. This quarter also marks the completion of our ELP [ph] implementation. After nearly 2 years, all our cost of operations manufacturing plants and support functions are on a single platform, enabling us to achieve greater efficiency. Overall, we have been able to accelerate our operational efficiency program with a positive impact in 2016, and we expect to exceed the initial savings target of $300 million by year 2017. 
I am pleased to say that with the positive momentum in the business and the health of improved foreign exchange rates, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2016 and 2017. 
Coming now to more detail on our first quarter results. Operational revenue growth was 12% and you can find a slide on our webcast that breaks this down a. This reflects 6 extra days in the quarter due to the accounting calendar as well as the negative impact of changes in markets like Venezuela and India and the product SKU rationalization that we communicated last year. Adjusting for these factors, the growth will be 10% operational and 6% excluding the additional impact of recent acquisitions. In the quarter, we grew adjusted net income by 28% [ph] operationally, once again growing faster than revenue and helped by the fact that our OpEx increased only 2% operationally compared to the 12% revenue growth. We continue to deliver our long-term value proposition of growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. 
In looking at the overall market, we continue to see the animal health industry performing well despite lower economic challenges. We have seen good growth in most markets. A greater consumption of proteins and increased medical spending on pets continues to help create customer demand for our products. As always, while I'm very pleased with the quarterly results, I also want to emphasize the need to look at our business on a full year basis to account for some of the seasonal situations and timing patterns in animal health. 
Let me now update you on our new product launches and R&D developments. APOQUEL is showing steady growth. We have continued to launch APOQUEL in additional markets such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and we plan in the coming months to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where it has been approved including Japan, Brazil and Mexico. And this month, the product will be available to customers without restrictions. 
In the first quarter, APOQUEL sales were approximately $50 million, an increase of about $40 million from the year ago quarter. As previously communicated, we expect APOQUEL to generate peak sales of more than $300 million. As for SIMPARICA, our new once [indiscernible] tablet for the treatment of fleas and ticks, it has launched in the U.S. and in several European markets. It is early but we are hearing a positive response from our customers, and we expect performance to ramp up in the remainder of the year. 
We are also developing combinations of this molecular in SIMPARICA with other agents. This would cover a broader spectrum of parasites including heartworm, and we're seeing some remainder as a strong platform for future lifecycle innovations. Our canine and [indiscernible] therapy that targets and neutralized IL-31 to help treat atopic dermatitis in dogs has been introduced to veterinarian dermatologists in the U.S. and their conditional license. And we received another conditional license in Canada in the first quarter. We are hearing very positive customer feedback and we are gaining market experience with the product. 
We continue to allocate our capital for investments in key commercial activities, R&D programs and the business development opportunities that can generate faster revenue growth. For example, vaccines and genetics are 2 areas we are expanding our portfolio as we put greater R&D emphasis around disease separation. And in the first quarter, we had several positive developments. We received approval of Rui Lan Wen, the second vaccine resulting from our joint venture in China and the first combination vaccine in China to help protect ticks against certain locally prevalent insects. We also gained approval in China for a poultry vaccine to help prevent Marek's disease. In the U.S., we have now received licenses from the USDA for a new VANGUARD oral vaccine and see new VANGUARD rapid resp intranasal vaccines. Zoetis is now the first and only manufacturer to offer oral intranasal and injectable options for vaccinating dogs against Bordetella bronchiseptica. We also granted a conditional license in the U.S. for Avian Influenza vaccine to help prevent disease caused by the avian influenza virus H5N1. We are participating in the process to supply the USDA with vaccine for [indiscernible] should they decide a vaccination strategy is needed. 
We are also seeing progress in genetic tests as our farm animal customers want more information about traits and conditions that can help them build a healthier and more productive herd. During the quarter, in the U.S., we launched CLARIFIDE Plus, the first commercially available genomic test that gives us daily [indiscernible] the right way to predict risk factors for costly diseases in hosting daily cattle. And just last month in Chile, we launched the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon, the first attenuated live vaccine against SRS. We will have a significant R&D achievement there by PHARMAQ and a much-needed to help Chilean and fisher farmers, great news for the industry and a terrific new opportunity for Zoetis. 
In summary, we are off to a good start for 2016 based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and the continued benefits of our R&D investment. We have been able to accelerate our efficiency program and expect to achieve additional savings targets of $300 million by 2017. 
And finally, with improved foreign exchange currency rates and the positive momentum of the business, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2016 and '17. 
With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?"
215548781,329674508,971968,"Zoetis Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Ramón.

I'll walk you through a number of factors that you s",2150,"Thank you, Juan Ramón. I'm going to hit on many of the themes covered by Juan Ramón because they're important to the financial review of the quarter. So let's talk about our first quarter performance. I'll walk you through a number of factors that you should consider to gauge how we did in Q1. There are some helpful information on the webcast slides and of course included in our press release. I'll then hit on a few other highlights in the quarter results and discuss our updates to guidance. 
Now before I jump in the quarter, let me say that we know that the U.S. financial markets are quarter-centric and not to [indiscernible] quarterly modelers, but within any quarter, a lot of noise can and does creep into the comparison with the prior year period. In our discussion and our webcast slides, our objective is to try to highlight the use of major elements for the noise and our results so that you can calibrate how our reported performance might influence your thoughts about our future prospects. The most important thing about our first quarter performance is that the results from Q1 supported in improvement to our outlook for the full year 2016. 
So with that background, let me cover 2 important points to enable you to put our 12% operational revenue growth in perspective. First, we operate on a 4 4 5 financial-week calendar with our international operations closing 1 month ahead of the U.S. Yes, this was a carryover from our days as part of Pfizer. Now under our 4 4 5 calendar, every handful of years, you'll have a quarter in a year that has as many of 6 extra calendar days in it. That's what we have in Q1 '16 compared with Q1 of '15. Yes, we estimate that the additional days account for approximately 6% of the 12% operational revenue growth for Q1 '16 versus '15. 
Important safety tip for those with quarterly models out there. Our fourth quarter this year will have 5 fewer days than the prior year quarter, and the full year 2016 has one more calendar day than 2015, this being a leap year. So that's the extra days. 
Second, our operating efficiency initiative was a drag on our operational revenue growth in the quarter. We estimate that the combination of the eliminated SKUs and the changes to our business models in Venezuela, India and other countries reduced operational revenue growth by some 4%. So you think about it like this, 12% operational growth for the quarter minus 6% for the extra days plus 4% for the impact of the efficiency initiative, that equates to normalize growth rate of approximately 10%. Of that 10%, roughly 4% came from acquisitions including Abbott, PHARMAQ and other smaller transactions. So our organic operational growth in Q1 was circa 6%, and including acquisitions was 10% so now [ph] 12% but pretty good, right? 
Now highlights for the first quarter. Very high level. We now ended what I previously referred to as the golden age of our companion animal business. The full supply of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA, a refreshed companion animal vaccine line and conditional license by IL-31, we're positioned to deliver a significant growth in our companion animal business in 2016 and beyond. On a normalized basis, organic operational revenue growth which adjust for the 6 extra days, the impact of the operational efficiency initiative and M&A, we had about 20% growth in companion animal in Q1 compared with Q1 of 2015. And the [indiscernible] was recently consistent between the U.S. and international segments. On the same normalized constant currency basis, livestock was up 1% with solid performance in the International segment offset by a decline in the U.S. Q1 of 2015 was a particularly strong quarter in U.S. livestock and there were a number of other factors that I'll touch on later. Our livestock business, both in the U.S. and international segments, are healthy and poised to contribute to revenue growth for the remainder of the year. 
Stepping down the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin hit an all-time high at 67.4% in the quarter, a bit above the high end of our full year guidance range but I'll point out that from a gross margin perspective, many things fell on the favorable side of the line during the quarter: mix, level of scrap, et cetera. Our expectations for gross margin for the full year continue to be in the range of 66% to 67%. In operating expenses, total adjusted OpEx grew 2% on an operational basis. But if you remember those extra 6 days, they impact our expenses as well. Our progress in reducing operating costs continues and we're on track to deliver on the promises of our operational efficiency initiative in 2016 and expect to end in 2017 having taken more than the targeted $300 million of cost out of our company. 
With the gross margin expansion and active efforts to contain operating costs, our 12% reported operational revenue growth translated into 27% operational growth in adjusted operating profit and 35% operational growth in adjusted income before tax. The [indiscernible] actions last January were a key driver of the 350 basis points rise in our adjusted effective tax rate to 30.9%, which resulted in our adjusted net income in the quarter rising 28% operationally. Our purchase of shares which began in Q1 of 2015 started in January 2015 helped to reduce our fully diluted share count from 503.2 million in Q1 of '15 to 499.5 million in the current quarter, and that led to operational growth of adjusted diluted EPS of 29%. So that was a very quick walk down our P&L for the quarter. 
Now here are a few more contextual details that I believe will help you think about our performance. First, FX. Dare I say that we may have found the bottom of the cycle? Maybe not, but the environment has improved for sure. Foreign exchange had a negative 2 700 basis point impact on our revenue growth in the first quarter compared to Q1 of '15. Now that's a big hit. But based on current rates, the FX impact on our growth will lessen over the remainder of the year. While we continue to measure our performance on an operational or constant currency basis, it just feels better when the gap between operational and reported results narrows. 
Next, the SKU reduction and the changes to our business models in countries like Venezuela and India reduced our operational revenue growth by roughly 400 basis points. You should expect the growth drag on the full year to be roughly 500 basis points, so more of a negative factor compared with the prior year for the next 9 months and, particularly, in Q2 and in Q3. Importantly, the impact of the SKU reduction and the changes in business models are felt more in our international segment than in the U.S. and more in livestock than in companion animals. 
Let we step through the elements of the 12% operational revenue growth in Q1. Price accounted for 3% of the growth, APOQUEL volume another 3%, 4% from acquisitions, 6% from growth of in-line products and minus 4% from the impact of the SKU reductions and changes to business models in Venezuela, India and other countries. 
Companion animal is the star of the quarter. Revenue growth normalized for both the 6 extra days and the impact of the efficiency initiatives increased 20% operationally. APOQUEL was a major driver, but other products contributed as well including vaccines as well as the Abbott acquisition. We also expanded U.S. customers' access to a number of our companion animal products through third-party distributors and that change led to a one-time and semipermanent buildup of their inventories during the quarter to establish their base level. 
In livestock, we have lots of puts and takes. Normalized organic revenue growth was 1% operationally with the International segment up 5% and the U.S. segment down 9%. First, let's talk about international. Since livestock rebounded as the anti-infective sales in the quarter were higher when compared with the very light Q1 of 2015, which was caused by new legislation last year. Australia livestock also posted a strong quarter with better weather playing a role. In Brazil, we benefited from above average price increases and continued favorable conditions in the cattle segment which were, in part, offset by a negative impact of our SKU reductions. In U.S. livestock, a mild winter was a major driver of lower cattle product sales in the quarter. With milder weather, there was less risk of disease [indiscernible] and that impacted our premium products. We also saw a decline in swine products due to increased competition. 
In summary, after adjusting for the noise, we had a solid quarter from a revenue perspective, and through the ongoing program to improve efficiency, delivered an improved gross margin, contained operating costs and posted strong growth and profits. 
Switching to restructuring charges. Let me quickly review this quarter's one-time charges related to certain significant items. First, the standup costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer, totaled $12 million the quarter, down about half of the prior year. That work continues to lie down and will be substantially completed later this year. In the second bucket, cost related to the efficiency initiative, we recorded $5 million of cost which were more than offset by a $33 million gain associated in the sale of 4 manufacturing sites and certain products as part of the efficiency initiative during the quarter. Interesting, rather than the gain, I'd like to think about it from a gross cash perspective. Gross pretax cash proceeds from the sales of the sites was $75 million. We have additional assets for sales including a transaction in Taiwan which closed last Friday, and any impact from those sales would further affect cost in this second bucket. 
Finally, we recorded $3 million of cost associated with our ongoing supply network strategy initiative. We're still in the early days of that initiative. We also did record a one-time net tax charge of approximately $35 million in the quarter relating to the nullification of our Belgian tax ruling by the European Commission for periods from 2013 through 2015. 
Now guidance, turning to guidance. There are 4 factors that led us to now and raise our guidance to 2016. First let me cover the easy ones, FX rates. We refreshed our guidance for current FX rates and that was certainly a helper in our guidance. Second, in the first quarter, our International segment was stronger than we had expected and we're confident that strength will carry through the balance of 2016. Third, we're more confident in our expectations for APOQUEL as we put supply issues behind us and have launch plan in place in new markets and they're well underway. And fourth, we reduced our guidance for our 2016 effective tax rate on adjusted income by 100 basis points. This is due to changes in our projected mix of income by jurisdiction as a result of internal restructuring of our international operations. 
If you want to calibrate the various factors, at the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS, we raised guidance by approximately $0.10 a share. I believe that's[indiscernible] 10.5, but it's $0.10 a share for this purpose. Roughly $0.03 comes from FX. Roughly $0.04 comes from stronger operational performance and the reduced tax rate added roughly $0.03. I hope that helps you think about the change in the guidance. 
For 2017, the only change we made at this point are based on changed FX rates. So we'll go through it for '16 and '17. For the full year '16 we now expect revenue between $4.775 billion to $4.875 billion; reported diluted EPS of between $1.41 and $1.56 per share; and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.83 to $1.90 per share. For the full year 2017, we now expect revenue between $5.075 billion to $5.275 billion; reported diluted EPS of between $2.01 to $2.19 per share; and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.24 and $2.38 per share. 
Now to summarize. We enjoyed a diverse product portfolio, global footprint and productive R&D that together enable us to balance fluctuations across different species, therapies and markets and deliver consistent revenue and profit growth over time. We are well down below improving the efficiency of our operating expensed structure leading to improved margins, and we're on track to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% in 2017. With the continued focus on expense efficiency, we expect to deliver operating profit growth faster than the revenue growth. Last but certainly not least, we strive to intelligently allocate our capital and actively manage our capital structure to drive shareholder returns. 
That's it for my prepared remarks. Let me turn it back to Juan Ramón before we get to Q&A."

In the cattle, there are 2 segments, beef and dairy. Let's talk about beef.

We have seen that they increased in placement in feedlots. We also expect that this will continue for the rest of the year, and also, we expect that at the end of the year, the number of cows in beef will be increasing by 2% to 3%. So it's something that even if we have seen some temporary impact in the first quarter, we want also to see this business on a yearly basis, and we are confident that, on a yearly basis, the market will remain very strong. In dairy, what we have seen is the global prices for meat [ph] has been going down. This also resulted in some negative impact in dairy customers. And in some of the cases, we expect they will be reducing the number of dairy cows. Again, so it's a cycle that we have seen also in previous year. After a cycle of low price and reduction of cows, there will be another cycle and lower prices will go up and then we will be rebuilding the herd. So we don't see that is something that is concerning our medium long-term profit for the business. In swine, we reported that we are facing some additional competition for vaccines. It's a similar case that we saw in the past with companion animal. We identify these in companion animal. We have been working to upgrade our vaccines.

It's not affecting in the same way to our industry, and one example. So we have seen in Brazil the GDP is declining, while the GDP for agriculture including the livestock is growing. So again, so it's -- in the animal health industry, I think we cannot extrapolate the market trends which are affecting other sectors to our trends. And our trends are based on population, still continue growing; middle class, which is still increasing; and also the need to improve productivity because the world is being challenged with the need of more food with fewer resources. And companies like Zoetis that's going to bring this type of innovation, we have a significant opportunity for growth. And the same drivers are also impacting our companion animal. More people, more middle class, it's increasing the number of pet adoptions, and also very important, the amount that pet owners are spending there for pet in keeping these animals healthier and to live longer. So we are very confident that the market trends remain positive for the animal health industry. And for Zoetis, we have been targeting to grow in line faster than the market. In the first 3 years, as an independent company, we have been growing faster than the market. In '16 because some one-time impact related to our operational efficiency, the reported growth will be lower. Adjusted by this factor, we expect that we'll be growing in line with faster than the market. The same for '17. We have projected for '17 our growth, in my opinion, it's at the midpoint, it's a faster than the projection of the market. And we have no reason to believe that in the future we'll continue growing in line or faster than the market. So one of the things that are very important is we have already all what is needed to maximize our portfolio. And very important, our R&D investment continue delivering very strong results and we have been continuing bringing in the market your products but also very important, bringing to the market lifecycle innovation which is also helping to protect our future growth.

And when you think about when people talk about anti-infectives or antibiotics, if people look at our portfolio and say, you're a market leader in anti-infectives, I hear and I see this in the news and therefore, you have a lot of revenues at r",526,"Yes, sure. And when you think about when people talk about anti-infectives or antibiotics, if people look at our portfolio and say, you're a market leader in anti-infectives, I hear and I see this in the news and therefore, you have a lot of revenues at risk. And to put in perspective, I think what people are mostly focus on the amount of anti-infectives sales that we have in livestock and not necessarily as concerned whether the anti-infectives have used the treatment of companion animals. So we sold [ph] about $1.3 billion of anti-infectives in the livestock segment, but importantly, first, I want to talk about our company and our outlook, importantly, that $1.3 billion, about $1 billion of than earned a form of high-value injectable products that goes to animals when they are sick, when the alternative is that animal could die and animals around that animal could die. And that's why I would characterize it as a responsible use of the anti-infective, and that is the overwhelming majority of our portfolio is products that fall into that category. And while there continues to be pressure or concern from folks generally about the use of anti-infectives and wanting to use [indiscernible] anti-infectives, what they're mainly focused on is not treating sick animals but really the use of anti-infectives in ways that were, for example, to promote growth. Within our portfolio, about $300 million in balance in livestock, that is mainly anti-infectives that are used in feed and in water. Our work with our customers and our own diligence strongly suggest that those products are being used on what we would call responsible way, in other words, not in some therapeutic bruises to promote growth but to treat sick animals. Even so if I were looking at outside, if I would look at the $300 million that's the piece I got to keep my eye on and that's the piece that I'd be concerned, now back to the overall trends. Our anti-infectives continue to grow but they grow slower than the balance of our portfolio. And just real quick, of course, that's baked into our 2016 expectations, our 2017 expectations, and frankly, it's baked into folks who look at our industry generally about what the long-term growth prospects are for the industry. It's an important part of the industry, and so that's baked into this macro view of our industry able to grow mid-single digits or better for the foreseeable future. I'll continue on because it's a very interesting topic. We pivoted many years ago away from the development of additional anti-infectives to a focus on vaccines because the best way to reduce the use of anti-infectives is to reduce the incidence of disease. That's the best way. Now we've been very successful pivoting our R&D portfolio and now our product portfolio to feature vaccines and will assist producers in maintaining the health of their herd so that they would how to use less anti-infectives. So that's a big area for us. Now we're focusing all of this on livestock segment because I think that's where your question [indiscernible] so I'll stop there. Next question please."

Of course, we continue I think like most companies we focus first on what kind of capital can we allocate within our company to drive incremental revenue and profit growth. That is always going to be very high return activity. So first thing we do is try to max out programs inside that can drive revenue. That falls in a bunch of categories. That could be incremental sales force. That could be investment in DTC advertising to growth markets. It could be incremental investment in R&D to develop new products. It could be incremental CapEx to create a technology platform. So it's all these things, so we do that first. The second piece which I think what you're asking about is outside. So we look outside and what sorts of opportunities do we see. We feel a very consistent smaller deals that we do every single year that none of which I think on an individual basis is going to be exciting to the market at large, but in the aggregate, help us want to feed our R&D effort because we can acquire technologies and things that feed R&D. Second is small [indiscernible] that we just continually do, and yes, that can be anywhere from $40 million to $75 million a year in activity and that's relatively consistent. Next [indiscernible] is sort of midsized M&A. Last year, I guess I put PHARMAQ in that category and maybe even added in that category as well. Last year, we were fortunate enough to close 2 deals. I wish we could do that every year. The challenge is not our desire, would you do this deal? We would do these deals 100 out of 100x if they present themselves. So we are, as you said always love to say, we are interested and ready to do those deals when they present themselves. And we spring-loaded to go after them when they present themselves, but predicting when they're going to be available is a challenge. On the larger scale, M&A really I guess what you think of is potentially transformative, we said many times over, a transaction was one of the top 5 companies are very difficult for reasons of the antitrust. You have to think of this as FTC type issues because there's a lot of concentration now amongst the top, say, 5 companies. So the prospects of that transaction I would say never say never. It's 0 but it will be pretty hard. And then next down the list, there are opportunities there. We continue to look. We're very active. I should say we're very proactive in informing assets that we think will be interesting and valuable to add to our company. But of course, we're not going to disclose what our list of targets might be at any moment in time. And then the last bucket is the one that I think is important. I referenced it in the tail end of my prepared remarks, and that is returning capital to shareholders. As we enter 2017, we have lots of the standup costs, the operational efficiency costs and all those things behind us not just from a P&L perspective but also from [indiscernible] the accruals et cetera, and we put that cash flow behind us, that negative cash flow behind us. And we enter '17, we start to throw off a fair amount of cash. And the question is, if you don't have anything to do with it, what are you going to do? Well, couple of things. One, we have the dividend. It's circa commitment this year of, call it, circa $190 million or thereabouts in 2016. We have a share repurchase program. We are currently repurchasing shares at a rate of 75 million a quarter under a full [indiscernible] that we announced way back in November of '14. And so long-winded, but we intend -- to the extent that we cant deploy capital in our business or outside our business, to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over time. We think that's appropriate. Cash is a [indiscernible] assets to have around but it also dovetails nicely into the discussion of capital structure which we acquired about as well. So we have articulated that we expect to operate in the normal course of business in the range of 2.5 to 3.5x trailing EBITDA for a debt level for our company. Operating in that range will enable us to maintain an investment grade rating -- we believe will enable us to maintain an investment grade rating. And that's important, as you pointed out, I mean the market is taking a different look at leverage levels today than they might have 2 or maybe 3, 2 or 3 years ago, but in cognizant of that. I said, and I get this question a lot, I will restate it, would you ever do a deal that would cause you to be above that range. The answer is yes so we would go above the top end of that range to pursue what we felt was value-generative M&A. Will we go above that range to buy that stock? Probably not. In fact, I'd say definitely not. But we would in the context of making an acquisition. And so we get below 2.5. We probably put some leverage John, we get about the top end of the rate of 35 you would expect to manage that leverage down. The objective is to try to operate in that range and I'll stop there. At the high end of the range, I don't know what it is."

When we eliminate an SKU from the portfolio, if we sell it like as we did, we sold some [indiscernible] as I said in my remarks during the quarter, and we sold the [indiscernible] products. Obviously, that product is gone. When we eliminate an SKU and we stop producing, we may still have inventory we may still sell. So that's why we're seeing them play out over the course of 2016, but let me frame it. Q1, we said the impact of SKU reductions was about 4%. We said we expect it to be about 5%, and this growth versus prior year for the full year which says that during the 9 months, you have Q2, 3 and 4, it will be greater than 5% impact from a growth perspective versus the same period in the prior year. And I further said that it's mostly in Q2 and Q3, so middle part of the year as we sell these products and they're gone. And what you're going to see is a moderation of that in Q4 because we did start to see it impact in Q4 last year. And as we entered 2017, there's still going to be a drag because it's still sold at the beginning -- some of these products beginning of 2016. But if you look at kind of run rate when we enter Q1 of '17, that will be fully reflective of all of those SKUs being one and again impact versus prior year have here in Q2, 3 of this year, moderate in Q4. There's still an impact in Q1 next year and Q2 next year but information is pretty substantially. The key part is we will have this activity behind us entering 2017. Next question please."

With respect to working capital, you pointed back to the day sales of inventory that were on [indiscernible] at the end of the year. We expect that we can have purchased some pretty sizable improvements in our investment in working capital or working capital efficiency. Now with the -- thanks to some higher power, the completion of our SAP implementation where we have every part of our company up on one instance of SAP, we now have the opportunity to activate the tools that will enable us to much more tightly manage our investment inventory while at the same time, having a high service level to our customers. That's not something that is instantaneous. That is something that we've started. And I think I said in public forums before, we expect to make progress against that in 2016. We expect to make much more substantive progress on that in 2017. And that is the focus of our opportunity in being more efficient in working capital. We're pretty good in accounts receivable. As we said, we're good in accounts receivable, and we're also good on accounts payable. So it's really inventory that we're focused on. Expect a modest improvement in 2016 and a more significant improvement beginning in 2017 as we get the tools up that will enable us to better manage our supply chain.

We delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating our steady and predictable growth and confirming the strength of Zoetis as the industry leader in animal health. The diversity of our portfolio in terms of geog",1203,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating our steady and predictable growth and confirming the strength of Zoetis as the industry leader in animal health. The diversity of our portfolio in terms of geographies, species and therapeutic areas as well as our business model continues driving our outperformance. 
In previous years, we have seen different species leading our growth based on changes in market trends and the mix of products in our portfolio. For example, in 2013, our growth was driven largely by swine and poultry products. In 2014, it was driven by cattle and swine, and in 2015, companion animal and cattle led the way. This quarter, the most significant operational growth driver by far has been our portfolio of companion animal, a trend we expect to continue through 2016. 
Our companion animal business is growing, thanks to the increasing sales of APOQUEL, the addition of Abbott Animal Health products, the introduction of new vaccines in Europe and the U.S. and the overall positive performance of the rest of our portfolio. This is important as we experienced softer growth in livestock. 
We continue to invest across our portfolio, and during the first quarter, our R&D investment continued to show many positive results, including the approval of SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide in the U.S., Brazil and Canada. This quarter also marks the completion of our ERP implementation. After nearly 2 years, all our commercial operations, manufacturing plants and support functions are on a single platform, enabling us to achieve greater efficiency. 
Overall, we have been able to accelerate our operational efficiency program with a positive impact in 2016, and we expect to exceed the initial savings target of $300 million by year 2017. I am pleased to say that with the positive momentum in the business and the health of improved foreign exchange rates, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2016 and 2017. 
Coming now to more detail on our first quarter results. Operational revenue growth was 12%, and you can find a slide on our webcast that breaks this down. This reflects 6 extra days in the quarter due to the accounting calendar as well as the negative impact of changes in markets like Venezuela and India and the product SKU rationalization that we communicated last year. Adjusting for these factors, the growth will be 10% operational and 6% excluding the additional impact of recent acquisitions. 
In the quarter, we grew adjusted net income by 28%  operationally, once again growing faster than revenue and helped by the fact that our OpEx increased only 2% operationally compared to the 12% revenue growth. We continue to deliver our long-term value proposition of growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. 
In looking at the overall market, we continue to see the animal health industry performing well despite global economic challenges. We have seen good growth in most markets as greater consumption of proteins and increased medical spending on pets continues to help create customer demand for our products. As always, while I'm very pleased with the quarterly results, I also want to emphasize the need to look at our business on a full year basis to account for some of the seasonal fluctuations and timing patterns in animal health. 
Let me now update you on our new product launches and R&D developments. APOQUEL is showing steady growth. We have continued to launch APOQUEL in additional markets, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and we plan in the coming month to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where it has been approved, including Japan, Brazil and Mexico. And this month, the product will be available to customers without restrictions. In the first quarter, APOQUEL sales were approximately $50 million, an increase of about $40 million from the year-ago quarter. As previously communicated, we expect APOQUEL to generate peak sales of more than $300 million. 
As for SIMPARICA, our new once-monthly chewable tablet for the treatment of fleas and ticks, it has launched in the U.S. and in several European markets. It is early but we are hearing a positive response from our customers, and we expect performance to ramp up in the remainder of the year. We are also developing combinations of the Sarolaner molecule in SIMPARICA with other agents. This would cover a broader spectrum of parasites, including heartworm, and we're seeing Sarolaner as a strong platform for future life cycle innovations. 
Our canine antibody therapy that targets and neutralizes IL-31 to help treat atopic dermatitis in dogs has been introduced to veterinarian dermatologists in the U.S. under a conditional license. And we received another conditional license in Canada in the first quarter. We are hearing very positive customer feedback, and we are gaining market experience with the product. 
We continue to allocate our capital for investments in key commercial activities, R&D programs and business development opportunities that can generate faster revenue growth. For example, vaccines and genetics are 2 areas we are expanding our portfolio as we put greater R&D emphasis around disease prevention. And in the first quarter, we had several positive developments. We received approval of RUI LAN WEN, the second vaccine resulting from our joint Venture in China and the first combination vaccine in China to help protect pigs against certain locally prevalent illnesses. We also gained approval in China for a poultry vaccine to help prevent Marek's disease. 
In the U.S., we have now received licenses from the USDA for a new VANGUARD B oral vaccine and 3 new VANGUARD rapid resp intranasal vaccines. Zoetis is now the first and only manufacturer to offer oral, intranasal and injectable options for vaccinating dogs against Bordetella bronchiseptica. We are also granted a conditional license in the U.S. for an avian influenza vaccine to help prevent diseases caused by the avian influenza virus H5N1. We are participating in a process to supply the USDA with this vaccine for stockpile, should they decide a vaccination strategy is needed. 
We are also seeing progress in genetic tests as our farm animal customers want more information about traits and conditions that can help them build a healthier and more productive herd. During the quarter, in the U.S., we launched CLARIFIDE Plus, the first commercially available genomic test that gives dairy producers a direct way to predict risk factors for costly diseases in Holstein dairy cattle. 
And just last month, in Chile, we launched the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon, the first attenuated live vaccine against SRS. This was a significant R&D achievement by PHARMAQ and a much-needed product to help Chilean fish farmers, great news for the industry and a terrific new opportunity for Zoetis. 
In summary, we are off to a good start for 2016 based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and the continued benefits of our R&D investment. We have been able to accelerate our efficiency program and expect to achieve additional savings target of $300 million by 2017. And finally, with improved foreign exchange currency rates and the positive momentum of the business, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2016 and '17. 
With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?"
215548781,329674508,972372,"Zoetis Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Ramón. I'm going to hit on many of the themes covered by Juan Ramón because they're important to the financial review of the quarter. So let's talk about our first quarter performance. I'll walk you through a number of factors that you s",2158,"Thank you, Juan Ramón. I'm going to hit on many of the themes covered by Juan Ramón because they're important to the financial review of the quarter. So let's talk about our first quarter performance. I'll walk you through a number of factors that you should consider to gauge how we did in Q1. There are some helpful information on the webcast slides and, of course, included in our press release. I'll then hit on a few other highlights in the quarterly results and discuss our updated guidance. 
Before I jump in the quarter, let me say that we know that the U.S. financial markets are quarter-centric and not to nazify [ph] quarterly modelers, but in any quarter, a lot of noise can and does creep into the comparison with the prior year period. In our discussion and our webcast slides, our objective is to try to highlight for you the major elements of the noise in our results so that you can calibrate how our reported performance might influence your thoughts about our future prospects. The most important thing about our first quarter performance is that the results for Q1 supported an improvement to our outlook for the full year 2016. 
So with that background, let me cover 2 important points to enable you to put our 12% operational revenue growth in perspective. First, we operate on a 4-4-5 financial week calendar, with our international operations closing 1 month ahead of the U.S. Yes, this was a carryover from our days as part of Pfizer. Now under our 4-4-5 calendar, every handful of years you'll have a quarter in a year that has as many as 6 extra calendar days in it. That's what we have in Q1 '16 compared with Q1 of '15. Yes, we estimate that the additional days account for approximately 6% of the 12% operational revenue growth for Q1 '16 versus '15. 
Important safety tip for those with quarterly models out there. Our fourth quarter this year will have 5 fewer days than the prior year quarter, and the full year 2016 has 1 more calendar day than 2015, this being a leap year. So that's the extra days. 
Second, our operating efficiency initiative was a drag on our operational revenue growth in the quarter. We estimate that the combination of the eliminated SKUs and the changes to our business models in Venezuela, India and other countries reduced operational revenue growth by some 4%. So you can think about it like this, 12% operational growth for the quarter minus 6% for the extra days plus 4% for the impact of the efficiency initiative. That equates to a normalized growth rate of approximately 10%. Of that 10%, roughly 4% came from acquisitions, including Abbott, PHARMAQ and other smaller transactions. So our organic operational growth in Q1 was circa 6%, and including acquisitions was 10%, so not 12% but pretty good, right? 
Now highlights for the first quarter, very high level. We've now ended what I previously referred to as the golden age of our companion animal business. With a full supply of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA, a refreshed companion animal vaccine line and the conditional license for IL-31, we are positioned to deliver significant growth in our companion animal business in 2016 and beyond. On a normalized basis, organic operational revenue growth, which adjust for the 6 extra days, the impact of the operational efficiency initiative and M&A, we had about 20% growth in companion animal in Q1 compared with Q1 of 2015. And the growth was reasonably consistent between the U.S. and the International segments. 
On the same normalized constant-currency basis, livestock was up 1%, with solid performance in the International segment offset by a decline in the U.S. Q1 of 2015 was a particularly strong quarter in U.S. livestock, and there were a number of other factors that I'll touch on later. Our livestock business both in the U.S. and International segments are healthy and poised to contribute to revenue growth in the remainder of the year. 
Stepping down the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin hit an all-time high of 67.4% in the quarter, a bit above the high end of our full year guidance range. But I'll point out that from a gross margin perspective, many things fell on the favorable side of the line during the quarter: mix, level of scrap, et cetera. Our expectations for gross margin for the full year continue to be in the range of 66% to 67%. 
In operating expenses, total adjusted OpEx grew 2% on an operational basis. But if you remember those extra 6 days, they impact our expenses as well. Our progress in reducing operating costs continues, and we're on track to deliver on the promises of our operational efficiency initiative in 2016 and expect to enter 2017 having taken more than the targeted $300 million of costs out of our company. 
With our gross margin expansion and active efforts to contain operating costs, our 12% reported operational revenue growth translated into 37% operational growth in adjusted operating profit and 35% operational growth in adjusted income before tax. The EC's actions last January were a key driver of the 350 basis point rise in our adjusted effective tax rate to 30.9%, which resulted in our adjusted net income in the quarter rising 28% operationally. 
Our purchase of shares, which began in Q1 of 2015, started in January 2015, helped to reduce our fully diluted share count from 503.2 million in Q1 of '15 to 499.5 million in the current quarter, and that led to operational growth of adjusted diluted EPS of 29%. So that was a very quick walk down our P&L for the quarter. 
Here are a few more contextual details that I believe will help you think about our performance. First, FX. Dare I say that we may have found the bottom of the cycle? Maybe not, but the environment has improved for sure. Foreign exchange had a negative 2 -- 700 basis point impact on our revenue growth in the first quarter compared with Q1 of '15. That's a big hit. But based on current rates, the FX impact on our growth will lessen over the remainder of the year. While we continue to measure our performance on an operational or constant-currency basis, it just feels better when the gap between operational and reported results narrows. 
Next, the SKU reduction and the changes to our business models in countries like Venezuela and India reduced our operational revenue growth by roughly 400 basis points. You should expect the growth drag on the full year to be roughly 500 basis points, so more of a negative factor compared with the prior year for the next 9 months and, particularly, in Q2 and in Q3. Importantly, the impact of the SKU reduction and the changes in business models are felt more in our International segment than in the U.S. and more in livestock than in companion animal. 
Let me step through the elements of the 12% operational revenue growth in Q1. Price accounted for 3% of the growth; APOQUEL volume, another 3%; 4% from acquisitions; 6% from growth of in-line products; and minus 4% from the impact of the SKU reductions and changes to business models in Venezuela, India and other countries. 
Companion animal is the star of the quarter. Revenue growth, normalized for both the 6 extra days and the impact of the efficiency initiatives, increased 20% operationally. APOQUEL was the major driver, but other products contributed as well, including vaccines, as well as the Abbott acquisition. We also expanded U.S. customers' access to a number of our companion animal products through third-party distributors, and that change led to a onetime and semipermanent buildup of their inventories during the quarter to establish their base level. 
In livestock, we have lots of puts and takes. Normalized organic revenue growth was 1% operationally, with the International segment up 5% and the U.S. segment down 9%. First, let's talk about International. France livestock rebounded as anti-infective sales in the quarter were higher when compared with a very light Q1 of 2015, which was caused by new legislation last year. Australia livestock also posted a strong quarter with better weather playing a role. In Brazil, we benefited from above-average price increases and continued favorable conditions in the cattle segment, which were, in part, offset by the negative impact of our SKU reductions. 
In U.S. livestock, a mild winter was a major driver of lower cattle product sales in the quarter. With milder weather, there was less risk of disease incidence, and that impacted our premium products. We also saw a decline in swine products due to increased competition. In summary, after adjusting for the noise, we had a solid quarter from a revenue perspective and, through the ongoing programs to improve efficiency, delivered an improved gross margin, contained operating costs and posted strong growth in profits. 
Switching to restructuring charges. Let me quickly review this quarter's onetime charges related to certain significant items. First, the stand-up costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer, totaled $12 million in the quarter, down about half from the prior year. That work continues to wind down and will be substantially completed later this year. 
In the second bucket, costs related to the efficiency initiative, we recorded $5 million of costs, which were more than offset by a $33 million gain associated with the sale of 4 manufacturing sites and certain products as part of the efficiency initiative during the quarter. Interesting, rather than the gain, I'd like to think about it from a gross cash perspective. Gross pretax cash proceeds from the sale of the sites was $75 million. We have additional assets for sale, including a transaction in Taiwan, which closed last Friday, and any impact from those sales would further affect costs in this second bucket. 
Finally, we recorded $3 million of costs associated with our ongoing supply network strategy initiative. We're still in the early days of that initiative. We also did record a onetime net tax charge of approximately $35 million in the quarter relating to the nullification of our Belgian tax ruling by the European Commission for periods from 2013 through 2015. 
Now guidance -- turning to guidance. There are 4 factors that led us to narrow and raise our guidance for 2016. First, let me cover the easy ones, FX rates. We refreshed our guidance for current FX rates, and that was certainly a helper in our guidance. Second, in the first quarter, our International segment was stronger than we had expected, and we are confident that strength will carry through the balance of 2016. Third, we are more confident in our expectations for APOQUEL as we put supply issues behind us and have launch plans in place for -- in new markets and they're well underway. And fourth, we reduced our guidance for our 2016 effective tax rate on adjusted income by 100 basis points. This is due to changes in our projected mix of income by jurisdiction as a result of internal restructuring of our international operations. 
If you want to calibrate the various factors, at the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS, we raised guidance by approximately $0.10 a share. I'd be remiss if I didn't say it's actually $0.105, but it's $0.10 a share for this purpose. Roughly $0.03 comes from FX, roughly $0.04 comes from stronger operational performance and the reduced tax rate added roughly $0.03. I hope that helps you think about the change in the guidance. 
For 2017, the only change we made at this point are based on changed FX rates. So to go through it for '16 and '17. For the full year '16, we now expect revenue between $4.775 billion to $4.875 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.41 and $1.56 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.83 to $1.90 per share. For the full year 2017, we now expect revenue between $5.075 billion to $5.275 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $2.01 to $2.19 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.24 and $2.38 per share. 
To summarize, we enjoy a diverse product portfolio, a global footprint and productive R&D that together enable us to balance fluctuations across different species, therapies and markets and deliver consistent revenue and profit growth over time. We are well down the road of improving the efficiency of our operating expense structure, leading to improved margins, and we're on track to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% in 2017. With the continued focus on expense efficiency, we expect to deliver operating profit growth faster than the revenue growth. Last but certainly not least, we strive to intelligently allocate our capital and actively manage our capital structure to drive shareholder returns. 
That's it for my prepared remarks. Let me turn it back to Juan Ramón before we get to Q&A."

On new vaccines, we have new vaccines for companion animal, and this has been introduced in Europe as well as in the U.S. I mentioned new vaccines that are in the U.S. covering oral, injectable, intranasal, and I mentioned that this is for specific Bordetella issue -- Bordetella bronchiseptica disease. So this is something that definitely represents a significant upgrade on our portfolio for companion animal in vaccines. We also launched a new vaccine in China. This is for swine. And It's a combination of vaccine for PRRS [ph], with a combination for swine fever in pigs. So another opportunity for increasing our presence in China, and increasing our presence in the swine market in China, that is a significant opportunity for Zoetis."

In the cattle, there are 2 segments, beef and dairy. Let's talk about beef. Beef, we reported that there were probably milder winter conditions that impacted our premium products, but the fundamentals of the beef market, of the cattle are very strong. We have seen that -- the increasing placement in feedlots. We also expect that this will continue for the rest of the year. And also, we expect that, at the end of the year, the number of cows in beef will be increasing by 2% to 3%. So it's something that even if we have seen some temporary impact in the first quarter, we want also to see this business on a yearly basis. And we are confident that, on a yearly basis, the market remain very strong. In dairy, what we have seen is the global prices for milk has been going down. This also resulted in some negative impact in dairy customers. And in some of the cases, we expect that they will be reducing the number of dairy cows. Again -- so it's a cycle that we have seen also in previous years. After a cycle of low price and reduction of cows, there will be another cycle where the prices will go up, and then they will be rebuilding their herd. So we don't see that, that is something that is concerning our medium- and long-term prospects for the business. In swine, we reported that we are facing some additional competition for vaccines. It's a similar case that we saw in the past with companion animal. We identify this need in companion animal. We have been working to upgrade our vaccines. Now our vaccines in companion animal are very strong, and we are doing the same with swine. So we are working to upgrade our swine portfolio for vaccines, and we are confident that this also will bring us the opportunity for growing in the future. We don't expect swine to be a significant driver of growth in 2016. And finally, poultry. Poultry in the U.S., I think, is a positive segment. We expect to generate positive growth in 2016."

We expect, now that, in May, we are opening the market without restrictions, they will be expanding the market not only to chronic but also to acute. In the case of IL-31, IL-31 has been introduced as a conditional license. So what we are doing is to gain experience in the market by doing some activity with dermatologists -- veterinarian dermatologists. This also has the objective of collecting all the data that will support full license in terms of efficacy of the product. But we are convinced that they are 2 products that are -- they are very complementary. And one is oral, the other one is injectable. There are some dogs which are not managing well swallowing pills. This is something that IL-31 will cover. There are also -- not everyone is responding the same way to treatments. So we see that APOQUEL, in some cases, is working very well. IL-31, in some other cases, is also working very well. So the veterinarian will have the option to choose what is the best treatment, depending on specific cases of dogs with atopic dermatitis or with any kind of skin conditions.

So your official guidance for 2016 and 2017 implies strong operational growth in terms of revenue, like mid- to high-single digits. So wondering if we can think about this revenue growth over the longer term, that this will continue to grow in line with the rest of the industry, animal health industry, or at some point, we need to expect some slowdown of this trend. And second somewhat related question is about segments. Do you have more color about the potential long-term growth in different segments of products, antibiotics versus anti -- versus vaccines versus other pharmaceuticals in other segment that you report?"

So we see that the overall market trend maybe is slowing down the growth in some markets. It's not affecting in the same way to our industry. And one example, so we have seen that, in Brazil, the GDP is declining while the GDP for agriculture, including the livestock, is growing. So again -- so it's -- in the animal health industry, I think we cannot extrapolate the market trends which are affecting other sectors to our trends. And our trends are based on population, which still continue growing; middle class, which is still increasing; and also, the need to improve productivity because, well, the world is being challenged with the need of more food with fewer resources. And companies like Zoetis that's going to bring this type of innovation, they have a significant opportunity for growth. And the same drivers are also impacting companion animal. More people, more middle class, this is increasing the number of pet adoptions and also very important, the amount that pet owners are spending per pet in keeping these animals healthier and to live longer. So we are very confident that the market trends remain positive for the animal health industry. And for Zoetis, we have been targeting to grow in line or faster than the market. In the first 3 years as independent company, we have been growing faster than the market. In '16, because of some onetime impact related to our operational efficiency, the reported growth will be lower. Adjusted by this factor, we expect that we'll be growing in line or faster than the market. The same for '17. We have projected for '17 a growth that, in my opinion, it's -- at the midpoint, it's faster than the projection of the market. And we have no reason to believe that in the future we'll continue growing in line or faster than the market. So one of the things that are very important is that we have already all what is needed to maximize our portfolio. And very important, our R&D investment continue delivering very strong results. And we have been -- continued bringing to the market new products, but also very important, bringing to the market life cycle innovation, which is also helping to protect our future growth. And maybe Paul can talk about trends in therapeutic areas, antibiotics, vaccines, things that are part of our efforts to ensure that we have the right balance and the right opportunities for growth."

And when you think about -- when people talk about anti-infectives or antibiotics, people look  at our portfolio and they say, ""Gee, you're a market leader in anti-infectives. I hear this, I see this in the news, and therefore, you have a lot o",546,"Yes, sure. And when you think about -- when people talk about anti-infectives or antibiotics, people look  at our portfolio and they say, ""Gee, you're a market leader in anti-infectives. I hear this, I see this in the news, and therefore, you have a lot of revenues at risk."" And to put it in perspective, I think what people mostly focus on is the amount of anti-infective sales that we have in the -- in livestock. They're not necessarily as concerned where the anti-infectives have been used in the treatment of companion animals. But we have sold about $1.3 billion of anti-infectives in the livestock segment. But importantly -- but first, I'm going to talk about our company and our outlook. Importantly, that $1.3 billion, about $1 billion of that are earned in the form of high-value injectable products that are dosed to animals when they are sick, where the alternative is that animal could die and the animals around that animal could die. And that's what I will characterize as the responsible use of anti-infective, and that is the overwhelming majority of our portfolio, is products that fall into that category. And while there continues to be pressure or concern from folks generally about the use of anti-infectives and wanting to use less anti-infectives, what they're mainly focused on is not treating the sick animals but really the use of anti-infectives in ways that would -- for example, to promote growth. Within our portfolio, about $300 million balance in livestock, that is mainly anti-infectives that are used in feed and in water. Our work with our customers and our own diligence strongly suggest that those products are being used on what we would call responsible way, in other words, not in some therapeutic doses to promote growth but to treat sick animals. Even still, if I were looking as an outsider, I would look at that $300 million as ""That's the piece I got to keep my eye on, and that's the piece I'd be concerned about."" Now back to the overall trends. Our anti-infectives continue to grow, but they grow slower than the balance of our portfolio. And just so -- real quick, of course, that's baked into our 2016 expectations, our 2017 expectations. And frankly, it's baked into folks who look at our industry generally about what the long-term growth prospects are for the industry. It's an important part of the industry, and so that's baked into this -- the macro view of our industry, able to grow mid-single digits or better for the foreseeable future. I'll continue on because, for me, it's a very interesting topic. We pivoted many years ago away from the development of additional anti-infectives to a focus on vaccines because the best way to reduce the use of anti-infectives is to reduce the incidence of disease. That's the best way. We've been very successful pivoting our R&D portfolio and now our product portfolio to feature vaccines that will assist producers in maintaining the health of their herd so that they would have to use less anti-infectives. So that's a big area for us. Now we focus -- I'm focusing all of this on the livestock segment because I think that's where your question lies, so I'll stop there."

215548781,329674508,972372,"Zoetis Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Sure. It's Paul. I'll take that on the capital allocation front. Of course, we continue like -- I think, like most companies, we focus first on what kind of capital can we allocate within our company to drive incremental revenue and profit growth. That is",988,"Sure. It's Paul. I'll take that on the capital allocation front. Of course, we continue like -- I think, like most companies, we focus first on what kind of capital can we allocate within our company to drive incremental revenue and profit growth. That is always going to be very high-return activity. So first thing we do is try to max out programs inside that can drive revenue, and that falls in a bunch of categories. That could be incremental sales force. That could be investment in DTC advertising to growth markets. It could be incremental investment in R&D to develop new products. It could be incremental CapEx to create a technology platform. So it's all those things. So we do that first. The second piece, which I think what you were asking about, is outside. So we look outside and what sorts of opportunities do we see. We see a very consistent flow of what I'll call smaller deals that we do every single year that none of which, I think, on an individual basis, is going to be exciting to the market at large, but in the aggregate, help us, one, feed our R&D effort because we can acquire technologies and things that feed R&D. Second is small add-ons that we just continually do. And yes, that can be anywhere from $40 million to $75 million a year in activity, and it's relatively consistent. Next, it would be sort of the midsized M&A. I think last year -- and I guess I put PHARMAQ in that category and maybe even Abbott in that category as well. Last year, we were fortunate enough to close 2 deals. I wish we could do that every year. The challenge is not our desire. Would you do this deal? We would do those deals 100 out of 100 times if they present themselves. So we are -- as I used to always love to say, we're interested and ready to do those deals when they present themselves. And we are spring-loaded to go after them when they present themselves. But predicting when they are going to be available is the challenge. On the larger-scale M&A really, I guess what you think of as potentially transformative, we've said many times over, a transaction with one of the top 5 companies is very difficult for reasons of antitrust. So they have FT -- I think of it as FTC-type issues because there's a lot of concentration now amongst the top, say, 5 companies. So the prospects for a transaction, I would say -- never say never. It's not 0, but it would be pretty hard. And then next down the list, there are opportunities there. We continue to look. We're very active. I should say we're very proactive in targeting assets that we think would be interesting and valuable to add to our company. But of course, we're not going to disclose what our list of targets might be at any moment in time. And then the last bucket is the one that I think is important, and I referenced it in the tail end of my prepared remarks, and that is returning capital to shareholders. As we enter 2017, we have lots of stand-up costs and the operational efficiency costs and all those things behind us, not just from a P&L perspective but also from paying out the accruals, et cetera. We put that cash flow behind us -- that negative cash flow behind us. And when we enter '17, we start to throw off a fair amount of cash. And the question is, ""Well, gee, if you don't have anything to do with it, what are you going to do?"" Well, a couple of things. One, we have a dividend. It's circa -- a commitment this year of, call it, circa $190 million or thereabouts in 2016. We have a share repurchase program. We are currently repurchasing shares at a rate of $75 million a quarter under a program that we announced way back in November of '14. And so long-winded, but we intend, to the extent that we can't deploy that capital in our business or outside our business, to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over time. We think that's appropriate. Cash is a nonproductive asset for us to have around. But this also dovetails nicely into the discussion of capital structure, which you inquired about as well. So we have articulated that we expect to operate in the normal course of business in the range of 2.5 to 3.5x trailing EBITDA or -- for a debt level for our company. With that -- operating in that range will enable us to maintain an investment-grade rating -- we believe, will enable us to maintain an investment-grade rating. And that's important, as you pointed out. I mean the market is taking a different look at leverage levels today than they might have 2 or maybe 3 or 2 -- 2 or 3 years ago, but we're cognizant of that. I said -- because we get this question a lot, I'll restate it. People say, ""Well, would you ever do a deal that would cause you to be above that range?"" The answer is yes. We would go above the top end of that range to pursue what we felt was value-generative M&A. Would we go above that range to buy back stock? Probably not. In fact, I'll say definitely not. But we would in the context of making an acquisition. And so if we get below 2.5, we'd probably put some leverage on. If we get above or up to the top end of the range at 3.5, you'd expect us to manage that leverage down. The objective is to try to operate in that range, and I'll stop there. [indiscernible] at the high end of the range, I don't know what it is."

It's 2017 guidance. We're 1 quarter into '16. We have a pretty broad range there. You can surmise that our outlook continues to be in that range or we would have adjusted that range.

Let me start with Sarolaner, SIMPARICA now, which we have -- the name in the market is SIMPARICA. And we have no restriction for this product. We have enough product to introduce the product in all markets where the regulatory authorities approved. And this is in the U.S., all EU markets. And we also have operation for Canada and some other countries. So it's something that we don't see any restrictions. So at the time of the launch in the U.S. and also in Europe, there is not anything that we can call loading of the product. On the contrary, so most of the product was related to samples that we provided to the veterinarians to get familiar with the product. So we have not generated significant revenues in the first quarter, but we expect that these revenues will be ramping up during the rest of the year. So we have very good expectation for the product. As I mentioned in some of the other comments, we have very strong publications supporting the efficacy of the product. As I said, this product is working very fast. And also, it's showing that during the duration of the treatment, it's having a very strong efficacy. So it is not dropping efficacy at the last day of the duration of the treatment. On the contrary, it's maintaining the efficacy. And in terms of SKU, I think we have made significant progress on SKUs. So most of the SKUs have been already eliminated from our portfolio, and maybe there are some few SKUs that will be eliminated from now until the third quarter, which are related to SKUs that will be replaced by other products that we are introducing in the market. But the large majority of SKUs has been already eliminated from our portfolio."

So -- and then also important, when we eliminate an SKU from the portfolio, if we sell it like -- as we did, we had -- we've sold some plants,",330,"Let me continue on, on that because I think you asked a question about how it plays out over the course of 2016. So -- and then also important, when we eliminate an SKU from the portfolio, if we sell it like -- as we did, we had -- we've sold some plants, as I said in my remarks, during the quarter, and we sold it with the products. Obviously, that product is gone. When we eliminate an SKU and we stop producing, we may still have inventory, we may still sell. And so that's why you're seeing it play out over the course of 2016. But let me frame it. Q1, we said the impact of SKU reductions was about 4%. We said that we expect it to be about 5%, and this is growth versus prior year for the full year, which says that during the 9 months, Q2, 3 and 4, it will be greater than 5% impact from a growth perspective versus the same period in the prior year. And I further said that it's in Q -- mostly in Q2 and Q3, so middle part of the year, as we sell all these products and they're gone. And what you're going to see is a moderation of that in Q4 because we did start to see impact in Q4 of last year. And as we enter 2017, there's still going to be a drag because we still sold them at the beginning -- some of these products at the beginning of 2016. But if you look at kind of run rate when we enter Q1 of '17, that will be fully reflective of all of those SKUs being gone. And again, impact versus prior year, heavier in Q2, 3 of this year, moderates in Q4. There's still an impact in Q1 next year and Q2 next year, but it diminishes pretty substantially. The key part is we will have this activity behind us entering 2017."

That's just a -- we could not shrink those days in the context of also changing all of our ERP systems, et cetera. So we're working on that, and our goal is to be -- like most other companies, to have our balance sheet on the same day that we report earnings. So just know that, that's a priority for us, and we'll get there. With respect to working capital, you pointed back to the day sales of inventory that were on hand at the end of the year. We expect that we can have some pretty sizable improvements in our investment in working capital or working capital efficiency. Now with the -- thank some higher power, the completion of our SAP implementation where we have every part of our company up on one instance of SAP, we now have the opportunity to activate the tools that will enable us to much more tightly manage our investment in inventory while, at the same time, having a high service level to our customers. That's not something that is instantaneous. That is something that we are -- we've started. And I think I've said in public forums before, we expect to make progress against that in 2016. We'd expect to make much more substantive progress on that in 2017. And that is the focus of our opportunity in being more efficient in working capital. We're pretty good in accounts receivable. I say pretty good -- we're good in accounts receivable, and we're also good in -- on accounts payable. So it's really inventory that we are focused on. Expect a modest improvement in 2016 and more significant improvements beginning in 2017 as we get the tools up that will enable us to better manage our supply chain. Your question regarding the distributor stocking, again, that was in the U.S. That was with respect to some companion animal products to increase. So the amount that went in was approximately $2 million in the quarter, and so it's something that you should take into consideration."

We delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating our steady and predictable growth and confirming the strength of Zoetis as the industry leader in animal health. The diversity of our portfolio in terms of geog",1204,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating our steady and predictable growth and confirming the strength of Zoetis as the industry leader in animal health. The diversity of our portfolio in terms of geographies, species and therapeutic areas as well as our business model continues driving our performance. 
In previous years, we have seen different species leading our growth based on changes in market trends and the mix of products in our portfolio. For example, in 2013, our growth was driven largely by swine and poultry products. In 2014, it was driven by cattle and swine, and in 2015, companion animal and cattle led the way. This quarter, the most significant operational growth driver by far has been our portfolio of companion animal, a trend we expect to continue through 2016. 
Our companion animal business is growing, thanks to the increasing sales of APOQUEL, the addition of Abbott Animal Health products, the introduction of new vaccines in Europe and the U.S. and the overall positive performance of the rest of our portfolio. This is important as we experience softer growth in livestock. 
We continue to invest across our portfolio, and during the first quarter, our R&D investment continued to show many positive results, including the approval of SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide in the U.S., Brazil and Canada. This quarter also marks the completion of our ERP implementation. After nearly 2 years, all our commercial operations, manufacturing plants and support functions are on a single platform, enabling us to achieve greater efficiency. 
Overall, we have been able to accelerate our operational efficiency program with a positive impact in 2016, and we expect to exceed the initial savings target of $300 million by year 2017. I am pleased to say that with the positive momentum in the business and the health of improved foreign exchange rates, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2016 and 2017. 
Coming now to more detail on our first quarter results. Operational revenue growth was 12%, and you can find a slide on our webcast that breaks this down. This reflects 6 extra days in the quarter due to the accounting calendar as well as the negative impact of changes in markets like Venezuela and India and the product SKU rationalization that we communicated last year. Adjusting for these factors, the growth will be 10% operational and 6% excluding the additional impact of recent acquisitions. 
In the quarter, we grew adjusted net income by 28% operationally, once again growing faster than revenue and helped by the fact that our OpEx increased only 2% operationally compared to the 12% revenue growth. We continue to deliver our long-term value proposition of growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. 
In looking at the overall market, we continue to see the animal health industry performing well despite global economic challenges. We have seen good growth in most markets as greater consumption of proteins and increased medical spending on pets continues to help create customer demand for our products. As always, while I'm very pleased with the quarterly results, I also want to emphasize the need to look at our business on a full year basis to account for some of the seasonal fluctuations and timing patterns in animal health. 
Let me now update you on our new product launches and R&D developments. APOQUEL is showing steady growth. We have continued to launch APOQUEL in additional markets, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and we plan in the coming months to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where it has been approved, including Japan, Brazil and Mexico. And this month, the product will be available to customers without restrictions. In the first quarter, APOQUEL sales were approximately $50 million, an increase of about $14 million from the year-ago quarter. As previously communicated, we expect APOQUEL to generate peak sales of more than $300 million. 
As for SIMPARICA, our new once-monthly chewable tablet for the treatment of fleas and ticks, it has launched in the U.S. and in several European markets. It is early but we are hearing a positive response from our customers, and we expect performance to ramp up in the remainder of the year. We are also developing combinations of the Sarolaner molecule in SIMPARICA with other agents. This would cover a broader spectrum of parasites, including heartworm, and we're seeing Sarolaner as a strong platform for future life cycle innovations. 
Our canine antibody therapy that targets and neutralizes IL-31 to help treat atopic dermatitis in dogs has been introduced to veterinarian dermatologists in the U.S. under a conditional license. And we received another conditional license in Canada in the first quarter. We are hearing very positive customer feedback, and we are gaining market experience with the product. 
We continue to allocate our capital for investments in key commercial activities, R&D programs and business development opportunities that can generate faster revenue growth. For example, vaccines and genetics are 2 areas we are expanding our portfolio as we put greater R&D emphasis around disease prevention. And in the first quarter, we had several positive developments. We received approval of RUI LAN WEN, the second vaccine resulting from our joint venture in China and the first combination vaccine in China to help protect pigs against certain locally prevalent illnesses. We also gained approval in China for a poultry vaccine to help prevent Marek's disease. 
In the U.S., we have now received licenses from the USDA for a new VANGUARD B oral vaccine and 3 new VANGUARD rapid resp intranasal vaccines. Zoetis is now the first and only manufacturer to offer oral, intranasal and injectable options for vaccinating dogs against Bordetella bronchiseptica. We were also granted a conditional license in the U.S. for an avian influenza vaccine to help prevent diseases caused by the avian influenza virus H5N1. We are participating in a process to supply the USDA with this vaccine for stockpile, should they decide a vaccination strategy is needed. 
We are also seeing progress in genetic tests as our farm animal customers want more information about traits and conditions that can help them build a healthier and more productive herd. During the quarter, in the U.S., we launched CLARIFIDE Plus, the first commercially available genomic test that gives dairy producers a direct way to predict risk factors for costly diseases in Holstein dairy cattle. 
And just last month, in Chile, we launched the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon, the first attenuated live vaccine against SRS. This was a significant R&D achievement by PHARMAQ and a much-needed product to help Chilean fish farmers, great news for the industry and a terrific new opportunity for Zoetis. 
In summary, we are off to a good start for 2016 based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and the continued benefits of our R&D investment. We have been able to accelerate our efficiency program and expect to achieve an additional savings target of $300 million by 2017. And finally, with improved foreign exchange currency rates and the positive momentum of the business, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2016 and '17.

I'm going to hit on many of the themes covered by Juan Ramón because they're important to the financial review of the quarter. So let's talk about our first quarter performance. I'll walk you through a number of factors that you should consider to gauge how we did in Q1. There's some helpful information on the webcast slides and, of course, included in our press release. I'll then hit on a few other highlights in the quarterly results and discuss our updates to guidance. 
Before I jump in the quarter, let me say that we know that the U.S. financial markets are quarter-centric and not to nausify [ph] quarterly modelers, but in any quarter, a lot of noise can and does creep into the comparison with the prior year period. In our discussion and our webcast slides, our objective is to try to highlight for you the major elements of the noise in our results so that you can calibrate how our reported performance might influence your thoughts about our future prospects. The most important thing about our first quarter performance is that the results for Q1 supported an improvement to our outlook for the full year 2016. 
So with that background, let me cover 2 important points to enable you to put our 12% operational revenue growth in perspective. First, we operate on a 4-4-5 financial week calendar, with our international operations closing 1 month ahead of the U.S. Now, this was a carryover from our days as part of Pfizer. Now under our 4-4-5 calendar, every handful of years you'll have a quarter in a year that has as many as 6 extra calendar days in it. That's what we have in Q1 '16 compared with Q1 of '15. Yes, we estimate that the additional days account for approximately 6% of the 12% operational revenue growth for Q1 '16 versus '15. 
Important safety tip for those with quarterly models out there. Our fourth quarter this year will have 5 fewer days than the prior year quarter, and the full year 2016 has 1 more calendar day than 2015, this being a leap year. So that's the extra days. 
Second, our operating efficiency initiative was a drag on our operational revenue growth in the quarter. We estimate that the combination of the eliminated SKUs and the changes to our business models in Venezuela, India and other countries reduced operational revenue growth by some 4%. So you can think about it like this, 12% operational growth for the quarter minus 6% for the extra days plus 4% for the impact of the efficiency initiative. That equates to a normalized growth rate of approximately 10%. Of that 10%, roughly 4% came from acquisitions, including Abbott, PHARMAQ and other smaller transactions. So our organic operational growth in Q1 was circa 6%, and including acquisitions was 10%, so not 12% but pretty good, right? 
Now highlights for the first quarter, very high level. We've now ended what I previously referred to as the golden age of our companion animal business. With a full supply of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA, a refreshed companion animal vaccine line and the conditional license for IL-31, we are positioned to deliver significant growth in our companion animal business in 2016 and beyond. On a normalized basis, organic operational revenue growth, which adjusts for the 6 extra days, the impact of the operational efficiency initiative and M&A, we had about 20% growth in companion animal in Q1 compared with Q1 of 2015. And the growth was reasonably consistent between the U.S. and the International segments. 
On the same normalized constant-currency basis, livestock was up 1%, with solid performance in the International segment offset by a decline in the U.S. Q1 of 2015 was a particularly strong quarter in U.S. livestock, and there were a number of other factors that I'll touch on later. Our livestock business both in the U.S. and International segments are healthy and poised to contribute to revenue growth in the remainder of the year. 
Stepping down the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin hit an all-time high of 67.4% in the quarter, a bit above the high end of our full year guidance range. But I'll point out that from a gross margin perspective, many things fell on the favorable side of the line during the quarter: mix, level of scrap, et cetera. Our expectations for gross margin for the full year continue to be in the range of 66% to 67%. 
In operating expenses, total adjusted OpEx grew 2% on an operational basis. But if you remember those extra 6 days, they impact our expenses as well. Our progress in reducing operating costs continues, and we're on track to deliver on the promises of our operational efficiency initiative in 2016 and expect to enter 2017 having taken more than the targeted $300 million of costs out of our company. 
With our gross margin expansion and active efforts to contain operating costs, our 12% reported operational revenue growth translated into 37% operational growth in adjusted operating profit and 35% operational growth in adjusted income before tax. The EC's actions last January were a key driver of the 350 basis point rise in our adjusted effective tax rate to 30.9%, which resulted in our adjusted net income in the quarter rising 28% operationally. 
Our purchase of shares, which began in Q1 of 2015, started in January 2015, helped to reduce our fully diluted share count from 503.2 million in Q1 of '15 to 499.5 million in the current quarter, and that led to operational growth of adjusted diluted EPS of 29%. So that was a very quick walk down our P&L for the quarter. 
Here are a few more contextual details that I believe will help you think about our performance. First, FX. Dare I say that we may have found the bottom of the cycle? Maybe not, but the environment has improved for sure. Foreign exchange had a negative 2 -- 700 basis point impact on our revenue growth in the first quarter compared with Q1 of '15. That's a big hit. But based on current rates, the FX impact on our growth will lessen over the remainder of the year. While we continue to measure our performance on an operational or constant-currency basis, it just feels better when the gap between operational and reported results narrows. 
Next, the SKU reduction and the changes to our business models in countries like Venezuela and India reduced our operational revenue growth by roughly 400 basis points. You should expect the growth drag on the full year to be roughly 500 basis points, so more of a negative factor compared with the prior year for the next 9 months and, particularly, in Q2 and in Q3. Importantly, the impact of the SKU reduction and the changes in business models are felt more in our International segment than in the U.S. and more in livestock than in companion animal. 
Let me step through the elements of the 12% operational revenue growth in Q1. Price accounted for 3% of the growth; APOQUEL volume, another 3%; 4% from acquisitions; 6% from growth of in-line products; and minus 4% from the impact of the SKU reductions and changes to business models in Venezuela, India and other countries. 
Companion animal is the star of the quarter. Revenue growth, normalized for both the 6 extra days and the impact of the efficiency initiatives, increased 20% operationally. APOQUEL was the major driver, but other products contributed as well, including vaccines, as well as the Abbott acquisition. We also expanded U.S. customers' access to a number of our companion animal products through third-party distributors, and that change led to a onetime and semipermanent buildup of their inventories during the quarter to establish their base level. 
In livestock, we had lots of puts and takes. Normalized organic revenue growth was 1% operationally, with the International segment up 5% and the U.S. segment down 9%. First, let's talk about International. France livestock rebounded as anti-infective sales in the quarter were higher when compared with a very light Q1 of 2015, which was caused by new legislation last year. Australia livestock also posted a strong quarter, with better weather playing a role. In Brazil, we benefited from above-average price increases and continued favorable conditions in the cattle segment, which were, in part, offset by the negative impact of our SKU reductions. 
In U.S. livestock, a mild winter was a major driver of lower cattle product sales in the quarter. With milder weather, there was less risk of disease incidence, and that impacted our premium products. We also saw a decline in swine products due to increased competition. In summary, after adjusting for the noise, we had a solid quarter from a revenue perspective and, through the ongoing programs to improve efficiency, delivered an improved gross margin, contained operating costs and posted strong growth in profits. 
Switching to restructuring charges. Let me quickly review this quarter's onetime charges related to certain significant items. First, the stand-up costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer, totaled $12 million in the quarter, down about half from the prior year. That work continues to wind down and will be substantially completed later this year. 
In the second bucket, costs related to the efficiency initiative, we recorded $5 million of costs, which were more than offset by a $33 million gain associated with the sale of 4 manufacturing sites and certain products as part of the efficiency initiative during the quarter. Interesting, rather than the gain, I'd like to think about it from a gross cash perspective. Gross pretax cash proceeds from the sale of the sites was $75 million. We have additional assets for sale, including a transaction in Taiwan, which closed last Friday, and any impact from those sales would further affect costs in this second bucket. 
Finally, we recorded $3 million of costs associated with our ongoing supply network strategy initiative. We're still in the early days of that initiative. We also did record a onetime net tax charge of approximately $35 million in the quarter relating to the nullification of our Belgian tax ruling by the European Commission for periods from 2013 through 2015. 
Now guidance -- turning to guidance. There are 4 factors that led us to narrow and raise our guidance for 2016. First, let me cover the easy ones, FX rates. We refreshed our guidance for current FX rates, and that was certainly a helper in our guidance. Second, in the first quarter, our International segment was stronger than we had expected, and we are confident that strength will carry through the balance of 2016. Third, we are more confident in our expectations for APOQUEL as we put supply issues behind us and have launch plans in place for -- in new markets, and they're well under way. And fourth, we reduced our guidance for our 2016 effective tax rate on adjusted income by 100 basis points. This is due to changes in our projected mix of income by jurisdiction as a result of internal restructuring of our international operations. 
If you want to calibrate the various factors, at the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS, we raised guidance by approximately $0.10 a share. I'd be remiss if I didn't say it's actually $0.105, but it's $0.10 a share for this purpose. Roughly $0.03 comes from FX, roughly $0.04 comes from stronger operational performance and the reduced tax rate added roughly $0.03. I hope that helps you think about the change in the guidance. 
For 2017, the only change we made at this point are based on changed FX rates. So to go through it for '16 and '17. For the full year '16, we now expect revenue between $4.775 billion to $4.875 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.41 and $1.56 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.83 to $1.90 per share. For the full year 2017, we now expect revenue between $5.075 billion to $5.275 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $2.01 to $2.19 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.24 and $2.38 per share. 
To summarize, we enjoy a diverse product portfolio, a global footprint and productive R&D that together enable us to balance fluctuations across different species, therapies and markets and deliver consistent revenue and profit growth over time. We are well down the road of improving the efficiency of our operating expense structure, leading to improved margins, and we're on track to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% in 2017. With the continued focus on expense efficiency, we expect to deliver operating profit growth faster than the revenue growth. Last but certainly not least, we strive to intelligently allocate our capital and actively manage our capital structure to drive shareholder returns. 
That's it for my prepared remarks. Let me turn it back to Juan Ramón before we get to Q&A."

So this is something that definitely represents a significant upgrade on our portfolio for companion animal in vaccines. We also launched a new vaccine in China. This is for swine.

In the cattle, there are 2 segments, beef and dairy. Let's talk about beef. Beef, we reported that there were probably milder winter conditions that impacted our premium products, but the fundamentals of the beef market, of the cattle are very strong. We have seen that -- the increasing placement in feedlots. We also expect that this will continue for the rest of the year. And also, we expect that, at the end of the year, the number of cows in beef will be increasing by 2% to 3%. So it's something that even if we have seen some temporary impact in the first quarter, we want also to see this business on a yearly basis. And we are confident that, on a yearly basis, the market remains very strong. In dairy, what we have seen is the global prices for milk has been going down. This also resulted in some negative impact in dairy customers. And in some of the cases, we expect that they will be reducing the number of dairy cows. Again -- so it's a cycle that we have seen also in previous years. After a cycle of low prices and reduction of cows, there will be another cycle where the prices will go up, and then they will be rebuilding their herd. So we don't see that, that is something that is concerning our medium- and long-term prospects for the business. In swine, we reported that we are facing some additional competition for vaccines. It's a similar case that we saw in the past with companion animal. We identify this need in companion animal. We have been working to upgrade our vaccines. Now our vaccines in companion animal are very strong, and we are doing the same with swine. So we are working to upgrade our swine portfolio for vaccines, and we are confident that this also will bring us the opportunity for growing in the future. We don't expect swine to be a significant driver of growth in 2016. And finally, poultry. Poultry in the U.S., I think it's a positive segment. We expect to generate positive growth in 2016."

So wondering if we can think about this revenue growth over the longer term, that this will continue to grow in line with the rest of the industry, animal health industry, or at some point, we need to expect some slowdown of this trend. And second somewhat related question is about segments. Do you have more color about the potential long-term growth in different segments of products, antibiotics versus anti -- versus vaccines versus other pharmaceuticals in other segments that you report?"

So we see that the overall market trends that maybe are slowing down the growth in some markets, it's not affecting in the same way to our industry. And one example, so we have seen that, in Brazil, the GDP is declining while the GDP for agriculture, including the livestock, is growing. So again -- so it's -- in the animal health industry, I think we cannot extrapolate the market trends which are affecting other sectors to our trends. And our trends are based on population, which still continues growing; middle class, which is still increasing; and also, the need to improve productivity because, well, the world is being challenged with the need of more food with fewer resources. And companies like Zoetis that's going to bring this type of innovation, they have a significant opportunity for growth. And the same drivers are also impacting companion animal. More people, more middle class, this is increasing the number of pet adoptions and also very important, the amount that pet owners are spending per pet in keeping these animals healthier and to live longer. So we are very confident that the market trends remain positive for the animal health industry. And for Zoetis, we have been targeting to grow in line or faster than the market. In the first 3 years as independent company, we have been growing faster than the market. In '16, because of some onetime impact related to our operational efficiency, the reported growth will be lower. Adjusted by this factor, we expect that we'll be growing in line or faster than the market. The same for '17. We have projected for '17 a growth that, in my opinion, it's -- at the midpoint, it's faster than the projection of the market. And we have no reason to believe that in the future we'll continue growing in line or faster than the market. So one of the things that are very important is that we have already all what is needed to maximize our portfolio. And very important, our R&D investment continues delivering very strong results. And we have been -- continued bringing to the market new products, but also very important, bringing to the market life cycle innovation, which is also helping to protect our future growth. And maybe Paul can talk about trends in therapeutic areas, antibiotics, vaccines, things that are part of our efforts to ensure that we have the right balance and the right opportunities for growth."

And when you think about -- when people talk about anti-infectives or antibiotics, people look  at our portfolio and they say, ""Gee, you're a market leader in anti-infectives. I hear this, I see this in the news, and therefore, do you have a lot of revenues at risk?"" And to put it in perspective, I think what people mostly focus on is the amount of anti-infective sales that we have in the -- in livestock. They're not necessarily as concerned with the anti-infectives have been used in the treatment of companion animals. But we have sold about $1.3 billion of anti-infectives in the livestock segment. But importantly -- but first, I'm going to talk about our company and our outlook. Importantly, of that $1.3 billion, about $1 billion of that are earned in the form of high-value injectable products that are dosed to animals when they are sick, where the alternative is that animal could die and the animals around that animal could die. And that's what I would characterize as the responsible use of anti-infective, and that is the overwhelming majority of our portfolio, is products that fall into that category. And while there continues to be pressure or concern from folks generally about the use of anti-infectives and wanting to use less anti-infectives, what they're mainly focused on is not treating the sick animals but really the use of anti-infectives in ways that would -- for example, to promote growth. Within our portfolio, about $300 million balance in livestock, that is mainly anti-infectives that are used in feed and in water. Our work with our customers and our own diligence strongly suggests that those products are being used in what we would call responsible way, in other words, not in some therapeutic doses to promote growth but to treat sick animals. Even still, if I were looking as an outsider, I would look at that $300 million as ""That's the piece I got to keep my eye on, and that's the piece I'd be concerned about."" Now back to the overall trends. Our anti-infectives continue to grow, but they grow slower than the balance of our portfolio. And just so we're real clear, of course, that's baked into our 2016 expectations, our 2017 expectations. And frankly, it's baked into folks who look at our industry generally about what the long-term growth prospects are for the industry. It's an important part of the industry, and so that's baked into this -- the macro view of our industry, able to grow mid-single digits or better for the foreseeable future. I'll continue on because it's a very interesting topic. We pivoted many years ago away from the development of additional anti-infectives to a focus on vaccines, because the best way to reduce the use of anti-infectives is to reduce the incidence of disease. That's the best way. We've been very successful pivoting our R&D portfolio and now our product portfolio to feature vaccines that will assist producers in maintaining the health of their herd so that they would have to use less anti-infectives. So that's a big area for us. Now we focus -- we are focusing all of this on the livestock segment because I think that's where your question lies, so I'll stop there."

So the use is quite limited because we are just going to fewer customers in the U.S., mostly veterinarian dermatologists. Some other customers are using the product. And the objective is not really to generate significant revenue growth, but to gain experience on the product and making sure that the product is generating the amount of data that would support a full license.

Of course, we continue like -- I think, like most companies, we focus first on what kind of capital can we allocate within our company to drive incremental revenue and profit growth. That is",989,"Sure. It's Paul. I'll take that on the capital allocation front. Of course, we continue like -- I think, like most companies, we focus first on what kind of capital can we allocate within our company to drive incremental revenue and profit growth. That is always going to be very high-return activity. So first thing we do is try to max out programs inside that can drive revenue, and that falls in a bunch of categories. That could be incremental sales force. It could be investment in DTC advertising to grow markets. It could be incremental investment in R&D to develop new products. It could be incremental CapEx to create a technology platform for us. So it's all those things. So we do that first. The second piece, which I think what you were asking about, is outside. So we look outside and what sorts of opportunities do we see. We see a very consistent flow of what I'll call smaller deals that we do every single year that none of which, I think, on an individual basis, is going to be exciting to the market at large, but in the aggregate, help us, one, feed our R&D effort because we can acquire technologies and things that feed R&D. Second is small add-ons that we just continually do. And yes, that can be anywhere from $40 million to $75 million a year in activity, and it's relatively consistent. Next bucket would be sort of the midsized M&A. I think last year, I don't know, I guess I put PHARMAQ in that category and maybe even Abbott in that category as well. Last year, we were fortunate enough to close 2 deals. I wish we could do that every year. The challenge is not our desire. Would you do this deal? We would do those deals 100 out of 100 times if they present themselves. So we are -- as we used to always love to say, we're tanned, rested and ready to do those deals when they present themselves. And we are spring-loaded to go after them when they present themselves. But predicting when they are going to be available is the challenge. On the larger-scale M&A really, I guess what you think of as potentially transformative, we've said many times over, a transaction with one of the top 5 companies is very difficult for reasons of antitrust. So they have FT -- I think of it as FTC-type issues because there's a lot of concentration now amongst the top, say, 5 companies. So the prospects for a transaction, I would say never say never. It's not 0, but it would be pretty hard. And then next down the list, there are opportunities there. We continue to look. We're very active. I should say we're very proactive in targeting assets that we think would be interesting and valuable to add to our company. But of course, we're not going to disclose what our list of targets might be at any moment in time. And then the last bucket is the one that I think is important, and I referenced it in the tail end of my prepared remarks, and that is returning capital to shareholders. As we enter 2017, we have lots of stand-up costs and the operational efficiency costs and all those things behind us, not just from a P&L perspective but also from paying out the accruals, et cetera. We put that cash flow behind us -- that negative cash flow behind us. And when we enter '17, we start to throw off a fair amount of cash. And the question is, ""Well, gee, if you don't have anything to do with it, what are you going to do?"" Well, a couple of things. One, we have a dividend. It's circa -- a commitment this year of, call it, circa $190 million or thereabouts in 2016. We have a share repurchase program. We are currently repurchasing shares at the rate of $75 million a quarter under a program that we announced way back in November of '14. And so long-winded, but we intend, to the extent that we can't deploy that capital in our business or outside our business, to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over time. We think that's appropriate. Cash is a nonproductive asset for us to have around. But this also dovetails nicely into the discussion of capital structure, which you inquired about as well. So we have articulated that we expect to operate in the normal course of business in the range of 2.5 to 3.5x trailing EBITDA or -- for a debt level for our company. With that -- operating in that range will enable us to maintain an investment-grade rating -- we believe, will enable us to maintain an investment-grade rating. And that's important, as you pointed out. I mean, the market is taking a different look at leverage levels today than they might have 2 or maybe -- 2 or 3 years ago, but we're cognizant of that. I said -- because we get this question a lot, I'll restate it. People say, ""Well, would you ever do a deal that would cause you to be above that range?"" The answer is yes. We would go above the top end of that range to pursue what we felt was value-generative M&A. Would we go above that range to buy back stock? Probably not. In fact, I'll say definitely not. But we would in the context of making an acquisition. And so if we get below 2.5, we'd probably put some leverage on. If we get above or up to the top end of the range at 3.5, you'd expect us to manage that leverage down. The objective is to try to operate in that range, and I'll stop there. I think at the high end of the range, I don't know what it is."

We have enough product to introduce the product in all markets where the regulatory authorities approve. And this is in the U.S., all EU markets. And we also have operations for Canada and some other countries. So it's something that we don't see any restrictions. So at the time of the launch in the U.S. and also in Europe, there is not anything that we can call loading of the product. On the contrary, so most of the product was related to samples that we provided to the veterinarians to get familiar with the product. So we have not generated significant revenues in the first quarter, but we expect that these revenues will be ramping up during the rest of the year. So we have very good expectations for the product. As I mentioned in some of the other comments, we have very strong publications supporting the efficacy of the product. As I said, this product is working very fast. And also, it's showing that during the duration of the treatment, it's having a very strong efficacy. So it is not dropping efficacy at the last day of the duration of the treatment. On the contrary, it's maintaining the efficacy. And in terms of SKU, I think we have made significant progress on SKUs. So most of the SKUs have been already eliminated from our portfolio, and maybe there are some few SKUs that will be eliminated from now until the third quarter, which are related to SKUs that will be replaced by other products that we are introducing in the market.

So -- and then also important, when we eliminate an SKU from the portfolio, if we sell it like -- as we did, we had -- we've sold some plants, as I said in my remarks, during the quarter, and we sold it with the products. Obviously, that product is gone. When we eliminate an SKU and we stop producing, we may still have inventory, we may still sell. And so that's why you're seeing it play out over the course of 2016. But let me frame it. Q1, we said the impact of SKU reductions was about 4%. We said that we expect it to be about 5%, and this is growth versus prior year for the full year, which says that during the 9 months, Q2, 3 and 4, it will be greater than 5% impact from a growth perspective versus the same period in the prior year. And I further said that it's in Q -- mostly in Q2 and Q3, so middle part of the year, as we sell all these products and they're gone. And what you're going to see is a moderation of that in Q4 because we did start to see impact in Q4 of last year. And as we enter 2017, there's still going to be a drag because we still sold them at the beginning -- some of these products at the beginning of 2016. But if you look at the kind of run rate when we enter Q1 of '17, that will be fully reflective of all of those SKUs being gone. And again, impact versus prior year, heavier in Q2, 3 of this year, moderates in Q4. There's still an impact in Q1 next year and Q2 next year, but it diminishes pretty substantially. The key part is we will have this activity behind us entering 2017."

That's just a -- we could not shrink those days in the context of also changing all of our ERP systems, et cetera. So we're working on that, and our goal is to be -- like most other companies, to have our balance sheet on the same day that we report earnings. So just know that, that's a priority for us, and we'll get there. With respect to working capital, you pointed back to the day sales of inventory that were on hand at the end of the year. We expect that we can have some pretty sizable improvements in our investment in working capital, our working capital efficiency. So now with the -- thanks to some higher power, the completion of our SAP implementation where we have every part of our company up on one instance of SAP, we now have the opportunity to activate the tools that will enable us to much more tightly manage our investment in inventory while, at the same time, having a high service level to our customers. That's not something that is instantaneous. That is something that we are -- we've started. And I think I've said in public forums before, we expect to make progress against that in 2016. We'd expect to make much more substantive progress on that in 2017. And that is the focus of our opportunity in being more efficient in working capital. We're pretty good in accounts receivable. I say pretty good -- we're good in accounts receivable, and we're also good in -- on accounts payable. So it's really inventory that we are focused on. Expect a modest improvement in 2016 and more significant improvements beginning in 2017 as we get the tools up that will enable us to better manage our supply chain. Your question regarding the distributor stocking, again, that was in the U.S. That was with respect to some companion animal products to increase. So the amount that went in was approximately $18 million in the quarter, and so it's something that you should take into consideration."

Our performance this quarter, once again, demonstrates why we have confidence in the consistency and predictability of our results and why we are the leader in the animal health care industry. True to our di",1407,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our performance this quarter, once again, demonstrates why we have confidence in the consistency and predictability of our results and why we are the leader in the animal health care industry. 
True to our diverse business model, we continue generating good results from many different sources. Both in the U.S. and international markets and across different species and [indiscernible] carriers. And our portfolio help us deliver steady results over the long term despite some of the economic and market challenges that exist. 
Our R&D investment is maintaining a high level of productivity with new [indiscernible] like SIMPARICA as well as lifecycle innovation and market expansions for key product lines such as DRAXXIN, VANGUARD and VERSICAN Plus. We also combined this internal investment with external pharmacy [indiscernible] we had products like SILEO, the new [indiscernible] version medicine that we are marketing for dogs in the U.S. 
In addition to sales innovation, we are demonstrating our leadership in the animal health industry with a profitability and performance of our operations. We have been executing on the operational efficiency program we announced last year, and we are on track to deliver more than $300 million in savings and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% by the end of 2017. We believe this achievement in efficiency and predictability is unparalleled in the animal health industry. 
Looking more closely at our second quarter results. Operational revenue was up 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As you will recall, every year, our revenue loss and forecast will continue to reflect the impact from changes related to the operational efficiency program we put in place in 2015. Those SKU rationalization and business changes in countries like Venezuela and India continue to partially offset more significant gains in our core business. Excluding these impacts and the impact of acquisitions, our normalized organic operational growth would be 9%. And on the same basis, our companion animal program grew 15%, 1-5, and our livestock products grew 5%. Paul will provide more details from [indiscernible] reported to normalized organic operational growth in his remarks. 
The growth in companion animal was based on strong performance by APOQUEL as well as our recently launched vaccines and SIMPARICA. In livestock, we saw growth coming from a recovery of cattle business in the U.S. [indiscernible] positive performance for the International segment was offset by a decline in the U.S. And importantly, we declined globally due to market conditions and pressure from competition. We are improving our cost of sales and gross margin as we refine our manufacturing and network, execute our efficiency plan and focus on continuous improvement. 
On an operational basis, our adjusted operating expenses was flat in the second quarter even as we grew revenues significantly, thanks to the ownership and mindset of our products and expense management discipline. 
The growth in revenues, growth margin improvement and discipline in expenses result in an adjusted net income growth of 22% operationally, once again, supporting our long-term and value proposition to grow adjusted net income [indiscernible] 
We always emphasize the full year review of our business to account for some of the seasonal situation and timing patterns in animal health. And we continue to see good progress throughout the lens. We're increasing our guidance for 2016 based on our strong performance in the first half of the year, the continued strength of our business model and the confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year. Paul will go through updates on our 2016 guidance in his remarks. 
Now let me turn to the innovation investment that are fueling our performance this year and positioning us well for the future value creation. At the beginning of the year, I said we needed to execute flawlessly on our new product launches, and I'm very pleased with our progress. In the case of APOQUEL, it has become a very positive story. For the first half of 2016, we have exceeded $100 million in revenue. And since May, we have been supplying APOQUEL with no restrictions. Recently, we have launched in additional markets such as Brazil, Japan, Mexico and Russia. And in the coming months, we plan to introduce APOQUEL in the rest of the approved markets such as Colombia, Peru, Uruguay as well as Singapore and Hong Kong. 
SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide for dogs, is now available to customers in the U.S. and most of the European countries, and we expect it to be further deployed in Canada, Brazil and New Zealand during 2016. We are pleased with the launch of SIMPARICA despite being the most recent entrant in a very competitive oral flea and tick market for dogs. At launch, SIMPARICA was introduced with extensive public data showing its rapid onset of action, its sustained persistence of protection against fleas and ticks and other advantages over various oral and topical parasiticides on the market. 
While new products have been a big lift for us recently, we continue to build on our established product lines and focus on the lifecycle innovation that will keep our portfolio strong and sustainable. One of the strength of our R&D rotation is the ability to innovate across the basis of health care that veterinarians encounter -- faces that include prediction, prevention and treatment. Our R&D begins with an understanding of the biology of the diseases, their pathways and how they work. Then we complement with [indiscernible] that come from our commercial teams working shoulder to shoulder with veterinarians and producers. And we operationalize this knowledge across the face of health care. 
We use innovations in genetics, diagnostics, and increasingly, digital platforms to help predict risk or detect diseases in species. This means the ability to breed healthier and more productive animals, to detect disease earlier and to develop practices in bioinformatics and applications that capitalize on the use of big data. 
In the second quarter, for example, we continue to expand our business diagnostic franchise into new markets with an additional approval in Spain for livestock [indiscernible] This point-of-care [indiscernible] deliver accurate, fast and clear results that give our customers, family informed diagnosis without disrupting their clinical consultation. 
Our customers are also seeking for new solutions to get ahead and help prevent infectious diseases. We have been placing a greater emphasis on our vaccine portfolio, some of which we introduced last year and others that we'll continue to expand in terms of approvals and geographies. For example, in the second quarter, we expanded our VERSICAN Plus and VANGUARD vaccine franchises with new approvals in Europe and Canada. VERSICAN Plus, a combination vaccine that protects dogs against 10 canine diseases, was first approved in European Union in 2014. And this quarter, we received additional approval in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands for a smaller combination of the vaccine. Additionally, VERSICAN Plus rabies achieved approval for a new claim in the European Union 3 years' duration of immunity. Meanwhile, VANGUARD B Oral and VANGUARD crLyme vaccines were approved in Canada after having just received their U.S. approval in December 2015. 
And finally, across the faces of health care, we develop medicines to treat sick animals. Vaccine, one of the Zoetis' largest global product lines and was first introduced in 2016, and this quarter, we received approval of a new label [indiscernible] in Europe for DRAXXIN and DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective oral treatment in swine respiratory disease. 
In addition to our internal R&D, we also look for a target that can help grow and strengthen our product portfolio. For example, in May, Zoetis launched in the U.S. a program called SILEO under an exclusive agreement with Orion Corporation. SILEO is the first and the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of noise aversion in dogs. And here in the U.S., this Fourth of July, you probably read about or heard about this exciting new product that brought hope to many dog owners. 
In summary, we have continued our positive momentum through the first half of the year based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and dedicated Zoetis colleagues. We continue to read the benefit of a productive, world-class R&D organization focused on new programs and lifecycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. And we are executing on key product launches and our operational efficiency program to ensure our long-term growth and value creation. 
With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?"

Another solid quarter with lots of good things to cover, so let's get to it, starting with a quick walk down the P&L for the quarter. And then I'll provide some commentary on the number of areas that I believe will be helpful in understanding our quarter, our first half 2016 and what you might expect for the balance of 2016. 
Before I start, I want to point out that the SKU rationalization and changes in business models we made in several international countries continue to have an impact on our revenue in 2016 and growth in revenue for 2016 compared with 2015. 
Now first, we're confident on the steps that we took and are taking to improve efficiency will put so what is in a position to deliver higher profits and cash flows and and to grow those profits and cash flow from here forward. 
Second, while we're going through this transition, we believe it's important that we and you have visibility into how the go-forward portion of our business is performing. So we prepared analyses that strip the eliminated SKUs out of our revenue to show the underlying growth of the go-forward business. And on our website, you'll see slides and you'll find the table -- or tables, rather, that show our reported revenue growth for the second quarter and for the first half of 2016 and then walk you through the impacts of foreign currency, the operational efficiency changes related to SKUs and other business model changes, recent M&A. And then the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first [ph] quarter relative to the prior year. 
The objective here is not to divert attention from our reported revenue growth rates to provide perspective on how you might think about our future growth prospects in our 2D state. While we use the phrase operational growth, that means excluding the impact of changes in FX rates versus the same period the prior year. When we say normalized organic growth for any period compared with the prior year period, that means excluding the impact of FX, the eliminated SKUs, the business changes outside the U.S., the extra days in the first quarter of the year and the impact of recent M&A. 
So with that lengthy preamble, let's talk about the quarter. 
Revenue grew 6% on an operational constant-currency basis. We posted adjusted gross margin of 67.9% in the quarter, resulting in adjusted gross profit growing faster than revenue, up 11% on an operational basis. Adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis, reflecting the great progress we've made in our efficiency initiative. As Juan Ramón said, we're on track to deliver more than the previously announced $300 million savings associated with the efficiency initiative, and those savings are considered in our guidance for 2017. 
The combination of 11% operational growth of adjusted gross profit and the flat adjusted operating expenses enabled us to grow adjusted EBIT for the quarter by 25% on an operational basis. Below the operating line, we had higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate on adjusted income, which together reduced the operational growth rate of adjusted net income to 22%. We put adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 on the board for the quarter. And the strong performance in the first half of the year enabled us to increase our guidance for the full year 2016 by 3% -- excuse me, $0.03 per share across the range. A solid quarter and a solid first half of the year, for sure. 
So a bit deeper dive on revenue. [indiscernible] reported geographically was the U.S., up 10% and by global business, it was companion animal, up 13% in both of those on an operational basis. Of course, APOQUEL was an important driver of both. APOQUEL sales in the quarter were roughly $60 million. APOQUEL has a lot of revenue growth still ahead. And with SIMPARICA and a number of other recently introduced companion animal products, we expect our companion animal business to drive above market revenue growth through 2017. 
Our international segment was up 2% operationally and the global livestock business grew about 1% operationally, both were disproportionately impacted by our SKU reductions and the changes we made to our operating models in countries, including Venezuela and India. On the flip side, global livestock is benefiting from M&A, mostly [indiscernible] 
Now let's talk about the components of our operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. APOQUEL accounted for 3% of that growth. New products other than APOQUEL, including our new companion animal vaccines, SIMPARICA, [indiscernible] 1 and SILEO, to name a few, added 2%. In-line products added 4% with 3% coming from increased prices and 1% from volume. And M&A accounted for another 2%. The impact of the SKU reduction and the changes in business models reduced our growth by some 500 basis points. And that gets you to the 6% operational revenue growth for the quarter. Pretty good, right? 
Once again, our revenue growth came from a number of sources and reflects the strength of our diverse business model. 
Let's turn to our 2 segments: U.S. and International. Starting with the U.S. Overall the U.S. business was up 10% in the quarter. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. grew 11% in the quarter. U.S. companion animals business was up 17%, mainly through the ramp of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA and the introduction of other new products. Half of the growth was driven by the ramp of APOQUEL. U.S. livestock grew 2% with a 4% pickup from increased selling prices that were offset in part by volume decreases related to some of the SKU reductions. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. livestock business delivered growth of 5% compared with 9% decline in Q1 of this year. The business rebounded nicely in Q2, and the year-to-date normalized organic growth rate for the U.S. livestock business was negative 3%. After the first quarter, there was some concern out there about the health of our U.S. livestock business. For the [indiscernible] we expect our U.S. livestock business to deliver growth for the full year 2016 on a normalized organic basis. Within U.S. livestock, cattle, especially big cattle, was particularly strong as the [indiscernible] were increasing and drove higher demand for our high-value injectable, anti-infectives, vaccines and parasiticides and the recently launched [indiscernible] 1 implants. U.S. swine products experienced a decline due to competition for such therapy vaccines, new restrictions on the use of our products for pork exports to China, a decline of PEDD revenue as the disease is no longer prevalent and some eliminated SKUs. U.S. poultry revenue declined in the quarter with the impact of SKU rationalization more than offsetting growth from the increased use of our health maintenance products and MSAs for antibiotic-free production products like Zoamix, for example. 
Onto the international segment. Revenue from our International segment was up 2% operationally. On a normalized organic basis, the growth rate was 7%. On the same normalized organic basis, the International companion animal business led the way, up 10%, while International livestock was up 5% in the quarter. Again, both of those are on a normalized organic basis. 
It's worth spotlighting a few countries for you. China was up $14 million or 49% operationally. Pork prices in China were relatively high leading to favorable conditions for pork producers and for our swine portfolio, including products like DRAXXIN, Exceed and our vaccines. About 1/3 of the growth in China was driven by products purchased by producers that stock up ahead of label changes for some of our products. 
Finally, we had very successful spring promotions that drove increased sales of our Revolution and Vector Max product in China. In Brazil, cattle and companion animal sales were strong, but partially offset by weakness in poultry. The cattle portion of our livestock in Brazil enjoyed favorable market conditions, leading to strong performance from our vaccines and parasiticides. We also saw increased adoption of [indiscernible] in the swine business. 
Across the portfolio, we also benefited from increased selling prices. The poultry business saw high input prices and increased restrictions on exportation to Japan that made for challenging market for poultry producers and saw a [indiscernible] few accounts based on price. For the quarter, Brazil grew 6% operationally. Australia posted a solid 10% operational growth for the quarter, led by launch of APOQUEL, the success of a promotional campaign for Revolution and sales of anti-infectives for cattle. 
On the negative side of the growth ledger, in the U.K., we saw sales decline 21% operationally. The biggest factor in nearly half the decline was due to weather. A wet winter and spring delayed the cattle sheep turnout season, and that was a factor. The second quarter was also negatively impacted as we were in the process of shifting the acquired Abbott products to our distribution. And we saw the channel accelerate purchases into Q1 and work off the inventory in Q2. Year-to-date, the U.K. business is up 3% operationally. Finally, the group in other emerging countries declined 5% operationally, with the biggest drag being Venezuela and the SKU reductions. We saw growth across most of the countries in this grouping, including through the additional of PHARMAQ revenue in Chile. 
So on revenue, high level, the beat goes on. Growth from many sources in a diversified models enables us to overcome softness in parts of our business with strength in other areas. 
Now let shift to the rest of the P&L. We posted a high gross margin, 67.9% in the second quarter. But before we all start high-fiving each other, let's look at the factors that led to the 250 basis based point improvement over the prior year quarter. Of the improvement, roughly 1/3 came from price increases. 1/3 from the mix shift toward a high-margin companion animal products and 1/3 came from other areas, mostly improvements in our supply chain efficiency. These 3 net positives experienced a bit of a headwind due to unfavorable movement of foreign currency. 
Our gross margin is improving, but it's not a one-way ratchet. There's some seasonal elements that we expect to come in to play in the second half of 2016. For example, sales of our livestock products are great as a percentage of total revenue in the second half of the year and pricing promotions heading into the fall can lessen our net selling prices and thereby reduce gross margins in the period. These factors are expected to result in our reporting lower gross margins in the second half of the year as compared with the first half. And finally, there's, of course, FX. Predicting the timing and magnitude of the FX changes on the cost of goods sold and on gross margin in short periods is very difficult. So that's a lot of discussion designed to caution you about assuming that our guidance for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue for 2016 and 2017 are conservative. 
There's good news here. We fully expect our gross margins to continue to improve over time based on increased selling prices, increased sales from our companion animal products versus livestock and increased efficiency in our supply chain. But the upper journey will not be linear quarter-to-quarter. 
Turning to adjusted operating expenses. There's really not a lot to say except that we're on track to take out more than our target of $300 million operating cost by year-end. So we entered 2017 in our new leaned-out state. Total adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis when compared to Q2 of '15. Note that our operating expense base is not static. We've added costs, selling, marketing and R&D to the base via the PHARMAQ acquisition and to support the launch of SIMPARICA. And we may consider investing in promotion of certain key products or incremental R&D. The purpose of efficiency initiative was to eliminate nonproductive expenditures, not to ignore high-value investments we can make in our business. At this stage, our 2D operating expense structure is what you see in our 2017 guidance table. We continue to demonstrate excellent expense discipline to the second quarter. And that, combined with the gross margin improvement [indiscernible] operational growth adjusted EBITDA 25% for the quarter. Below the operating line, we had increased interest expense due to the notes issuance in Q4 that's funded the PHARMAQ acquisition and prefunded the $400 million of debt that matured in the first quarter of the year. In our effective tax rate on adjusted income increased by some 100 basis points, mostly due to the change in our tax status in Belgium. Bottom line, our adjusted net income grew operationally 22% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% operationally, about 100 basis points faster than adjusted net income. That's our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 '16 or almost 1% less than in Q2 of '15. 
Couple of additional factors. [indiscernible] think about for the balance of 2016 and into '17. First, as always, FX. While there's been a bit of volatility in FX rates recently, notably with the British pound and the euro, the FX impact on the balance of our year and into 2017 is little change from our last guidance update. The overall impact on our future expectations for our international operations, based on FX rates in late July, are negligible. That said, FX rates have a negative impact on our reported revenue profit rate, decreasing revenue growth in Q2 by some 300 basis points compared with Q2 of '15 and adjusted net income growth by some 800 basis points. Contrast that with the 700 [ph] basis point drag on reported revenue growth in Q1 and a 1,300 basis point drag on adjusted net income in Q1. 
So as we'd hoped on the last call, the impact of FX rates on reported growth is moderating. Regardless, we continue to measure ourselves on a constant-currency or operational basis. 
Next, the SKU reductions, including the changes we made to our business models in places like Venezuela and India. And as we communicated in our last call, we expect the SKU reductions and business changes to decrease revenue growth by some 500 basis points for the full year 2016. In Q1, the impact was roughly 400 basis points. In Q2, it was roughly 500 basis points. And year-to-date, it was roughly 500 basis point. I point out just a little bit of rounding in there. 
You can see the impact of the SKU reductions and business model changes on the revenue growth in the charts that are on our website that I mentioned earlier. And I'd call your attention because I think they're helpful. 
On to onetime costs. I won't use this time to walk to the table in the press release, but I want to call your attention to [indiscernible] expense item from the reversal of a portion of our severance accrual. At the time we recorded the accrual, we based it on the best information available. As it's worked out, we expect to pay out a little bit less severance than we had we thought, mainly due to a greater level of voluntary attrition than expected. From a cash-out [indiscernible] perspective, that's a good thing for us. For the avoidance of doubt, the reversal did not increase our adjusted net income, but it did increase our reported GAAP net income in the quarter and was a factor in narrowing the gap between adjusted earnings and generally accepted accounting principle earnings. 
Finally, guidance. Today, we're updating our guidance for the full year 2016 for a couple of things. We've increase our revenue guidance range by $25 million to reflect the strength of our business and our improved visibility now that we're through the first half of 2016. And we moved our expectations for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue from a range of 33% to 34% to approximately 33%. So the favorable end of the range. Adjusted EBIT projections have improved in a similar fashion. So that's been updated, too. We also updated our onetime cost to reflect the lower expectations for the severance point I just talked about. All other categories remain the same, and it resulted that we've raised our guidance range for 2016 to adjusted earnings per share by $0.03 to the range of $1.86 to $1.93 per share. Note that the operational growth rate for adjusted net income implied by our guidance increased by 100 basis points is now a range of 10% to 14%. The majority of the increase in our guidance is operational, not FX-related. 
Now we can all do the math into what our guidance implies for the second half of the year for adjusted net income per share, and you may think that outlook is anomalous, given the second half revenue is expected to exceed revenue in the first half of the year. 
There are a couple of observations about the phasing of our business in 2016. First, we do expect second half revenues to exceed the first half. That's a good start. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are expected to generate lower gross margins in the second half of the year than seen in the first half due to mix and promotional programs reducing net selling prices and therefore gross margin. Next, a major promotional spending and operating expenses in support of our various product franchises are more weighted to the back half of the year. And finally, our R&D spending also skews to the second half of the year. Generally, the benefits of the increased sales expected in the second half of the year compared with the first may be more than offset by reduced gross margins in the phasing of spending on promotion programs -- promotional programs in R&D. 
So you all know I don't like to talk about quarters. But here are a couple of tips for phasing Q3 and Q4 of '16. We expect Q4 to be our highest revenue quarter. We expect gross margin in the second half to be below those in Q1 and Q2. Selling expenses are expected to be heavier in the second half of the year, particularly heavy in Q4. And R&D spending in the second half is expected to be higher than in the first half and heaviest in Q4. From adjusted net income perspective, Q3 may be the low quarter for the year. 
What's most important is that we raised our full year 2016 guidance of revenue by $25 million and adjusted earnings per share by $0.03. This is all good stuff. Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. We expect a more detail looked at 2017 at the time we report our third [ph] quarter. 
That's it for me. Keith, let's go ahead and queue up to Q&A."

Let's start with cattle, and let's start with the cattle in the U.S. cattle in the U.S. have 2 different segments, beef and dairy. In beef, we've seen that the number of animals, it's larger than previous years by 3%. In the second quarter also, we saw that the number of placement in the feedlots increased by 5%. On the total year, we expect that the number of animals will be about 3% higher than 2015. And also, the placements on the feedlot, even in the second half, will be lower than in the second quarter. We expect also to grow by about 3%. With all these, we expect that the cattle business for beef in the U.S. will be positive. We have seen also improvement in Australia because of the weather conditions. We have seen also that the fundamentals of the Brazilian remains very strong, with even increasing exportations. So in our opinion, the cattle business for beef will be positive for the year. Dairy. Prices are having a negative impact in the profitability of farmers around the world. In the U.S., we expect that the business will not be -- revenues coming from dairy will not be a significant driver of growth. Although we've seen also that, so far, farmers are not reducing the number of animals, so which is also a good indication that they also expect improvement in pricing, pricing in the second half or first half of 2017. Swine. And for us, as we said in the International business, it's doing extremely well. We expect this trend to continue in the second half. In the U.S., we are facing some competitive challenge that we also expect to start solving in the fourth and first quarter of 2017. And poultry is the area where we expect probably less positive evolution of our portfolio. But in general, we expect that livestock at the end of the year will be showing a positive growth."

So the first thing, almost 3 years ago or 4.5 years after we made this projection, we are confirming that, in 2017, we'll be improving or reaching that 34% EBITDA margin. And moving from at that time, 25% as it was projected for the end of 2014 to 34%. It's a significant improvement. And I think it's probably a confirmation of the predictability and sustainability of our business. I think there are not too many companies that after 3 years they can maintain what I consider was an aggressive target of improving our margins by 900 basis points. Now I will turn to Paul to provide some additional comments."

And I want to be real clear, why -- one, why did we provide long-term guidance? So we provided that because we knew the steps that we were about to embark on would include the SKU rationalization, the change in business models outside the U.S.",466,"Yes, sure. And I want to be real clear, why -- one, why did we provide long-term guidance? So we provided that because we knew the steps that we were about to embark on would include the SKU rationalization, the change in business models outside the U.S. and a pretty substantial change in our OpEx base. In light of that outside parties trying to forecast what we would look like in '16 and then in '17, you would have had no chance to really be able to be somewhat accurate, and so we felt compelled to provide longer-term guidance to let people, through their own models, whether they were in the neighborhood of what we were thinking, or yes, they had differences of opinion. I think that was a onetime event. We, like most other companies, are reverting to having just -- or we'll revert to having just 1 year worth of guidance, yes, on the streets. So we'll provide the update, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for '17 later this year. And then we'll have 2017 on the board. But I really want to focus on -- a comment, Vlad, that you made on the 34% kind of operating EBIT margin -- or excuse me, adjusted EBIT margin target that you referenced because I really want to be really, really clear. We're not targeting a maximum operating margin. We're seeking to maximize our cash flow and grow it at a fast rate. If that's a 33% margin, that's okay. If that's at a 36% margin, yes, that's okay, too. But it's not focus -- focusing solely on what is that margin, unless maximize that margin. We're looking at maximizing earnings as a proxy for cash flow and then growing it as quickly and for as long as we can at an attractive rate. Now separately, I believe you asked about -- what is there an upper limit? One of the advantages of our company is that we have a wonderful, global footprint where we have the scale to support that global footprint and generally, not completely, but generally, we have the ability to drive a lot more revenue on the infrastructure that we have deployed around the globe. So the answer is, yes, we have the ability to continue to leverage our cost structure and thereby improve that operating margin. But what I don't want people to do is to focus on it and say a 33 or 35 -- and look at that, well, gee, that's less than I thought. The goal is not limited to drive that percentage. It's to maximize profit, cash flow, growth and grow it fast and grow it for a long time. So I've rambled a little bit there, but I hope that I covered your question."

And we wanted to make sure that while we were transitioning to a different model, a more efficient model, we were ensuring that compliance of any type of finance, tax or IT element, so -- but we have no doubt that by the end of the year, all the programs will be in place and we'll start 2017 with a new base. In terms of SKUs, I said most of the work had been completed. And there are only some SKUs that we'll be eliminating from now until the end of the year. And this will be also with the introduction of new product that also will help us to minimize the negative impact of this last SKU rationalization. The other area that is still work in progress, but also progressing in line with expectations, it's the manufacturing changes. We exit the 7 plants that we targeted. There is 1 plant that is still in progress, but 5 has been sold, 1 has been exited and the other 1 is in process. So in that area, things are progressing very well. There is some structural changes also in manufacturing that are work in progress. So again, so we plan to finalize this work by the end of the year and start 2017 with fully implemented plans for the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015."

And we have 3 buckets in our R&D expenses. One is related to regulatory expenses. About 15%, 1-5. And then the other 85% is split between new product innovation and lifecycle innovation. So we are investing significantly to keep our current portfolio updated and competitive. So how much are we generating in terms of growth in line compared to new products and price? So we described that the animal health industry will be growing at 5% to 6% in the next coming years. About half of this 5% to 6% will be related to price. And then in-line, we'll have half of the growth. And [indiscernible] will have half of the remaining growth. The ability of Zoetis and other companies to grow faster than this 5% to 6% will come from new products. So in 2016, excluding the impact of SKU rationalization in the second quarter, this organic operational growth -- normalized organic operational growth is 9%. So how much came from price? It was about 3% from price. New products also generated a significant part of this growth. And in-line portfolio it was growing volume by 1%.

IL-31, being a product which is injectable, maybe we will position more in chronic than acute, but still will be opportunities for both indications. And the -- as I said, in terms of efficacy, greater response from the veterinarians, mainly the pathologists and some experienced veterinarians. And also great on safety. So I think all indications are very positive to IL-31 and this will be, as I said, very complementary to our atopic dermatitis franchise, dermatologic itching conditions. And we are very pleased with what we're doing. Last comment on SIMPARICA. So we use SIMPARICA as a platform.

Our performance this quarter, once again, demonstrates why we have confidence in the consistency and predictability of our results and why we are the leader in the animal health care industry. 
True to our diverse business model, we continue generating good results from many different sources, both in the U.S. and international markets, and across different species and therapeutic areas. And our portfolio help us deliver steady results over the long term, despite some of economic and market challenges that exist. 
Our R&D investment is maintaining a high level of productivity. With new products, like SIMPARICA, as well as life-cycle innovation and market expansions for key product lines, such as DRAXXIN, VANGUARD and VERSICAN Plus. We also combine this internal investment with the external finance [indiscernible]  opportunities. We had products like SILEO, the new noise aversion medicine that we are marketing for dogs in the U.S. 
In addition to sales innovation, we are demonstrating our leadership in the animal health industry, with the profitability and performance of our operations. We have been executing on the operational efficiency program we announced last year, and we are on track to deliver more than $300 million in savings and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% by the end of 2017. We believe this achievement in efficiency and predictability is unparalleled in the animal health industry. 
Looking more closely at our second quarter results. Operational revenue was up 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As you will recall, this year, our revenue growth and forecast will continue to reflect the impact from changes related to the operational efficiency program we put in place in 2015. Those SKU rationalization and business changes in countries like Venezuela and India continue to partially offset more significant gains in our core business. Excluding these impacts and the impact of acquisitions, our normalized organic operational growth would be 9%. And on the same basis, our companion animal program grew 15%, 1-5, and our livestock products grew 5%. Paul will provide more details on the breach from reported to normalized organic operational growth, in his remarks. 
The growth in companion animal was based on strong performance by APOQUEL as well as our recently launched vaccines and SIMPARICA. 
In livestock, we saw growth coming from a recovery of cattle business in the U.S. In swine, the positive performance from the International segment was offset by a decline in the U.S. And importantly, we declined globally due to market conditions and pressure from competition. We are improving our cost of sales and gross margin as we refine our manufacturing and network, execute our efficiency plan and focus on continuous improvement.
On an operational basis, our adjusted operating expenses was flat in the second quarter even as we grew revenues significantly, thanks to the ownership and mindset of our products and expense management discipline. 
The growth in revenues. Growth margin improvement and discipline on expenses resulted in adjusted net income growth of 22% operationally, once again supporting our long-term and value proposition to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue.
We always emphasize a full year view of our business to account for some of the seasonal situations and timing patterns in animal health, and we continue to see good progress throughout that lens. We're increasing our guidance for 2016 based on our strong performance in the first half of the year, the continued strength of our business model and the confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year. Paul will go through update to 2016 guidance in his remarks. 
Now let me turn to the innovation in investment that are fueling our performance this year and positioning as well for the future value creation. At the beginning of the year, I said we needed to execute flawlessly on our new product launches, and I am very pleased with our progress. In the case of APOQUEL, it has become a very positive story. For the first half of 2016, we have exceeded $100 million in revenue. And since May, we have been supplying APOQUEL with no restrictions. Recently, we have launched in additional markets such as Brazil, Japan, Mexico and Russia. And in the coming months, we plan to introduce APOQUEL in the rest of the approved markets such as Colombia, Peru, Uruguay [ph] as well as Singapore and Hong Kong. 
SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide for dogs, is now available to customers in U.S. and most of the European countries, and we expect it to be further deployed in Canada, Brazil and New Zealand during 2016. We are pleased with the launch of SIMPARICA, despite being the most recent entrant in a very competitive oral flea and tick market for dogs. At launch, SIMPARICA was introduced with extensive published data, showing its rapid onset of action, its sustained persistence of protection against fleas and ticks, and other advantages over various oral and topical parasiticides on the market. 
While new products have been a big lift for us recently, we continued to build on our major established product lines and focus on the lifecycle innovation that will keep our portfolio strong and sustainable. One of the strengths of our R&D utilization is ability to innovate across the basis of health care that veterinarians encounter, phases that include prediction, prevention and treatment. Our R&D begins with an understanding of the biology of diseases, their pathways and how they work. Then we complement them with capital insight that come from our commercial teams working shoulder to shoulder with veterinarians and producers, and we apply this knowledge across the phases of health care. 
We use innovations in genetics, diagnostics, and increasingly, digital platforms, to help predict risk or detect diseases in species. This means the ability to breed healthier and more productive animals, to detect disease earlier and to develop practices in form by bioinformatics, and this is our applications that capitalize on the use of big data. 
In the second quarter, for example, we continue to expand our business diagnostic franchise into new markets, with an additional approval in Spain for livestock, pets therapeutics. This point-of-care therapeutics deliver accurate, fast and clear resource that give our customers timely and informed diagnosis without disrupting their clinical consultation. 
Our customers are also seeking for new solutions to get ahead and help prevent infectious diseases. We have been placing a greater emphasis on our vaccine portfolio, some of which we introduced last year, and others that we continue to expand in terms of approvals and geographies. 
For example, in the second quarter, we expanded our VERSICAN Plus and VANGUARD vaccine franchises with new approvals in Europe and Canada. VERSICAN Plus, a combination vaccine that protect dogs against 10 canine diseases, was first approved in European Union in 2014. And this quarter, we received additional approvals in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, for a smaller combination of antivaccine. 
Additionally, VERSICAN Plus rabies achieved approval for a new claim in the European Union, 3 years duration of immunity. 
Meanwhile, VANGUARD B Oral and VANGUARD crLyme vaccines were approved in Canada, after having just received their U.S. approval in December 2015. 
And finally, across the faces of health care, we develop medicines to treat sick animals. Vaccine, one of the Zoetis' largest global product lines, and was first introduced in 2015; and this quarter, we received approval of a new label claim in Europe for DRAXXIN and DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective oral treatment in swine respiratory disease. 
In addition to our internal R&D, we also look for a power that can help grow and strengthen our product portfolio. For example, in May, Zoetis launch in the U.S. a program called SILEO under an exclusive agreement with Orion Corporation. SILEO is the first and the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of noise aversion in dogs. And if you were in the U.S. this 4th of July, you probably read about or heard about this exciting new product that brought hope to many dog owners. 
In summary, we have continued our positive momentum through the first half of the year, based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and dedicated Zoetis colleagues. We continue to reap the benefit of a productive, world-class R&D organization focused on new programs and lifecycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. And we are executing on key product launches and our operational efficiency program to ensure our long-term growth and value creation. 
With that, let me turn the things over to Paul. Paul?"

Another solid quarter with lots of good things to cover, so let's get to it, starting with a quick walk down the P&L for the quarter. Then I'll provide some commentary on a number of areas that I believe will be helpful to understanding our quarter, our first half of 2016 and what you might expect for the balance of 2016. 
Before I start, I want to point out that the SKU rationalization and changes in business models we made in several international countries continue to have an impact on our revenue in 2016 and growth in revenue for 2016 compared with 2015. 
Now first, we're confident through the steps that we took and our thinking to improve efficiency will put Zoetis in the position to deliver high profits and cash flows and better grow those profits and cash flows from here forward. 
Second, while we are going through this transition, we believe it's important that we and you have visibility into how the go-forward portion of our business is performing. So we prepared analyses that strip the eliminated SKUs out of our revenue to show the underlying growth of the go-forward business. And on our website, you'll see slides and you'll find the table -- or tables, rather, that show our reported revenue growth for the second quarter and for the first half of 2016 and then walk you through the impacts of foreign currency, the operational efficiency changes related to SKUs and other business model changes, recent M&A, and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. 
The objective here is not to divert attention from our reported revenue growth rates, is to provide perspective on how you might think about our future growth prospects in our 2D state. While we use the phrase operational growth, that means excluding the impact of changes in FX rates versus the same period the prior year. When we say normalized organic growth for any period compared with the prior year period, that means excluding the impact of FX, the eliminated SKUs, the business changes outside the U.S., the extra days in the first quarter of the year and the impact of recent M&A. 
So with that lengthy preamble, let's talk about the quarter. 
Our revenue grew 6% on an operational constant currency basis. We posted an adjusted gross margin of 67.9% in the quarter, resulting in an adjusted gross profit growing faster than revenue, up 11% on an operational basis. Adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis, reflecting the great progress we've made on our efficiency initiative. As Juan Ramón said, we are on track to deliver more than the previously announced $300 million savings associated with the efficiency initiative, and those savings are considered in our guidance for 2017. 
The combination of 11% operational growth of adjusted gross profit and the flat adjusted operating expenses enable us to grow adjusted EBIT for the quarter by 25% on an operational basis. Below the operating line, we had higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate on adjusted income, which together reduce the operational growth rate of adjusted net income to 22%. We put adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 on the board for the quarter. And the strong performance in the first half of the year enabled us to increase our guidance for the full year 2016 by 3% -- excuse me, $0.03 per share across the range. A solid quarter and a solid first half of the year for sure. 
So a bit deeper dive on revenue. The quarter geographically was the U.S., up 10%, and by global business, it was companion animal, up 13%, and both of those on an operational basis. Of course, APOQUEL was an important driver of both. APOQUEL sales in the quarter were roughly $60 million. APOQUEL has a lot of revenue growth still ahead. And with SIMPARICA and a number of other recently introduced companion animal products, we expect our companion animal business to drive above market revenue growth through 2017. 
Our international segment was up 2% operationally and the global livestock business grew about 1% operationally, both were disproportionately impacted by our SKU reductions and the changes we made to our operating models in countries, including Venezuela and India. On a flip side, global livestock is benefiting from M&A, mostly PHARMAQ. 
Now let's talk about the components of our operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. APOQUEL accounted for 3% of that growth. New products, other than APOQUEL, including our new companion animal vaccines, SIMPARICA, SYNOVEX ONE and SILEO, to name a few, added 2%. In-line products added 4%, with 3% coming from increased prices and 1% from volume. And M&A accounted for another 2%. The impact of the SKU reductions and the changes in business models reduced our growth by some 500 basis points, and that gets you to the 6% operational revenue growth for the quarter. Pretty good, right?  Once again, our revenue growth came from a number of sources and reflects the strength of our diverse business model. 
Let's turn to our 2 segments, U.S. and International. Starting with the U.S. Overall, the U.S. business was up 10% in the quarter. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. grew 11% in the quarter. U.S. companion animal business was up 17%, mainly due to the ramp of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA and the introduction of other new products. Half of the growth was driven by the ramp of APOQUEL. U.S. livestock grew 2%, with a 4% pickup from increased selling prices that were offset in part by volume decreases related to some of the SKU reductions. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. livestock business delivered growth of 5% compared with 9% decline in Q1 of this year. The business rebounded nicely in Q2. And the year-to-date normalized organic growth rate for the U.S. livestock business was negative 3%. 
After the first quarter, there was some concern out there about the health of our U.S. livestock business. For the [indiscernible], after flow [indiscernible], we expect our U.S. livestock business to deliver growth for the full year 2016 on a normalized organic basis. 
Within U.S. livestock, cattle, especially beef cattle, was particularly strong as the herd size and placements in feedlots were increasing and drove higher demand for our high-value injectable anti-infectives, vaccines and parasiticides and the recently launched SYNOVEX ONE implants. 
U.S. swine products experienced a decline due to competitions for Fostera PCV vaccines, new restrictions on the use of some of our products for pork exports to China, a decline of PEDv revenue, as the disease is no longer prevalent, and some eliminated SKUs. U.S. poultry revenue declined in the quarter with the impact of SKU rationalization more than offsetting growth from the increased use of our health maintenance products and MFAs for antibiotic-free production, products like Zoamix, for example. 
On to the international segment. Revenue from our International segment was up 2% operationally. On a normalized organic basis, the growth rate was 7%. On the same normalized organic basis, the International companion animal business led the way, up 10%, while International livestock was up 5% in the quarter. Again, both of those are on a normalized organic basis. 
It's worth spotlighting a few countries for you. China was up $14 million or 49% operationally. Pork prices in China were relatively high, leading to favorable conditions for pork producers and for our swine portfolio, including products like DRAXXIN, EXCEDE, in our vaccines. About 1/3 of the growth in China was driven by products purchased by producers that stock up ahead of label changes for some of our products. 
Finally, we had very successful spring promotions that drove increased sales of our REVOLUTION and VECTIMAX products in China 
In Brazil, cattle and companion animal sales were strong, but partially offset by weakness in poultry. The cattle portion of our livestock in Brazil enjoyed favorable market conditions, leading to strong performance from our vaccines and parasiticides. We also saw increased adoption of IMPROVAC in the swine business. 
Across the portfolio, we also benefited from increased selling prices. The poultry business saw high input prices and increased restrictions on exportation to Japan have made for a challenging market for poultry producers and saw us lose a few accounts, based on price. For the quarter, Brazil grew 6% operationally. 
Australia posted a solid 10% operational growth for the quarter, led by the launch of APOQUEL, the success of a promotional campaign for REVOLUTION and sales of anti-infectives for cattle. 
On the negative side of the growth ledger, in the U.K., we saw sales declined 21% operationally. The biggest factor in nearly half the decline was due to weather. A wet winter and spring delayed the cattle sheep turnout seasons, and that was a factor. 
The second quarter was also negatively impacted as we were in the process of shipping the acquired Abbott products to our distribution, and we saw the channel accelerate purchases in the Q1 and work off the inventory in Q2. Year-to-date, the U.K. business is up 3% operationally. 
Finally, the grouping in other emerging countries declined 5% operationally, with the biggest drags being Venezuela and the SKU reductions. We saw growth across most other countries in this grouping, including through the additional of PHARMAQ revenue in Chile. 
So on revenue, high level, the beat goes on. Growth from many sources in a diversified models enables us to overcome softness in parts of our business, with strength in other areas. 
Now let's shift to the rest of the P&L. We posted a high gross margin, 67.9%, in the second quarter. But before we all start high-fiving each other, let's look at the factors that led to the 250 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Of the improvement, roughly 1/3 came from price increases, 1/3 from a mix shift toward a high-margin companion animal products and 1/3 came from other areas, mostly improvements in our supply chain efficiency. These 3 net positives experienced a bit of a headwind due to unfavorable movement of foreign currency. 
Our gross margin is improving, but it's not a one-way ratchet, and there were some seasonal elements that we expect to come into play in the second half of 2016. For example, sales of our livestock products are great as a percentage of total revenue in the second half of the year, and pricing promotions heading into the fall can lessen our net selling prices and, thereby, reduce gross margins in the period. These factors are expected to result in our reporting lower gross margins in the second half of the year as compared with the first half. 
And finally, there is, of course, FX. Predicting the timing and magnitude of FX changes on the cost of goods sold and on gross margin in short periods is very difficult. So that's a lot of discussion designed to caution you about assuming that our guidance for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue for 2016 and 2017 are conservative. 
There is good news here. We fully expect our gross margin to continue to improve over time based on increased selling prices, increased sales from our companion animal products versus livestock and increased efficiency in our supply chain. But the upper journey will not be linear quarter-to-quarter. 
Turning to adjusted operating expenses. There's really not a lot to say, except that we're on track to take out more than our target of $300 million operating cost by year-end. So we enter 2017 in our new leaned-out state. Total adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis when compared to Q2 of '15. 
Note that our operating expense base is not static. We've added costs, selling, marketing and R&D to the base via the PHARMAQ acquisition and to support the launch of SIMPARICA. And we may consider investing in promotion of certain key products or incremental R&D. The purpose of the efficiency initiative was to eliminate nonproductive expenditures, not to ignore high-value investments we can make in our business. At this stage, our 2D operating expense structure is what you see in our 2017 guidance table. 
We continued to demonstrate excellent expense discipline through the second quarter. And that, combined with the gross margin improvement, enabled us to pose operational growth of adjusted EBITDA of 25% for the quarter. Below the operating line, we had increased interest expense due to the note issuance in Q4 that's funded the PHARMAQ acquisition and prefunded the $400 million of debt that matured in the first quarter of the year. 
And our effective tax rate on adjusted income increased by some 100 basis points, mostly due to the change in our tax status in Belgium. 
Bottom line, our adjusted net income grew operationally 22% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% operationally, about 100 basis points faster than adjusted net income. That's our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 '16 or almost 1% less than in Q2 of '15. 
A couple of additional factors, I think, that you need to take about for the balance of 2016 and into '17. First, as always, FX. While there's been a bit of volatility in FX rates recently, notably with the British pound and the euro, the FX impact on the balance of our year and into 2017 is a little changed from our last guidance update. The overall impact on our future expectations for our international operations, based on FX rates in late July, are negligible. That said, FX rates had a negative impact on our reported revenue and profit rates, decreasing revenue growth in Q2 by some 300 basis points compared with Q2 of '15 and adjusted net income growth by some 800 basis points, contrast that with the 700 basis point drag on the reported revenue growth in Q1 and a 1,300 basis point drag on adjusted net income in Q1. 
So as we hoped on the last call, the impact of FX rates on our reported growth is moderating. Regardless, we continue to measure ourselves on a constant currency or operational basis. 
Next, the SKU reductions, including the changes we made to our business models in places like Venezuela and India, as we communicated in our last call, we expect the SKU reductions and business changes to decrease revenue growth by some 500 basis for the full year 2016. In Q1, the impact was roughly 400 basis points. In Q2, it was roughly 500 basis points. In year-to-date, it was roughly 500 basis points. I'll point out there's a little bit of rounding in there. You can see the impact to the SKU reductions in business model changes on the revenue in the charts that are on our website that I mentioned earlier. And I call your tension [indiscernible] help. 
On to onetime costs. I won't use this time to walk through the table in the press release, but want to call your attention to the contra expense item from the reversal of a portion of our severance accrual. At the time we recorded the accrual, we based on the best information available. As it's worked out, we expect to pay out a little bit less than severance than we have thought, mainly due to a greater level of voluntary attrition than expected. From a cash out-the-door perspective, that's a good thing for us. For the avoidance of doubt, the reversal did not increase our adjusted net income, but it did increase our reported GAAP net income in the quarter and was a factor in narrowing the gap between adjusted earnings and generally accepted accounting principle earnings.
Finally, on to guidance. Today, we're updating our guidance for the full year 2015 for a couple of things. We've increased our revenue guidance range by $25 million to reflect the strength of our business in our improved invisibility now that went though the first half of 2016. And we moved our expectations for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue from a range of 33% to 34% to approximately 33%, so the favorable end of the range.
Adjusted EBIT projections have improved in a similar fashion, so that's been updated too.
We also updated our onetime cost to reflect the lower expectations for the severance point I just talked about. All other categories remain the same, and the result is that we've raised our guidance range for 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.03 to the range of $1.86 to  $1.93 per share. Note that the operational growth rate for adjusted net income implied by our guidance increased by 100 basis points and is now a range of 10% to 14%. The majority of the increase in our guidance is operational, not FX-related. 
Now we can all do the math into what our guidance implies for the second half of the year for adjusted income per share, and you may think that, that outlook is anomalous, given the second half revenue is expected to exceed revenue in the first half of the year. 
There are a couple of observations about the phasing of our business in 2016. First, we do expect second half revenues to exceed the first half. That's a good story. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to generate lower growth margins in the second half of the year than seen in the first half, due to mix and promotional programs reducing net selling prices and, therefore, gross margins. Next, a major promotional spending and operating expenses in support of our various product franchises are more weighing into the back half of the year. 
And finally, our R&D spending also excused in the second half of the year. Generally, the benefits of increased sales expected in the second half of the year compared with the first maybe more than offset by reduced gross margins in the phasing of spending on promotion programs -- promotional programs and R&D. 
So you all know I don't like to talk about quarters, but here are a couple of tips for phasing Q3 and Q4 '16. We expect Q4 to be our highest revenue quarter. We expect gross margin in the second half to be below those in Q1 and Q2. Selling expenses are expected to be heavier in the second half of the year, particularly heavy in Q4. And R&D spending in the second half is expected to be higher than the first half and heaviest in Q4. From adjusted net income perspective, Q3 may be the low quarter for the year. What's most important is that we raised our full year 2016 guidance of revenue by $25 million and adjusted earnings per share by $0.03. This is all good stuff.
Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. We expect the more detailed look at 2017 at the time report our third quarter. 
That's it from me. Keith, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A."

With all these, we expect that the cattle business for beef in the U.S. will be positive. We have seen also improvement in Australia because of the weather conditions. We have seen, also, that the fundamentals of the Brazilian remains very strong with even increasing exportations. So in our opinion, the cattle business for beef will be positive for the year. Dairy, prices are having a negative impact in the profitability of farmers around the world. In the U.S., we expect that the business will not be -- or revenues coming from dairy will not be a significant driver of growth. Although we have seen most of that so far, farmers are not reducing the number of animals, so which also a good indication that we also expect improvement in pricing, pricing in the second half or first half of 2017. Swine, and for us, we said that in the rational business, it's doing extremely well. We expect this trend to continue in the second half.

You hit right on the head. I mean, earlier, when people were not quite convinced that we put the supply chain issues behind us, people were hoarding it or holding it in the office to ensure they had supply, but that is, from our perspective, a lesson that now you're seeing normal stocking and pull-through of the product. There may be pockets were it's still there, but much more normalized than we're excited about prospects for APOQUEL. With respect to DTC, and you can think about DTC for both potentially 2 products, it's APOQUEL, could be Simparica, I'd just say that within our guidance, within our OpEx guidance for 2016 and 2017, there are dollars allocated for promotional programs including DTC. I think when I talk about, during my prepared remarks, not ignoring opportunities to invest to say we made assumptions about the level of promotional spend against all of our product franchises. It's currently embedded within our guidance for '16 and '17 to the extent that we see great recurrence from certain promotional activities, we may well increase them in the future.

And then the smallest is the chronic, about 20% are chronic, so less than 20% are chronic. And, of course, our view is that when people -- you have an acute situation and you'll bring a dog in is this -- the opportunity where that dog can get excellent relief from using a product like APOQUEL and to the extent that it turns out that, that dog has seasonal issues, then, well it can move into a different category.

Similarly, trying to forecast your tax rate by quarter, by half-year, the longer the period you're forecasting, the more accurate you're going to be. It is entirely likely impossible that we'll see some discrete items in the second half of our year that will cause our tax rate to be higher in the second half than it would be in the first.

And I want to be real clear, so why -- one, why did we provide long-term guidance? We provided that because we knew the steps that we were about to embark on would include the SKU rationalization, the change in business models outside the U.S. and a pretty substantial change in our OpEx base. In light of that, outside party is trying to forecast what we would look like in '16 and then in '17, you would have had no chance to really be able to be somewhat accurate. And so we felt compelled to provide longer-term guidance to let people determine through their own models whether they were in the neighborhood of what we were thinking or they had differences of opinion. I think that was a one-time event. We, like most other companies, are reverting to having just -- or we'll revert to having just 1 year worth of guidance on the streets. So we'll provide the update, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for '17 later this year. And then we'll have 2017 on the board. But I really want to focus on -- a comment, Vlad, that you made around the 34% kind of operating EBIT margin -- or, excuse me, adjusted EBIT margin target that you referenced. Because I want to be really, really clear, we're not targeting the maximum operating margin. We're seeking to maximize our cash flow and grow it at a fast rate. If that's at a 33% margin, that's okay. If that's at a 36% margin, yes, that's okay, too. But it's not focus -- focusing solely on what is that margin, unless maximize that margin. We're looking at maximizing earnings as a proxy for cash flow and then growing it as quickly and for as long as we can at an attractive rate. Now separately, I believe you asked about -- what is there an upper limit? One of the advantages of our company is that we have a wonderful, global footprint where we have the scale to support that global footprint. And generally, not completely, but generally, we have the ability to drive a lot more revenue on the infrastructure that we have deployed around the globe. So the answer is, yes, we have the ability to continue to leverage our cost structure and thereby improve that operating margin. But what I don't want people to do is to focus on it and say a 33% or 35% -- and look at that, well, gee, that's less than I thought. The goal is not limited to continue to drive that percentage. It's to maximize profit, cash flow, grow it, and grow it fast and grow it for a long time. So I've rambled a little bit there, but I hope I covered your question."

And we have 3 buckets in our R&D expenses. One is related to regulatory expenses about 15%, 1-5. And then the other 85%, it's split between new product innovation and lifecycle innovation. So we are investing significantly to keep our current portfolio updated and competitive. So how much are we generating in terms of growth in line compared to new products and price? So we described that the animal health industry will be growing at 5% to 6% in the next coming years. About half of this 5% to 6% will be related to price. And then in line, we'll have half of the growth, our new products are half of the remaining growth. The ability of Zoetis and other companies to grow faster than this 5% to 6% will come from new products. So in 2016, excluding the impact of SKU rationalization in the second quarter, this organic operational growth -- normalized organic operational growth is 9%. So how much of it came from the price? It was about 3% of that from price. New products also generated a significant part of this growth. And the in-line portfolio, it was growing volume by 1%. So the rest of the portfolio; APOQUEL, generated 3 percentage points; other new products, another 2 percentage points. You see that the new products in the second quarter were generating about 500 basis points out of this 900 normalized organic operational growth. And this is what we also expect for the future. For the future, we have communicated that we plan that to grow in line or faster than market. In '17, basing our guidance, we plan that to grow faster than the market, and this faster growth will come from new product launches."

We described many times China as the largest producer of pork in the world.

And we expect that this will represent the big opportunity for companies like Zoetis that can offer products that will increase the productivity and the quality and safety of the production in China. We also have seen opportunities in other species like cattle. The objective, for us, in cattle is to build stronger portfolio, and especially to build stronger portfolio in vaccines. And the way that we're doing that is: First, trying to get approval for portfolio that is already available in other markets, also in China; and second, to invest in R&D locally to produce specific vaccines for cattle, for swine and also for poultry. And this is the strategy that we are following, and we are convinced that China will continue growing. And not only livestock, we've seen a significant success in our portfolio in companion animal. We have now a portfolio, which is covering vaccines and covering some other products. We still have the opportunity in China to approve APOQUEL in the future, to approve Simparica. This will take some time, but we are convinced that the potential growth of China will continue.

IL-31, being a product which is injectable, maybe we will position more in chronic than acute, but still will be opportunities for both indications. And the -- as I said, in terms of efficacy, greater response from the veterinarians, mainly dermatologists and some experienced veterinarians. And also great on safety. So I think all the indications are very positive to IL-31. And this will be, as I said, very complimentary to our atopic dermatitis franchise, dermatologic or itching conditions. And we are very pleased with what we're doing. Last comment on Simparica. So we consider Simparica as a platform. So the active ingredient of Simparica will be used for combinations of products, also for oral, for topical, and we're convinced that this will be a significant product in our portfolio. And I think, it's just to remind that in the cat business for -- parasiticide cat market, we have Revolution. And Revolution is performing very well.

True to our di",1420,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our performance this quarter, once again, demonstrates why we have confidence in the consistency and predictability of our results and why we are the leader in the animal health care industry. 
True to our diverse business model, we continue generating good results from many different sources, both in the U.S. and international markets, and across different species and therapeutic areas. And our portfolio help us deliver steady results over the long term, despite some other economic and market challenges that exist. 
Our R&D investment is maintaining a high level of productivity. With new products, like SIMPARICA, as well as life-cycle innovation and market expansions for key product lines, such as DRAXXIN, VANGUARD and VERSICAN Plus. We also combine this internal investment with external financial opportunities. We have products like SILEO, the new noise aversion medicine that we are marketing for dogs in the U.S. 
In addition to sales innovation, we are demonstrating our leadership in the animal health industry, with the profitability and performance of our operations. We have been executing on the operational efficiency program we announced last year, and we are on track to deliver more than $300 million in savings and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% by the end of 2017. We believe this achievement in efficiency and predictability is unparalleled in the animal health industry. 
Looking more closely at our second quarter results. Operational revenue was up 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As you will recall, this year, our revenue growth and forecast will continue to reflect the impact from changes related to the operational efficiency program we put in place in 2015, though SKU rationalization and business changes in countries like Venezuela and India continue to partially offset more significant gains in our core business. Excluding these impacts and the impact of acquisitions, our normalized organic operational growth would be 9%. And on the same basis, our companion animal program grew 15%, 1-5, and our livestock products grew 5%. Paul will provide more details on the breach from reported to normalized organic operational growth in his remarks. 
The growth in companion animal was based on strong performance by APOQUEL as well as our recently launched vaccines and SIMPARICA. 
In livestock, we saw growth coming from a recovery of cattle business in the U.S. In swine, the positive performance from the international segment was offset by a decline in the U.S. And in poultry, we declined globally due to market conditions and pressure from competition. We are improving our cost of sales and gross margin as we refine our manufacturing and network, execute our efficiency plan and focus on continuous improvement.
On an operational basis, our adjusted operating expenses was flat in the second quarter even as we grew revenues significantly, thanks to the ownership and mindset of our products and expense management discipline. 
The growth in revenues. Growth margin improvement and discipline on expenses resulted in adjusted net income growth of 22% operationally, once again supporting our long-term and value proposition to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue.
We always emphasize a full year view of our business to account for some of the seasonal situations and timing patterns in animal health, and we continue to see good progress through that lens. We're increasing our guidance for 2016 based on our strong performance in the first half of the year, the continued strength of our business model and the confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year. Paul will go through updates to 2016 guidance in his remarks. 
Now let me turn to the innovation in investment that are fueling our performance this year and positioning us well for the future value creation. At the beginning of the year, I said we needed to execute flawlessly on our new product launches, and I am very pleased with our progress. In the case of APOQUEL, it has become a very positive story. For the first half of 2016, we have exceeded $100 million in revenue. And since May, we have been supplying APOQUEL with no restrictions. Recently, we have launched in additional markets such as Brazil, Japan, Mexico and Russia. And in the coming months, we plan to introduce APOQUEL in the rest of approved markets such as Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay, as well as Singapore and Hong Kong. 
SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide for dogs, is now available to customers in U.S. and most of the European countries, and we expect it to be further deployed in Canada, Brazil and New Zealand during 2016. We are pleased with the launch of SIMPARICA, despite being the most recent entrant in a very competitive oral flea and tick market for dogs. At launch, SIMPARICA was introduced with extensive published data, showing its rapid onset of action, its sustained persistence of protection against fleas and ticks, and other advantages over various oral and topical parasiticides on the market. 
While new products have been a big lift for us recently, we continue to build on our major established product lines and focus on the lifecycle innovation that will keep our portfolio strong and sustainable. One of the strengths of our R&D utilization is ability to innovate across the basis of health care that veterinarians encounter, phases that include prediction, prevention and treatment. Our R&D begins with an understanding of the biology of diseases, their pathways and how they work. Then we complement them with customer insights that come from our commercial teams working shoulder to shoulder with veterinarians and producers, and we apply this knowledge across the phases of health care. 
We use innovations in genetics, diagnostics, and increasingly, digital platforms, to help predict risks or detect diseases in species. This means the ability to breed healthier and more productive animals, to detect disease earlier and to develop practices in form by bioinformatics, and this is our applications that capitalize on the use of big data. 
In the second quarter, for example, we continue to expand our business diagnostic franchise into new markets, with an additional approval in Spain for livestock, pets therapeutics. This point-of-care therapeutics deliver accurate, fast and clear resource that give our customers timely and informed diagnosis without disrupting their clinical consultation. 
Our customers are also seeking for new solutions to get ahead and help prevent infectious diseases. We have been placing a greater emphasis on our vaccine portfolio, some of which we introduced last year, and others that we continue to expand in terms of approvals and geographies. 
For example, in the second quarter, we expanded our VERSICAN Plus and VANGUARD vaccine franchises with new approvals in Europe and Canada. VERSICAN Plus, a combination vaccine that protect dogs against 10 canine diseases, was first approved in the European Union in 2014. And this quarter, we received additional approvals in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, for a smaller combination of antivaccine. 
Additionally, VERSICAN Plus rabies achieved approval for a new claim in the European Union, 3 years duration of immunity. 
Meanwhile, VANGUARD B Oral and VANGUARD crLyme vaccines were approved in Canada, after having just received their U.S. approval in December 2015. 
And finally, across the faces of health care, we developed medicines to treat sick animals. DRAXXIN, one of the Zoetis' largest global product lines, and was first introduced in 2015. And this quarter we received approval of a new label claim in Europe for DRAXXIN and DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective for treating swine respiratory disease. 
In addition to our internal R&D, we also look for partners that can help grow and strengthen our product portfolio. For example, in May, Zoetis launched in the U.S. a program called SILEO under an exclusive agreement with Orion Corporation. SILEO is the first and the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of noise aversion in dogs. And if you were in the U.S. this 4th of July, you probably read about or heard about this exciting new product that brought hope to many dog owners. 
In summary, we have continued our positive momentum through the first half of the year, based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and dedicated Zoetis colleagues. We continue to reap the benefits of a productive, world-class R&D organization focused on new programs and lifecycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. And we are executing on key product launches and our operational efficiency program to ensure our long-term growth and value creation.

Another solid quarter with lots of good things to cover, so let's get to it, starting with a quick walk down the P&L for the quarter. Then I'll provide some commentary on a number of areas that I believe will be helpful to understanding our quarter, our first half of 2016 and what you might expect for the balance of 2016. 
Before I start, I want to point out that the SKU rationalization and changes in business models we made in several international countries continue to have an impact on our revenue in 2016 and growth in revenue for 2016 compared with 2015. 
Now first, we're confident that the steps that we took and are taking to improve efficiency will put Zoetis in the position to deliver high profits and cash flows, and to better grow those profits and cash flows from here forward. 
Second, while we are going through this transition, we believe it's important that we and you have visibility into how the go-forward portion of our business is performing. So we've prepared analyses that strip the eliminated SKUs out of our revenue to show the underlying growth of the go-forward business. And on our website, you'll see slides and you'll find the table -- or tables, rather, that show our reported revenue growth for the second quarter and for the first half of 2016, and then walk you through the impacts of foreign currency, the operational efficiency changes related to SKUs and other business model changes, recent M&A, and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. 
The objective here is not to divert attention from our reported revenue growth rates. It's to provide perspective on how you might think about our future growth prospects in our 2D state. When we use the phrase operational growth, that means excluding the impact of changes in FX rates versus the same period the prior year. When we say normalized organic growth for any period compared with the prior year period, that means excluding the impact of FX, the eliminated SKUs, the business changes outside the U.S., the extra days in the first quarter of the year and the impact of recent M&A. 
So with that lengthy preamble, let's talk about the quarter. 
Our revenue grew 6% on an operational constant currency basis. We posted an adjusted gross margin of 67.9% in the quarter, resulting in an adjusted gross profit growing faster than revenue, up 11% on an operational basis. Adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis, reflecting the great progress we've made on our efficiency initiative. As Juan Ramón said, we are on track to deliver more than the previously announced $300 million savings associated with the efficiency initiative, and those savings are considered in our guidance for 2017. 
The combination of 11% operational growth of adjusted gross profit and the flat adjusted operating expenses enable us to grow adjusted EBIT for the quarter by 25% on an operational basis. Below the operating line, we had higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate on adjusted income, which together reduced the operational growth rate of adjusted net income to 22%. We put adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 on the board for the quarter. And the strong performance in the first half of the year enabled us to increase our guidance for the full year 2016 by 3% -- excuse me, $0.03 per share across the range. A solid quarter and a solid first half of the year for sure. 
So a bit deeper dive on revenue. The strongest quarter geographically was the U.S., up 10%, and by global business, it was companion animal, up 13%, and both of those on an operational basis. Of course, APOQUEL was an important driver of both. APOQUEL sales in the quarter were roughly $60 million. APOQUEL has a lot of revenue growth still ahead. And with SIMPARICA and a number of other recently introduced companion animal products, we expect our companion animal business to drive above market revenue growth through 2017. 
Our international segment was up 2% operationally and the global livestock business grew about 1% operationally. Both were disproportionately impacted by our SKU reductions and the changes we made to our operating models in countries, including Venezuela and India. On a flip side, global livestock is benefiting from M&A, mostly PHARMAQ. 
Now let's talk about the components of our operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. APOQUEL accounted for 3% of that growth. New products, other than APOQUEL, including our new companion animal vaccines, SIMPARICA, SYNOVEX ONE and SILEO, to name a few, added 2%. In-line products added 4%, with 3% coming from increased prices and 1% from volume. And M&A accounted for another 2%. The impact of the SKU reductions and the changes in business models reduced our growth by some 500 basis points, and that gets you to the 6% operational revenue growth for the quarter. Pretty good, right?  Once again, our revenue growth came from a number of sources and reflects the strength of our diverse business model. 
Let's turn to our 2 segments, U.S. and international. Starting with the U.S. Overall, the U.S. business was up 10% in the quarter. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. grew 11% in the quarter. U.S. companion animal business was up 17%, mainly due to the ramp of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA and the introduction of other new products. Half of the growth was driven by the ramp of APOQUEL. U.S. livestock grew 2%, with a 4% pickup from increased selling prices that were offset in part by volume decreases related to some of the SKU reductions. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. livestock business delivered growth of 5% compared with 9% decline in Q1 of this year. The business rebounded nicely in Q2. And the year-to-date normalized organic growth rate for the U.S. livestock business was negative 3%. 
After the first quarter, there was some concern out there about the health of our U.S. livestock business. For the avoidance of doubt, after full store [ph], we expect our U.S. livestock business to deliver growth for the full year 2016 on a normalized organic basis. 
Within U.S. livestock, cattle, especially beef cattle, was particularly strong as the herd size and placements in feedlots were increasing and drove higher demand for our high-value injectable anti-infectives, vaccines and parasiticides and the recently launched SYNOVEX ONE implants. 
U.S. swine products experienced a decline due to competitions for Fostera PCV vaccines, new restrictions on the use of some of our products for pork exports to China, a decline of PEDv revenue, as the disease is no longer prevalent, and some eliminated SKUs. U.S. poultry revenue declined in the quarter with the impact of SKU rationalization more than offsetting growth from the increased use of our health maintenance products and MFAs for antibiotic-free production, products like Zoamix, for example. 
On to the international segment. Revenue from our international segment was up 2% operationally. On a normalized organic basis, the growth rate was 7%. On the same normalized organic basis, the international companion animal business led the way, up 10%, while international livestock was up 5% in the quarter. Again, both of those are on a normalized organic basis. 
It's worth spotlighting a few countries for you. China was up $14 million or 49% operationally. Pork prices in China were relatively high, leading to favorable conditions for pork producers and for our swine portfolio, including products like DRAXXIN, EXCEDE, in our vaccines. About 1/3 of the growth in China was driven by products purchased by producers to stock up ahead of label changes for some of our products. 
Finally, we had very successful spring promotions that drove increased sales of our REVOLUTION and VECTIMAX products in China 
In Brazil, cattle and companion animal sales were strong, but partially offset by weakness in poultry. The cattle portion of our livestock in Brazil enjoyed favorable market conditions, leading to strong performance from our vaccines and parasiticides. We also saw increased adoption of IMPROVAC in the swine business. 
Across the portfolio, we also benefited from increased selling prices. The poultry business saw high input prices and increased restrictions on exportation to Japan that made for a challenging market for poultry producers, and saw us lose a few accounts based on price. For the quarter, Brazil grew 6% operationally. 
Australia posted a solid 10% operational growth for the quarter, led by the launch of APOQUEL, the success of a promotional campaign for REVOLUTION and sales of anti-infectives for cattle. 
On the negative side of the growth ledger, in the U.K., we saw sales declined 21% operationally. The biggest factor is nearly half the decline was due to weather. A wet winter and spring delayed the cattle/sheep turnout seasons, and that was a factor. 
The second quarter was also negatively impacted as we were in the process of shipping the acquired Abbott products to our distribution, and we saw the channel accelerate purchases in the Q1 and work off the inventory in Q2. Year-to-date, the U.K. business is up 3% operationally. 
Finally, the group in other emerging countries declined 5% operationally, with the biggest drags being Venezuela and the SKU reductions. We saw growth across most other countries in this grouping, including through the addition of PHARMAQ revenue in Chile. 
So on revenue, high level, the beat goes on. Growth from many sources in a diversified models enables us to overcome softness in parts of our business, with strength in other areas. 
Now let's shift to the rest of the P&L. We posted a high gross margin, 67.9%, in the second quarter. But before we all start high-fiving each other, let's look at the factors that led to the 250 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Of the improvement, roughly 1/3 came from price increases, 1/3 from a mix shift toward a high-margin companion animal products and 1/3 came from other areas, mostly improvements in our supply chain efficiency. These 3 net positives experienced a bit of a headwind due to unfavorable movement of foreign currency. 
Our gross margin is improving, but it's not a one-way ratchet, and there were some seasonal elements that we expect to come into play in the second half of 2016. For example, sales of our livestock products are great as a percentage of total revenue in the second half of the year, and pricing promotions heading into the fall can lessen our net selling prices and, thereby, reduce gross margins in the period. These factors are expected to result in our reporting lower gross margins in the second half of the year as compared with the first half. 
And finally, there is, of course, FX. Predicting the timing and magnitude of FX changes on the cost of goods sold and on gross margin in short periods is very difficult. So that's a lot of discussion designed to caution you about assuming that our guidance for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue for 2016 and 2017 are conservative. 
There is good news here. We fully expect our gross margin to continue to improve over time based on increased selling prices, increased sales from our companion animal products versus livestock and increased efficiency in our supply chain. But the upward journey will not be linear quarter-to-quarter. 
Turning to adjusted operating expenses. There's really not a lot to say, except that we're on track to take out more than our target of $300 million operating cost by year-end. So we enter 2017 in our new leaned-out state. Total adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis when compared to Q2 of '15. 
Note that our operating expense base is not static. We've added costs, selling, marketing and R&D to the base via the PHARMAQ acquisition and to support the launch of SIMPARICA. And we may consider investing in promotion of certain key products or incremental R&D. The purpose of the efficiency initiative was to eliminate nonproductive expenditures, not to ignore high-value investments we can make in our business. At this stage, our 2D operating expense structure is what you see in our 2017 guidance table. 
We continued to demonstrate excellent expense discipline through the second quarter. And that, combined with the gross margin improvement, enabled us to pose operational growth of adjusted EBITDA of 25% for the quarter. Below the operating line, we had increased interest expense due to the note issuance in Q4 that's funded the PHARMAQ acquisition and prefunded the $400 million of debt that matured in the first quarter of the year. 
And our effective tax rate on adjusted income increased by some 100 basis points, mostly due to the change in our tax status in Belgium. 
Bottom line, our adjusted net income grew operationally 22% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% operationally, about 100 basis points faster than adjusted net income. That's our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 '16 were almost 1% less than in Q2 of '15. 
A couple of additional factors, I think, that you need to think about for the balance of 2016 and into '17. First, as always, FX. While there's been a bit of volatility in FX rates recently, notably with the British pound and the euro, the FX impact on the balance of our year and into 2017 is little changed from our last guidance update. The overall impact on our future expectations for our international operations, based on FX rates in late July, are negligible. That said, FX rates had a negative impact on our reported revenue and profit rates, decreasing revenue growth in Q2 by some 300 basis points compared with Q2 of '15 and adjusted net income growth by some 800 basis points. Contrast that with the 700 basis point drag on the reported revenue growth in Q1 and the 1,300 basis point drag on adjusted net income in Q1. 
So as we hoped on the last call, the impact of FX rates on our reported growth is moderating. Regardless, we continue to measure ourselves on a constant currency or operational basis. 
Next, the SKU reductions, including the changes we made to our business models in places like Venezuela and India, as we communicated on our last call, we expect the SKU reductions and business changes to decrease revenue growth by some 500 basis for the full year 2016. In Q1, the impact was roughly 400 basis points. In Q2, it was roughly 500 basis points. In year-to-date, it was roughly 500 basis points. I'll point out there's a little bit of rounding in there. You can see the impact to the SKU reductions in business model changes on the revenue growth in the charts that are on our website that I mentioned earlier. And I call your attention to those; I think they are helpful.
On to onetime costs. I won't use this time to walk through the table in the press release, but want to call your attention to the a contra expense item from the reversal of a portion of our severance accrual. At the time we recorded the accrual, we based it on the best information available. As it's worked out, we expect to pay out a little bit less in severance than we had thought, mainly due to a greater level of voluntary attrition than expected. From a cash out-the-door perspective, that's a good thing for us. For the avoidance of doubt, the reversal did not increase our adjusted net income, but it did increase our reported GAAP net income in the quarter and was a factor in narrowing the gap between adjusted earnings and generally accepted accounting principle earnings.
Finally, on to guidance. Today, we're updating our guidance for the full year 2015 for a couple of things. We've increased our revenue guidance range by $25 million to reflect the strength of our business in our improved invisibility now that went though the first half of 2016. And we moved our expectations for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue from a range of 33% to 34% to approximately 33%, so the favorable end of the range.
Adjusted EBIT projections have improved in a similar fashion, so that's been updated too.
We also updated our onetime cost to reflect the lower expectations for the severance point I just talked about. All other categories remain the same, and the result is that we've raised our guidance range for 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.03 to the range of $1.86 to $1.93 per share. Note that the operational growth rate for adjusted net income implied by our guidance increased by 100 basis points and is now a range of 10% to 14%. The majority of the increase in our guidance is operational, not FX-related. 
Now we can all do the math into what our guidance implies for the second half of the year for adjusted net income per share, and you may think that, that outlook is anomalous, given the second half revenue is expected to exceed revenue in the first half of the year. 
There are a couple of observations about the phasing of our business in 2016. First, we do expect second half revenues to exceed the first half. That's a good story. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to generate lower growth margins in the second half of the year than seen in the first half, due to mix and promotional programs reducing net selling prices and, therefore, gross margins. Next, our major promotional spending and operating expenses in support of our various product franchises are more weighted to the back half of the year. 
And finally, our R&D spending also skews to the second half of the year. Generally, the benefits of increased sales expected in the second half of the year compared with the first maybe more than offset by reduced gross margins in the phasing of spending on promotion programs -- promotional programs and R&D. 
So you all know I don't like to talk about quarters, but here are a couple of tips for phasing Q3 and Q4 '16. We expect Q4 to be our highest revenue quarter. We expect gross margin in the second half to be below those in Q1 and Q2. Selling expenses are expected to be heavier in the second half of the year, particularly heavy in Q4. And R&D spending in the second half is expected to be higher than in first half and heaviest in Q4. From adjusted net income perspective, Q3 may be the low quarter for the year. What's most important is that we raised our full year 2016 guidance of revenue by $25 million and our adjusted earnings per share by $0.03. This is all good stuff.
Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. We expect the more detailed look at 2017 at the time we report our third quarter. 
That's it from me. Keith, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A."

In beef, we have seen that the number of animals, it's larger than the previous year by 3%. In the second quarter, also, we saw that the number of placements in feedlots increased by 5%. On the total year, we expect that the number of animals will be about 3% higher than 2015. And also, the placements on the feedlot, even in the second half, will be lower than in the second quarter, we expect also to grow by about 3%. With all this, we expect that the cattle business for beef in the U.S. will be positive. We have seen also improvement in Australia because of the weather conditions. We have seen, also, that the fundamentals of the Brazilian remains very strong with even increasing exportations. So in our opinion, the cattle business for beef will be positive for the year. Dairy, prices are having a negative impact in the profitability of farmers around the world. In the U.S., we expect that the business will not be -- or revenues coming from dairy will not be a significant driver of growth. Although we have seen also that so far, farmers are not reducing the number of animals, so -- which also a good indication that we also expect improvement in pricing, pricing in the second half or first half of 2017. Swine, and for us, as we said that in the international business, it's doing extremely well. We expect this trend to continue in the second half. In the U.S., we are facing some competitive challenge that we also expect to start showing in the fourth and first quarter of the 2017.

So also the good news is that we are ahead in the implementation, and we generate in '16 also higher savings than initially expected. In terms of the SKU rationalization, plans are in line with expectations. We have eliminated the majority of the SKUs now. There are still some few SKUs that we decided to keep until we have some of the product that will be replacing these SKUs. So we'll minimize the impact of the reduction. And in terms of plans that we included as divestment or exiting, we did almost all the work now. Countries that we changed the distribution model has been now fully implemented. So we are definitely extremely pleased with all the progress that we made in this program. So Paul will talk about the capital deployment."

We're currently repurchasing shares at the rate of about $75 million a quarter. We have a program that runs through the balance of 2016. And yes, we're obviously in the process of looking at 2017 and beyond and in thinking through what we'll do there. But Erin, you bring up a great point and something that we talk about quite a bit. 2016, we don't really demonstrate through our quarterly results the real cash-generating properties of our business. 2017 will be the first opportunity for the market to see, in our reported results, the ability of this company to generate significant free cash flow. And the reason for that -- reasons for that are the obvious ones that we're completing our standup from Pfizer, and that's been expensive and lengthy. We're completing or generally completing the payments for implementing our efficiency initiatives, and we hope to put those behind us by the end of 2016. And so when we enter 2017, you are going to see a much more normalized level of cash generation from this company. And as we generate that cash, we will stick to the model of looking for ways to deploy it inside, outside in value-generative M&A and last, and certainly not least, in the form of our dividend and share repurchases."

It's like, I talked about how difficult it can be to calculate or predict the impact of FX on your gross margin. Similarly, trying to forecast your tax rate by quarter, by half-year, the longer the period you're forecasting, the more accurate you're going to be. It is entirely likely and possible that we'll see some discrete items in the second half of our year that will cause our tax rate to be higher in the second half than it would be in the first. Generally, what I want to report is we made excellent progress in managing our tax position in light of the challenge that was thrown at us by the European Commission in January of this year. And we feel good heading into 2017 that we'll be able to achieve the effective tax rate that we've guided to on adjusted pretax of roughly 30%. So I'll leave it at that. And I think your other question was around dividend versus share repurchasing, how do you think about that, perhaps as you move into 2017 with a more normalized cash flow coming out of the company? Look, let me say that it will be something that we will more likely address in detail later in the year. As I said, as we go through the process of looking at 2017 in some detail, and we'll come back to you, just state that we intend to return to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases capital that's not needed to invest productively within our business or for M&A.

So I'm wondering -- and since then, they just never reissued the long-term guidance and did not expand to further years. So I'm wondering if you're planning to provide longer-term guidance in the future, and -- or it was more like a one-time event in advance of restructuring announced later? And if there is no long-term guidance, how we should think about operating margins going forward? And if you can also specifically -- and what are the limits for operating margin growth? And what -- can you specifically quantify contribution from the product gross margin growth due to ongoing supply network rationalization initiative?"

So the first thing, almost 3 years ago or 2.5 years after we made this projection, we are confirming that in 2017, we'll be improving or reaching that 34% EBITDA margin. And moving from at that time, 25% that was projected there for the end of 2014 to 34%, it's a significant improvement. And I think, it's probably the confirmation of the predictability and the sustainability of our business. I think there are not too many companies that after 3 years, they can maintain what I consider was an aggressive target of improving our margins by 900 basis points. Now I will turn to Paul to provide some additional comments."

And I want to be real clear, so why -- one, why did we provide long-term guidance?

And I want to be real clear, so why -- one, why did we provide long-term guidance? We provided that because we knew the steps that we were about to embark on would include the SKU rationalization, the change in business models outside the U.S. and a pretty substantial change in our OpEx base. In light of that, outside parties trying to forecast what we would look like in '16 and then in '17, you would have had no chance to really be able to be somewhat accurate. And so we felt compelled to provide longer-term guidance to let people determine through their own models whether they were in the neighborhood of what we were thinking or they had a difference of opinion. I think that was a one-time event. We, like most other companies, are reverting to having just -- or we'll revert to having just 1 year worth of guidance on the streets. So we'll provide the update, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for '17 later this year. And then we'll have 2017 on the board. But I really want to focus on a comment, Vlad, that you made around the 34% kind of operating EBIT margin -- or, excuse me, adjusted EBIT margin target that you referenced. Because I want to be really, really clear, we're not targeting the maximum operating margin. We're seeking to maximize our cash flow and grow it at a fast rate. If that's at a 33% margin, that's okay. If that's at a 36% margin, yes, that's okay, too. But it's not focus -- focusing solely on what is that margin, and let's maximize that margin. We're looking at maximizing earnings as a proxy for cash flow and then growing it as quickly and for as long as we can at an attractive rate. Now separately, I believe you asked about what -- is there an upper limit? One of the advantages of our company is that we have a wonderful, global footprint where we have scale to support that global footprint. And generally, not completely, but generally, we have the ability to drive a lot more revenue on the infrastructure that we have deployed around the globe. So the answer is, yes, we have the ability to continue to leverage our cost structure and thereby improve that operating margin. But what I don't want people to do is to focus on a, say, 33% or 35% -- and look at that, well, gee, that's less than I thought. The goal is not limited to continue to drive that percentage. It's to maximize profit, cash flow, grow it, and grow it fast and grow it for a long time. So I've rambled a little bit there, but I hope I covered your question."

So I would say that all the efforts in terms of commercial and R&D are mostly completed.

And this will be also with the introduction of new product that also will help us to minimize the negative impact of this last SKU rationalization. The other area that is still work in progress, but also progressing in line with expectations, it's the manufacturing changes. We exit the 7 plants that we targeted. There is 1 plant that is still in progress, but 5 have been sold, 1 has been exited and the other 1 is in process. So in that area, things are progressing very well.

So we are investing significantly to keep our current portfolio updated and competitive. So how much are we generating in terms of growth in line compared to new products and price? So we described that the animal health industry will be growing at 5% to 6% in the next coming years. About half of this 5% to 6% will be related to price. And then in line, we'll have half of the growth, our new products are half of the remaining growth. The ability of Zoetis and other companies to grow faster than this 5% to 6% will come from new products. So in 2016, excluding the impact of SKU rationalization in the second quarter, this organic operational growth -- normalized organic operational growth is 9%. So how much of it came from the price? It was about 3% from price. New products also generated a significant part of this growth. And the in-line portfolio, it was growing volume by 1%. So the rest of the portfolio; APOQUEL, generated 3 percentage points; other new products, another 2 percentage points. You see that the new products in the second quarter were generating about 500 basis points out of this 900 normalized organic operational growth. And this is what we also expect for the future.

We also have seen opportunities in other species like cattle. The objective, for us, in cattle is to build stronger portfolio, and especially to build stronger portfolio in vaccines. And the way that we're doing that is: First, trying to get approval for portfolio that is already available in other markets, also in China; and second, to invest in R&D locally to produce specific vaccines for cattle, for swine and also for poultry. And this is the strategy that we are following, and we are convinced that China will continue growing. And not only livestock, we've seen a significant success in our portfolio in companion animal.

What's also interesting about China is how it affects one of our other key markets, which is Brazil. I think many of you may have seen recently an article that talked about the increase in exports of beef from Brazil to China. That's a good thing for us because we're present in Brazil. And that helps with the health of our customer base in Brazil. So China has a pretty interesting influence on our business, both for what we do there, but also on other segments of our company."

And we are considering different ways of communicating to veterinarians and also different ways to communicate to pet owners, to increase the awareness of the product, and to make sure that the pet owners are also going to the clinics asking them for APOQUEL for both chronic but also acute indications."

If you want really to succeed in the cat market, you need to offer a topical indication. And this is what we'd be working in our R&D program really to develop -- to bring this product into the market.

So we want -- we focused during this period, until a full license, on providing this [indiscernible] and to get the experience of using this product, and also to develop all the data that will support the approval, the full license of IL-31. The feedback from the market so far is very positive. And again, it's very complementary to APOQUEL. APOQUEL will be in both acute and chronic. IL-31, being a product which is injectable, maybe we will position more in chronic than acute, but still will be opportunities for both indications. And the -- as I said, in terms of efficacy, greater response from the veterinarians, mainly dermatologists and some experienced veterinarians. And also great on safety. So I think all the indications are very positive to IL-31. And this will be, as I said, very complementary to our atopic dermatitis franchise, dermatologic or itching conditions. And we are very pleased with what we're doing. Last comment on Simparica. So we consider Simparica as a platform. So the active ingredient of Simparica will be used for combinations of products, also for oral, for topical, and we're convinced that this will be a significant product in our portfolio. And I think, it's just to remind that in the cat business for -- parasiticide cat market, we have Revolution. And Revolution is performing very well. And we also expect that with a new lifecycle innovation that we are applying to Simparica, the Revolution penetration also will be reinforced."

Our performance this quarter, once again, demonstrates why we have confidence in the consistency and predictability of our results and why we are the leader in the animal health care industry. True to our di",1420,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our performance this quarter, once again, demonstrates why we have confidence in the consistency and predictability of our results and why we are the leader in the animal health care industry. 
True to our diverse business model, we continue generating good results from many different sources, both in the U.S. and international markets, and across different species and therapeutic areas. And our portfolio help us deliver steady results over the long term, despite some other economic and market challenges that exist. 
Our R&D investment is maintaining a high level of productivity. With new products, like SIMPARICA, as well as life-cycle innovation and market expansions for key product lines, such as DRAXXIN, VANGUARD and VERSICAN Plus. We also combine this internal investment with external financial opportunities. We have products like SILEO, the new noise aversion medicine that we are marketing for dogs in the U.S. 
In addition to sales innovation, we are demonstrating our leadership in the animal health industry, with the profitability and performance of our operations. We have been executing on the operational efficiency program we announced last year, and we are on track to deliver more than $300 million in savings and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% by the end of 2017. We believe this achievement in efficiency and predictability is unparalleled in the animal health industry. 
Looking more closely at our second quarter results. Operational revenue was up 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As you will recall, this year, our revenue growth and forecast will continue to reflect the impact from changes related to the operational efficiency program we put in place in 2015, though SKU rationalization and business changes in countries like Venezuela and India continue to partially offset more significant gains in our core business. Excluding these impacts and the impact of acquisitions, our normalized organic operational growth would be 9%. And on the same basis, our companion animal program grew 15%, 1-5, and our livestock products grew 5%. Paul will provide more details on the breach from reported to normalized organic operational growth in his remarks. 
The growth in companion animal was based on strong performance by APOQUEL as well as our recently launched vaccines and SIMPARICA. 
In livestock, we saw growth coming from a recovery of cattle business in the U.S. In swine, the positive performance from the international segment was offset by a decline in the U.S. And in poultry, we declined globally due to market conditions and pressure from competition. We are improving our cost of sales and gross margin as we refine our manufacturing and network, execute our efficiency plan and focus on continuous improvement.
On an operational basis, our adjusted operating expenses was flat in the second quarter even as we grew revenues significantly, thanks to the ownership and mindset of our products and expense management discipline. 
The growth in revenues. Growth margin improvement and discipline on expenses resulted in adjusted net income growth of 22% operationally, once again supporting our long-term and value proposition to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue.
We always emphasize a full year view of our business to account for some of the seasonal situations and timing patterns in animal health, and we continue to see good progress through that lens. We're increasing our guidance for 2016 based on our strong performance in the first half of the year, the continued strength of our business model and the confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year. Paul will go through updates to 2016 guidance in his remarks. 
Now let me turn to the innovation in investment that are fueling our performance this year and positioning us well for the future value creation. At the beginning of the year, I said we needed to execute flawlessly on our new product launches, and I am very pleased with our progress. In the case of APOQUEL, it has become a very positive story. For the first half of 2016, we have exceeded $100 million in revenue. And since May, we have been supplying APOQUEL with no restrictions. Recently, we have launched in additional markets such as Brazil, Japan, Mexico and Russia. And in the coming months, we plan to introduce APOQUEL in the rest of approved markets such as Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay, as well as Singapore and Hong Kong. 
SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide for dogs, is now available to customers in U.S. and most of the European countries, and we expect it to be further deployed in Canada, Brazil and New Zealand during 2016. We are pleased with the launch of SIMPARICA, despite being the most recent entrant in a very competitive oral flea and tick market for dogs. At launch, SIMPARICA was introduced with extensive published data, showing its rapid onset of action, its sustained persistence of protection against fleas and ticks, and other advantages over various oral and topical parasiticides on the market. 
While new products have been a big lift for us recently, we continue to build on our major established product lines and focus on the lifecycle innovation that will keep our portfolio strong and sustainable. One of the strengths of our R&D utilization is ability to innovate across the basis of health care that veterinarians encounter, phases that include prediction, prevention and treatment. Our R&D begins with an understanding of the biology of diseases, their pathways and how they work. Then we complement them with customer insights that come from our commercial teams working shoulder to shoulder with veterinarians and producers, and we apply this knowledge across the phases of health care. 
We use innovations in genetics, diagnostics, and increasingly, digital platforms, to help predict risks or detect diseases in species. This means the ability to breed healthier and more productive animals, to detect disease earlier and to develop practices in form by bioinformatics, and this is our applications that capitalize on the use of big data. 
In the second quarter, for example, we continue to expand our business diagnostic franchise into new markets, with an additional approval in Spain for livestock, pets therapeutics. This point-of-care therapeutics deliver accurate, fast and clear resource that give our customers timely and informed diagnosis without disrupting their clinical consultation. 
Our customers are also seeking for new solutions to get ahead and help prevent infectious diseases. We have been placing a greater emphasis on our vaccine portfolio, some of which we introduced last year, and others that we continue to expand in terms of approvals and geographies. 
For example, in the second quarter, we expanded our VERSICAN Plus and VANGUARD vaccine franchises with new approvals in Europe and Canada. VERSICAN Plus, a combination vaccine that protect dogs against 10 canine diseases, was first approved in the European Union in 2014. And this quarter, we received additional approvals in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, for a smaller combination of antivaccine. 
Additionally, VERSICAN Plus rabies achieved approval for a new claim in the European Union, 3 years duration of immunity. 
Meanwhile, VANGUARD B Oral and VANGUARD crLyme vaccines were approved in Canada, after having just received their U.S. approval in December 2015. 
And finally, across the faces of health care, we developed medicines to treat sick animals. DRAXXIN, one of the Zoetis' largest global product lines, and was first introduced in 2015. And this quarter we received approval of a new label claim in Europe for DRAXXIN and DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective for treating swine respiratory disease. 
In addition to our internal R&D, we also look for partners that can help grow and strengthen our product portfolio. For example, in May, Zoetis launched in the U.S. a program called SILEO under an exclusive agreement with Orion Corporation. SILEO is the first and the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of noise aversion in dogs. And if you were in the U.S. this 4th of July, you probably read about or heard about this exciting new product that brought hope to many dog owners. 
In summary, we have continued our positive momentum through the first half of the year, based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and dedicated Zoetis colleagues. We continue to reap the benefits of a productive, world-class R&D organization focused on new programs and lifecycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. And we are executing on key product launches and our operational efficiency program to ensure our long-term growth and value creation. 
With that, let me turn the things over to Paul. Paul?"

Another solid quarter with lots of good things to cover, so let's get to it, starting with a quick walk down the P&L for the quarter. Then I'll provide some commentary on a number of areas that I believe will be helpful to understanding our quarter, our first half of 2016 and what you might expect for the balance of 2016. 
Before I start, I want to point out that the SKU rationalization and changes in business models we made in several international countries continue to have an impact on our revenue in 2016 and growth in revenue for 2016 compared with 2015. 
Now first, we're confident that the steps that we took and are taking to improve efficiency will put Zoetis in the position to deliver high profits and cash flows, and to better grow those profits and cash flows from here forward. 
Second, while we are going through this transition, we believe it's important that we and you have visibility into how the go-forward portion of our business is performing. So we've prepared analyses that strip the eliminated SKUs out of our revenue to show the underlying growth of the go-forward business. And on our website, you'll see slides and you'll find the table -- or tables, rather, that show our reported revenue growth for the second quarter and for the first half of 2016, and then walk you through the impacts of foreign currency, the operational efficiency changes related to SKUs and other business model changes, recent M&A, and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. 
The objective here is not to divert attention from our reported revenue growth rates. It's to provide perspective on how you might think about our future growth prospects in our 2D state. When we use the phrase operational growth, that means excluding the impact of changes in FX rates versus the same period the prior year. When we say normalized organic growth for any period compared with the prior year period, that means excluding the impact of FX, the eliminated SKUs, the business changes outside the U.S., the extra days in the first quarter of the year and the impact of recent M&A. 
So with that lengthy preamble, let's talk about the quarter. 
Our revenue grew 6% on an operational constant currency basis. We posted an adjusted gross margin of 67.9% in the quarter, resulting in an adjusted gross profit growing faster than revenue, up 11% on an operational basis. Adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis, reflecting the great progress we've made on our efficiency initiative. As Juan Ramón said, we are on track to deliver more than the previously announced $300 million savings associated with the efficiency initiative, and those savings are considered in our guidance for 2017. 
The combination of 11% operational growth of adjusted gross profit and the flat adjusted operating expenses enable us to grow adjusted EBIT for the quarter by 25% on an operational basis. Below the operating line, we had higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate on adjusted income, which together reduced the operational growth rate of adjusted net income to 22%. We put adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 on the board for the quarter. And the strong performance in the first half of the year enabled us to increase our guidance for the full year 2016 by 3% -- excuse me, $0.03 per share across the range. A solid quarter and a solid first half of the year for sure. 
So a bit deeper dive on revenue. The strongest quarter geographically was the U.S., up 10%, and by global business, it was companion animal, up 13%, and both of those on an operational basis. Of course, APOQUEL was an important driver of both. APOQUEL sales in the quarter were roughly $60 million. APOQUEL has a lot of revenue growth still ahead. And with SIMPARICA and a number of other recently introduced companion animal products, we expect our companion animal business to drive above market revenue growth through 2017. 
Our international segment was up 2% operationally and the global livestock business grew about 1% operationally. Both were disproportionately impacted by our SKU reductions and the changes we made to our operating models in countries, including Venezuela and India. On a flip side, global livestock is benefiting from M&A, mostly PHARMAQ. 
Now let's talk about the components of our operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. APOQUEL accounted for 3% of that growth. New products, other than APOQUEL, including our new companion animal vaccines, SIMPARICA, SYNOVEX ONE and SILEO, to name a few, added 2%. In-line products added 4%, with 3% coming from increased prices and 1% from volume. And M&A accounted for another 2%. The impact of the SKU reductions and the changes in business models reduced our growth by some 500 basis points, and that gets you to the 6% operational revenue growth for the quarter. Pretty good, right? Once again, our revenue growth came from a number of sources and reflects the strength of our diverse business model. 
Let's turn to our 2 segments, U.S. and international. Starting with the U.S. Overall, the U.S. business was up 10% in the quarter. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. grew 11% in the quarter. U.S. companion animal business was up 17%, mainly due to the ramp of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA and the introduction of other new products. Half of the growth was driven by the ramp of APOQUEL. U.S. livestock grew 2%, with a 4% pickup from increased selling prices that were offset in part by volume decreases related to some of the SKU reductions. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. livestock business delivered growth of 5% compared with 9% decline in Q1 of this year. The business rebounded nicely in Q2. And the year-to-date normalized organic growth rate for the U.S. livestock business was negative 3%. 
After the first quarter, there was some concern out there about the health of our U.S. livestock business. For the avoidance of doubt, after full store [ph], we expect our U.S. livestock business to deliver growth for the full year 2016 on a normalized organic basis. 
Within U.S. livestock, cattle, especially beef cattle, was particularly strong as the herd size and placements in feedlots were increasing and drove higher demand for our high-value injectable anti-infectives, vaccines and parasiticides and the recently launched SYNOVEX ONE implants. 
U.S. swine products experienced a decline due to competitions for Fostera PCV vaccines, new restrictions on the use of some of our products for pork exports to China, a decline of PEDv revenue, as the disease is no longer prevalent, and some eliminated SKUs. U.S. poultry revenue declined in the quarter with the impact of SKU rationalization more than offsetting growth from the increased use of our health maintenance products and MFAs for antibiotic-free production, products like Zoamix, for example. 
On to the international segment. Revenue from our international segment was up 2% operationally. On a normalized organic basis, the growth rate was 7%. On the same normalized organic basis, the international companion animal business led the way, up 10%, while international livestock was up 5% in the quarter. Again, both of those are on a normalized organic basis. 
It's worth spotlighting a few countries for you. China was up $14 million or 49% operationally. Pork prices in China were relatively high, leading to favorable conditions for pork producers and for our swine portfolio, including products like DRAXXIN, EXCEDE, in our vaccines. About 1/3 of the growth in China was driven by products purchased by producers to stock up ahead of label changes for some of our products. 
Finally, we had very successful spring promotions that drove increased sales of our REVOLUTION and VECTIMAX products in China 
In Brazil, cattle and companion animal sales were strong, but partially offset by weakness in poultry. The cattle portion of our livestock in Brazil enjoyed favorable market conditions, leading to strong performance from our vaccines and parasiticides. We also saw increased adoption of IMPROVAC in the swine business. 
Across the portfolio, we also benefited from increased selling prices. The poultry business saw high input prices and increased restrictions on exportation to Japan that made for a challenging market for poultry producers, and saw us lose a few accounts based on price. For the quarter, Brazil grew 6% operationally. 
Australia posted a solid 10% operational growth for the quarter, led by the launch of APOQUEL, the success of a promotional campaign for REVOLUTION and sales of anti-infectives for cattle. 
On the negative side of the growth ledger, in the U.K., we saw sales declined 21% operationally. The biggest factor is nearly half the decline was due to weather. A wet winter and spring delayed the cattle/sheep turnout seasons, and that was a factor. 
The second quarter was also negatively impacted as we were in the process of shipping the acquired Abbott products to our distribution, and we saw the channel accelerate purchases in the Q1 and work off the inventory in Q2. Year-to-date, the U.K. business is up 3% operationally. 
Finally, the group in other emerging countries declined 5% operationally, with the biggest drags being Venezuela and the SKU reductions. We saw growth across most other countries in this grouping, including through the addition of PHARMAQ revenue in Chile. 
So on revenue, high level, the beat goes on. Growth from many sources in a diversified models enables us to overcome softness in parts of our business, with strength in other areas. 
Now let's shift to the rest of the P&L. We posted a high gross margin, 67.9%, in the second quarter. But before we all start high-fiving each other, let's look at the factors that led to the 250 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Of the improvement, roughly 1/3 came from price increases, 1/3 from a mix shift toward a high-margin companion animal products and 1/3 came from other areas, mostly improvements in our supply chain efficiency. These 3 net positives experienced a bit of a headwind due to unfavorable movement of foreign currency. 
Our gross margin is improving, but it's not a one-way ratchet, and there were some seasonal elements that we expect to come into play in the second half of 2016. For example, sales of our livestock products are great as a percentage of total revenue in the second half of the year, and pricing promotions heading into the fall can lessen our net selling prices and, thereby, reduce gross margins in the period. These factors are expected to result in our reporting lower gross margins in the second half of the year as compared with the first half. 
And finally, there is, of course, FX. Predicting the timing and magnitude of FX changes on the cost of goods sold and on gross margin in short periods is very difficult. So that's a lot of discussion designed to caution you about assuming that our guidance for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue for 2016 and 2017 are conservative. 
There is good news here. We fully expect our gross margin to continue to improve over time based on increased selling prices, increased sales from our companion animal products versus livestock and increased efficiency in our supply chain. But the upward journey will not be linear quarter-to-quarter. 
Turning to adjusted operating expenses. There's really not a lot to say, except that we're on track to take out more than our target of $300 million operating cost by year-end. So we enter 2017 in our new leaned-out state. Total adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis when compared to Q2 of '15. 
Note that our operating expense base is not static. We've added costs, selling, marketing and R&D to the base via the PHARMAQ acquisition and to support the launch of SIMPARICA. And we may consider investing in promotion of certain key products or incremental R&D. The purpose of the efficiency initiative was to eliminate nonproductive expenditures, not to ignore high-value investments we can make in our business. At this stage, our 2D operating expense structure is what you see in our 2017 guidance table. 
We continued to demonstrate excellent expense discipline through the second quarter. And that, combined with the gross margin improvement, enabled us to pose operational growth of adjusted EBITDA of 25% for the quarter. Below the operating line, we had increased interest expense due to the note issuance in Q4 that's funded the PHARMAQ acquisition and prefunded the $400 million of debt that matured in the first quarter of the year. 
And our effective tax rate on adjusted income increased by some 100 basis points, mostly due to the change in our tax status in Belgium. 
Bottom line, our adjusted net income grew operationally 22% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% operationally, about 100 basis points faster than adjusted net income. That's our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 '16 were almost 1% less than in Q2 of '15. 
A couple of additional factors, I think, that you need to think about for the balance of 2016 and into '17. First, as always, FX. While there's been a bit of volatility in FX rates recently, notably with the British pound and the euro, the FX impact on the balance of our year and into 2017 is little changed from our last guidance update. The overall impact on our future expectations for our international operations, based on FX rates in late July, are negligible. That said, FX rates had a negative impact on our reported revenue and profit rates, decreasing revenue growth in Q2 by some 300 basis points compared with Q2 of '15 and adjusted net income growth by some 800 basis points. Contrast that with the 700 basis point drag on the reported revenue growth in Q1 and the 1,300 basis point drag on adjusted net income in Q1. 
So as we hoped on the last call, the impact of FX rates on our reported growth is moderating. Regardless, we continue to measure ourselves on a constant currency or operational basis. 
Next, the SKU reductions, including the changes we made to our business models in places like Venezuela and India, as we communicated on our last call, we expect the SKU reductions and business changes to decrease revenue growth by some 500 basis for the full year 2016. In Q1, the impact was roughly 400 basis points. In Q2, it was roughly 500 basis points. In year-to-date, it was roughly 500 basis points. I'll point out there's a little bit of rounding in there. You can see the impact to the SKU reductions in business model changes on the revenue growth in the charts that are on our website that I mentioned earlier. And I call your attention to those; I think they are helpful.
On to onetime costs. I won't use this time to walk through the table in the press release, but want to call your attention to the a contra expense item from the reversal of a portion of our severance accrual. At the time we recorded the accrual, we based it on the best information available. As it's worked out, we expect to pay out a little bit less in severance than we had thought, mainly due to a greater level of voluntary attrition than expected. From a cash out-the-door perspective, that's a good thing for us. For the avoidance of doubt, the reversal did not increase our adjusted net income, but it did increase our reported GAAP net income in the quarter and was a factor in narrowing the gap between adjusted earnings and generally accepted accounting principle earnings.
Finally, on to guidance. Today, we're updating our guidance for the full year 2015 for a couple of things. We've increased our revenue guidance range by $25 million to reflect the strength of our business in our improved invisibility now that went through the first half of 2016. And we moved our expectations for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue from a range of 33% to 34% to approximately 33%, so the favorable end of the range.
Adjusted EBIT projections have improved in a similar fashion, so that's been updated too.
We also updated our onetime cost to reflect the lower expectations for the severance point I just talked about. All other categories remain the same, and the result is that we've raised our guidance range for 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.03 to the range of $1.86 to $1.93 per share. Note that the operational growth rate for adjusted net income implied by our guidance increased by 100 basis points and is now a range of 10% to 14%. The majority of the increase in our guidance is operational, not FX-related. 
Now we can all do the math into what our guidance implies for the second half of the year for adjusted net income per share, and you may think that, that outlook is anomalous, given the second half revenue is expected to exceed revenue in the first half of the year. 
There are a couple of observations about the phasing of our business in 2016. First, we do expect second half revenues to exceed the first half. That's a good story. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to generate lower growth margins in the second half of the year than seen in the first half, due to mix and promotional programs reducing net selling prices and, therefore, gross margins. Next, our major promotional spending and operating expenses in support of our various product franchises are more weighted to the back half of the year. 
And finally, our R&D spending also skews to the second half of the year. Generally, the benefits of increased sales expected in the second half of the year compared with the first maybe more than offset by reduced gross margins in the phasing of spending on promotion programs -- promotional programs and R&D. 
So you all know I don't like to talk about quarters, but here are a couple of tips for phasing Q3 and Q4 '16. We expect Q4 to be our highest revenue quarter. We expect gross margin in the second half to be below those in Q1 and Q2. Selling expenses are expected to be heavier in the second half of the year, particularly heavy in Q4. And R&D spending in the second half is expected to be higher than in first half and heaviest in Q4. From adjusted net income perspective, Q3 may be the low quarter for the year. What's most important is that we raised our full year 2016 guidance of revenue by $25 million and our adjusted earnings per share by $0.03. This is all good stuff.
Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. We expect the more detailed look at 2017 at the time we report our third quarter. 
That's it from me. Keith, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A."

In beef, we have seen that the number of animals, it's larger than the previous year by 3%. In the second quarter, also, we saw that the number of placements in feedlots increased by 5%. On the total year, we expect that the number of animals will be about 3% higher than 2015. And also, the placements on the feedlot, even in the second half, will be lower than in the second quarter, we expect also to grow by about 3%. With all this, we expect that the cattle business for beef in the U.S. will be positive. We have seen also improvement in Australia because of the weather conditions. We have seen, also, that the fundamentals of the Brazilian remains very strong with even increasing exportations. So in our opinion, the cattle business for beef will be positive for the year. Dairy, prices are having a negative impact in the profitability of farmers around the world. In the U.S., we expect that the business will not be -- or revenues coming from dairy will not be a significant driver of growth. Although we have seen also that so far, farmers are not reducing the number of animals, so -- which also a good indication that we also expect improvement in pricing, pricing in the second half or first half of 2017. Swine, and for us, as we said that in the international business, it's doing extremely well. We expect this trend to continue in the second half. In the U.S., we are facing some competitive challenge that we also expect to start showing in the fourth and first quarter of the 2017. And poultry is the area in where we expect probably lesser positive evolution for our portfolio. But in general, we expect the livestock at the end of the year will be showing a positive growth."

There may be pockets where it's still there, but much more normalized than we're excited about prospects for APOQUEL. With respect to DTC, and you can think about DTC for both potentially 2 products, it's APOQUEL, could be Simparica, I'd just say that within our guidance, within our OpEx guidance for 2016 and 2017, there are dollars allocated for promotional programs including DTC. I think when I talked about, during my prepared remarks, not ignoring opportunities to invest to say we made assumptions about the level of promotional spend against all of our product franchises.

And, of course, our view is that when people -- you have an acute situation and you'll bring a dog in, is there's the opportunity where that dog can get excellent relief from using a product like APOQUEL and to the extent that it turns out that, that dog has seasonal issues, then, well it can move into a different category.

Look, let me say that it will be something that we will more likely address in detail later in the year. As I said, as we go through the process of looking at 2017 in some detail, and we'll come back to you, just state that we intend to return to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases capital that's not needed to invest productively within our business or for M&A. Yes, we -- I know a lot of you, we've been out in meetings, to say, you have a personal preference for share repurchase versus dividend. Let's leave that discussion for the fall."

So the question will be about the guidance and longer-term margin. So back in November 2014, the company issued the long-term guidance for the first time, given target 34% operating margin in 2017. So I'm wondering -- and since then, they just never reissued the long-term guidance and did not expand to further years. So I'm wondering if you're planning to provide longer-term guidance in the future, and -- or it was more like a one-time event in advance of restructuring announced later? And if there is no long-term guidance, how we should think about operating margins going forward? And if you can also specifically -- and what are the limits for operating margin growth? And what -- can you specifically quantify contribution from the product gross margin growth due to ongoing supply network rationalization initiative?"

So the first thing, almost 3 years ago or 2.5 years after we made this projection, we are confirming that in 2017, we'll be improving or reaching that 34% EBITDA margin. And moving from at that time, 25% that was projected there for the end of 2014 to 34%, it's a significant improvement. And I think, it's probably the confirmation of the predictability and the sustainability of our business. I think there are not too many companies that after 3 years, they can maintain what I consider was an aggressive target of improving our margins by 900 basis points. Now I will turn to Paul to provide some additional comments."

And I want to be real clear, so why -- one, why did we provide long-term guidance?

And I want to be real clear, so why -- one, why did we provide long-term guidance? We provided that because we knew the steps that we were about to embark on would include the SKU rationalization, the change in business models outside the U.S. and a pretty substantial change in our OpEx base. In light of that, outside parties trying to forecast what we would look like in '16 and then in '17, you would have had no chance to really be able to be somewhat accurate. And so we felt compelled to provide longer-term guidance to let people determine through their own models whether they were in the neighborhood of what we were thinking or they had a difference of opinion. I think that was a one-time event. We, like most other companies, are reverting to having just -- or we'll revert to having just 1 year worth of guidance on the streets. So we'll provide the update, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for '17 later this year. And then we'll have 2017 on the board. But I really want to focus on a comment, Vlad, that you made around the 34% kind of operating EBIT margin -- or, excuse me, adjusted EBIT margin target that you referenced. Because I want to be really, really clear, we're not targeting the maximum operating margin. We're seeking to maximize our cash flow and grow it at a fast rate. If that's at a 33% margin, that's okay. If that's at a 36% margin, yes, that's okay, too. But it's not focus -- focusing solely on what is that margin, and let's maximize that margin. We're looking at maximizing earnings as a proxy for cash flow and then growing it as quickly and for as long as we can at an attractive rate. Now separately, I believe you asked about what -- is there an upper limit? One of the advantages of our company is that we have a wonderful, global footprint where we have scale to support that global footprint. And generally, not completely, but generally, we have the ability to drive a lot more revenue on the infrastructure that we have deployed around the globe. So the answer is, yes, we have the ability to continue to leverage our cost structure and thereby improve that operating margin. But what I don't want people to do is to focus on a, say, 33% or 35% -- and look at that, well, gee, that's less than I thought. The goal is not limited to continue to drive that percentage. It's to maximize profit, cash flow, grow it, and grow it fast and grow it for a long time. So I've rambled a little bit there, but I hope I covered your question."

So I would say that all the efforts in terms of commercial and R&D are mostly completed.

And we wanted to make sure that while we were transitioning to a different model, a more efficient model, we were ensuring that compliance of any type of finance, tax or IT element, so -- but we have no doubt that by the end of the year, all the programs will be in place and we'll start 2017 with a new base. In terms of SKUs, I said most of the work has been completed. And there are only some SKUs that we'll be eliminating from now until the end of the year. And this will be also with the introduction of new product that also will help us to minimize the negative impact of this last SKU rationalization. The other area that is still work in progress, but also progressing in line with expectations, it's the manufacturing changes. We exit the 7 plants that we targeted. There is 1 plant that is still in progress, but 5 have been sold, 1 has been exited and the other 1 is in process. So in that area, things are progressing very well.

And we have 3 buckets in our R&D expenses. One is related to regulatory expenses about 15%, 1-5. And then the other 85%, it's split between new product innovation and lifecycle innovation. So we are investing significantly to keep our current portfolio updated and competitive. So how much are we generating in terms of growth in line compared to new products and price? So we described that the animal health industry will be growing at 5% to 6% in the next coming years. About half of this 5% to 6% will be related to price. And then in line, we'll have half of the growth, our new products are half of the remaining growth. The ability of Zoetis and other companies to grow faster than this 5% to 6% will come from new products. So in 2016, excluding the impact of SKU rationalization in the second quarter, this organic operational growth -- normalized organic operational growth is 9%. So how much of it came from the price? It was about 3% from price. New products also generated a significant part of this growth. And the in-line portfolio, it was growing volume by 1%. So the rest of the portfolio; APOQUEL, generated 3 percentage points; other new products, another 2 percentage points. You see that the new products in the second quarter were generating about 500 basis points out of this 900 normalized organic operational growth. And this is what we also expect for the future. For the future, we have communicated that we plan that to grow in line or faster than market. In '17, based on our guidance, we plan that to grow faster than the market, and this faster growth will come from new product launches."

We described many times China as the largest producer of pork in the world.

And we expect that this will represent a big opportunity for companies like Zoetis that can offer products that will increase the productivity and the quality and safety of the production in China. We also have seen opportunities in other species like cattle. The objective, for us, in cattle is to build stronger portfolio, and especially to build stronger portfolio in vaccines. And the way that we're doing that is: First, trying to get approval for portfolio that is already available in other markets, also in China; and second, to invest in R&D locally to produce specific vaccines for cattle, for swine and also for poultry. And this is the strategy that we are following, and we are convinced that China will continue growing. And not only livestock, we've seen a significant success in our portfolio in companion animal. We have now a portfolio, which is covering vaccines and covering some other products. We still have the opportunity in China to approve APOQUEL in the future, to approve Simparica.

So we want -- we focused during this period, until a full license, on providing this [indiscernible] and to get the experience of using this product, and also to develop all the data that will support the approval, the full license of IL-31. The feedback from the market so far is very positive. And again, it's very complementary to APOQUEL. APOQUEL will be in both acute and chronic. IL-31, being a product which is injectable, maybe we will position more in chronic than acute, but still will be opportunities for both indications. And the -- as I said, in terms of efficacy, greater response from the veterinarians, mainly dermatologists and some experienced veterinarians. And also great on safety. So I think all the indications are very positive to IL-31. And this will be, as I said, very complementary to our atopic dermatitis franchise, dermatologic or itching conditions. And we are very pleased with what we're doing. Last comment on Simparica. So we consider Simparica as a platform. So the active ingredient of Simparica will be used for combinations of products, also for oral, for topical, and we're convinced that this will be a significant product in our portfolio.

There has been a lot written lately about the animal health industry, livestock in particular. And the cycle that we face as part of the global food supply chain. Let me start by saying that I'm a very pleased",1397,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. 
There has been a lot written lately about the animal health industry, livestock in particular. And the cycle that we face as part of the global food supply chain. 
Let me start by saying that I'm a very pleased to the positive result we have reported in the third quarter because it reaffirms that we understand the cycles of our customers and businesses. And as in the past, we continue to be resilient in our ability to adapt and steadily grow our business despite the broader agriculture market changes. 
At Zoetis, we have regularly grown faster than the market circle, and we are very well positioned to achieve predictable growth within these cycles because of our diverse portfolio and global scope. 
We remain focused on the long term. Full year review of our review of our business since quarterly results can be misleading about the cycles in our customers markets. Our strength in all relevant geographies, species and specific careers help us offset many of the economic and business challenges that can affect part of the animal health industry in the near term. 
We also making improvements in our cost structure. And the reallocating resources to the most important growth opportunities in animal health from therapeutic carrier and geographical perspective. I'm pleased to say that we have nearly completed our operational efficiency initiative, and we can confirm that we expect to exceed the target of $300 million in cost savings by the end of 2017. 
We also now expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34% to 35% in 2017, higher than our original projection and we expect to grow our revenues faster than the market again in 2017. 
This quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew our revenue 4% operationally. We had particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. When you exclude the impact of our operational efficiency initiative, foreign exchange and acquisitions, all what we call normalized organic operational growth, our growth in the third quarter was 6%. 
On the same normalized basis, our companion animal [ph] grew 11% and our livestock products grew 2%. The companion animal growth was driven by food supply of APOQUEL and interaction of products. 
In the livestock, the main driver of growth was strength in our international markets, which were able to offset the impact of produce rationalization changes across the livestock portfolio. 
Moving forward, we expect companion animal to be the main contributor to growth in the fourth quarter and in 2017. And in terms of livestock, we expect improved growth as we get beyond the product rationalization impact this year. 
Moving onto earnings. We grew adjusted earnings 6% operationally, reflecting the negative impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate. Glenn will discuss this in more detail. But excluding tax and interest, our EBITDA growth was 17%. 
As we finish up 2016, we are increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to reflect the strong performance we have achieved through the first 9 months of the year and based on the market trends we see and the confidence in our business, we are also improving our guidance for 2017 despite the recent negative evolution of our currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. 
Let me provide additional business update on some key products and discuss the investments we are making to support that growth. For the first 9 months of 2016, we have generated approximately $180 million in revenue for APOQUEL, with about $70 million coming in the third quarter. 
We have here an excellent response from veterinarians and pet owners using APOQUEL as we increase our penetration in new markets. Our research indicates that we are achieving great awareness and satisfaction among veterinarians, as well as more frequent proactive request from pet owners. 
APOQUEL has now been launched with unrestricted supply in all approved markets, and we are working on further expanding its market share. In the U.S., we have seen the growth of new patients since achieving food supply in May. APOQUEL has been doing very well in treating the dogs with chronic allergies, and we are increasingly seeking its use for more seasonal and acute allergy causes, an important part of our expansion plans. 
As we look ahead with APOQUEL, we are trying additional ways to support this product growth. For example, in the U.S., we are developing and testing direct-to-consumer or DTC advertising and we expect to launch a national advertising campaign for APOQUEL in 2017. 
Also to support the growth of our companion animal business, we have also been expanding our product portfolios and field force in China and Brazil. These are great examples on how our efficiency initiative is ultimately about better allocating resources to generate sales growth. 
Meanwhile, SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide products, is available in the U.S. and most of the EU countries, and it is being further deployed in markets like Canada and Brazil. 
In 2017, SIMPARICA will be available for the flu, flea and tick season in the U.S. and EU. We are planning to support SIMPARICA with additional promotional investment to ensure it has a positive impact in our revenue growth in 2017. We are also getting ready for a broader launch of our canine antibody therapy targeting IL-31. This therapy is currently only available in the U.S. and under conditional license. 
And in October, we expanded our effort on dermatology specialist and made it available to all the veterinarians in the U.S. We will broaden the in the weeks ahead, and we expect to receive a full USDA license by the end of the year with Europe to follow next year. 
We are also seeing good progress with the PHARMAQ acquisition that we made 1 year ago. We have posted $64 million in [ph] revenue through the first 9 months of the year. Despite the toxic algae bloom that has been impacting the fish pharmacy in Chile. PHARMAQ has achieved rapid adoption of its alpha check, [ph] vaccine for [ph]. 
Fish farmers who needed a more predictable and reliable means of protection have responded very favorably to recent information that [ph] has already been demonstrated protection up to 11 months after vaccination, and we continue testing for the longer duration of efficacy. Fish farmers also view this vaccine as an important way to reduce the use of antibiotics in their operations. 
Now let me turn to the R&D innovations that continue supporting our growth and value creation. New product introductions like APOQUEL, the IL-31 antibody therapy, SIMPARICA and the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine are very important. That continues innovation over the lifecycle of our product is also critical to our long-term success. 
In the third quarter, we had several approvals of new indications and formulations for key livestock products. In swine, we obtained approvals in the U.S. for new combinations of our future XP vaccine. This now helps guard against additional flu strains that threaten swine herd health. We also expanded our FOSTERA swine vaccine with additional indications and approve also in markets like Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Our premium injectable and vaccine receive additional indications and approvals in Japan and Canada. 
We also obtained approval in Japan for BOPRIVA, a unique vaccine that temporarily reduce testosterone in bowls, providing farmers with a highly effective way to manage aggressive behavior. 
We also make investments and showing progress in our diagnosis portfolio. In August, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices, or SMB. They are pioneers in developing the manufacturing microfluidic “lab on a chip” diagnostic analyzers products, which are used for veterinary point-of-care services. SMB's promising pipeline has helped our existing diagnostic business which obtain approval for values in test kits in the third quarter in new markets, such as Mexico, Japan and Korea. 
Lots of good news to share about our new products, lifecycle innovation and business development activities. 
In summary, we have continued to demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio across geographies and species. And this time, we see particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. We are realizing the benefits of this disciplined approach to R&D and business development, which is strengthening our business for the long-term. And we expect to achieve our operational efficiency initiative target in 2017 and set ourselves on a path to increase profitability to generation and value generation while maintaining our revenue goals. 
With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?"

Before I get into the financials, I want to thank many of you to reaching out and speaking with me since I became CFO in August. I'm very excited to take on this role and work with the rest of the Zoetis leaders to continue driving",2035,"Thank you, Juan Ramón. Before I get into the financials, I want to thank many of you to reaching out and speaking with me since I became CFO in August. I'm very excited to take on this role and work with the rest of the Zoetis leaders to continue driving the performance of the company. 
As CFO, I am committed to maintaining our reputation for financial integrity and transparency and continuing an ongoing dialogue with the investment community. 
We remain focused on achieving our updated financial guidance for 2016 and 2017. Building our capacity for long-term revenue and earnings growth, and delivering innovation and financial performance that people have come to expect from Zoetis. 
I am pleased to say that in my first quarter as CFO, that we are making excellent progress in all those fronts, and we are raising our earnings guidance for 2016 and improving our earnings guidance for 2017 despite the negative impact of foreign currency, which was approximately $0.03. 
The consistent performance we've delivered over time with recent periods of major efficiency initiatives and change is a testament to the quality and commitment of our Zoetis colleagues. 
So what are the key takeaways for the third quarter results? Continued strong operational revenue growth from our diverse portfolio, continued improvement in our adjusted EBIT growth and margin, a meaningful contribution from several new product launches, lifecycle innovations and targeted business development activities. And finally, an updated guidance for 2016 and 2017 that reflects our recent performance and confidence in the future. 
Now, let me walk you through the major pieces of our third quarter income statement and provide some color. We generally talk about operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency. You can also see once again in the tables on our website that we are providing additional detail and impact related to our operational efficiency initiative, M&A and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. We refer to the revenue growth, excluding these items as normalized organic operational growth. 
For the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 4%, which excludes a 2% negative impact of foreign exchange. Now, let me take you through the key elements of our performance and bridge that to our normalized growth. First, APOQUEL and a number of other new products contributed 5% of our revenue growth. The [ph] portfolio grew 1% with price contributing 2% and volume declining 1%. Recent M&A contributed 3% to our growth, while our operational efficiency initiative reduced our growth by 5% due to product rationalizations and changes to our business in markets like Venezuela and India. 
Accounting for all of these factors, we delivered normalized organic operational growth of 6% in the quarter. And for the first 9 months of the year, our revenue growth on this basis was 7%, in line with our view of 7% to 8% growth for the full year. 
Turning now to our segment performance. In terms of the U.S., we generated 1% operational growth compared to a very strong third quarter in the previous year. Just a reminder, the U.S. grew 19% in Q3 2015, with livestock growing 13% and companion animal growing 27%. 
In the third quarter of 2016, U.S. companion animal products grew 5%, driven by APOQUEL, SIMPARICA and other new product launches like our new vaccines. This growth was partially offset by a decline in surgical fluid products. In U.S. livestock, we declined by 2% against the very strong year ago quarter when we grew 13%. The decline was primarily due to the impact of SKU eliminations, lower sales of our swine products, where we continue to see increased competition, as well as the impact of a challenging market environment, especially for our cattle and swine customers. We partially offset this decline with growth in our cattle business with successful promotional activity drove increased volumes. 
Shifting back to a normalized organic operational growth basis, U.S. grew 3%, with companion animal growing 6% and livestock growing 1%. 
Turning to International. Revenue grew 6% operationally. We delivered very strong operational growth of 15% in companion animal and 2% in livestock. Our international business saw a significant impact from our operational efficiency initiatives, which reduced growth by 8%. By species group, the impact was 9% in livestock and 6% in companion animal. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 5% to our international revenue growth. Based on these factors, our normalized organic operational growth for International was 9%, with companion animal growth of 21% and livestock growth of 4%. 
You can see the full results for our top 11 markets in the table, but let me highlight a few items. Growth in markets like Japan, Brazil, Germany and Australia was primarily from companion animal products and launches of APOQUEL. In Japan, we saw a significant benefits from the initial stocking of APOQUEL with wholesalers in the quarter. France and Canada both saw a mix of companion animal and livestock sales driving their growth, including sales of APOQUEL and a more stable environment in France around antibiotic usage and prior regulatory changes. 
Meanwhile, we continue to see livestock supported with growth in cattle in Brazil and swine in China, where we currently have favorable market conditions, as well as growth in companion animal in China, where we are seeing positive trends in medicalization rates for pets. 
Overall, we have been very pleased with the strong growth we've seen in emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, where we have invested in expanding our field force and product portfolios to effectively capitalize on the fast-growing trends in these countries. We'll continue to deploy selling resources into these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. 
Wrapping up the revenue picture. There are 5 key takeaways for the third quarter. Our diversified model continues to deliver steady, predictable and meaningful revenue growth with, strong product lines and geographies balancing the effect of certain market challenges and cycles. 
Product rationalization continues to impact revenue growth, however, we continued to deliver strong growth on a normalized basis. APOQUEL, once again, was a significant growth driver with launches in new markets and continued expansion of the customer base into existing markets. 
Other companion animal products like SIMPARICA and the recent additions to our vaccine portfolio are contributing to growth. And finally, when it comes to revenue, we are improving the base business in various emerging markets by expanding our product portfolio and adding to our direct sales capability. Turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin improved 120 basis points, primarily due to a more profitable mix of products. While foreign exchange had a negative impact of 70 basis points this quarter. Adjusted operating expense also declined, reflecting the continued realization of our operational efficiency changes and continued discipline around SG&A, which includes the addition of PHARMAQ expenses this year. Improved gross margin and reduction in operating expense is enabled us to grow our adjusted EBIT by 17% operationally versus the 4% operational revenue growth. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.6% versus 25.1% in the year ago quarter. This difference was primarily driven by the impact of the European Commission tax ruling earlier this year and the benefit of certain discrete items in the year ago quarter. 
As a result, adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, reflecting the change to our adjusted tax rate and higher interest expense, which offset much of our adjusted EBIT growth. For the quarter, GAAP net income grew 26% on a reported basis, aid by a reduction in [ph] cost and restructuring charges, as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets related to the establishment of our new international operating model. 
Moving to guidance for full year 2016. We are now into the high end of our revenue range and increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to reflect our ongoing confidence in the momentum of our new products and the sustainable cost benefits of our operational efficiency initiative. As you model out the remainder of 2016, remember that we have 5 fewer days in Q4 2016 and Q4 2015, and this is usually our highest quarter in terms of operating expenses as a percent of revenue and lowest quarter for gross margin due to the seasonal nature of our product mix. 
For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth, including the impact from products rationalization, of 4% to 5% and adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 32% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 12% to 15%. The significant increase in our guidance for reported diluted EPS is due to our increased outlook for the business and a favorable tax items realized in Q3. 
Moving to 2017. Since our last update in August, changes in FX rates have lowered our views for revenue by $50 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03. However, the overall evolution in our business over the past year has positive unbalance as our companion animal dermatology portfolio continues to grow and several livestock markets in our international business are strengthening. These changes are allowing us to increase the low end of our revenue range and maintaining the high end while absorbing the negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Cost of goods remains the same at 32% to 33% as we have been successful in our cost reduction efforts, as well as our SKU rationalization that has brought an improvement mix. On SG&A, FX changes works slightly in our favor. However, we are increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end as we allocate a portion of our cost savings to promising investment opportunities, such as advertising and promotion investments in key companion animal franchises like APOQUEL and SIMPARICA that will drive revenue starting in 2017 and over the next several years. Field force expansions in Brazil and China where we see sustainable growth drivers and opportunities for increased market share; and enhancements to our diagnostic commercial capabilities following the acquisition of SMB. 
We are also taking on the necessary R&D investments to develop SMB's pipeline, as well as investing additional R&D dollars for some of our key international growth markets. When you take all of these changes together, we are increasing the lower end of our adjusted EPS range, maintaining the high end of $2.38 despite the negative impact of foreign currency, while also improving our view for adjusted EBIT margin to be between 34% and 35%. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we do want to point out that we are currently expecting the delivery of full year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year for a few reasons. First, we will have some lingering effects from the operational efficiency initiative in the first 2 quarters as we continue to sell out remaining inventory in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. Second, a portion of our revenue growth is dependent upon the ramping up of new product launches, which we expect to build throughout the year. Finally, many of the incremental investments we are making on the SG&A line are weighted towards the first half of the year and begin to deliver results in the revenue line as the year goes on. 
A final point on capital allocation. We are continuing to repurchase shares at a steady rate of $75 million per quarter. At this rate, we will revise our current plan that the end of this year. Share repurchase will continue to be an important element of our capital allocation framework, and we will provide a more specific update later this year. 
So wrapping up. We've improved our outlook for revenue. We've achieved our retargeted cost structure. We are presently taking on investment in long-term growth. We've improved our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin and we've improved our review for EPS. It has been a tremendous effort to get where we are. We're proud of what we've achieved to-date, and we're excited to continue moving the business to new heights. 
With that, I'll had things over to the operator to open the lines for your questions. Operator?"

It Juan Ramón. Well on the question on the livestock and how we plan to grow this business in price or other call them growth, definitely we continue applying the same strategy in terms of rising that can be justified through outcome and providing the value to our customers. We continue having these prices very constantly over the years, and we also plan to continue increasing these prices in the future. In the U.S., as we reported, we -- livestock in this quarter grew by 1% in terms of normalized growth. So, excluding the impact of SKU or currency or M&A. If we go to the sales of the drivers of these growth, cattle grow by low single-digit, slow decline and poultry have double-digit growth. So talking about the cattle and also the situation on the feedlots and all the friends that are affecting this segment for me the driver at the factor that are impacting the cattle business in the U.S. So 1, is more animals, which is positive. We have seen also in this quarter the higher placement of animals in feedlots and other positive element. But there are other elements, which are negative, and we have seen that in the quarter. So first, the producers are losing money. Animals are entering heavier into the feedlots. And also we have experiencing mill weather conditions in the U.S. that are driving the lower disease incident. So net-net, compared to 1 year ago, we think that the situation is less positive. But still, with this situation, we have been able to grow the business and the reason why we are growing is because of our portfolio. The ability also to increase prices and also the team, which is interacting with customers. The last comment I want to make here is that this is a business livestock, which is affected by cycles. Cycles that has been affecting in the past as we continue in the future. Despite of this cycles, have been very resilient and showing very steady growth. In the past 5 to 6, and we also expect in the future despite of our cycles, where we will continue growing at the same rate. And definitely, we see Zoetis also growing in 2017 in livestock, in line with the market."

There has been a lot written lately about the animal health industry, livestock in particular, and the cycles we face as part of the global food supply chain. 
Let me start by saying that I'm a very pleased with the positive result we have reported in the third quarter because it reaffirms that we understand the cycles of our customers and businesses. And as in the past, we continue to be resilient in our ability to adapt and steadily grow our business despite the broader agriculture market changes. 
At Zoetis, we have regularly grown faster than the market, and we are very well positioned to achieve predictable growth within these cycles because of our diverse portfolio on global scope. 
We remain focused on the long term. Full year review of our business, since they are quarterly results, can be misleading about the cycles in our customers markets. Our strength in all relevant geographies, species and therapeutic areas help us offset many of the economic and business challenges that can affect part of the animal health industry in the near term. 
We also making improvements in our cost structure. And reallocating resources with the most important growth opportunities in animal health from therapeutic area and geographical perspective. I'm pleased to say, we have nearly completed our operational efficiency initiative, and we can confirm that we expect to exceed the target of $300 million in cost savings by the end of 2017. 
We also now expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34% to 35% in 2017, higher than our original projection, and we expect to grow our revenues faster than the market again in 2017. 
This quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew our revenue 4% operationally with a particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. When you exclude the impact of our operational efficiency initiative, foreign exchange and acquisitions, all, what we call, normalized organic operational growth, our growth in the third quarter was 6%. 
On the same normalized basis, our companion animal products grew 11%, and our livestock products grew 2%. The companion animal growth was driven by food supply of APOQUEL and interaction of all the new products. 
In the livestock, the main driver of growth was strength in our international markets, which were able to offset the impact of produce rationalization changes across the livestock portfolio. 
Moving forward, we expect companion animal to be the main contributor to growth in the fourth quarter and in 2017. And in terms of livestock, we expect improved growth as we get beyond the product rationalization impacts this year. 
Moving onto earnings. We grew adjusted earnings 6% operationally, reflecting the negative impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate. Glenn will discuss this in more detail. But excluding tax and interest, our EBITDA growth was 17%. 
As we finish up 2016, we are increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to reflect the strong performance we have achieved through the first 9 months of the year. And based on the market trends we see and the confidence in our business, we are also improving our guidance for 2017 despite the recent negative evolution of currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. 
Let me provide additional business updates on some key products and discuss the investments we are making to support that growth. For the first 9 months of 2016, we have generated approximately $180 million in revenue for APOQUEL, with about $70 million coming in the third quarter. 
We have here an excellent response from veterinarians and pet owners using APOQUEL as we increase our penetration in new markets. Our research indicates that we are achieving a great awareness and satisfaction among veterinarians as well as more frequent proactive request from pet owners. 
APOQUEL has now been launched with unrestricted supply in all approved markets, and we are working on further expanding its market share. In the U.S., we have seen the growth of new patients since achieving food supply in May. APOQUEL has been doing very well in treating the dogs with chronic allergies, and we are increasingly seeing its use for more seasonal and acute allergy causes, an important part of our expansion plans. 
As we look ahead with APOQUEL, we are trying additional ways to support this product growth. For example, in the U.S., we are developing and testing direct-to-consumer or DTC advertising, and we expect to launch a national advertising campaign for APOQUEL in 2017. 
Also to support the growth of our companion animal business, we have also been expanding our product portfolios and field force in China and Brazil. These are great examples on how our efficiency initiative is ultimately about better allocating resources, which generate sales growth. 
Meanwhile, Simparica, our new oral parasiticide products, is available in the U.S. and most of the EU countries, and it is being further deployed in markets like Canada and Brazil. 
In 2017, Simparica will be available for the flu, flea and ticks season in the U.S. and EU. We are planning to support Simparica with additional promotional investment to ensure it has a positive impact in our revenue growth in 2017. We are also getting ready for a broader launch of our canine antibody therapy targeting IL-31. This therapy is currently only available in the U.S. under a conditional license. 
And in October, we expanded our effort beyond dermatology specialist and made it available to all the veterinarians in the U.S. We will broaden this duration in the weeks ahead, and we expect to receive a full USDA license by the end of the year with Europe to follow next year. 
We are also seeing good progress with the PHARMAQ acquisition that we made 1 year ago. We have posted $64 million in fish revenue through the first 9 months of the year, despite the toxic algae bloom that has been impacting the fish pharmacy in Chile. PHARMAQ has achieved rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmonid fish. 
Fish farmers, who needed a more predictable and reliable means of protection, have responded very favorably to recent information that LiVac SRS has already been demonstrated protection up to 11 months after vaccination, and we continue testing for longer duration of efficacy. Fish farmers also view this vaccine as an important way to reduce the use of antibiotics in their operations. 
Now let me turn to the R&D innovations that continue supporting our future growth and value creation. New product introductions like APOQUEL, the IL-31 antibody therapy, Simparica and the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine are very important. That continues innovation over the lifecycle of our products is also critical to our long-term success. 
In the third quarter, we had several approvals of new indications and formulations for key livestock products. In swine, we obtained approvals in the U.S. for new combinations of our FluSure XP vaccine. This now helps guard against additional flu strains that threaten swine herd health. We also expanded our Fostera swine vaccine with additional indications and approve in markets like Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Our premium injectable anti-infective for DRAXXIN received additional indications and approvals in Japan and Canada. 
We also obtained approval in Japan for BOPRIVA, a unique vaccine that temporarily reduce testosterone in bulls, providing farmers with a highly effective way to manage aggressive behavior. 
We also make investments and showing progress in our diagnostic portfolio. In August, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices, or SMB. They are pioneers in developing the manufacturing microfluidic “lab on a chip” diagnostic products, which are used for veterinary point-of-care services. SMB's promising pipeline has helped our existing diagnostic business, which obtained approval for values in test kits in the third quarter in new markets, such as Mexico, Japan and Korea. Lots of good news to share about our new products, lifecycle innovation and business development activities. 
In summary, we have continued to demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio across geographies and species. And this time, we see particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. We are realizing the benefits of disciplined approach to R&D and business development, which is strengthening our business for the long term. And we expect to achieve our operational efficiency initiative target in 2017 and set ourselves on a path to increase profitability, cash generation and value creation while maintaining our revenue goals. 
With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?"

Before I get into the financials, I wanted to thank many of you for reaching out and speaking with me since I became CFO in August. I'm very excited to take on this role and work with the rest of Zoetis leaders to continue driving the performance of our company. 
As CFO, I am committed to maintaining our reputation for financial integrity and transparency and continuing an ongoing dialogue with the investment community. 
We remain focused on achieving our updated financial guidance for 2016 and 2017. Building our capacity for long-term revenue and earnings growth and delivering innovation and financial performance that people have come to expect from Zoetis. 
I am pleased to say that in my first quarter as CFO, that we are making excellent progress on all those fronts, and we are raising our earnings guidance for 2016 and improving our earnings guidance for 2017 despite the negative impact of foreign currency, which was approximately $0.03. The consistent performance we've delivered over time through recent periods of major efficiency initiatives and change is a testament to the quality and commitment of our Zoetis colleagues. 
So what are the key takeaways for the third quarter results? Continued strong operational revenue growth from our diverse portfolio, continued improvement in our adjusted EBIT growth and margin, a meaningful contribution from several new product launches, lifecycle innovations and targeted business development activities. And finally, an updated guidance for 2016 and 2017 that reflects our recent performance and confidence in the future. 
Now, let me walk you through the major pieces of our third quarter income statement and provide some color. We generally talk to operational growth, which excludes the impacts of foreign currency. You can also see once again in the tables on our website that we are providing additional detail and impacts related to our operational efficiency initiatives, M&A, and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. We refer to the revenue growth, excluding these items as normalized organic operational growth. 
For the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 4%, which excludes a 2% negative impact of foreign exchange. Now, let me take you through the key elements of our performance and bridge that to our normalized growth. First, APOQUEL and a number of other new products contributed 5% of our revenue growth. The in-line portfolio grew 1% with price contributing 2% and volume declining 1%. Recent M&A contributed 3% to our growth, while our operational efficiency initiative reduced our growth by 5% due to product rationalizations and changes to our business in markets like Venezuela and India. 
Accounting for all of these factors, we delivered normalized organic operational growth of 6% in the quarter. And for the first 9 months of the year, our revenue growth on this basis was 7%, in line with our view of 7% to 8% growth for the full year. 
Turning now to our segment performance. In terms of the U.S., we generated 1% operational growth compared to a very strong third quarter in the previous year. Just a reminder, the U.S. grew 19% in Q3 2015, with livestock growing 13% and companion animal growing 27%. 
In the third quarter of 2016, U.S. companion animal products grew 5%, driven by APOQUEL, Simparica and other new product launches like our new vaccines. This growth was partially offset by a decline in surgical fluid products. In U.S. livestock, we declined by 2% against the very strong year ago quarter when we grew 13%. The decline was primarily due to the impact of SKU eliminations, lower sales of our swine products, where we continue to see increased competition as well as the impact of a challenging market environment, especially for our cattle and swine customers. We partially offset this decline with growth in our cattle business with successful promotional activity drove increased volumes. 
Shifting back to a normalized organic operational growth basis, U.S. grew 3%, with companion animal growing 6% and livestock growing 1%. 
Turning to International. Revenue grew 6% operationally. We delivered very strong operational growth of 15% in companion animal and 2% in livestock. Our international business saw a significant impact from our operational efficiency initiatives, which reduced growth by 8%. By species group, the impact was 9% in livestock and 6% in companion animal. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 5% to our international revenue growth. Based on these factors, our normalized organic operational growth for International was 9%, with companion animal growth of 21% and livestock growth of 4%. 
You can see the full results for our top 11 markets in the tables, but let me highlight a few items. Growth in markets like Japan, Brazil, Germany and Australia was primarily from companion animal products and launches of APOQUEL. In Japan, we saw a significant benefit from the initial stocking of APOQUEL with wholesalers in the quarter. France and Canada both saw a mix of companion animal and livestock sales driving their growth, including sales of APOQUEL and a more stable environment in France around antibiotic usage and prior regulatory changes. 
Meanwhile, we continue to see livestock supported with growth in cattle in Brazil and swine in China, where we currently have favorable market conditions as well as growth in companion animal in China, where we are seeing positive trends in medicalization rates for pets. 
Overall, we have been very pleased with the strong growth we've seen in emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, where we have invested in expanding our field force and product portfolios to effectively capitalize on the fast-growing trends in these countries. We'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. 
Wrapping up the revenue picture. There are 5 key takeaways for the third quarter. Our diversified model continues to deliver steady, predictable and meaningful revenue growth with strong product lines and geographies balancing the effects of certain market challenges and cycles. 
Product rationalization continues to impact revenue growth, however, we continued to deliver strong growth on a normalized basis. APOQUEL, once again, was a significant growth driver with launches in new markets and continued expansion of the customer base in existing markets. 
Other companion animal products like Simparica and recent additions to our vaccine portfolio are contributing to growth. And finally, when it comes to revenue, we're improving the base business in various emerging markets by expanding our product portfolio and adding to our direct sales capability. 
Turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin improved 120 basis points, primarily due to a more profitable mix of products. While foreign exchange had a negative impact of 70 basis points this quarter. Adjusted operating expense also declined, reflecting the continued realization of our operational efficiency changes and continued discipline around SG&A, which includes the addition of PHARMAQ expenses this year. Improved gross margin and reduction in operating expenses enabled us to grow our adjusted EBIT by 17% operationally versus the 4% operational revenue growth. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.6% versus 25.1% in the year ago quarter. This difference was primarily driven by the impact of the European Commission tax ruling earlier this year and the benefit of certain discrete items in the year ago quarter. 
As a result, adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, reflecting the change to our adjusted tax rate and higher interest expense, which offset much of our adjusted EBIT growth. For the quarter, GAAP net income grew 26% on a reported basis, aided by a reduction in stand-up costs and restructuring charges as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets related to the establishment of our new international operating model. 
Moving to guidance for full year 2016. We are now into the high end of our revenue range and increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to reflect our ongoing confidence in the momentum of our new products and the sustainable cost benefits of our operational efficiency initiative. As you model out the remainder of 2016, remember that we have 5 fewer days in Q4 2016 than Q4 2015, and this is usually our highest quarter in terms of operating expenses as a percent of revenue and our lowest quarter for gross margin due to the seasonal nature of our product mix. 
For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth, including the impact from products rationalization of 4% to 5% and adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 32% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 12% to 15%. The significant increase in our guidance for reported diluted EPS is due to our increased outlook for the business and a favorable tax items realized in Q3. 
Moving to 2017. Since our last update in August, changes in FX rates have lowered our views for revenue by $50 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03. However, the overall evolution in our business over the past year has been positive unbalance as our companion animal dermatology portfolio continues to grow and several livestock markets in our international business are strengthening. These changes are allowing us to increase the low end of our revenue range and maintaining the high end while absorbing the negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Cost of goods remains the same at 32% to 33% as we have been successful in our cost reduction efforts, as well as our SKU rationalization that has brought an improved mix. On SG&A, FX changes works slightly in our favor. However, we are increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end as we allocate a portion of our cost savings to promising investment opportunities, such as advertising and promotion investments in key companion animal franchises like APOQUEL and Simparica that will drive revenue starting in 2017 and over the next several years. Field force expansions in Brazil and China where we see sustainable growth drivers and opportunities for increased market share and enhancements to our diagnostic commercial capabilities following the acquisition of SMB. 
We are also taking on the necessary R&D investments to develop SMB's pipeline, as well as investing additional R&D dollars through some of our key international growth markets. When you take all of these changes together, we are increasing the lower end of our adjusted EPS range, maintaining the high end of $2.38 despite the negative impact of foreign currency, while also improving our view for adjusted EBIT margin to be between 34% and 35%. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we do want to point out that we are currently expecting the delivery of full year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year for a few reasons. First, we will have some lingering effects from the operational efficiency initiative in the first 2 quarters as we continue to sell out remaining inventory in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. Second, a portion of our revenue growth is dependent upon the ramping up of new product launches, which we expect to build throughout the year. Finally, many of the incremental investments we are making on the SG&A line are weighted towards the first half of the year and begin to deliver results in the revenue line as the year goes on. 
A final point on capital allocation. We are continuing to repurchase shares at a steady rate of $75 million per quarter. At this rate, we will exhaust our current plan at the end of this year. Share repurchases will continue to be an important element of our capital allocation framework, and we will provide a more specific update later this year. 
So wrapping up. We've improved our outlook for revenue. We've achieved our retargeted cost structure. We're prudently taking on investments in long-term growth. We've improved our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin, and we've improved our review for EPS. It has been a tremendous effort to get where we are. We're proud of what we've achieved to-date, and we're excited to continue moving the business to new heights.

It's Juan Ramón. Well, on the question on the livestock and how we plan to grow this business in price or other volume growth, definitely, we will continue applying the same strategy in terms of pricing that can be justified through outcome and providing the value to our customers. We continue having these prices very constantly over the years, and we also plan to continue increasing these prices in the future. In the U.S., I think, as we reported, we -- livestock in this quarter grew by 1% in terms of normalized growth, so -- excluding the impact of SKU or currency or M&A. If we go to the sales of the drivers of this growth, cattle grow by low single-digit, swine declined and poultry have double-digit growth. So talking about the cattle and also the situation on the feedlots and all different drivers that are affecting this segment. So let me describe the factors that are impacting the cattle business in the U.S. So one, it's more animals, which is a positive. We have seen also in this quarter higher placement of animals in feedlots, another positive element. But there are other elements, which are negative, and we have seen that in the quarter. So first, the producers are losing money. Animals are entering heavier into the feedlots. And also we have experiencing mill weather conditions in the U.S. that are driving the lower disease incident. So net-net, compared to 1 year ago, we think that the situation is less positive. But still, with this situation, we have been able to grow the business and the reason why we are growing is because of our portfolio. The ability also to increase prices and also the team, which is interacting with customers. The last comment I want to make here is that this -- it's a business, livestock, which is affected by cycles. Cycles that has been affecting in the past and will be continued affecting in the future. Despite of these cycles there, [indiscernible] results has been very resilient and showing very steady growth. In the past 5 to 6, and we expect also in the future despite of our cycles, we will continue growing at the same rate. And definitely, we see Zoetis also growing in 2017 in livestock in line with the market."

And we said the DTC campaign, that really we expect to broader the access of -- or expanding the access of the product to more patients and also bring pet owners to the clinics and the veterinarian then can prescribe the product. In a sense of other DTC investments, we mentioned also that we are considering also DTC for Simparica. It's something that we will continue in the U.S. when we have the right level of penetration in the market. In terms of cattle. So cattle in the U.S., we expect that at the end of the year will be growing. And we insisted many times that it's important not to look at our business on a quarterly basis but on a full year basis. And in a full year basis, we still expect the cattle business showing a positive growth. And we know that some cycles that can be negative at certain points will turn into positive in the following phases -- or the following quarters or a months.

And then really fast, sorry, just a followup on APOQUEL, you mentioned you plan to exceed the $300 million. Can you expander detail on time line for that, is that a 2017 event?"

That is a 2017 event, exceeding the $300 million is baked into through our projections for 2017. In terms of operating margins, so we're not targeting specific operating margin going forward. We're really focused on income generation and cash generation and that is our focus. However, when you look at what we articulated as the long-term strategy, the ability to grow revenue at a faster pace than our costs, that's definitely does need to increase margins as we move forward and in terms of the benefit that we expect to get from the supply network strategy moving forward. So we have articulated and we're still committed to by 2020, we do expect to achieve an extra 200 basis points improvement in our margin from that strategy. So when you take all those factors together, that definitely leads to improved margin. But again, our focus is on cash generation."

Let me start with the comment on the price -- the protein pricing and how this is going to be affecting our business. So we have seen that these prices are growing up and down is part of cycles that has been affecting our industry for the case. And we have been managing that very well in these situations. We saw prices going down for poultry and then the next cycle going up. It's always depend on the supply, the demand continue growing, and this is something that will help the industry to continue generating more revenues. We don't think that the current situation is specifically negative. It's something that we expect that, that will be a reverse in the near future, and we will see that this is not having a negative impact in our projections. And again, so this -- and this has been very predictable and showing -- it's a big growth even in situations with well significant negative factors, including the drought or even including the economic crisis in 2008. The animal health industry was probably one of the few industries that showing growth in this negative environment. Dairy, we have seen that the prices of dairy has been down significantly at the beginning of the year. Now these prices are recovering, and very important is that we have not seen any reduction of assets in terms of cows, which is an indication that producer value is still keeping the animals to ensure that we'll be able to supply market demands in the next cycle. So we expect also dairy having a positive trend in 2017. And then Glenn will talk about the SKU rationalization."

You also asked about the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. mainly. And -- well, so far, until very recently, the use of APOQUEL has been mostly focused on chronic. We have seen already in this quarter that it's already APOQUEL in the U.S., which is where we have more recent market research. The use has been also extended to seasonal and chronic and acute. And we expect also this to continue, not only in the U.S. but also in international markets, and we are very confident that the expansion of the products will be driven by the use in all the different categories, chronic, acute and seasonal. You also asked about what is the situation of APOQUEL U.S., International? Well, this quarter, on the $70 million, $40 million came from the U.S. and $30 million International. This is something that is probably not representative of the full potential of International and the U.S. What we can also saw in the markets through market research is that the new patients is growing constantly in the U.S., which is very positive, and we expect that this will continue. And if the results of the pilot, it's showing positive for the DTC that we are testing in the U.S., then we expect that this will be also accelerating the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. As you know, not in all markets where DTC is available because there are some restrictions in terms of regulatory for direct-to-consumer that's actually in many markets in the world."

There has been a lot written lately about the animal health industry, livestock in particular, and the cycles we face as part of the global food supply chain. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with th",1399,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. There has been a lot written lately about the animal health industry, livestock in particular, and the cycles we face as part of the global food supply chain. 
Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with the positive result we have reported in the third quarter, because it reaffirms that we understand the cycles of our customers and businesses. And, as in the past, we continue to be resilient in our ability to adapt and steadily grow our business, despite the broader agriculture market changes. 
At Zoetis, we have regularly grown faster than the market, and we are very well positioned to achieve predictable growth within these cycles because of our diverse portfolio and global scope. 
We remain focused on the long term. Full-year review of our business, since they are quarterly results, can be misleading about the cycles in our customers markets. Our strength in all relevant geographies, species and therapeutic areas help us offset many of the economic and business challenges that can affect part of the animal health industry in the near term. 
We are also making improvements in our cost structure. And reallocating resources to the most important growth opportunities in animal health from therapeutic area and geographical perspective. I'm pleased to say, we have nearly completed our operational efficiency initiative, and we can confirm that we expect to exceed the target of $300 million in cost savings by the end of 2017. 
We also now expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34% to 35% in 2017, higher than our original projection.  And we expect to grow our revenues faster than the market again in 2017. 
This quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew our revenue 4% operationally with a particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. When you exclude the impact of our operational efficiency initiative, foreign exchange and acquisitions, all, what we call, normalized organic operational growth, our growth in the third quarter was 6%. 
On the same normalized basis, our companion animal products grew 11%, and our livestock products grew 2%. The companion animal growth was driven by food supply of APOQUEL and interaction of other new products. 
And in livestock, the main driver of growth was strength in our international markets, which were able to offset the impact of product rationalization changes across the livestock portfolio. 
Moving forward, we expect companion animal to be the main contributor to growth in the fourth quarter and in 2017. And in terms of livestock, we expect improved growth as we get beyond the product rationalization impacts this year. 
Moving onto earnings, we grew adjusted earnings 6% operationally, reflecting the negative impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate. Glenn will discuss this in more detail. But excluding net tax and interest, our EBITDA growth was 17%. 
As we finish up 2016, we are increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to reflect the strong performance we have achieved through the first 9 months of the year. And based on the market trends we see and the confidence in our business, we are also improving our guidance for 2017 despite the recent negative evolution of currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. 
Let me provide additional business updates on some key products and discuss the investments we are making to support that growth. For the first 9 months of 2016, we have generated approximately $180 million in revenue for APOQUEL, with about $70 million coming in the third quarter. 
We have here an excellent response from veterinarians and pet owners using APOQUEL as we increase our penetration in new markets. Our research indicates that we are achieving a great awareness and satisfaction among veterinarians as well as more frequent proactive request from pet owners. 
APOQUEL has now been launched with unrestricted supply in all approved markets, and we are working on further expanding its market share. In the U.S., we have seen a growth of new patients since achieving full supply in May. APOQUEL has been doing very well in treating dogs with chronic allergies, and we are increasingly seeing its use for more seasonal and acute allergy causes, an important part of our expansion plans. 
As we look ahead with APOQUEL, we are trying additional ways to support this product growth. For example, in the U.S., we are developing and testing direct-to-consumer, or DTC, advertising, and we expect to launch a national advertising campaign for APOQUEL in 2017. 
Also, to support the growth of our companion animal business, we have also been expanding our product portfolios and field force in China and Brazil. These are great examples on how our efficiency initiative is ultimately about better allocating resources, which generate sales growth. 
Meanwhile, Simparica, our new oral parasiticide for dogs, is available in the U.S. and most of the EU countries, and it is being further deployed in markets like Canada and Brazil. 
In 2017, Simparica will be available for the full flea and tick season in the U.S. and EU. We are planning to support Simparica with additional promotional investment to ensure it has a positive impact in our revenue growth in 2017. We are also getting ready for a broader launch of our canine antibody therapy targeting IL-31. This therapy is currently only available in the U.S. under a conditional license. 
And in October, we expanded our effort beyond dermatology specialist and made it available to all veterinarians in the U.S. We will broaden this duration in the weeks ahead, and we expect to receive a full USDA license by the end of the year with Europe to follow next year. 
We are also seeing good progress with the PHARMAQ acquisition that we made 1 year ago. We have posted $64 million in fish revenue through the first 9 months of the year, despite the toxic algae bloom that has been impacting the fish pharmacy in Chile. PHARMAQ has achieved rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon in Chile. 
Fish farmers, who needed a more predictable and reliable means of protection, have responded very favorably to recent information that LiVac SRS has already demonstrated protection up to 11 months after vaccination, and we continue testing for longer duration of efficacy. Fish farmers also view this vaccine as an important way to reduce the use of antibiotics in their operations. 
Now let me turn to the R&D innovations that continue supporting our future growth and value creation. New product introductions like APOQUEL, the IL-31 antibody therapy, Simparica and the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine are very important. The continuous innovation over the life cycle of our products is also critical to our long-term success. 
In the third quarter, we had several approvals of new indications and formulations for key livestock products. In swine, we obtained approvals in the U.S. for new combinations of our FluSure XP vaccine. This now helps guard against additional flu strains that threaten swine herd health. We also expanded our Fostera swine vaccine with additional indications and approvals in markets like Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Our premium injectable anti-infective DRAXXIN received additional indications and approvals in Japan and Canada. 
We also obtained approval in Japan for BOPRIVA, a unique vaccine that temporarily reduce testosterone in bulls, providing farmers with a highly effective way to manage aggressive behavior. 
We are also making investments and showing progress in our diagnostic portfolio. In August, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices, or SMB. They are pioneers in developing the manufacturing microfluidic “lab on a chip” diagnostic products, which are used for veterinary point-of-care services. SMB's promising pipeline has helped our existing diagnostic business, which obtained approval for wide use in test kits in the third quarter in new markets such as Mexico, Japan and Korea. Lots of good news to share about our new products, life cycle innovation and business development activities. 
In summary, we have continued to demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio across geographies and species. And this time, we see particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. We are realizing the benefits of disciplined approach to R&D and business development, which is strengthening our business for the long term. And we expect to achieve our operational efficiency initiative target in 2017 and set ourselves on a path to increase profitability, cash generation and value creation while maintaining our revenue goals. 
With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?"

We remain focused on achieving our updated financial guidance for 2016 and 2017. Building our capacity for long-term revenue and earnings growth and delivering innovation and financial performance that people have come to expect from Zoetis. 
I am pleased to say that in my first quarter as CFO, that we are making excellent progress on all those fronts, and we are raising our earnings guidance for 2016 and improving our earnings guidance for 2017, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, which was approximately $0.03. The consistent performance we've delivered over time, through recent periods of major efficiency initiatives and change, is a testament to the quality and commitment of our Zoetis colleagues. 
So what are the key takeaways for the third quarter results? Continued strong operational revenue growth from our diverse portfolio, continued improvement in our adjusted EBIT growth and margin, a meaningful contribution from several new product launches, life cycle innovations and targeted business development activities and finally, an update to guidance for 2016 and 2017 that reflects our recent performance and confidence in the future. 
Now, let me walk you through the major pieces of our third quarter income statement and provide some color. We generally talk to operational growth, which excludes the impacts of foreign currency. You can also see once again in the tables on our website that we are providing additional detail and impacts related to our operational efficiency initiatives, M&A, and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. We refer to the revenue growth, excluding these items as normalized organic operational growth. 
For the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 4%, which excludes a 2% negative impact of foreign exchange. Now, let me take you through the key elements of our performance and bridge that to our normalized growth. First, APOQUEL, and a number of other new products, contributed 5% of our revenue growth. The in-line [ph] portfolio grew 1%, with price contributing 2% and volume declining 1%. Recent M&A contributed 3% to our growth, while our operational efficiency initiative reduced our growth by 5%, due to product rationalizations and changes to our business in markets like Venezuela and India. 
Accounting for all of these factors, we delivered normalized organic operational growth of 6% in the quarter. And for the first 9 months of the year, our revenue growth on this basis was 7%, in line with our view of 7% to 8% growth for the full year. 
Turning now to our segment performance. In terms of the U.S., we generated 1% operational growth compared to a very strong third quarter in the previous year. Just a reminder, the U.S. grew 19% in Q3 2015, with livestock growing 13% and companion animal growing 27%. 
In the third quarter of 2016, U.S. companion animal products grew 5%, driven by APOQUEL, Simparica and other new product launches, like our new vaccines. This growth was partially offset by a decline in surgical fluid products. In U.S. livestock, we declined by 2% against a very strong year ago quarter when we grew 13%. The decline was primarily due to the impact of SKU eliminations, lower sales of our swine products, where we continue to see increased competition as well as the impact of a challenging market environment, especially for our cattle and swine customers. We partially offset this decline with growth in our cattle business, where successful promotional activity drove increased volumes. 
Shifting back to a normalized organic operational growth basis, U.S. grew 3%, with companion animal growing 6% and livestock growing 1%. 
Turning to International. Revenue grew 6% operationally. We delivered very strong operational growth of 15% in companion animal and 2% in livestock. Our international business saw a significant impact from our operational efficiency initiatives, which reduced growth by 8%. By species group, the impact was 9% in livestock and 6% in companion animal. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 5% to our international revenue growth. Based on these factors, our normalized organic operational growth for International was 9%, with companion animal growth of 21% and livestock growth of 4%. 
You can see the full results for our top 11 markets in the tables, but let me highlight a few items. Growth in markets like Japan, Brazil, Germany and Australia was primarily from companion animal products and launches of APOQUEL. In Japan, we saw a significant benefit from the initial stocking of APOQUEL with wholesalers in the quarter. France and Canada both saw a mix of companion animal and livestock sales driving their growth, including sales of APOQUEL and a more stable environment in France around antibiotic usage and prior regulatory changes. 
Meanwhile, we continue to see livestock supported with growth in cattle in Brazil and swine in China, where we currently have favorable market conditions as well as growth in companion animal in China, where we are seeing positive trends in medicalization rates for pets. 
Overall, we have been very pleased with the strong growth we have seen in emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, where we have invested in expanding our field force and product portfolios to effectively capitalize on the fast-growing trends in these countries. We'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. 
Wrapping up the revenue picture. There are 5 key takeaways for the third quarter. Our diversified model continues to deliver steady, predictable and meaningful revenue growth with strong product lines and geographies balancing the effects of certain market challenges and cycles. 
Product rationalization continues to impact revenue growth; however, we continue to deliver strong growth on a normalized basis. APOQUEL once again was a significant growth driver with launches in new markets and continued expansion of the customer base in existing markets. 
Other companion animal products like Simparica and recent additions to our vaccine portfolio are contributing to growth. And finally, when it comes to revenue, we are improving the base business in various emerging markets by expanding our product portfolio and adding to our direct sales capability. 
Turning to the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin improved 120 basis points, primarily due to a more profitable mix of products, while foreign exchange had a negative impact of 70 basis points this quarter. Adjusted operating expense also declined, reflecting the continued realization of our operational efficiency changes and continued discipline around SG&A, which includes the addition of PHARMAQ expenses this year. Improved gross margin and a reduction in operating expenses enabled us to grow our adjusted EBIT by 17% operationally versus the 4% operational revenue growth. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.6% versus 25.1% in the year-ago quarter. This difference was primarily driven by the impact of the European Commission tax ruling earlier this year and the benefit of certain discrete items in the year-ago quarter. 
As a result, adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, reflecting the change to our adjusted tax rate and higher interest expense, which offset much of our adjusted EBIT growth. For the quarter, GAAP net income grew 26% on a reported basis, aided by a reduction in stand-up costs and restructuring charges as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets related to the establishment of our new international operating model. 
Moving to guidance for full-year 2016. We are now into the high end of our revenue range and increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to reflect our ongoing confidence in the momentum of our new products and the sustainable cost benefits of our operational efficiency initiative. As you model out the remainder of 2016, remember that we have 5 fewer days in Q4 2016 than Q4 2015, and this is usually our highest quarter in terms of operating expenses as a percent of revenue and our lowest quarter for gross margin, due to the seasonal nature of our product mix. 
For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth, including the impact from product rationalization of 4% to 5% and adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 32% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 12% to 15%. The significant increase in our guidance for reported diluted EPS is due to our increased outlook for the business and the favorable tax items realized in Q3. 
Moving to 2017. Since our last update in August, changes in FX rates have lowered our views for revenue by $50 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03. However, the overall evolution in our business over the past year has been positive on balance as our companion animal dermatology portfolio continues to grow and several livestock markets in our international business are strengthening. These changes are allowing us to increase the low end of our revenue range and maintaining the high end while absorbing the negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Cost of goods remains the same at 32% to 33% as we have been successful in our cost reduction efforts, as well as our SKU rationalization that has brought an improved mix. On SG&A, FX changes work slightly in our favor; however, we are increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end as we allocate a portion of our cost savings to promising investment opportunities, such as advertising and promotion investments in key companion animal franchises like APOQUEL and Simparica that will drive revenue starting in 2017 and over the next several years. Field force expansions in Brazil and China, where we see sustainable growth drivers and opportunities for increased market share and enhancements to our diagnostic commercial capabilities following the acquisition of SMB. 
We are also taking on the necessary R&D investments to develop SMB's pipeline, as well as investing additional R&D dollars toward some of our key international growth markets. When you take all of these changes together, we are increasing the lower end of our adjusted EPS range, maintaining the high end of $2.38, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, while also improving our view for adjusted EBIT margin to be between 34% and 35%. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we do want to point out that we are currently expecting the delivery of full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year for a few reasons. First, we will have some lingering effects from the operational efficiency initiative in the first 2 quarters as we continue to sell out remaining inventory in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. Second, a portion of our revenue growth is dependent upon the ramping up of new product launches, which we expect to build throughout the year. Finally, many of the incremental investments we are making on the SG&A line are weighted towards the first half of the year and begin to deliver results on the revenue line as the year goes on. 
A final point on capital allocation. We are continuing to repurchase shares at a steady rate of $75 million per quarter. At this rate, we will exhaust our current plan at the end of this year. Share repurchases will continue to be an important element of our capital allocation framework, and we will provide a more specific update later this year. 
So wrapping up. We've improved our outlook for revenue. We've achieved our targeted cost structure. We're prudently taking on investments in long-term growth. We've improved our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin, and we've improved our review for EPS. It has been a tremendous effort to get where we are. We're proud of what we've achieved to date, and we're excited to continue moving the business to new heights. 
With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

It's Juan Ramón. Well, on the question on the livestock and how we plan to grow this business in price or other volume growth, definitely continue applying the same strategy in terms of pricing that can be justified through outcome and providing the value to our customers. We continue having these prices very constantly over the years, and we also plan to continue increasing these prices in the future. In the U.S., I think, as we reported, we -- livestock in this quarter grew by 1% in terms of normalized growth, so -- excluding the impact of SKU or currency or M&A. If we go to the sales of the drivers of this growth, cattle grow by low single digit, swine declined and poultry have double-digit growth. So talking about the cattle and also the situation on the feedlots and all different drivers that are affecting this segment. So let me describe the factors that are impacting the cattle business in the U.S. So one, it's more animals, which is a positive. We have seen also in this quarter, higher placement of animals in feedlots, another positive element. But there are other elements which are negative, and we have seen that in the quarter. So first, the producers are losing money. Animals are entering heavier into the feedlots. And also we have experiencing mild weather conditions in the U.S. that are driving the lower disease incident. So net-net, compared to 1 year ago, we think that the situation is less positive. But still, with this situation, we have been able to grow the business and the reason why we are growing is because of our portfolio. The ability also to increase prices and also the team, which is interacting with customers. 
The last comment I want to make here is that this -- it's a business, livestock, which is affected by cycles. Cycles that has been affecting in the past and will be continue affecting in the future. Despite of these cycles, the animal [indiscernible] has been very resilient and showing very steady growth. In the past 5 to 6, and we expect also in the future despite of our cycles, we will continue growing at the same rate. And definitely, we see Zoetis also growing in 2017 in livestock in line with the market."

It's something that we will continue in the U.S. when we have the right level of penetration in the market. In terms of cattle. So cattle in the U.S., we expect that, at the end of the year, will be growing. And we insisted many times that it's important not to look at our business on a quarterly basis but on a full-year basis. And in a full-year basis, we still expect the cattle business showing a positive growth.

Let me start with the comment on the price -- the protein pricing and how this can be affecting our business. So we have seen that these prices are growing up and down is part of cycles that has been affecting our industry for decades. And we have been managing that very well, these situations. We saw prices going down for poultry and then the next cycle going up. It's always depend on the supply.  The demand continue growing, and this is something that will help the industry to continue generating more revenues. We don't think that the current situation is specifically negative. It's something that we expect that will be a reverse in the near future, and we will see that this is not having a negative impact in our projections. And again, so this industry has been very predictable and showing a steady growth, even in situations with, well, significant negative factors, including the drought or even including the economic crisis in 2008. The animal health industry was probably one of the few industries that showing growth in this negative environment. Dairy, we have seen that the prices of dairy has been down significantly at the beginning of the year. Now these prices are recovering, and very important is that we have not seen any reduction of the herd in terms of cows, which is an indication that producer [indiscernible] is still keeping the animals to ensure that they will be able to supply market demands in the next cycle.

And not too big difference in terms of U.S. or international, the only different in some international markets with high inflation rates, the price increases can be higher and in line with this inflation. You also asked about the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. mainly. And, well, so far, until very recently, the use of APOQUEL has been mostly focused on chronic. We have seen already in this quarter that it's already APOQUEL in the U.S., which is where we have more recent market research. The use has been also extended to seasonal and chronic and acute. And we expect also this to continue, not only in the U.S. but also in international markets.  And we are very confident that the expansion of the products will be driven by the use in all the different categories, chronic, acute and seasonal. You also asked about what is the situation of APOQUEL U.S., International? Well, this quarter, on the $70 million, $40 million came from the U.S. and $30 million International. This is something that is probably not representative of the full potential of International and the U.S. What we can also saw in the market through market research is that the new patients is growing constantly in the U.S., which is very positive, and we expect that this will continue. And if the results of the pilot, it's showing positive for the DTC that we are testing in the U.S., then we expect that this will be also accelerating the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. As you know, not in all markets where DTC is available, because there are some restrictions in terms of regulatory for direct-to-consumer that I've seen in many markets in the world."

There has been a lot written lately about the animal health industry, livestock in particular, and the cycles we face as part of the global food supply chain. 
Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with the positive result we have reported in the third quarter, because it reaffirms that we understand the cycles of our customers and businesses. And, as in the past, we continue to be resilient in our ability to adapt and steadily grow our business, despite the broader agriculture market changes. 
At Zoetis, we have regularly grown faster than the market, and we are very well positioned to achieve predictable growth within these cycles because of our diverse portfolio and global scope. 
We remain focused on the long term. Full-year review of our business, since they are quarterly results, can be misleading about the cycles in our customers markets. Our strength in all relevant geographies, species and therapeutic areas help us offset many of the economic and business challenges that can affect part of the animal health industry in the near term. 
We are also making improvements in our cost structure. And reallocating resources to the most important growth opportunities in animal health from therapeutic area and geographical perspective. I'm pleased to say, we have nearly completed our operational efficiency initiative, and we can confirm that we expect to exceed the target of $300 million in cost savings by the end of 2017. 
We also now expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34% to 35% in 2017, higher than our original projection.  And we expect to grow our revenues faster than the market again in 2017. 
This quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew our revenue 4% operationally with a particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. When you exclude the impact of our operational efficiency initiative, foreign exchange and acquisitions, all, what we call, normalized organic operational growth, our growth in the third quarter was 6%. 
On the same normalized basis, our companion animal products grew 11%, and our livestock products grew 2%. The companion animal growth was driven by food supply of APOQUEL and interaction of other new products. 
And in livestock, the main driver of growth was strength in our international markets, which were able to offset the impact of product rationalization changes across the livestock portfolio. 
Moving forward, we expect companion animal to be the main contributor to growth in the fourth quarter and in 2017. And in terms of livestock, we expect improved growth as we get beyond the product rationalization impacts this year. 
Moving onto earnings, we grew adjusted earnings 6% operationally, reflecting the negative impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate. Glenn will discuss this in more detail. But excluding net tax and interest, our EBITDA growth was 17%. 
As we finish up 2016, we are increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to reflect the strong performance we have achieved through the first 9 months of the year. And based on the market trends we see and the confidence in our business, we are also improving our guidance for 2017 despite the recent negative evolution of currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. 
Let me provide additional business updates on some key products and discuss the investments we are making to support that growth. For the first 9 months of 2016, we have generated approximately $180 million in revenue for APOQUEL, with about $70 million coming in the third quarter. 
We have here an excellent response from veterinarians and pet owners using APOQUEL as we increase our penetration in new markets. Our research indicates that we are achieving a great awareness and satisfaction among veterinarians as well as more frequent proactive request from pet owners. 
APOQUEL has now been launched with unrestricted supply in all approved markets, and we are working on further expanding its market share. In the U.S., we have seen a growth of new patients since achieving full supply in May. APOQUEL has been doing very well in treating dogs with chronic allergies, and we are increasingly seeing its use for more seasonal and acute allergy causes, an important part of our expansion plans. 
As we look ahead with APOQUEL, we are trying additional ways to support this product growth. For example, in the U.S., we are developing and testing direct-to-consumer, or DTC, advertising, and we expect to launch a national advertising campaign for APOQUEL in 2017. 
Also, to support the growth of our companion animal business, we have also been expanding our product portfolios and field force in China and Brazil. These are great examples on how our efficiency initiative is ultimately about better allocating resources, which generate sales growth. 
Meanwhile, Simparica, our new oral parasiticide for dogs, is available in the U.S. and most of the EU countries, and it is being further deployed in markets like Canada and Brazil. 
In 2017, Simparica will be available for the full flea and tick season in the U.S. and EU. We are planning to support Simparica with additional promotional investment to ensure it has a positive impact in our revenue growth in 2017. We are also getting ready for a broader launch of our canine antibody therapy targeting IL-31. This therapy is currently only available in the U.S. under a conditional license. 
And in October, we expanded our effort beyond dermatology specialist and made it available to all veterinarians in the U.S. We will broaden this duration in the weeks ahead, and we expect to receive a full USDA license by the end of the year with Europe to follow next year. 
We are also seeing good progress with the PHARMAQ acquisition that we made 1 year ago. We have posted $64 million in fish revenue through the first 9 months of the year, despite the toxic algae bloom that has been impacting the fish pharmacy in Chile. PHARMAQ has achieved rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon in Chile. 
Fish farmers, who needed a more predictable and reliable means of protection, have responded very favorably to recent information that LiVac SRS has already demonstrated protection up to 11 months after vaccination, and we continue testing for longer duration of efficacy. Fish farmers also view this vaccine as an important way to reduce the use of antibiotics in their operations. 
Now let me turn to the R&D innovations that continue supporting our future growth and value creation. New product introductions like APOQUEL, the IL-31 antibody therapy, Simparica and the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine are very important. The continuous innovation over the life cycle of our products is also critical to our long-term success. 
In the third quarter, we had several approvals of new indications and formulations for key livestock products. In swine, we obtained approvals in the U.S. for new combinations of our FluSure XP vaccine. This now helps guard against additional flu strains that threaten swine herd health. We also expanded our Fostera swine vaccine with additional indications and approvals in markets like Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Our premium injectable anti-infective DRAXXIN received additional indications and approvals in Japan and Canada. 
We also obtained approval in Japan for BOPRIVA, a unique vaccine that temporarily reduce testosterone in bulls, providing farmers with a highly effective way to manage aggressive behavior. 
We are also making investments and showing progress in our diagnostic portfolio. In August, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices, or SMB. They are pioneers in developing the manufacturing microfluidic “lab on a chip” diagnostic products, which are used for veterinary point-of-care services. SMB's promising pipeline has helped our existing diagnostic business, which obtained approval for wide use in test kits in the third quarter in new markets such as Mexico, Japan and Korea. Lots of good news to share about our new products, life cycle innovation and business development activities. 
In summary, we have continued to demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio across geographies and species. And this time, we see particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. We are realizing the benefits of disciplined approach to R&D and business development, which is strengthening our business for the long term. And we expect to achieve our operational efficiency initiative target in 2017 and set ourselves on a path to increase profitability, cash generation and value creation while maintaining our revenue goals. 
With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?"

Before I get into the financials, I wanted to thank many of you for reaching out and speaking with me since I became CFO in August. I'm very excited to take on this role and work with the rest of Zoetis leaders to continue driving the performance of our company. 
As CFO, I am committed to maintaining our reputation for financial integrity and transparency and continuing an ongoing dialogue with the investment community. 
We remain focused on achieving our updated financial guidance for 2016 and 2017. Building our capacity for long-term revenue and earnings growth and delivering innovation and financial performance that people have come to expect from Zoetis. 
I am pleased to say that in my first quarter as CFO, that we are making excellent progress on all those fronts, and we are raising our earnings guidance for 2016 and improving our earnings guidance for 2017, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, which was approximately $0.03. The consistent performance we've delivered over time, through recent periods of major efficiency initiatives and change, is a testament to the quality and commitment of our Zoetis colleagues. 
So what are the key takeaways for the third quarter results? Continued strong operational revenue growth from our diverse portfolio, continued improvement in our adjusted EBIT growth and margin, a meaningful contribution from several new product launches, life cycle innovations and targeted business development activities and finally, an update to guidance for 2016 and 2017 that reflects our recent performance and confidence in the future. 
Now, let me walk you through the major pieces of our third quarter income statement and provide some color. We generally talk to operational growth, which excludes the impacts of foreign currency. You can also see once again in the tables on our website that we are providing additional detail and impacts related to our operational efficiency initiatives, M&A, and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. We refer to the revenue growth, excluding these items as normalized organic operational growth. 
For the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 4%, which excludes a 2% negative impact of foreign exchange. Now, let me take you through the key elements of our performance and bridge that to our normalized growth. First, APOQUEL, and a number of other new products, contributed 5% of our revenue growth. The in-line [ph] portfolio grew 1%, with price contributing 2% and volume declining 1%. Recent M&A contributed 3% to our growth, while our operational efficiency initiative reduced our growth by 5%, due to product rationalizations and changes to our business in markets like Venezuela and India. 
Accounting for all of these factors, we delivered normalized organic operational growth of 6% in the quarter. And for the first 9 months of the year, our revenue growth on this basis was 7%, in line with our view of 7% to 8% growth for the full year. 
Turning now to our segment performance. In terms of the U.S., we generated 1% operational growth compared to a very strong third quarter in the previous year. Just a reminder, the U.S. grew 19% in Q3 2015, with livestock growing 13% and companion animal growing 27%. 
In the third quarter of 2016, U.S. companion animal products grew 5%, driven by APOQUEL, Simparica and other new product launches, like our new vaccines. This growth was partially offset by a decline in surgical fluid products. In U.S. livestock, we declined by 2% against a very strong year ago quarter when we grew 13%. The decline was primarily due to the impact of SKU eliminations, lower sales of our swine products, where we continue to see increased competition as well as the impact of a challenging market environment, especially for our cattle and swine customers. We partially offset this decline with growth in our cattle business, where successful promotional activity drove increased volumes. 
Shifting back to a normalized organic operational growth basis, U.S. grew 3%, with companion animal growing 6% and livestock growing 1%. 
Turning to International. Revenue grew 6% operationally. We delivered very strong operational growth of 15% in companion animal and 2% in livestock. Our international business saw a significant impact from our operational efficiency initiatives, which reduced growth by 8%. By species group, the impact was 9% in livestock and 6% in companion animal. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 5% to our international revenue growth. Based on these factors, our normalized organic operational growth for International was 9%, with companion animal growth of 21% and livestock growth of 4%. 
You can see the full results for our top 11 markets in the tables, but let me highlight a few items. Growth in markets like Japan, Brazil, Germany and Australia was primarily from companion animal products and launches of APOQUEL. In Japan, we saw a significant benefit from the initial stocking of APOQUEL with wholesalers in the quarter. France and Canada both saw a mix of companion animal and livestock sales driving their growth, including sales of APOQUEL and a more stable environment in France around antibiotic usage and prior regulatory changes. 
Meanwhile, we continue to see livestock supported with growth in cattle in Brazil and swine in China, where we currently have favorable market conditions as well as growth in companion animal in China, where we are seeing positive trends in medicalization rates for pets. 
Overall, we have been very pleased with the strong growth we have seen in emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, where we have invested in expanding our field force and product portfolios to effectively capitalize on the fast-growing trends in these countries. We'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. 
Wrapping up the revenue picture. There are 5 key takeaways for the third quarter. Our diversified model continues to deliver steady, predictable and meaningful revenue growth with strong product lines and geographies balancing the effects of certain market challenges and cycles. 
Product rationalization continues to impact revenue growth; however, we continue to deliver strong growth on a normalized basis. APOQUEL once again was a significant growth driver with launches in new markets and continued expansion of the customer base in existing markets. 
Other companion animal products like Simparica and recent additions to our vaccine portfolio are contributing to growth. And finally, when it comes to revenue, we are improving the base business in various emerging markets by expanding our product portfolio and adding to our direct sales capability. 
Turning to the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin improved 120 basis points, primarily due to a more profitable mix of products, while foreign exchange had a negative impact of 70 basis points this quarter. Adjusted operating expense also declined, reflecting the continued realization of our operational efficiency changes and continued discipline around SG&A, which includes the addition of PHARMAQ expenses this year. Improved gross margin and a reduction in operating expenses enabled us to grow our adjusted EBIT by 17% operationally versus the 4% operational revenue growth. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.6% versus 25.1% in the year-ago quarter. This difference was primarily driven by the impact of the European Commission tax ruling earlier this year and the benefit of certain discrete items in the year-ago quarter. 
As a result, adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, reflecting the change to our adjusted tax rate and higher interest expense, which offset much of our adjusted EBIT growth. For the quarter, GAAP net income grew 26% on a reported basis, aided by a reduction in stand-up costs and restructuring charges as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets related to the establishment of our new international operating model. 
Moving to guidance for full-year 2016. We are now into the high end of our revenue range and increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to reflect our ongoing confidence in the momentum of our new products and the sustainable cost benefits of our operational efficiency initiative. As you model out the remainder of 2016, remember that we have 5 fewer days in Q4 2016 than Q4 2015, and this is usually our highest quarter in terms of operating expenses as a percent of revenue and our lowest quarter for gross margin, due to the seasonal nature of our product mix. 
For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth, including the impact from product rationalization of 4% to 5% and adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 32% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 12% to 15%. The significant increase in our guidance for reported diluted EPS is due to our increased outlook for the business and the favorable tax items realized in Q3. 
Moving to 2017. Since our last update in August, changes in FX rates have lowered our views for revenue by $50 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03. However, the overall evolution in our business over the past year has been positive on balance as our companion animal dermatology portfolio continues to grow and several livestock markets in our international business are strengthening. These changes are allowing us to increase the low end of our revenue range and maintaining the high end while absorbing the negative impact of foreign exchange. 
Cost of goods remains the same at 32% to 33% as we have been successful in our cost reduction efforts, as well as our SKU rationalization that has brought an improved mix. On SG&A, FX changes work slightly in our favor; however, we are increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end as we allocate a portion of our cost savings to promising investment opportunities, such as advertising and promotion investments in key companion animal franchises like APOQUEL and Simparica that will drive revenue starting in 2017 and over the next several years. Field force expansions in Brazil and China, where we see sustainable growth drivers and opportunities for increased market share and enhancements to our diagnostic commercial capabilities following the acquisition of SMB. 
We are also taking on the necessary R&D investments to develop SMB's pipeline, as well as investing additional R&D dollars toward some of our key international growth markets. When you take all of these changes together, we are increasing the lower end of our adjusted EPS range, maintaining the high end of $2.38, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, while also improving our view for adjusted EBIT margin to be between 34% and 35%. 
While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we do want to point out that we are currently expecting the delivery of full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year for a few reasons. First, we will have some lingering effects from the operational efficiency initiative in the first 2 quarters as we continue to sell out remaining inventory in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. Second, a portion of our revenue growth is dependent upon the ramping up of new product launches, which we expect to build throughout the year. Finally, many of the incremental investments we are making on the SG&A line are weighted towards the first half of the year and begin to deliver results on the revenue line as the year goes on. 
A final point on capital allocation. We are continuing to repurchase shares at a steady rate of $75 million per quarter. At this rate, we will exhaust our current plan at the end of this year. Share repurchases will continue to be an important element of our capital allocation framework, and we will provide a more specific update later this year. 
So wrapping up. We've improved our outlook for revenue. We've achieved our targeted cost structure. We're prudently taking on investments in long-term growth. We've improved our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin, and we've improved our review for EPS. It has been a tremendous effort to get where we are. We're proud of what we've achieved to date, and we're excited to continue moving the business to new heights.

It's Juan Ramón. Well, on the question on the livestock and how we plan to grow this business in price or other volume growth, definitely continue applying the same strategy in terms of pricing that can be justified through outcome and providing the value to our customers. We continue having these prices very constantly over the years, and we also plan to continue increasing these prices in the future. In the U.S., I think, as we reported, we -- livestock in this quarter grew by 1% in terms of normalized growth, so -- excluding the impact of SKU or currency or M&A. If we go to the sales of the drivers of this growth, cattle grow by low single digit, swine declined and poultry have double-digit growth. So talking about the cattle and also the situation on the feedlots and all different drivers that are affecting this segment. So let me describe the factors that are impacting the cattle business in the U.S. So one, it's more animals, which is a positive. We have seen also in this quarter, higher placement of animals in feedlots, another positive element. But there are other elements which are negative, and we have seen that in the quarter. So first, the producers are losing money. Animals are entering heavier into the feedlots. And also we have experiencing mild weather conditions in the U.S. that are driving the lower disease incident. So net-net, compared to 1 year ago, we think that the situation is less positive. But still, with this situation, we have been able to grow the business and the reason why we are growing is because of our portfolio. The ability also to increase prices and also the team, which is interacting with customers. 
The last comment I want to make here is that this -- it's a business, livestock, which is affected by cycles. Cycles that has been affecting in the past and will be continue affecting in the future. Despite of these cycles, the animal [indiscernible] has been very resilient and showing very steady growth. In the past 5 to 6, and we expect also in the future despite of our cycles, we will continue growing at the same rate. And definitely, we see Zoetis also growing in 2017 in livestock in line with the market."

Let me start with the comment on the price -- the protein pricing and how this can be affecting our business. So we have seen that these prices are growing up and down is part of cycles that has been affecting our industry for decades. And we have been managing that very well, these situations. We saw prices going down for poultry and then the next cycle going up. It's always depend on the supply.  The demand continue growing, and this is something that will help the industry to continue generating more revenues. We don't think that the current situation is specifically negative. It's something that we expect that will be a reverse in the near future, and we will see that this is not having a negative impact in our projections. And again, so this industry has been very predictable and showing a steady growth, even in situations with, well, significant negative factors, including the drought or even including the economic crisis in 2008. The animal health industry was probably one of the few industries that showing growth in this negative environment. Dairy, we have seen that the prices of dairy has been down significantly at the beginning of the year. Now these prices are recovering, and very important is that we have not seen any reduction of the herd in terms of cows, which is an indication that producer [indiscernible] is still keeping the animals to ensure that they will be able to supply market demands in the next cycle.

How has that shifted and how do you see that trending going forward? And also on APOQUEL, are you able to tell us how many dogs in the U.S. have been treated with APOQUEL so far? And then secondly, just a broader question on pricing trends. As you look into 2017, can you remind us what your pricing expectations are both U.S. and OUS and whether there's been any change from 2016?"

And the animal health projections, it's growing prices 2% to 3%. And this has been always very consistent in the past and I will continue applying this 2% to 3% in our projections. And we expect that '17 also will be in line with these percentages. And not too big difference in terms of U.S. or international, the only different in some international markets with high inflation rates, the price increases can be higher and in line with this inflation. You also asked about the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. mainly. And, well, so far, until very recently, the use of APOQUEL has been mostly focused on chronic. We have seen already in this quarter that it's already APOQUEL in the U.S., which is where we have more recent market research. The use has been also extended to seasonal and chronic and acute. And we expect also this to continue, not only in the U.S. but also in international markets.  And we are very confident that the expansion of the products will be driven by the use in all the different categories, chronic, acute and seasonal. You also asked about what is the situation of APOQUEL U.S., International? Well, this quarter, on the $70 million, $40 million came from the U.S. and $30 million International. This is something that is probably not representative of the full potential of International and the U.S. What we can also saw in the market through market research is that the new patients is growing constantly in the U.S., which is very positive, and we expect that this will continue. And if the results of the pilot, it's showing positive for the DTC that we are testing in the U.S., then we expect that this will be also accelerating the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. As you know, not in all markets where DTC is available, because there are some restrictions in terms of regulatory for direct-to-consumer that I've seen in many markets in the world."

We have significant new products launched recently. And also very important, our R&D investment in our current portfolio is also showing very positive results. So we don't think that the consolidation of the industry that will be taking place from now until the end of the year will change that significantly, the competitive landscape. We compete not on a global basis, but also on a country basis and also on species basis, and they are not too significant different because of this consolidation. So we are very confident that we will remain very competitive and the products that we are introducing and also the support in terms of promotional activities and R&D and even manufacturing the quality and reliable supply will help us to maintain and expand our market share."
